      "Taylor Swift's new film, \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d has topped the weekend box office with $33 million in North America",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 This weekend\u2019s box office belonged to two undeniable draws: Taylor Swift and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.",
      "It might have looked like a heavyweight matchup, but Swift\u2019s devoted fanbase once again proved unstoppable with her film \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d which debuted at No. 1 with $33 million in North America, according to Sunday estimates from Comscore. The AMC Theatres release -- announced only two weeks ago with minimal promotion -- served as a companion piece to Swift\u2019s 12th studio album, packaging music videos, behind-the-scenes footage and profanity-free lyric visuals into an 89-minute experience.",
      "The film played at all 540 AMC theaters in the U.S. for three days, ending after Sunday. AMC aired the show in Mexico, Canada and across Europe.",
      "\u201cFor Taylor Swift to harness the power of the movie theater to build her brand, create excitement among her fans, and create a communal experience outside of her touring, outside of her live performances, is really a stroke of genius,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cTo be able to add another $33 million to the box office bottom line is much welcomed by theater owners who were looking for content for their big screens.\u201d",
      "It comes nearly two years after her \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d concert film opened to $96 million, with Swift extending her streak of box office dominance.",
      "Meanwhile, Johnson saw a more modest showing. His A24 drama \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d co-starring Emily Blunt, opened in third place with a mere $6 million, trailing Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d which earned $11.1 million and has now accumulated $107 million globally.",
      "Despite strong reviews and a 15-minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival -- where Johnson drew praise for portraying MMA legend Mark Kerr \u2014 the film marked one of the lowest openings as a lead.",
      "\u201cWhen major movie stars branch out into more indie roles, like Tom Cruise in \u201dMagnolia,\" they're trying to redefine their career,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThey can straddle both universes, so Dwayne Johnson and all the acclaim he\u2019s getting. That prestige factor. That\u2019s the currency. He knows box office. He studies this and he's a business person. But also realize that when you go outside of your comfort zone, it puts him in a certain light. ... Dwayne Johnson is redefining what he can do.\u201d",
      "Beyond the two marquee names, the rest of the weekend lineup offered a wide mix ranging from animated adventures to horror sequels and international releases.",
      "DreamWorks Animation\u2019s family adventure \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie\u201d debuted in fourth place with $5.2 million, expanding the popular Netflix preschool series to the big screen. Warner Bros.\u2019 supernatural thriller \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rites\u201d followed in fifth with $4 million, pulling in $458.2 million globally.",
      "In sixth was \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 Infinity Castle,\u201d the latest entry in the hit Japanese anime saga, earning $3.5 million. A re-release of \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d made a splash in seventh with $3.1 million \u2014 a solid return for the 2022 blockbuster ahead of \u201cAvatar: The Fire and Ash\u201d on Dec. 19.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 were \u201cThe Strangers: Chapter 2\u201d with $2.8 million, the IFC dark comedy \u201cGood Boy\u201d with $2.2 million, marking the company's second-best opening weekend ever. \u201cKantara: A Legend \u2013 Chapter 1\u201d with $1.7 million.",
      "Dergarabedian said he's looking forward to October films such as \u201cTron: Ares,\u201d \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d and \u201cRoofman,\" starring Channing Tatum.",

      "On Saturday night, a Lebanese military intelligence force reached one of the entrances of the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh near Sidon and took Shaker, who had been hiding inside the camp for more than 12 years, into custody, two security and two judicial officials said.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A judge remained undecided Friday on the treatment and placement plan for a man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and ramming his car into the front gate of her home.",
      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, a 48-year-old from Mississippi, has pleaded not guilty to felony stalking and vandalism. But in May, Judge Maria Cavalluzzi found him not competent to stand trial after evaluations from two experts. At Friday\u2019s hearing in a Los Angeles court dedicated to mental health cases, she heard arguments on Carwyle's treatment and placement.",
      "Aniston\u2019s lawyer, Blair Berk, spoke on her behalf for the first time, detailing two years of Carwyle\u2019s harassment and stalking, including various failed attempts to make physical contact with the actor.",
      "Cavalluzzi said she leaned toward sending Carwyle to a mental health treatment alternative to imprisonment. She requested another hearing, scheduled for later this month, to hear from a mental health professional before making a final decision.",
      "Prosecutors and Aniston\u2019s attorney will have a chance to weigh in, Cavalluzzi said.",
      "The judge acknowledged Aniston's \u201cvery real\" fear, but she said she can't ignore the opinions of mental health professionals who have evaluated Carwyle and deemed him not a danger to society. The alternative treatment option offers community-based housing, treatment and support services as opposed to incarceration.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Carwyle had been harassing the \u201cFriends\u201d star with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, \u201conly feet away from where she was,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Carwyle had a stated and \u201cpersistent delusion\u201d to impregnate Aniston with three children, Berk said, and \u201cthere is simply no way to prevent him from carrying out his delusion if he walks out.\u201d",
      "The prosecution expressed concern that if Carwyle were offered the treatment in Los Angeles, nothing would stop him \u201cfrom traveling those few miles to Ms. Aniston,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Berk and William Donovan, the deputy district attorney, argued Carwyle was a present danger to Aniston and those around her. Berk said he attempted to enter her property twice, but was turned away.",
      "Carwyle\u2019s lawyer, Robert Krauss, said his client qualifies for alternative treatment, arguing that he hasn\u2019t been convicted of violent crimes. Granting him alternative treatment, \u201cis not like giving him a break or showing him leniency,\u201d Krauss said. \u201cIts just one thing and one thing only \u2014 and that is absolute, pure faithfulness of the law.\u201d",
      "Krauss also referenced a report from the probation department, which recommended Carwyle be granted probation and 90 days in jail if convicted, much less than the over three years maximum sentence for his two charges. Carwyle has been in jail since May and, if convicted, could be let out with time served.",

      "When Cavalluzzi asked how she can be sure he won\u2019t walk away from the treatment program \u2014 a stated concern from the prosecution \u2014 Carwyle responded, \u201cYou have my word.\u201d",

      "Donovan argued that a state hospital is a \u201cmuch safer, much more effective place for him to go,\u201d and will offer the treatment Carwyle needs to address his delusions. The prosecution also argued there\u2019s no evidence that Carwyle\u2019s delusions toward Aniston have stopped, even with medication.",

      "The hearing was postponed several times in recent months as Carwyle at first objected to the incompetence finding and asked for an opinion, and both sides sought more time to examine the case.",
      "Carwyle remains jailed, but he is under a judge's order not to contact or get near Aniston.",
      "Authorities said Aniston was home at the time of the gate crash, but he did not come into contact with her. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. No one was injured.",

      "Tyrese Gibson was booked into a Georgia jail early Friday, a week after he failed to turn himself in following an arrest warrant for cruelty to animals, police said.",
      "Gibson was released the same day on a $20,000 bond, Fulton County Police Captain Nicole Dwyer said. He has still not turned his four Cane Corso dogs to police, who authorities say killed a neighbor\u2019s small dog in mid-September and had roamed the neighborhood unsupervised at various times over the past few months.",
      "\u201cWe are glad he did the right thing and turned himself in,\u201d Dwyer wrote to The Associated Press, noting the four dogs are still unaccounted for.",
      "Gibson's lawyer, Gabe Banks, wrote to the AP Friday that his legal team secured a consent bond, meaning the terms of his bond were set before he voluntarily turned himself in. Banks wrote Gibson \u201chas cooperated fully with legal authorities and will continue to do so until this matter is resolved.\u201d",
      "Banks had previously told AP that the actor wasn't home when the incident took place and \u201cimmediately made the difficult decision to rehome his dogs to a safe and loving environment,\u201d including two adult dogs and their three puppies.",
      "A search warrant for the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d actor's property was issued alongside the arrest warrant days after the Sept. 18 incident, when the dogs attacked a small spaniel owned by a neighbor about a half a mile away from Gibson's house. The dog was rushed to a veterinary hospital, but did not survive, Dwyer said.",

      "Gibson had initially told police he would surrender his dogs on Sept 22, but when officers arrived, he said he needed a few more days, according to a police press release.",
      "Gibson posted a video to Instagram that included various clips of his dogs early Monday and reposted it the following day with a statement from him and his lawyer. Banks wrote Gibson had dealt with stalkers for years, and \u201chis only motivation in bringing these dogs into his life was to protect his family and provide peace of mind.\u201d",

I remain committed to facing this matter with honesty, responsibility, and compassion.\u201d",

The pop superstar\u2019s 12th studio album has no shortage of clever clues and references to her public life and discography. Many are opaque, revealing just enough to inspire a myriad of fan theories. Others are concrete \u2013 explicit names and places worth exploring. Below, you will find a guide to those instances, and how they relate to Swift.",
      "Read on, and happy digging!",

And this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour.\u201d She and beau Kelce were spotted last year in Lake Como, Italy, but it is unclear if they spent time in nearby Portofino. Additionally, the standard version of her album is available in \u201csweat and vanilla perfume Portofino orange vinyl.\u201d As for the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e?

      "Meaning: A 50 Cent reference further implies this song is rooted in Swift\u2019s teen years in the \u201900s, when the rapper was at the height of his popularity. The song also mentions \u201cprom\u201d and \u201csecond period,\u201d what is typically associated with high school.",

      "Taylor Swift's 12th album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" shows she's still at the top of the cultural mainstream",
      "Who is Taylor Swift\u2019s heir apparent? Her 12th album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d offers an answer. It\u2019s Taylor Swift.",
      "Her last album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d ended with the cautionary \u201cClara Bow,\u201d an allegory that seemed to suggest her tenure atop the cultural mainstream was inherited from stars of the past, like the namechecked Stevie Nicks \u2014 and that a new generation of younger, elastic female pop performers could soon take her place. In 2025, there are many to choose from: Consider Chappell Roan\u2019s full-throated theatrics, Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s fiery punk-pop feminism, Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s cheeky sexuality. In the knotty themes of Friday's \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d best illustrated in the title track, Swift asserts that the baton hasn\u2019t been passed, but rather shared. Because she isn\u2019t going anywhere.",
      "\u201cAnd all the headshots on the walls / Of the dance halls are of the b------ / Who wish I\u2019d hurry up and die,\u201d she sings with a wink, \u201cBut I\u2019m immortal now, baby dolls / I couldn\u2019t if I tried.\u201d Notably, if she has a chosen successor in someone else, it\u2019s the album\u2019s sole feature: Carpenter, who sings on the stomp-clap closer in her newly adopted twang. The mournful glissando of lap steel \u2014 the album\u2019s most country moment \u2014 arrives only with Carpenter\u2019s introduction. The western genre is Swift\u2019s past and Carpenter\u2019s future.",
      "If Swift is co-signing Carpenter, she\u2019s also learning from her. Carpenter has cornered the market on tight pop songs with pert, provocative messages; Swift does the same with the manspreading swagger of the George Michael-interpolating \u201cFather Figure,\u201d which mentions a protege, and the funky \u201cWood.\u201d (A carefully veiled PG-13 lyric: \u201cHis love was the key / That opened my thighs,\u201d she sings. \u201cGirls, I don\u2019t need to catch the bouquet / To know a hard rock is on the way.\u201d) Interwoven are suggestive, sensual ad-libs ... and a direct reference to fiance Travis Kelce\u2019s podcast.",
      "Across a brisk 12 tracks \u2014 Swift\u2019s tendency toward abundance doesn\u2019t manifest itself in a double album this time around, but instead in her endless vinyl variants \u2014 \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d mostly delivers on its promise of up-tempo pop \u201cbangers,\u201d to borrow her own vernacular. Fans need not wait up for the long-anticipated \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d because \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d pulls from its essence. But this time, with a lot of affection, like a truer \u201cLover\u201d era.",
      "Swift has long internalized criticisms and responded to them in her art, most directly in 2017\u2019s \u201cReputation.\u201d Here, she is once again concerned with her perception, articulated over booming, lush production on \u201cCANCELLED!\u201d or \u201cElizabeth Taylor.\u201d On the latter, she sings, \u201cHollywood hates me / You\u2019re only as hot as your last hit, baby.\u201d Except this time, her love acts as an anchor. \u201cI can\u2019t have fun if I can\u2019t have you,\u201d she flirts.",
      "For \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d Swift enlisted Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback, the hitmaking duo she collaborated with on 2012\u2019s \u201cRed,\u201d 2014\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d and, of course, \u201cReputation.\u201d Notably absent is her frequent producing partner Jack Antonoff. It\u2019s a wise decision: In years past, Swift, Shellback and Martin\u2019s pop experiments shifted not only her career trajectory but the genre itself. Before \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\u201d an EDM drop in the middle of a radio pop hit was unimaginable. After, the style would dominate for half the decade.",
      "\u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d isn\u2019t as seismic, but there are addictive and idiosyncratic Swiftisms here: acerbic wit and thick literary references in glassy pop hooks. Where a song like \u201cOpalite,\u201d if attempted by another other performer, would lose its weightlessness under its voluble aspirations, Swift manages to swoon. Stacked, opalescent harmonies and a vintage swing give the song, fittingly, an almost iridescent quality.",
      "And there are bops, like the undeniable opener \u201cThe Fate of Ophelia\u201d with its 1980s-via-Robyn synth-pop and momentary \u201cSummertime Sadness\u201d vocal delivery.",
      "There\u2019s a treasure trove of deliciously quotable lines, too, as expected. \u201cPlease God bring me a best friend who I think is hot,\u201d she manages to make effortless in the \u201cMidnights\u201d-esque \u201cWi$h Li$t,\u201d a lovely song about the mundanity of romance and the suburban fantasy of \u201ca couple kids \u2026 a driveway with a basketball hoop.\u201d",
      "Swift\u2019s dense vocabulary is on full display, often full of charm. But it is sometimes unwieldy, a common criticism of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d like when she overstuffs \u201cOur thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition on foolish decisions which led to misguided visions\u201d into \u201cFather Figure,\u201d momentarily overvaluing clever writing over clever cadence.",

      "Benny Safdie\u2019s \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d isn\u2019t what you think it is, especially if you think it\u2019s a movie about a British guy who thinks his typewriter is the tops.",
      "\u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d would seem to bear all the hallmarks of something grittier, darker and more disturbing than it is. It\u2019s the solo directorial debut of the younger Safdie, whose films with his brother, Josh, have rarely not sprinted headlong into unsettling tumult. Add that sensibility to a true-life tale of a mixed martial arts fighter in the late \u201990s, and it\u2019s only natural to spend much of \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bracing for tragedy, for some ear-splitting descent into macho calamity.",
      "Yet \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d starring Dwayne Johnson as MMA pioneer Mark Kerr, is something simpler and less curious. A lack of probing was never anything you could accuse a Safdie brothers\u2019 movie of; these are the filmmakers who plunged a camera into the body cavity of a jewelry-store owner in \u201cUncut Gems.\u201d But, despite its grainy, VHS aesthetics, \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is a surprisingly conventional and oddly untroubled movie, albeit one that gives Johnson an indie-film platform for one of his finest performances.",
      "As Mark, Johnson has drained away much of his big-screen charisma. The part \u2014 brawny, often shirtless, frequently raging in the ring \u2014 is immediately so close to Johnson\u2019s own professional wrestling background that early scenes look almost documentary-like. But gone is the megawatt grin and the dashing eyebrow lift. Johnson\u2019s normally polished bald head is here covered with a closely cropped dark head of hair.",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening, Mark rhapsodizes about his feeling of domination. An opponent\u2019s fear, he says, you can \u201csmell in their scent.\u201d At this point, Mark has known only victory in thumping triumphs that leave him feeling like a god. Losing, he confesses, is unfathomable.",
      "The laws of moviedom decree, of course, that Mark will soon lose, and his well-earned sense of invincibility will shatter. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bounces between Mark\u2019s home and Japan, where the Pride Fighting Championship takes place. That\u2019s where Mark, a much-celebrated champion, is taken down by an illegal but nevertheless humbling move. After the fact, the match is ruled a tie, but the stink of defeat never dissipates.",
      "The real battle, in any case, is at home. Mark\u2019s dependence on opioids for the punishing extremes he endures is becoming desperate. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is based on John Hyams\u2019s 2002 documentary of the same name, and part of the nature of that film was the curiosity of Mark\u2019s extreme violence in the ring and his otherwise sweet passivity. In Safdie\u2019s film, Mark is asked in the doctor\u2019s waiting room if fighters hate each other during a bout. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he replies.",
      "But while we don\u2019t doubt Mark\u2019s sincerity \u2014 he\u2019s as earnest as he is muscle-bound \u2014 Johnson also exudes an inner turmoil, and a struggle to keep his rage at bay while nursing mounting wounds to his ego. His body is so stiff, it\u2019s like he could snap at any moment.",

      "NEW YORK -- In 1983, six thieves muscled their way into a warehouse near Heathrow Airport, expecting to find a large sum of foreign currency. They got much more than they bargained for \u2014 26 million pounds worth of gold bars.",
      "What happened in the days and years next is the subject of PBS\u2019 \u201cMasterpiece\u201d enthralling series \u201cThe Gold,\u201d which traces the ripple effects of Britain's biggest robbery, going from a local search to infiltrating an international money laundering cartel. It starts airing Sunday.",
      "\u201cFrom the minute the show starts, the pressure's on,\u201d says showrunner Neil Forsyth. \u201cThere\u2019s a clock ticking, there\u2019s a net tightening and all these things. So it\u2019s lovely to write characters under that continual pressure.\u201d",
      "The so-called Brinks-Mat heist rocked Britain, leading to changes in banking laws, policing and shining a light on official corruption. Much of the gold was never located. It was melted down and sold back into the financial system, with the proceeds laundered into real estate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s literally in the bricks and mortar and the architecture that surrounds people everywhere,\u201d says Emun Elliott, who plays one of the detectives. \u201cThere might be a piece of that stolen gold in your wedding ring. It is everywhere.\u201d",
      "To tell the sprawling story of \u201cThe Gold,\u201d Forsyth streamlined timelines, combined real-life figures and adjusted events to fit the drama. Viewers are told the series was \u201cinspired by real events.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a strict factual drama,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t find that a very attractive route to go down creatively because I like having the space to create and that\u2019s extremely important if you\u2019re going to create something that\u2019s truly entertaining, truly gripping.\u201d",

      "Boyce \u201cwas known to be a safe pair of hands,\u201d says Bonneville, who met the retired officer to prepare for the role. Boyce knew some officers in the department were corrupt and picked a lean, insular team to track down the gold and money.",
      "\u201cHe absolutely was adamant that not on his watch would police corruption thrive,\u201d Bonneville says. \u201cHe\u2019s a real man of integrity and I think that comes through. You\u2019ve got him against all odds trying to steer a level course and get this job done.\u201d",
      "Forsyth says the series' first episode attracted some 10 million viewers in the U.K. \u2014 or 1 in 5 of the adult population. He says he was in a restaurant with his wife once when the nearby table spent the whole meal discussing it, which was \u201csomewhat unnerving.\u201d",
      "Forsyth was only 5 and living in Scotland at the time of what he calls the \u201ciconic heist.\u201d Despite its impact on British society, no one had pieced it all together in a dramatization or an all-encompassing documentary until now.",

      "Eight years ago, the great Daniel Day-Lewis said he was finished with acting",
      "It is often said of our greatest actors that they could compellingly recite the phone book.",
      "There's no doubt, just to continue that thought for a moment, that Daniel Day-Lewis is one of our greatest living actors \u2014 perhaps truly the best of them all. And so the first and most important thing to say about \u201cAnemone,\u201d a bleak, somber, absorbing but also sometimes frustratingly opaque collaboration with his director son Ronan, is that it's brought Day-Lewis back. He told us eight years ago that he was done with acting, and we hoped he was exaggerating. At least for now, it seems he was.",
      "As for the phone book: Well, there\u2019s a moment here where you might wish that was indeed the content you were hearing. In one of two remarkable monologues that punctuate a movie otherwise spare with words, Day-Lewis, playing a bitter and lonely recluse, lets loose an anecdote so shockingly scatological and epically disgusting \u2014 the script is co-written by father and son, by the way \u2014 that it\u2019s hard to erase from one\u2019s mind (still trying, here). Somehow, he makes it more fascinating than revolting \u2014 but it\u2019s a Herculean task, something Day-Lewis the actor is obviously no stranger to.",
      "The film's title refers to a flower that we briefly see growing in the lush woodlands where we find Day-Lewis\u2019 character, Ray, eking out the sparest of existences. The father-son writers take their time explaining why exactly Ray has consigned himself to this solitary life, but we get a key hint in the first frames of the film \u2014 violent kids\u2019 drawings, with stick figures carrying long guns, and severed limbs.",
      "We soon learn that both Ray and brother Jem (Sean Bean) were British soldiers, veterans of the early days of the Northern Ireland troubles. They're also victims of a violent childhood in care homes.",
      "But they haven't seen each other in two decades, their bond torn asunder by some unrevealed trauma that led them to each seek comfort \u2014 or absolution \u2014 in different places. Jem has found it in strict religious practice, and home life with Nessa, Ray's former partner, and Brian, their son.",
      "It is teenager Brian\u2019s deepening troubles that have spurred Jem to seek out his brother in the lush but forbidding woods, where Ray leads an ascetic life devoted to the most basic human survival. Ronan Day-Lewis, a painter making his feature directorial debut, is at his best in creating, along with cinematographer Ben Fordesman, a sense of the unpredictability of nature, culminating in a dramatic hailstorm.",

But the brothers connect, slowly, in mundane activities like brushing their teeth, swimming in the ocean, or dancing wildly together.",
      "The words do come tumbling when Ray relates his tale of how he wrought revenge upon a priest who repeatedly molested him as a child. This bracing monologue \u2014 in which he describes defecating on the man in sickening detail \u2014 is only a precursor to an extraordinary speech later in the film that is vintage Day-Lewis, a searing account of the life-altering moment he killed a young boy. \u201cI don\u2019t need your absolution,\u201d he snarls to his brother, when the latter tries to veer him away from the guilt and shame that have crippled him for 20 years.",
      "But clearly Ray does need some sort of absolution, and his confession to his brother is that first step.",

But he has also come to think of his declaration of retirement as a mistake, or not quite what he intended. At least, it wasn\u2019t enough to stand in the way of him making a movie with his son.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s been imagined on my behalf by numerous commentators, people that don\u2019t know me, that somehow the way I work has left me so debilitated I can barely open my eyes in the morning. This then requires a period of five or six years recovery!\u201d Day-Lewis says. \u201cThat was never the case. The work itself was always nourishing to me.\u201d",
      "Yet after making \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s London-set portrait of a perfectionist couturier, Day-Lewis was uncertain that he would ever regenerate the appetite to tackle another role.",
      "\u201cI definitely was brought low after I finished shooting \u201cPhantom Thread\u201d more than for any other reason because I anticipated being back in the public arena again,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd this is where I find myself now. And it\u2019s something I never found a solution to from the day I started doing this work until now. The public aspect of my life I\u2019ve always been baffled by.\u201d",
      "The most meaningful gesture Day-Lewis is offering his son might not be making a movie with him, but returning to the spotlight for it. At the New York Film Festival, Day-Lewis has been a happy, humble presence, calling himself a fool for his professed retirement and dutifully accepting a glare of attention that he\u2019s largely avoided for the last decade.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a stark reminder for me of: Oh, yeah, that\u2019s what it\u2019s like,\u201d he said, chuckling.",
      "But Day-Lewis greeted a reporter warmly, urging him to pull a chair \u2014 a Churchill, noted Day-Lewis, a craftsman and furniture maker \u2014 and spoke candidly and thoughtfully about the mystique that has often surrounded his work, an aura he disdains.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s weighed heavily over the years, this sort of misconception which has now become so ludicrous about Method acting, which is a very bad name in the business now,\u201d says Day-Lewis. \u201cWe all find a different way of approaching the same problems. And when we\u2019re on the set, it makes no goddamn difference what system you train under, Meisner or Method or Stanislavski or whatever it might be.

From a young age, Day-Lewis saw how invested his son was in creating imagery. Ronan, meanwhile, grew up marveling from a distance at his father\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cIt always held a huge amount of mystery to me what he was doing,\u201d says Ronan, who has vivid memories of being on set for films like \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d and \u201cThe Ballad of Jack and Rose.\u201d \u201cTo be inside this realm that I had always been watching curiously from the outside was so intriguing. But there were aspects of his process that still remained a mystery to me, which I think helped, actually.\u201d",

(\u201cThere were never enough sardines for me,\u201d he says, smiling.) \u201cAnemone\u201d unfolds in fits and starts, with several glorious, improvised monologues surrounded with strikingly lush imagery by Ronan. Day-Lewis so relishes pushing the boundaries of such a fictional world that, once in it, he tends to not want to let go.",
      "\u201cYou hope to create a world, an illusion. And when somebody says to you, \u2018That was the last shot. Go home now,\u2019 that was so bewildering to me because I\u2019m still invested in that world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not I have trouble letting go of it. The trouble I have is that I want to still splash around in that illusion.\u201d",
      "Still, it seems Day-Lewis has in \u201cAnemone\u201d avoided the kind of post-film feeling that followed \u201cPhantom Thread.\u201d The actor hasn\u2019t yet announced a forthcoming project, but he acknowledges feeling the capacity for more. While he doesn\u2019t say he missed acting during the last eight years, he appears to have come to some self-acceptance of its fundamental, irrevocable place in his life.",
      "\u201cIt has been my primary form of self-expression for my entire life, since I was a child,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd therefore, I don\u2019t know if I experience it as a sense of missing if I\u2019m not doing it. But the need to express myself in that way, even at a subterranean level, that is still there.\u201d",
      "But just as it\u2019s time to go, Day-Lewis offers \u201can appendix\u201d to his answer. If \u201cAnemone\u201d has left him still hungry for more, that fact is owed partly to the nature of its making. Not just that it was done with Ronan, but that they made it, themselves. It\u2019s Day-Lewis\u2019 first screenwriting credit.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s a completely new experience for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI never really dared attempt to write before, so it\u2019s a new thing. You can begin with absolutely nothing and the hunger can grow out of that.\u201d",

      "Filmmaker Raoul Peck examines the prophetic messages of George Orwell in \u201cOrwell: 2+2=5.\u201d",
      "Filmmaker Raoul Peck uses George Orwell\u2019s writings to weave together a biographical portrait of the author and a dispiriting picture of power and truth in the modern world in \u201cOrwell: 2+2=5.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s hardly the first to connect the dots between Orwell\u2019s prophetic writings and the current state of things \u2014 remember, sales for \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d soared in the months following Donald Trump\u2019s first election when phrases like \u201calternative facts\u201d were being used with no irony. Knowing that, Peck draws heavily on what has come before. The film is packed with clips from film adaptations of \u201c1984,\u201d including Michael Anderson\u2019s black and white version from 1956, and Michael Radford\u2019s, released in 1984, documentaries, like Robert Kane Pappas\u2019s 2003 warning \u201cOrwell Rolls in His Grave,\u201d and news footage from World War II through Gaza. In sum, it makes a persuasive point that things are only getting worse.",
      "\u201cOrwell: 2+2=5\u201d is loosely structured around Orwell\u2019s time on the Isle of Jura, in Scotland, where he wrote what would be his last novel, \u201c1984,\u201d while his health was deteriorating from tuberculosis. He went to Jura in 1946 and was dead by 1950. But this is no Wikipedia page or college lecture. There are no talking heads and no one explaining, \u201cWar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\u201d",
      "Instead, it\u2019s a loose assembly of biography, reflection and key moments of political awakening, with actor Damian Lewis narrating Orwell\u2019s words with a poetic gravitas, interspersed with a collage of images, words and archival footage. Anything from David Lean\u2019s \u201cOliver Twist\u201d and Sydney Pollack \u201cOut of Africa\u201d to Lauren Greenfield\u2019s \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d is on the table, and nothing is there carelessly. Alexei Aigui\u2019s powerful score adds a melancholy weight to sequences showing wartime destruction past and present along with the political phrases used to describe them: A \u201cstrategic bombing\u201d in Berlin in 1945, \u201cpeacekeeping operations\u201d in Mariupol in 2022, \u201cclearance operation\u201d in Myanmar in 2017.",
      "There\u2019s a purposefully disorienting effect to the film\u2019s editing, blending past, present, fiction and reality in such a way that it all begins to blur together. By the time we\u2019re hearing Lewis utter Orwell\u2019s famous phrase \u201cthe very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world\u201d while AI images pollute the screen, it\u2019s easy to forget that the quote is seven decades old. It won\u2019t prepare you for any kind of historical report on Orwell, totalitarianism or doublespeak, but its impact is undeniable.",
      "Orwell understood that every writer is a product of their own time. Born Eric Arthur Blair in Motihari, Bihar, then an outpost of the British Empire, Peck focuses in on a photograph of him as a baby with his Indian nursemaid. Describing himself as \u201clower upper middle class,\u201d Orwell attended Eton and served with the British Imperial Police in Burma (now Myanmar) and observed how power manifested in colonial outposts, how class unattainable in England was suddenly accessible to any white man simply because they were white. He considered himself both a snob and a revolutionary, which only intensified as he picked up more life experiences through the Spanish Civil War, his time at the BBC and simply observing ordinary people around him. It\u2019s actually quite extraordinary just how much information Peck, who has delved into the lives of James Baldwin, Karl Marx, Patrice Lumumba and Ernest Cole, is able to convey in just under two hours.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Country music star Morgan Wallen denied to police that he threw a chair off a Nashville honky-tonk bar roof before and after he was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment in 2024, police video obtained by The Associated Press shows.",
      "Roughly two weeks after his April 2024 arrest, Wallen commented on social media: \u201cI'm not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility\u201d and said he \u201cmade amends\u201d with Nashville law enforcement and others. Then in December, he pleaded guilty to two counts.",
      "The Metro Nashville Police Department released the footage of Wallen\u2019s arrest, captured by several officers' body and cruiser cameras, in response to a public records request from the AP. A previously released arrest affidavit did not get into the details of what Wallen told officers.",
      "A police car camera shows two officers, who were standing outside, react to something apparently falling from above on a late Sunday night. And one officer\u2019s body camera video begins with a shot of a broken chair in the road near his parked police cruiser, close to Chief\u2019s on Broadway, in the city's entertainment district.",
      "Then, as Wallen and his bodyguard team come down to the main entrance on Broadway, one of the men with Wallen is shouting, \u201cHe didn\u2019t see anything. You don\u2019t have witnesses, you are accusing!\u201d",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t throw nothing, he didn\u2019t throw nothing,\u201d the bodyguard continues, and accuses two bar workers of \u201cbeing aggressive.\u201d",
      "When an officer asks Wallen what happened, the musician replies, \u201cI don't know.\u201d",
      "He later tells another officer, \u201cWe\u2019ve not tried to cause no problems, man. I don\u2019t know what they are \u2014 I don\u2019t know why.\u201d",
      "That officer said police were figuring out what happened after a chair came flying off the roof and landed by his patrol car. Wallen replied, \u201cAs you should.\u201d",
      "At one point, Wallen is on his cellphone, then points it at the officer and says, \u201cEric Church is on the phone.\u201d Church, another country star, co-owns Chief's. During the call, Wallen had used an expletive to describe the officers he said were \u201ctrying to take me to jail outside of your (expletive) bar.\u201d",
      "Church, who can't be heard on the police recording, recommended to the officer that Wallen wait in a private space instead of standing on the public sidewalk, said a representative for Church.",
      "The officer responds: \u201cIt\u2019s not really something we can do. Law enforcement have to enforce the laws. Figure out what happened. We\u2019ve got a supervisor coming to the scene. Gotta treat it like we would with anybody else.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Wallen did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Back in the bar, police were in an office watching security footage from the roof, body camera footage shows. The security video was not clear from the officers' body cameras and a police spokesperson said there was no security camera footage from the bar in the case files.",
      "The officers return outside and a sergeant, who says he watched security video of Wallen throwing a chair off the roof, handcuffs him.",

      "Bad Bunny captivated audiences with his residency in Puerto Rico, inspiring patriotism and drawing half a million people to the island this summer",
      "NEW YORK -- Crowds wore maga flowers and \u201cpavas\u201d \u2014 straw hats traditionally worn by j\u00edbaros, Puerto Rican rural farmers. They drank Medalla beer and danced salsa.",
      "Over the course of a 31-date residency at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, Bad Bunny worked a miracle, inspiring patriotism in the hearts of a proud Boricua people, and in those traveling to Puerto Rico for the first time. He performed on two stages, one showcasing the island's natural beauty with its flamboyan and plantain trees, and another, a casita (\u201clittle house\u201d), for the pari de marquesina, a house party.",
      "If all the world's a stage \u2014 might as well make it home.",
      "In February, it can be expected that the artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio will bring the same spirit to the 2026 Super Bowl. And he'll do so in Spanish \u2014 a landmark moment for Latino culture.",
      "Bad Bunny's \u201cNo Me Quiero Ir De Aqu\u00ed\u201d residency (in English, \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Leave Here\u201d) bypassed a traditional U.S. tour, bringing approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generating an estimated $733 million for Puerto Rico. Across three hours, attendees were guided through a musical history \u2014 reggaet\u00f3n hits from Bad Bunny's singular discography as well as the folkloric styles of his latest album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos.\u201d (\u201cI Should Have Taken More Photos.\")",
      "There was a political history, too: like in the affecting song \u201cLo Que Pas\u00f3 a Hawaii,\u201d (\u201cWhat Happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for Puerto Rico's autonomy. Or 2022's \u201cEl Apag\u00f3n\u201d (\u201cThe Blackout\u201d), in reference to Hurricane Maria, its aftermath and the continued anger and frustration over persistent, chronic power outages.",
      "Of course, a Super Bowl halftime show traditionally runs 12 to 15 minutes. It's not a lot of time to bring Puerto Rico, or its complicated colonial history, to the NFL's mainstream \u2014 but it is enough for a taste.",
      "It's worth mentioning Benito has done so before: making a surprise appearance at the Super Bowl in 2020, during Shakira and Jennifer Lopez's performance. He sang in Spanish alongside two artists whose bilingual hits helped usher in a crossover era for Latin music in the \u201800s. He\u2019s a direct inheritor of their successes, and he's been able to kick the door down further \u2014 helping to establish an industry where Latino superstars need not record their music in English to have a career.",
      "Bad Bunny is simultaneously an interesting and an obvious choice for the NFL: One of the most popular artists on the planet who understands that going global means embracing the local, performing during the most-watched television program of the year.",
      "In a recent interview with i-D Magazine, Bad Bunny mentioned that one of the reasons his residency bypassed the continental U.S. were concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos.",
      "\u201cThere was the issue of \u2014 like, (expletive) ICE could be outside (my concert). And it\u2019s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,\u201d he told the publication, referencing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico since large-scale arrests began in late January, surprising many in the U.S. territory that has long welcomed migrants.) It resonated with Latinos and the Spanish speaking community, who have grown increasingly weary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation.",
      "Bad Bunny has long been critical of Trump and backed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \u201cI will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader,\u201d he said in a video last year.",
      "For some Trump supporters, Bad Bunny's booking at the 2026 Super Bowl is a divisive political pick. Conservative commentator Benny Johnson described Bad Bunny as an \u201canti-ICE activist\" on Instagram.",

      "At the very least, Bad Bunny, who performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, is set to make history, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.",
      "The question is \u2014 what messages will Bad Bunny deliver in a culture where identity is politicized? And what does it mean that his performance arrives in the midst of one of the largest immigration crackdowns in U.S. history, where Latinos are especially vulnerable?",
      "In February, Kendrick Lamar's 2025 Super Bowl halftime performance made art of his short set, offering a meta commentary on race and America. \u201cThe revolution \u2019bout to be televised,\u201d he announced early in the performance.",
      "It featured actor Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam, whose character critiqued the rapper and his dancers dressed in red, white and blue for being \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d reminding them to \u201cplay the game.\u201d There was the sense that Lamar was breaking the fourth wall, reminding viewers of the NFL's political associations following Colin Kaepernick\u2019s kneeling protests and the Black Lives Matter movement.",
      "That Lamar was able to weave American themes into his history-making performance as the first solo hip-hop artist to ever headline the coveted slot will no doubt benefit Bad Bunny. At the very least, he may learn from the rapper's layered and conceptual narratives, that messages on the NFL stage do not need to be explicit to be effective.",
      "At every date of his residency, Bad Bunny invited celebrities \u2014 among them LeBron James, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2014 to join in his party. He also performed with many musicians, including Puerto Rico heavyweights Jowell y Randy, Arc\u00e1ngel and notably Marc Anthony. The pair duetted \u201cPreciosa,\u201d which is viewed as one of Puerto Rico\u2019s unofficial anthems.",
      "Written by Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn in 1937, \u201cPreciosa\u201d references Puerto Rico\u2019s hybrid identity \u2014 a mix of Spanish, African and the indigenous Taino cultures \u2014 and threats made to the island in its long colonial history. (\u201cNo importa el tirano te trate con negra maldad,\u201d goes the chorus. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that the tyrant treats you with black hatred.\u201d) It also arrived shortly after the 1937 Ponce massacre, in which a peaceful march organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party ended in a police shooting where 19 died and 200 were injured.",
      "It's common for Super Bowl halftime performances to bring surprise guests into their sets \u2014 and no doubt Bad Bunny will do the same \u2014 but who he chooses will wait to be seen. If he pulls from the book of Lamar, any collaboration may have veiled political weight \u2014 informed by his residency, but softened for the NFL crowd.",

      "Lewis Moody, the former England rugby captain and 2003 World Cup winner, has been diagnosed with ALS, also known as motor neurone disease.",
      "The 47-year-old Moody went public with his diagnosis on Monday, saying he has \u201ca bit of muscle wasting in the hand and the shoulder\u201d while describing them as \u201cminor symptoms\u201d at the moment.",
      "\u201cI feel fit and well in myself and I\u2019m focused on staying positive, living life and dealing with the changes I will experience as they come,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "Moody was given the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis two weeks ago. He said he noticed symptoms for the first time while training in the gym. Physiotherapy didn't make his shoulder feel better, he said, and scans later showed nerves in his brain and spinal cord had been damaged by ALS.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something about looking the future in the face and not wanting to really process that at the minute,\u201d he said in an emotional interview with the BBC where he sat alongside his wife, Annie.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand where it\u2019s going. We understand that. But there is absolutely a reluctance to look the future in the face for now.\u201d",
      "Fellow rugby player Doddie Weir and rugby league star Rob Burrow have died from the illness in recent years, with rugby embracing a high-profile fundraising campaign to tackle it.",
      "According to Britain's National Health Service, the disease \u201ccauses muscle weakness that gets worse over a few months or years. It\u2019s usually life-shortening and there\u2019s currently no cure, but treatment can help manage the symptoms.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re given this diagnosis of MND and we\u2019re rightly quite emotional about it, but it\u2019s so strange because I feel like nothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d Moody told the BBC.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel ill. I don\u2019t feel unwell ... I\u2019m still capable of doing anything and everything. And hopefully that will continue for as long as is possible.\u201d",
      "Moody, a flanker nicknamed \u201cMad Dog\u201d because of his fearless and hard-hitting style of play, played 71 times for England, including in all seven matches as England won the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia. In the final against Australia, he won the lineout that led to Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s match-winning drop goal.",

      "Former Leicester teammates Geordan Murphy and Leon Lloyd on Monday launched an online fundraiser to help Moody and his family.",
      "\u201cThere is not a nasty bone in his body,\" Will Greenwood, Moody's World Cup-winning teammate in 2003, told the BBC. \"He is the most optimistic human you can hope to find ... and then he had an ability on the pitch to just turn a switch and be the most ferocious competitor.",

      "Edilson Trindade, the manager who has worked at the bar since 2018, told The Associated Press the establishment usually sells about 80 caipirinhas \u2014 Brazil\u2019s national cocktail made with cacha\u00e7a, lime, sugar and ice \u2014 each night. Last week, he didn\u2019t sell a single one. No other cocktails were ordered, either.",
      "\u201cClients have been worried, and we\u2019re advising them it\u2019s better not to drink cocktails,\u201d Trindade said.",
      "His concern reflects a nationwide unease over distilled beverages following a surge in methanol poisoning cases that has prompted police investigations, stoked public fear and altered drinking habits in recent days.",
      "The Health Ministry said Friday it had confirmed 11 cases tied to alcoholic beverages and was investigating 116 suspected cases. One death was confirmed through lab tests in Sao Paulo, with eleven others under investigation.",
      "Nearly all the cases have been reported in Sao Paulo, the country's most populous state and the epicenter of the outbreak.",
      "Last week, local media reported deaths and hospitalizations linked to methanol-tainted alcohol. Some patients were admitted to intensive care with severe symptoms, including blindness.",
      "One of them was the rapper Hungria, who has been hospitalized in Brasilia after possibly drinking altered alcohol. On Friday, he posted on his Instagram account that he was feeling better and would soon be discharged.",
      "\"Friday has a different energy. If you feel thirsty, find a safe place to have a drink,\" the singer said.",
      "Health Minister Alexandre Padilha urged Brazilians to avoid drinking, especially distilled beverages, which are more difficult to verify for adulteration. He described the situation as abnormal and noted that Brazil recorded 20 methanol poisoning cases in August and September, equal to its annual average.",

      "Though it\u2019s conventional wisdom, many relationship experts say sticking to such a rule is counterproductive. It may even harm the relationship.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely wrong,\u201d said Samantha Whiten, a clinical psychologist in Maryland. \u201cAll it does is make sure that people are fighting when they\u2019re tired.\u201d",
      "Instead, couples can learn habits that help them get rest while boosting the relationship long term.",
      "It\u2019s understandable to want to discuss a problem before letting it fester, Whiten said, but it\u2019s unrealistic to expect conflicts to be wrapped up quickly and lovingly before drifting off to sleep.",
      "\u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s like a fairy tale, though.\u201d",
      "Some sources attribute the origin of the phrase to the New Testament book of Ephesians. Translations vary, but it\u2019s some version of: \u201cBe angry but do not sin; do not let the sun set on your anger.\u201d",
      "The trouble is, couples shouldn\u2019t fight when they are \u201cemotionally dysregulated,\u201d Whiten said. She referred to the acronym HALT, a common reminder in therapy that people should avoid serious discussions when hungry, angry, lonely or tired. Many people also drink alcohol at night, which doesn\u2019t help create a calm environment.",
      "\u201cThey are more likely to say and do things impulsively that they may regret,\u201d she said.",
      "Discussing problems at night might seem easiest because it's when your partner is most available, said Sabrina Romanoff, a clinical psychologist in New York City.",
      "But it\u2019s better to acknowledge that something needs to be discussed, take a pause, and set a time to come back to it, she said. That could mean having lunch or coffee together the next day, or any time you\u2019re not rushing out the door.",
      "The key is to follow through.",
      "\u201cIt speaks to a skill, to trust that your partner is really going to return to this thing that\u2019s really important to you,\u201d Romanoff said, adding that most couples have to practice that.",

      "\u201cPeople need to individually learn how they can regulate themselves and tell themselves it\u2019s OK,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea of being able to self-soothe is really key.\u201d",
      "The reverse \u2014 avoidance \u2014 is no better. Many people might need space to process an argument, but they\u2019re obliged to come back later to their partner to address the topic.",
      "The goal is that both people feel secure enough to acknowledge the disagreement, remember their relationship is more important than one argument, and agree to talk about it later, Whiten said. \u201cWhen people can learn to do that, it\u2019s really transformative.\u201d",
      "Romanoff suggested that couples establish regular check-ins. They don\u2019t have to talk about the worst problems in their lives at a given point, but they should make a habit of small gestures of communication.",

      "A nonprofit group in Miami is helping reduce the strain on emergency rooms by providing homeless people with health care where they live",
      "MIAMI -- MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Jonas Richards became homeless several years ago after losing his job as a truck driver. Despite suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes, seeing a doctor hasn't been a major priority since then.",
      "\u201cWhen you're homeless, it's not easy,\u201d Richards said. \u201cYou find yourself hustling, trying to keep a little money in your pocket, trying to find something to eat.\u201d",
      "But Richards recently had his first visit with doctors from Miami Street Medicine while sitting on a curb outside a homeless shelter.",
      "\u201cYou get everything done right here very fast,\u201d Richards said. \u201cIt was a big help.\u201d",
      "Miami Street Medicine is a nonprofit organization providing free mobile health care services to homeless people. It\u2019s part of a larger group, Dade County Street Response, which also includes a free clinic called Doctors Within Borders, a disaster relief team and a mental health crisis line.",
      "Miami Street Medicine teams of paid staff and medical school student volunteers aren\u2019t just bandaging cuts and handing out aspirin. They\u2019re performing intake on patients with tablet computers and offer follow-up visits for chronic conditions. They're working with specialists like dermatologists, neurologists and cardiologists.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out there to meet the needs of our patients,\u201d founder Dr. Dan Bergholz said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s a cough drop, we\u2019ve got you. We are happy to help you with that cough drop. But really the mission is so much greater. It\u2019s showing that we care, and we\u2019re there for them. So when that cough becomes pneumonia, they\u2019ll let us listen to their lungs and maybe trust us to take them to the hospital.\u201d",
      "Bergholz began laying groundwork for Miami Street Medicine about seven years ago. He said he had started doing charity outreach with homeless people as an undergraduate, but it seemed like more could be done.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like we weren\u2019t quite moving the needle for folks,\u201d Bergholz said.",
      "After learning more about the growing trend of street medicine and being accepted to the University of Miami\u2019s medical school, Bergholz began working with other students to set up a program.",
      "\u201cI moved down to Miami early and just started hitting the streets and chatting with people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could call it a needs assessment.\u201d",
      "Just as Miami Street Medicine was taking off, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and forced the group to adjust. Bergholz connected with Dade County Street Response to provide health care to more underserved areas.",

      "\u201cA sort of bigger vision emerged to fill the gaps in the local social safety net,\u201d Bergholz said.",
      "One challenge is the transient nature of homeless people, which makes it difficult to provide continual care. Dr. Armen Henderson, founder of Dade County Street Response, said the problem is compounded by laws that target homeless people.",
      "\u201cThe criminalization of homelessness has significantly impacted our patients\u2019 ability to be in one place to get services,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cFor the street medicine team, they know they meet us in one place. But if the majority of those patients are now ending up in jail, now the people are trying to figure out what places are police not harassing them.\u201d",
      "Another challenge is fighting the common sentiment that providing services actually increases homelessness, Henderson said.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that ends homelessness is easy access to housing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that encourages people to be unsheltered. No one wants to be unsheltered. So by offering services like this, we\u2019re actually trying to ease people\u2019s suffering. When people come in here, they want to get off the street. They want to figure out a plan.\u201d",
      "Members of Miami Street Medicine have noticed more people losing their homes in recent years as prices increase and wages remain stagnant. Dr. Inaki Bent, who oversees street medicine teams, said he\u2019s also seen an increase in undocumented migrants on the streets as the state and federal governments have expanded immigration enforcement this year.",
      "\u201cI see patients here who are no longer working,\u201d Bent said. \u201cThey\u2019re no longer working because the fields and the construction sites have become targets. And they would prefer not to be employed or not to expose themselves to that risk.\u201d",
      "In addition to the individual benefit to patients, providing medical treatment on the street and at the group's clinic prevents treatable conditions from becoming emergencies that ultimately strain the entire health care system. For example, Bent had a patient who had previously been treated for seizures at an emergency room and received a prescription, but couldn't afford it. The patient would have eventually ended up back in the ER, but Miami Street Medicine paid for his medicine.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re able to fill that void and hopefully prevent a couple more admissions,\u201d Bent said. \u201cBut we're also able to do a human service for him, for our fellow man, to provide him with the necessary health care so he can begin his path toward a productive life.\u201d",

(AP) \u2014 New Mexico lawmakers moved quickly Thursday at a special legislative session to prop up funding for food assistance and rural health care services in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to federal spending on Medicaid and nutrition programs.",
      "The Democratic-led Legislature sent a flurry of bills to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham that include more than $16 million to sustain food assistance under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and additional funds to bolster food banks, as the federal government ends SNAP eligibility for many noncitizens and changes benefit calculations for others.",
      "\u201cWe need to act to make sure that New Mexicans don't go hungry with SNAP changes at the federal level,\u201d Democratic state Sen. George Mu\u00f1oz of Gallup said.",
      "Another $50 million would help sustain medical services at rural health clinics and hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid spending.",
      "Republicans in the legislative minority voted in unison against the spending provisions, arguing big Medicaid changes are still far away and that New Mexico should focus on reducing errors in benefit distributions.",
      "At the same time, Democrats and some GOP legislators voted to backfill subsidies to health insurance on New Mexico\u2019s Affordable Health Care exchange in case federal credits are allowed to expire. The federal subsidies are a major sticking point of the budget standoff in Washington that prompted the federal government shutdown Wednesday.",
      "In a news release, Lujan Grisham said she'll sign the bills to protect families from being priced out of insurance and ensure health care services are provided in small communities.",
      "Many federal health care changes under Trump's big bill don\u2019t kick in until 2027 or later, and Democratic legislators in New Mexico acknowledged that their bills are only a temporary bandage.",
      "\u201cSome of the most significant (federal) cuts are delayed a few years, and these are deeply significant,\u201d said state Rep. Nathan Small of Las Cruces, lead sponsor of the spending bill. \u201cI want to make sure that we\u2019re all thinking of, not hundreds of millions, but billions of dollars of reduced Medicaid support to our state.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s big bill is prompting urgent action in several Democratic states, but not in Republican ones.",
      "\u201cThese are temporary fixes,\" Democratic state House Speaker Javier Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cThese are insurmountable holes for any state to plug.\u201d",
      "New Mexico lawmakers approved a quick infusion of state spending on food assistance through SNAP for elderly recipients.",
      "Nearly one-fourth of New Mexico residents receive food assistance through SNAP, making it a major line of defense against hunger.",

      "The stakes are high in New Mexico, where about 38% of residents rely on Medicaid. And state lawmakers \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 are warning of a rural health care crisis as New Mexico struggles to retain medical professionals and keep clinics and hospitals open.",
      "State Sen. Pat Woods, a Republican from the state\u2019s sparsely populated eastern plains, co-sponsored changes to rural health care grants aimed at shoring up existing health care services at rural clinics and hospitals. A 64-3 vote of the House on Thursday sent the bill to the governor for consideration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out a way to fund and keep some of these clinics open. What\u2019s going to happen in the future? Who the hell knows,\u201d Woods told a panel of state lawmakers. \u201cWhat I worry about is keeping these clinics and hospitals open until the dust settles.\u201d",
      "Legislators also voted to set aside $17 million to ensure subsidies don't lapse on New Mexico's Affordable Care Act exchange.",
      "That initiative also would extend insurance subsidies to middle-income residents whose earnings equal or exceed 400% of the federal poverty level \u2014 roughly $128,000 annually for a family of four.",

      "Separately, legislators approved $6 million in state funding for public broadcasting stations \u2014 including $430,000 for five tribal stations hit hard by the defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting by Congress and Trump. Approved federal grants to the stations for the current federal budget year were clawed back, under a bill signed by Trump in July.",
      "Another bill awaiting the governor's signature would give the New Mexico Health Department greater decision-making authority regarding adult and childhood immunizations and state vaccine purchases.",

      "Federal health officials have approved another generic version of the abortion pill, prompting outrage from some abortion opponents aligned with President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal officials have approved another generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, a regulatory formality that quickly triggered pushback from anti-abortion groups and politicians aligned with the Trump administration.",
      "Drugmaker Evita Solutions announced on its website that the Food and Drug Administration signed off on its low-cost form of the pill, which is approved to end pregnancies through 10 weeks.",
      "Students for Life Action, which opposes abortion, in a statement Thursday called the approval \u201ca stain on the Trump presidency and another sign that the deep state at the FDA must go.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri also criticized the move in a post on X, stating, \u201cI have lost confidence in the leadership at FDA.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the agency said the FDA \u201chas very limited discretion in deciding whether to approve a generic drug,\" and added that FDA officials do not \u201cendorse any product.\u201d",
      "The criticism comes as Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s top health officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., face growing pressure from abortion opponents to reevaluate mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago and has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.",
      "In a letter to Republican attorneys general last month, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary pledged to conduct a full review of the drug\u2019s safety.",
      "Under Makary and Kennedy, the FDA has repeatedly delayed decisions on vaccines, ultimately narrowing the terms of approval for this year's COVID-19 shots. That type of political intervention was previously highly unusual at the FDA, where career scientists typically make such decisions.",
      "The FDA approved the original version of mifepristone in 2000 and gradually eased access over time. That included approving the first generic pill, from drugmaker GenBioPro, in 2019.",
      "In 2021, the FDA under Democratic President Joe Biden permitted online prescribing and mail-order delivery of the drug, greatly expanding access. Abortion opponents have been fighting the change ever since.",
      "Approval of generic drugs is typically a rote process at the FDA, with multiple copycat versions usually approved after the patent on the original drug expires. In most cases, generic drugmakers only need to show that their drug matches the ingredients and formula used in the original medication.",
      "\u201cThis is exactly how our system is supposed to work, and it has worked this way for decades,\" said Mini Timmaraju of Reproductive Freedom for All. \u201cCareer scientists and civil servants at the FDA did their jobs.\u201d",

      "Access to mifepristone is restricted across large sections of the country because of state laws that ban abortion \u2014 including medication abortion \u2014 or impose separate restrictions on the drug\u2019s use.

      "The idea of meditating can be intimidating to beginners",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea of meditating can be intimidating. Beginners may imagine sitting uncomfortably in silence while breathing deeply and scrubbing all thoughts from their minds. The prospect of trying those techniques at work may feel embarrassing.",
      "But there are ways to bring short, inconspicuous sessions into the workday if you want to see if meditation can help you deal with challenging customers or reduce anxiety while preparing for a presentation. And experienced practitioners say there's no right or wrong way to do it.",
      "\u201c Meditation is quite easy, as a matter of fact. I think there\u2019s a stigma around it, that you have to be in complete silence, and you have to have some room setup, or do some chanting, or some serious breathing,\u201d said Michelle Beyer, a wellness coach who owns the Brooklyn women\u2019s gym Alana Life & Fitness. \u201cThere\u2019s one-minute meditations you can do to make yourself feel great. Nobody will even know you\u2019re doing them.\"",
      "While there are different meditation techniques, many traditions encourage focusing on breathing to help calm the mind. When thoughts pop up, imagine letting them go. Practitioners say meditating before or at work helps them maintain focus, sit still and reduce stress.",
      "\u201cThere is a calm that I am definitely missing when I have forgotten to do it for a few days,\u201d said Brianna Healy, who meditates for 10 minutes daily before starting her job as assistant director of strategic initiatives and data solutions at Naropa University, a college in Boulder, Colorado, that is inspired by Buddhist principles. \u201cI can always tell the difference in my demeanor.\"",
      "If you feel pressed for time, try fitting meditation sessions into breaks. You can set a timer and focus on breathing while sitting at a desk, in a restroom, inside a vehicle or outside, Beyer said.",
      "Here are some easy mini-meditations to try out on the job.",
      "Commuters can consider getting to work a little early and taking a pause in their cars or a quiet location to decompress from getting out the door and to your destination, said Kathryn Remati, a meditation teacher and author of \u201cBefriend Yourself.\u201d If you only have a minute or two, that's still enough time to try Remati's instructions for a quick reset.",
      "Close your eyes and take a long, slow, deep breath to fill your tummy and lungs with air, she said. Hold the breath for a second, and then slowly breathe out like you're blowing out a candle. \"You\u2019ll immediately feel a shift and you\u2019ll feel like a human again,\u201d Remati said.",
      "While repeating that process, consider setting a positive intention, or goal, for the day. Instead of focusing on a to-do list, think about how you want behave towards others, she said. Some intention examples are, \u201cToday I\u2019m going to be productive, but I\u2019m also going to a good listener\u201d or \u201cI want to have a positive attitude,\u201d she said.",
      "Visualization is another technique that experienced meditators use. Picture yourself succeeding at the challenges you\u2019ll encounter that day. If there\u2019s an upcoming deadline, envision yourself finishing the task 10 minutes early. Jumping for joy. Get specific like a movie director and imagine the colors in the room or the feeling of wind on your face, Remati said.",
      "Throughout the day, \u201cyou can bring up that image anytime you need it to refocus,\u201d she said.",
      "You can also use visualization to reframe your perspective on colleagues or clients. A technique Remati recommends putting into practice before meetings may seem quirky: Envision a white light over the meeting room's doorway that showers the people entering with brightness. Remati says it may help you imagine them in a better light. \u201cYou can even put some sort of pink bubble around people,\" she added.",
      "Another short meditation that can be done almost anywhere involves breathing deeply and mentally scanning your body for sensations, a technique popularized in the U.S. by mindfulness practitioner Jon Kabat-Zinn. Depending on your location and comfort level, you can keep your eyes open or closed.",

      "Inhale through the nose and out through the mouth. Start with your feet and work your way up, noticing any areas with pain, tightness, tingling, warmth or other sensations. Think about relaxing the muscles of any spots where there's tension.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re intentionally scanning your body,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about, how do your feet feel in your shoes? How do your ankles feel? Knees, hips, ribs, shoulders, neck, head, and by the time you know it, you checked in with every part of your body.\"",
      "Another discreet meditation technique is breathing deeply and joining your pointer finger to your thumb to form a circle. You can do this if you feel your stress level rising. \u201cSay to yourself, whenever I put my finger and thumb together, I will be able to be peaceful and open-minded,\u201d Remati said.",
      "If you're in a meeting and start to feel resentful or left out, you can do it under the table, and no one will know, she added. Remati does this herself if she notices she's becoming judgmental or short-tempered. \u201cYou just do the finger and thumb, take a nice deep breath, get grounded, and then get back into the meeting and feeling positive,\u201d she said.",
      "One of Beyer's favorite techniques is best done when there aren't a lot of people nearby. Truck drivers can do it in traffic. You inhale, and then when you're breathing out, you hum with your lips closed, she said.",
      "\u201cIt's going to immediately take down stress levels in the body and even in the mind,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cWhen you inhale and you focus on humming, then your brain is focused on that, not the \u2018what ifs' or the worries that like to take over when we feel stressed.\u201d",
      "If you feel self-conscious about humming in a quiet office, you can step outside or head to a noisier place.",
      "The shoulder and jaw release technique also may help relax the bodies of train passengers or drivers or stuck in traffic, Beyer said. To start, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Repeat that, and then on the third exhale, roll your shoulders back. Inhale a fourth time and then on the next exhale relax your tongue and jaw, Beyer said. Finally, inhale again, bring your attention to your hands and just let them hang heavy, she said. Then breathe in and out a sixth time.",
      "Another technique Remati encourages is saying mantras or affirmations, which are positive statements or slogans you repeat to yourself. You can write them down and say them in your head or out loud while breathing deeply, before a meeting or at any point throughout the day.",
      "Some phrases you might say: \u201cI am calm.\" Deep breath. \u201cI am confident.\u201d Deep breath. \"I am ready for success,\u201d Remati suggested. \u201cI speak my truth. I am patient. I am here for the highest good of all.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats kept their promise to reject any Republican spending bill that didn\u2019t extend or restore health care benefits, choosing instead to force a government shutdown. Now they have to figure out how to get out of it.",
      "Just hours after the shutdown began, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said that if the Republicans work with them, \u201cthe shutdown could go away very quickly.\u201d",
      "But that won\u2019t be easy. Republican leaders \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump \u2014 have said that they won\u2019t negotiate or be \u201cheld hostage \u201d by Democrats demanding concessions to reopen the government. The bill Democrats voted against was a simple extension of funding for 45 days, legislation they say should be noncontroversial.",
      "While that uncompromising Republican position may not last long \u2014 there were some early, informal talks on the Senate floor Wednesday \u2014 reaching a deal would be difficult. It\u2019s deeply uncertain, for now, if the two sides could find common ground on health care policy or sow enough trust for the Democrats to change their position.",
      "At the same time, an extended shutdown could be increasingly painful for Democrats. The Trump administration has threatened to lay off thousands of workers and target Democratic-leaning states. On Wednesday, the White House announced it was putting a hold on subway and tunnel projects in Schumer\u2019s home state of New York.",
      "\u201cThis Democrat shutdown is actually delaying progress on the issues that Democrats claim to be interested in,\u201d Thune, who represents South Dakota, said on the Senate floor Wednesday.",
      "Republicans were encouraged Tuesday evening when three Democrats voted with them to keep the government open \u2014 Democratic Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine.",
      "Republicans, who hold the majority, need eight Democrats to win the 60 votes needed for passage in the 53-47 Senate. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was the only Republican to vote with Democrats against the measure.",
      "Thune is holding repeated votes on the measure, which failed 55-45 on Tuesday night and again Wednesday morning. He said he hopes that five Democrats will eventually feel the pressure and support the bill \u201cwhen they realize that this is playing a losing hand.\u201d",
      "Republicans are eyeing several moderate Democrats who appeared to be wavering before casting \u201cno\u201d votes on Tuesday night, including Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Gary Peters of Michigan. Both voted to keep the government open in March, along with Schumer, while many of their colleagues voted for a shutdown.",
      "But Shaheen and Peters each voted no on Tuesday after extensive negotiations with colleagues in both parties on the floor. Shaheen said afterward that \u201cI have been in intensive conversations with colleagues from both sides of the aisle on how to find a path forward and I\u2019m eager to work with my Republican colleagues to find common ground.\u201d",
      "As some Democrats are already looking for a way out, others say they need to dig in and fight.",
      "\u201cAs Donald Trump\u2019s lawlessness grows during this shutdown, our spines should stiffen, not bend,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said in a social media post on Wednesday. \u201cLet\u2019s stand for something. The American people don\u2019t want us to fund the destruction of their health care and the destruction of our democracy.\u201d",
      "The divisions in the caucus pose a dilemma for Schumer, who was blasted by base voters and activists in March when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. Many Democrats in the House and Senate have suggested that shutting down the government is their only leverage to fight Trump and push back on his policies, including health care and spending cuts.",
      "\u201cStanding up to (Trump) on this is sending a message to him on those other issues as well,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.",
      "Democrats have demanded that Republicans immediately extend health care subsidies for people who purchase coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The expanded subsidies first put in place in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic are set to expire at the end of the year, raising premium costs for millions of people.",

The subsidies, which go to low- and middle-income people who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, are slated to expire at the end of the year if Congress doesn't extend them. Their expiration would more than double what subsidized enrollees currently pay for premiums next year, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues.",

      "The Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases in the last five years that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people\u2019s federal food benefits",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A single mother who relied on federal food assistance lost her benefits in 2020 after Kentucky investigators concluded she\u2019d committed fraud.",
      "The state alleged she had made multiple same-day purchases, tried to overdraw her account a few times, entered a few invalid PINs and sometimes made \u201cwhole-dollar\u201d purchases that are unlikely during typical grocery runs.",
      "The woman from Salyersville in Appalachian Kentucky had an explanation: She worked at the store. She would sometimes buy lunch there and then get groceries after work. Her child would also occasionally use her card.",
      "An administrative hearing officer kicked her off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) regardless, based solely on the allegedly suspicious shopping pattern. She sued \u2014 and won.",
      "\u201cIt is draconian to take away SNAP benefits from a single mother without clear and convincing evidence that intentional trafficking was occurring during a time when food scarcity is so prevalent,\u201d Franklin County Judge Thomas Wingate said in his 2023 decision.",
      "Over the last five years, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people\u2019s food benefits.",
      "Judges, lawyers and legal experts said in interviews and in court documents that such evidence proves little. Kentucky Public Radio reviewed dozens of administrative hearing decisions and court documents from the last five years in which the cabinet relied on shopping patterns to prove a person had \u201ctrafficked,\u201d or sold, their benefits.",
      "Kentucky is so aggressive in disqualifying people from SNAP benefits that the state is second in the nation for per-capita administrative disqualifications, behind Florida, according to the most recent federal data from 2023.",
      "In the last decade, disqualifications in Kentucky rose from fewer than 100 in 2015 to over 1,800 in 2023. And more than 300 others have been accused of selling or misusing their benefits since January 2024, according to records obtained by Kentucky Public Radio.",
      "Another Franklin County judge in 2023 ordered the cabinet to stop disqualifying individuals based solely on transactional data, but since the decision, at least three lawsuits allege the health agency continues to bring such cases.",
      "Transactional data alone cannot prove intent to commit fraud nor show the actual result of any individual transaction, University of Kentucky law professor Cory Dodds said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that folks didn\u2019t do it, didn\u2019t commit the fraud, but I don\u2019t think the cabinet in a lot of these cases has met their burden of proof, either.\u201d",
      "Kentuckians receive notice of their alleged suspicious activity through mailed letters, in which they\u2019re asked to voluntarily waive their right to a hearing and automatically accept the punishment. On first offense, that\u2019s generally a one-year SNAP ban. They\u2019re also required to repay the full amount the state says they misused.",
      "Often, these cases involve a relatively small amount of money. Records show that more than 900 people have been kicked off for \u201ctrafficking\u201d or misuse for less than $1,000 since 2022. The lowest amount alleged was 14 cents.",
      "The state has leaned heavily on administrative hearing waivers since 2015, and by 2023, almost a quarter of all disqualifications were via waiver. Some lawsuits allege individuals did not fully understand the consequences of the waivers and were encouraged to sign by officials.",
      "Kentucky Public Radio reviewed more than two dozen cases since 2020 in which the cabinet accused an individual of trafficking using only spending patterns, despite the participants\u2019 denial or lack of response \u2014 and with no other evidence or interviews presented, according to administrative hearing decisions.",
      "Kendra Steele, a spokesperson for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, declined to schedule an interview with cabinet officials after multiple requests. Steele said in an email that \u201cwe have never\u201d brought trafficking cases based solely on transactional data and acknowledged it would not be sufficient to prove intent.",
      "In response to a different question, Steele wrote the investigation into fraud allegations consists of looking into income, living situations \u201cand patterns of spending that are indicative of trafficking.\u201d She did not indicate how any of those factors could be used to prove intentional misuse or selling of SNAP benefits, or how it differs from relying on transactional data \u2014 which is inherently a pattern of spending. Steele said in another email that they also interview vendors and SNAP recipients.",
      "Roughly 4 in 25 Kentuckians suffer from food insecurity, similar to the national rate of about 14%, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The USDA will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d The decision comes in the wake of federal funding cuts for food and nutrition safety net programs nationwide.",
      "In the last fiscal year, 1 in 8 Kentuckians benefitted from SNAP, formerly called food stamps. Food insecurity in Kentucky\u2019s rural areas is even more stark, and legal representation harder to come by.",
      "\u201cThe people who benefit from these programs are some of the folks that we need to be helping the most in this country,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cIt\u2019s our fellow Kentuckians who are going hungry as a result of baseless allegations of waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d",

But administrative hearing decisions reviewed by KPR from 2020 through 2023 included evidence the cabinet relied on; hearing officers would frequently say a person had trafficked their benefits based on shopping patterns the state deemed suspicious.",
      "National legal experts who specialize in SNAP access say an overreliance on transactional data isn\u2019t unique to Kentucky. Transactional data was initially meant as a tool to identify potential fraud cases \u2014 not as a means to prove it, Georgetown law professor David Super said.",
      "He\u2019s studied SNAP disqualifications for decades, and has seen many cases where he believes transactional data is misconstrued as direct evidence of wrongdoing, instead of requiring a state to build cases with witnesses, affidavits, video evidence and plea deals.",
      "In one redacted 2023 state administrative hearing decision, a hearing officer decided a woman in the eastern Kentucky city of McKee had trafficked her benefits because she had made eight back-to-back transactions in a year. The decision also said she\u2019d checked her balance several times, made a few insufficient fund attempts and had incorrectly entered her PIN number a few times.",
      "She lost her SNAP benefits for a year. In an appeal, the woman told the state she has two kids and had recently discovered she was pregnant.",
      "\u201cEveryone forgets to get something and has to go back in the store and get it,\u201d she wrote, defending her back-to-back purchases.",

      "Cabinet officials acknowledged in cross examinations during a 2023 case that back-to-back transactions and whole-dollar purchases aren\u2019t forbidden under SNAP rules, nor are recipients told that the cabinet considers them suspicious.",
      "But all of these things are used as evidence \u2014 sometimes the sole evidence \u2014 that a person misused their benefits.",
      "Kristie Goff, an AppalRed legal aid lawyer in Prestonsburg in southeast Kentucky, used to see many of these cases, though they\u2019ve declined in the last year.",
      "\u201cThere have been very few instances in cases I have handled, where a client was not able to give me a perfectly reasonable explanation for those transactions, and none of it was trafficking,\u201d Goff said. \u201cThere are no receipts, there\u2019s no video footage to show that someone\u2019s doing anything wrong. It\u2019s just a number written on a paper.\u201d",
      "While saying purchasing history is insufficient to prove trafficking, Kentucky judges have stopped short of demanding that the state change how it trains employees or conducts its SNAP investigations.",
      "In response to an open records request, the cabinet provided KPR with documents used to train investigators on intentional program violations. They appear to almost exclusively discuss transactional data, including investigating back-to-back payments, large transactions and whole-dollar purchases.",
      "In 2020, Michigan appellate judges decided transactional data alone is never sufficient to prove that a business \u2014 or person \u2014 fraudulently used SNAP benefits.",
      "Dodds believes that should be the standard for all states, including Kentucky.",
      "He is in the early stages of systematically reviewing thousands of SNAP benefit trafficking hearing decisions between 2020 and 2023. Data from about 700 decisions in 2020 alone already shows that many Kentuckians have been denied benefits before the state presents what he considers real evidence of guilt.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a handful of cases that I would say there was real evidence that they had done something wrong,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cThere was one where a woman was on the phone with the hearing officer while she was actively trying to sell her benefits. ...

      "Peninsula Vald\u00e9s, located in the Patagonian province of Chubut, is globally important for the conservation of marine mammals and is home to a key breeding population of Southern right whales \u2014 once an endangered species \u2014 as well as elephant seals and sea lions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen whales in Canada and California, but this was the best and probably the largest number of whales I\u2019ve ever seen in my life,\u201d said Tino Ventz, a German tourist who recently visited the peninsula with his girlfriend.",
      "The Southern right whale was nearly exterminated by hunting expeditions up until the last century. Before large-scale whaling began, the population in southern waters was estimated at around 100,000, before it was decimated to about 600. Since then, it has slowly recovered to roughly 4,700 whales around Peninsula Vald\u00e9s today.",
      "Whale-watching season in the south American country peaks between August and September. This year, more than 2,000 whales have been spotted, though the actual number is likely higher, scientists say.",
      "Ventz, 24, and his partner joined Argentine Andrea Delfino and her children on a boat trip. Southern winds stirred the whales into more acrobatic breaching, a spectacle that leaves an indelible impression on those who witness it.",
      "Other tourists preferred to watch the whales from the shore, as is common in neighboring Brazil or Uruguay.",
      "Watching from the beach, Agustina Guidol\u00edn, fulfilled her dream of witnessing \u201cthe immensity that borders on the magical and the wild.\u201d The tourists were at El Doradillo Park, a protected natural area in Puerto Madryn, where whales spend time close to shore with their young after giving birth.",
      "In addition to Peninsula Vald\u00e9s and other points in Patagonia, the whales\u2019 migration route extends along Uruguay\u2019s eastern coast and southern Brazil.",
      "Santiago Fern\u00e1ndez, a biologist with Argentina\u2019s National Scientific and Technical Research Council, is part of a project that since 1999 has carried out two to three aerial surveys each year along 640 kilometers (400 miles) of Patagonian coastline. This year\u2019s count recorded 2,100 whales \u2014 863 of them mothers with calves, and the rest solitary individuals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re underestimating the number of whales in the area,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said of the census, noting that it represents only a snapshot, since whales move in and out of the same region as they migrate.",

      "Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared his readiness to adhere to nuclear arms limits under the 2010 New START arms reduction treaty for one more year, and he urged Washington to follow suit. When asked about the proposal, Trump said Sunday it \u201csounds like a good idea to me.\u201d",

      "Roustan Hockey, Canada's last major wooden hockey stick factory, faces challenges from trade tensions",
      "BRANTFORD, Ontario -- BRANTFORD, Ontario (AP) \u2014 Wearing protective gloves and earplugs, a worker feeds lengths of wood into a machine that makes an earsplitting whine as it automatically cuts a groove into the end of each piece.",
      "Nearby, stacks of wooden wedges wait to be slotted into those grooves to form the beginnings of a hockey stick. Further down the Roustan Hockey production line, other workers are busy shaping, trimming, sanding, painting and screen printing as they turn lumber into a Canadian national symbol.",
      "It's a typical day on the job for the 15 workers at Canada's last major hockey stick factory, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southwest of Toronto.",
      "The operation has origins that date back to the 1800s and has survived decades of trade globalization to hang on as the last North American commercial manufacturer of traditional wooden hockey sticks. Now it's facing fresh headwinds from the trade war launched by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has ripped up free trade deals in North America and imposed tariffs on Canadian exports.",
      "The uncertainty is making life a headache for Roustan.",
      "\u201cYou never know\u201d what Trump will do, said Bo Crawford, the factory's general manager. \u201cYou just have to roll with it and the president of the U.S. can change his mind day to day, week to week, hour to hour. So yeah, we have to deal with it the best we can,\" he said.",
      "Roustan has spent months dealing with U.S. customer worries and navigating the trade challenges.",
      "Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian imports, though many goods have ultimately remained exempted because they're already covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement negotiated during his first term.",
      "Then, in late August, the Trump administration eliminated a widely used customs exemption for international shipments worth $800 that resulted in new uncertainty over cross-border trade, said owner and CEO Graeme Roustan.",
      "\u201cEven if somebody buys one or two or five or 10 sticks and it\u2019s under $100, they\u2019re going to be affected by the tariffs, so the jury is still out on how that\u2019s going to impact business,\u201d Roustan said.",
      "Roustan Hockey's factory churns out about 400,000 wooden hockey sticks a year under the Christian, Northland and Sherwood brands, with about 100,000 exported to the United States. It also makes plastic-bladed road hockey sticks and foam-core goalie sticks.",
      "Crawford said shipments to the U.S. have been held up for manual inspections at the border, where they've been hit with surprise tariffs, which the company's customs broker has managed to get waived.",
      "It's not just sticks. Shipments of goalie pads, which Roustan manufactures at a separate factory in Toronto, were recently flagged for an unexpected 200% tariff, which company managers said they're trying to resolve with new forms from their shipping company.",
      "The disruption underscores the broader trade turmoil that's left the Canadian economy reeling.",
      "Canada's economy shrank 1.6% in the second quarter, in the first contraction since 2023 and the biggest decline since the COVID-19 pandemic. Exports slumped 7.5%, as uncertainty over tariffs and trade pummeled exports to the country's biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "Those figures overshadow the longer-term decline of Canadian manufacturing. Some 37,800 manufacturing jobs were lost in the year to August, according to official data.",

Years of excessive regulation, and a chronic lack of ambition by successive governments in promoting domestic transformation of our natural resources\u2014recently made worse by Washington\u2019s protectionist agenda,\u201d wrote economists St\u00e9fane Marion and Matthieu Arseneau. \"That failure has eroded Canada\u2019s manufacturing base and left us at risk of becoming irrelevant in global supply chains.\u201d",
      "The Roustan operation started life in 1847 as an agricultural workshop, 20 years before Canada became a country and 70 years before the National Hockey League was created.",
      "It's all that survives of the golden era of North American wooden hockey stick manufacturing in the 1970s and \u201980s when there were numerous workshops in Ontario and Quebec, as well as U.S. production centered in Minnesota.",
      "Roustan, a businessman who also owns the Hockey News and once attempted to buy the Montreal Canadiens, acquired the operation in 2019 \u2014 by then named Heritage Wood Specialties \u2014 and moved it from aging facilities in the town of Hespeler, 20 miles (30 kilometers) north of Brantford, hometown of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky.",
      "Nowadays, global production amounts to about 5 million hockey sticks a year, but wood makes up only about a tenth. No NHL player has regularly used a wooden stick in well over a decade, underlining the sport's embrace of newer technology.",
      "Composite sticks, made of carbon fiber and other lightweight advanced materials, are now far more popular and preferred by both amateurs and professionals. But composite sticks are pricier because of the advanced manufacturing processes involved.",
      "Meanwhile, over the years, Canadian and U.S. production consolidated or moved to Asia and Mexico amid a wider global shift by Western consumer brands in search of cheaper manufacturing overseas.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to compete against some of the Asian markets and some of our competitors that are in other countries,\" said Crawford. \u201cBut our quality kind of stands for itself.\u201d",
      "Roustan acknowledges that the wooden hockey stick market is not a growth industry and, at best, production will hold steady.",
      "\u201cRight now, we have, you know, 5-10% of the market. But it\u2019s diminishing every year. And the kids that are growing up today, they are all about composite. So yes, it\u2019s a shrinking market for sure.\u201d",
      "At Roustan's 130,000 square foot factory, the manufacturing process is low-tech and artisanal.",
      "At one workstation, a worker uses liquid epoxy to glue fiberglass reinforcing sheets to wooden blades, in batches of six. Nearby, another worker uses a band saw to trim dried excess fiberglass off each blade. In the paint room, sticks are dipped in white paint and then hung on a line of moving hooks to dry.",
      "The factory's story is not just about evolving trade patterns and modern industrial practices, but also about the place that the national winter sport has in the Canadian soul, Roustan said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to any country to have a manufacturing base of products that you consume on a regular basis,\u201d said Roustan. \u201cHaving a factory that makes hockey sticks in Canada really serves two purposes. One, it contributes to the manufacturing base. But two, (it) has the legacy and the tug of the heartstrings of the game that we all love in Canada.\u201d",

      "The fire on Saturday night came two days after two men were killed when a knife-wielding assailant attacked their synagogue in Manchester on the holiest day of the Jewish year, in what authorities have called a terrorist assault. One of the victims was accidentally shot by an armed officer as he and other congregants barricaded the synagogue to block the attacker from entering.",

He said they had been held at the Alexandria Staging Facility immigration detention center in Louisiana. Nguyen said he tracked their flight with help from rights group Human Rights First.",

It said they were \u201cin good health and undergoing admission processes.\u201d",

      "The main stud for his owner, food vendor and farmer Thawatchai Daeng-Ngam, Tod was one of the competitors Monday at the annual water buffalo racing festival in Chonburi, a city about an hour drive from Bangkok.",
      "Formerly considered humble draft animals, water buffaloes have become prized show animals in Thailand. They are celebrated at the festival, held at the end of the 11th lunar month to celebrate the beginning of the harvest season and put a spotlight on the animals that once were vital to Thai agriculture.",
      "These days tractors have replaced buffaloes, once prized for their strength and ability to plow fields and transport heavy loads. If the animals are not competing in shows, they are sold for meat.",
      "Buffaloes were the main attraction at the fair in Chonburi, which kicked off with a parade featuring students performing traditional Thai dance. Some of the buffaloes wore flower crowns as they pulled traditional wooden carriages with wheels 2 meters (6.5 feet) tall carrying their owners and women dressed in traditional Thai garb.",
      "The festival also featured a race with buffaloes ridden by jockeys sprinting down a 100-meter (328-foot) track.",
      "Pitun Rassamee came to compete with his 3-year-old buffalo with white fur. The albino already had won local competitions and he hoped Lookaew, meaning marble in Thai, would place in the top five.",
      "There was good reason to be hopeful. Another albino Thai buffalo was sold in 2024 for 18 million baht ($672,000) after winning multiple pageants.",
      "The shift from farm animals to prized symbols has been a gradual one accompanying the mechanization of farming. Thailand's water buffalo population was in decline for a time.",
      "But the contests have injected new interest in the animals, as well as a new industry enjoying government support. The Thai government designated a Thai Buffalo Conservation Day beginning in 2017 and local governments now provide breeding assistance to farmers.",
      "Thawatchai, the food vendor who owns Tod, said raising the buffalo for competition was only a hobby. He lets it roam freely on his family's farm and was only at the festival to see how Tod measured up with others.",

Those include a revisionism of wartime history and regular visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, seen as a symbol of militarism.",

      "The LDP and opposition parties are currently considering convening the parliament in mid-October to formally elect a new prime minister.",
      "Takaichi is likely to be Japan\u2019s leader because the LDP, even without a majority in either house of parliament following consecutive election losses, is still by far the largest in the lower house, which decides the national leader, and because opposition groups are highly splintered.",

      "Takaichi said she will honor the tariffs and investment agreements between the government of the current prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba and the Trump administration.",

      "In a rare move that shakes their 26-year-partnership, Komeito leader Tetsuo Saito told Takaichi on Saturday that his party has \u201cbig worry and concern\" about her positions and would not stay in the coalition unless these positions are dropped.",
      "As new party president, Takaichi\u2019s first job is to decide a lineup of top LDP party posts, which she is expected to announce Tuesday.",
      "Takaichi has turned to the LDP\u2019s most powerful kingmaker and former prime minister Taro Aso, a conservative who backed her and reportedly influenced Saturday\u2019s party vote. She is expected to appoint him as deputy prime minister and name his brother-in-law and former Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki as party secretary general.",

      "Political watchers say Takaichi is considering appointing those who voted for her in the runoff as a reward. Among them is Toshimitsu Motegi, who is close to Aso and has served in key ministerial posts including as foreign and trade ministers. He is being considered for the position of top diplomat.",
      "Takaichi has also suggested appointing a number of former Abe faction lawmakers implicated in slush funds and other scandals to senior posts, despite public criticism over the party's lack of reform measures and subsequent election losses.",

      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 France\u2019s new prime minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu resigned less than 24 hours after naming his government and after less than a month in office, plunging the country into a deep political crisis and leaving French President Emmanuel Macron with few options.",
      "The French presidency said in a statement Monday that Macron, who has been hitting record lows in opinion polls, has accepted his resignation.",
      "Lecornu had replaced his predecessor, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, in September to become France\u2019s fourth prime minister in barely a year during a prolonged period of political instability.",
      "French politics have been in disarray since Macron called snap elections last year that produced a deeply fragmented legislature and a political impasse. Far-right and left-wing lawmakers hold over 320 seats at the National Assembly, while the centrists and allied conservatives hold 210, with no party having an overall majority.",
      "A faithful ally of Macron, Lecornu said conditions were no longer met to remain in office after failing to build a consensus.",
      "\u201cIt would take little for it to work,\" Lecornu said in his resignation speech. \"By being more selfless for many, by knowing how to show humility. One must always put one\u2019s country before one\u2019s party.\u201d",
      "With less than two years before the next presidential election, Macron's opponents immediately tried to capitalize on the shocking resignation, with the far-right National Rally calling on him to either call for new snap parliamentary elections or resign.",
      "\u201cThis raises a question for the President of the Republic: can he continue to resist the legislature dissolution? We have reached the end of the road,\u201d far-right leader Marine Le Pen said. \u201cThere is no other solution. The only wise course of action in these circumstances is to return to the polls.\u201d",

      "Lecornu\u2019s main task would have been to pass a budget as France is faced with a massive debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France\u2019s public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion), or 114% of GDP.

      "Retailleau, the head of the conservative Republicans party, said he did not feel responsible for Lecornu's fall despite lashing out at the composition of the new government. Retailleau blamed Lecornu for not letting him know Le Maire would be part of the government. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of trust,\u201d he told TF1 broadcaster. \"You promise a break and end up with returning horses. This government embodied all the conditions to be censured.\u201d",

He also vowed that he would not employ a special constitutional power his predecessors had used to force budgets through Parliament without a vote and would instead seek compromise with lawmakers from the left and the right.",

      "Officials linked the crackdown on firearms users believed to hold such views to the fatal shooting in August of two police officers in Victoria state, in the country's east. The suspect in those killings, 56-year-old Dezi Freeman, remains at large, weeks after he is said to have killed two officers visiting his rural property to serve a search warrant.",
      "In the years before the shooting, Freeman appeared to have embraced so-called sovereign citizen views during court appearances. Members of such movements use debunked legal theories to reject government authority.",
      "Freeman is suspected of killing Detective Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim de Waart-Hottart and wounding a third officer. Following the shooting, investigators in Western Australia used bolstered gun laws enacted in 2024 to identify weapons owners in their state who they said held similar views to Freeman\u2019s.",
      "\u201cThe mission of this operation was simple and that was to validate and verify our intelligence on who may hold sovereign citizen ideologies here in Western Australia,\u201d the state\u2019s Police Commissioner Col Blanch told reporters on Sunday. Social media posts and information from other gun owners was used to identify those targeted.",
      "Officers visited 70 properties over five days in late September and early October, seizing 135 firearms and suspending or revoking 44 gun licenses, Blanch said. Investigators relied on a legal provision that allows only someone who meets the standard of a \u201cfit and proper person\u201d to hold a gun permit.",
      "\u201cIf you have made it very clear that you do not abide by the laws of Western Australia, set by the Parliament, then there is no way that you can be a fit and proper person,\u201d Blanch said.",
      "In explaining the raids, Blanch said that in the past three years, six police officers in four states have been shot dead by members of the public, which he said was \u201cunprecedented\u201d in Australia.",
      "In 2022, two officers were shot and killed by Christian extremists at a rural property in Queensland state.

      "The suspect, Freeman, fled alone, on foot and heavily armed, into dense surrounding forest. He is experienced in wilderness survival skills, officials said.",

      "Australian news outlets widely reported that Freeman espoused sovereign citizen beliefs, citing a 2021 video taken in Wangaratta Magistrate\u2019s Court and published online in which he can be seen attempting unsuccessfully to arrest a magistrate and police officers during a hearing.",

      "Hundreds of rescuers headed up the mountain Sunday to clear paths so that trapped people could come down, the Jimu report said. A video shot by a villager showed a long line of people with horses and oxen moving up a winding path in the snow.",
      "The snowstorm struck during a weeklong national holiday in China, when many travel at home and abroad.",
      "In another mountainous region in western China, one hiker died of hypothermia and altitude sickness and 137 others were evacuated in the north part of Qinghai province, CCTV said Monday.",

      "All 75 people on board evacuated to safety as the boat foundered about 1.6 kilometers (a mile) off the coast of Upolu, Samoa\u2019s second largest island before it caught fire and sank. The wreck of HMNZS Manawanui remains at the site of the sinking on Oct. 6, 2024, and a decision about whether it will remain there hasn't been made.",
      "The vessel sank due to failings of the crew and ship, an official inquiry found. The ship\u2019s crew didn\u2019t realize the vessel was on autopilot and believed something else had gone wrong as it plowed toward the reef, according to a report that highlighted the lack of training, qualifications and experience among those on board.",
      "The compensation announced by New Zealand foreign minister Winston Peters on Monday was the full amount requested by Samoa's government, a spokesperson for Peters said. It will be drawn from New Zealand military funds.",
      "\u201cWe have responded to the Government of Samoa\u2019s request in full and with good faith,\" Peters said in a statement. \u201cWe have always said we will do the right thing.\u201d",
      "Samoa's government didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "New Zealand officials would continue to work with the Samoan counterparts to decide the future of the wreck, Peters said. Work so far has included the removal of fallen shipping containers, pollutants and military equipment.",

      "The military recognized \u201cthe impact that the sinking has had on the people of Samoa, particularly the communities of the South coast,\u201d Ward said.",
      "The specialist dive and hydrographic vessel had been in service for New Zealand since 2019 and was surveying the reef that it ran aground on. Its sinking provoked alarm about environmental catastrophe for Samoan villagers living on the coast where it capsized, who said they feared permanent damage to the fragile reef ecosystem.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano was named to the newly created position of CEO of the IRS on Monday, making him the latest member of the Trump administration to be put in charge of multiple federal agencies.",
      "As IRS CEO, Bisignano will report to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who currently serves as acting commissioner of the IRS, the Treasury Department says. It is unclear whether Bisignano\u2019s newly created role at the IRS will require Senate confirmation.",
      "The Treasury Department said in a statement that Bisignano will be responsible for overseeing all day-to-day IRS operations while also continuing to serve in his role as commissioner of the Social Security Administration.",
      "Bessent said in a statement that the IRS and SSA \u201cshare many of the same technological and customer service goals. This makes Mr. Bisignano a natural choice for this role.\u201d",
      "The move to install Bisignano at the IRS adds another layer to the leadership shuffling that has occurred at the agency since the beginning of Trump's term. Bessent was named acting commissioner in August after Trump removed former U.S. Rep Billy Long from the role less than two months after his confirmation, and made him ambassador to Iceland.",

      "Some flavor crazes flirt with us and fade",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Some flavor crazes flirt with us and fade. Others stay and make themselves at home.",
      "It\u2019s too soon to tell for sure, but the Dubai chocolate movement seems to have put down roots and is spreading at a brisk clip. The sweet flavors and thick texture that have made Dubai chocolate bars a hit are morphing into other kinds of confections too.",
      "Let\u2019s back up for a minute. The original and now-classic Dubai chocolate bar was created by Fix Chocolatier in the United Arab Emirates in 2021, and by 2023 had exploded on social media. Rich and indulgent, it features a thick, milk chocolate shell usually encasing a creamy pistachio (and often tahini) filling mixed with crispy, shredded, phyllo-like pastry called kadayif.",
      "Global brands and small bakers alike are riffing on the concept with different flavors, translating the concept to croissants, milkshakes and more. Fillings range from peanut butter and jelly to s\u2019mores to matcha.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t call this a \u2018trend\u2019 anymore \u2014 it\u2019s a whole new thing,\u201d said Din Allall, whose family business, The Nuts Factory, has about 150 U.S. stores featuring nuts, dried fruits and candies.",
      "He carries 12 flavors of Dubai chocolate bar, as well as chocolate- and pistachio-covered Dubai dates, Dubai-coated roasted nuts, a layered Dubai chocolate strawberry parfait, and a Dubai Golden Chocolate bar infused with edible 24-karat gold for $79.99 (their regular 6.5-ounce bars sell for $18.99).",
      "It's not just the flavors that make Dubai chocolate different, Allall says, but the bar's structure too \u2014 \"huge, thick, with lots of filling.\"",
      "Trader Joe\u2019s carries a Dubai chocolate bar made by Patislove. IHOP introduced a limited-time Dubai pancake stack in some locations in August. Baskin-Robbins has some Dubai-inspired ice cream products on its menu, while Costco sells a range of Dubai chocolate confections, including a Dubai chocolate cake. Walmart and QVC also sell Dubai chocolate.",
      "Swiss chocolate giant Lindt has a bar, and drew crowds when it debuted a limited number of them in Europe last fall.",
      "\u201cFor me, it\u2019s the crunch,\" said Erica Lefkowits, who was buying some Dubai chocolate recently in Dublin. \"The chocolate is soft and melty, and the filling is creamy, and then the crunch of the kadayif. It\u2019s all about the texture. Plus, it\u2019s sugar.\u201d",
      "She was a little annoyed at the price, higher than your average chocolate bar. Part of Dubai chocolate's appeal, though, is the way it feels simultaneously indulgent and worldly. Pistachios, rose, saffron and cardamom bring luxury, travel and exoticism to the chocolate party.",

      "American distillers have gotten a costly cold shoulder from Canada",
      "American distillers have gotten a costly cold shoulder from Canada, where their exports plunged 85% earlier this year \u2014 topping broad declines in key international markets amid global trade tensions, a spirits industry group said Monday.",
      "Even a thaw in trade relations may not shake this hangover right away.",
      "\u201cEven though things have eased up, we still are not back on the shelf in Canada,\u201d said Kentucky craft distiller Tom Bard. \u201cProbably won't be for a good long while.\u201d",
      "The majority of Canadian provinces continue to ban American spirits from shelves, though Canada removed its retaliatory tariff on the products weeks ago, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States said. There's another nagging concern \u2014 that consumer reaction to the trade conflicts could curb the international thirst for American spirits in key markets.",
      "Overall exports of American spirits fell 9% in the second quarter of 2025 compared to a year ago, the council said in its new report. Sharp declines occurred in other crucial markets \u2014 the European Union, United Kingdom and Japan, it said. That comes on the heels of a banner year for U.S. spirits exports in 2024, the council said. Total first-quarter exports in 2025 edged up by 1% from a year ago.",
      "In the ultracompetitive spirits world, the sudden drop-off is a dispiriting development for U.S. distillers.",
      "\"There\u2019s a growing concern that our international consumers are increasingly opting for domestically produced spirits or imports from countries other than the U.S., signaling a shift away from our great American spirits brands,\u201d Chris Swonger, the council\u2019s CEO, said Monday in a release.",
      "Canada remains the only key trading partner that retaliated against U.S. spirits in the latest rounds of trade conflicts spurred by President Donald Trump's tariff policies. The president maintains that open trade cost the U.S. millions of factory jobs and that tariffs are the path to American-made prosperity.",
      "But American distilled spirits have been a high-profile target for retaliation.",
      "Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs on European steel and aluminum spurred the EU to retaliate with a tariff that caused American whiskey exports to the EU to plunge, costing distillers more than $100 million in revenue from 2018 to 2021, the council has said. Once the tariff was suspended, EU sales rebounded for American distillers \u2014 until the latest tensions resurfaced in the first year of Trump's second term.",
      "The Distilled Spirits Council is pressing for free-flowing trade for distilled spirits with zero-for-zero tariffs with key markets, saying it would give American distillers the certainty they need.",
      "Global markets are increasingly vital for producers of American whiskey \u2014 which includes bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and rye whiskey. The sector faces a supply-and-demand crunch in the U.S., where a sales slowdown is coinciding with massive stockpiles of whiskey, the council said.",
      "\u201cWith the slowdown in the U.S. market, it\u2019s more important than ever for American distillers to have reliable access to international markets,\" Swonger said. \"Until these trade issues are fully resolved, many distillers are remaining on the sidelines, fearful that without a permanent return to zero-for-zero tariffs, they could once again face retaliatory tariffs. They simply don\u2019t want to risk jeopardizing the investments they\u2019d need to make to reestablish their presence abroad.\u201d",
      "The most dramatic quarterly drop off in exports occurred in Canada, where U.S. spirits exports fell below $10 million amid the 85% plunge in the April-through-June quarter, the report showed.",

      "The pain was felt across a range of spirits categories, with quarterly declines of 13% for American whiskey, 14% for vodka, 15% for cordials and 12% for brandy, it said.",

Brown-Forman produces such brands as Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey and Woodford Reserve bourbon.",

      "At the start of 2025, their products were sold in British Columbia and Alberta, and they were in talks to expand to other Canadian provinces. The plan was to ship more than 1,000 cases \u2014 mostly bourbon along with flavored whiskeys and cream liqueurs \u2014 north of the border this year, perhaps turning their Canadian business into 15% to 20% of overall sales in 2025.",

      "The stalemate comes at a moment of troubling economic uncertainty. While the U.S. economy has continued to grow this year, hiring has slowed and inflation remains elevated as the Republican president's import taxes have created a series of disruptions for businesses and hurt confidence in his leadership. At the same time, there is a recognition that the nearly $2 trillion annual budget deficit is financially unsustainable.",
      "House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, among those appearing on the Sunday news shows, said there have been no talks with Republican leaders since their White House meeting on Sept. 29. He said since then Republicans, including Trump, \u201chave gone radio silent.\u201d",

That essentially undermines the value of Democrats trying to seek compromises on the budget since the administration could block the spending of money from any deal. The Trump administration sent Congress roughly $4.9 billion in what are called pocket rescissions on foreign aid, a process that meant the money was withheld without time for Congress to weigh in before the previous fiscal year ended last month.",

      "Details of the aid package are unknown, but it would come as the world\u2019s two largest economies have been unable to reach a trade deal and China has halted purchases of U.S. beans. China, the biggest foreign buyer of American soybeans for many years, last bought American beans in May and has not bought any for this harvest season, which began in September.",
      "\u201cThe Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for \u2018negotiating\u2019 reasons only, not buying,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve made so much money on Tariffs, that we are going to take a small portion of that money, and help our Farmers.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be meeting with President Xi, of China, in four weeks, and Soybeans will be a major topic of discussion,\" Trump wrote.",
      "The soybeans that China imports largely for oil extraction and animal feed are an important crop for U.S. agriculture because they are the top U.S. food export, accounting for about 14% of all farm goods sent overseas and China has been buying 25% of all American soybeans in recent years.",
      "U.S. farmers grew $60.7 billion worth of soybeans, or nearly 4.3 billion bushels, in the 2022-2023 marketing year, according to the American Soybean Association. Just over half were exported. Illinois is the top soybean growing state, but Iowa, Nebraska and Minnesota are also large producers.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate that we\u2019re being used as a bargaining chip in this trade war that\u2019s not of our own doing,\u201d Ragland said.",
      "He said time is running low for the two governments to strike a deal, because China has already ordered soybeans from countries such as Brazil and Argentina for deliveries through December and, if there's no soybean deal soon, China could skip the U.S. entirely.",
      "\u201cIf they get another couple months, they\u2019re into new crop soybeans in Brazil and Argentina. And they\u2019re going to bypass us altogether if we\u2019re not careful,\u201d Ragland said.",

Some critics have made parallels between that bubble, which saw the S&P 500 eventually halve in value, and the recent AI bonanza.",
      "It's not just the big household names in the S&P 500 index raising concern.

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed a bill allowing 800,000 Uber and Lyft drivers in the state to join a union and bargain collectively for better wages and benefits",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 More than 800,000 drivers for ride-hailing companies in California will soon be able to join a union and bargain collectively for better wages and benefits under a measure signed Friday by Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "Supporters said the new law will open a path for the largest expansion of private sector collective bargaining rights in the state's history. The legislation is a significant compromise in the yearslong battle between labor unions and tech companies.",
      "California is the second state where Uber and Lyft drivers can unionize as independent contractors. Massachusetts voters passed a ballot referendum in November allowing unionization, while drivers in Illinois and Minnesota are pushing for similar rights.",
      "Newsom announced the signing at an unrelated news conference at University of California, Berkeley. The new law will give drivers \u201cdignity and a say about their future,\u201d he said.",
      "The new law is part of an agreement made in September between Newsom, state lawmakers and the Service Employees International Union, along with rideshare companies Uber and Lyft. In exchange, Newsom also signed a measure supported by Uber and Lyft to significantly cut the companies' insurance requirements for accidents caused by underinsured drivers.",
      "Lyft CEO David Risher said in September that the new insurance rates are expected to save the company $200 million and could help reduce fares.",
      "Uber and Lyft fares in California are consistently higher than in other parts of the U.S. because of insurance requirements, the companies say. Uber has said that nearly one-third of every ride fare in the state goes toward paying for state-mandated insurance.",
      "Labor unions and tech companies have fought for years over drivers' rights. In July of last year, the California Supreme Court ruled that app-based ride-hailing and delivery services like Uber and Lyft can continue treating their drivers as independent contractors not entitled to benefits like overtime pay, paid sick leave and unemployment insurance. A 2019 law mandated that Uber and Lyft provide drivers with benefits, but voters reversed it at the ballot in 2020.",
      "The collective bargaining measure now allows rideshare workers in California to join a union while still being classified as independent contractors and requires gig companies to bargain in good faith. The new law doesn\u2019t apply to drivers for delivery apps like DoorDash.",
      "The insurance measure will reduce the coverage requirement for accidents caused by uninsured or underinsured drivers from $1 million to $60,000 per individual and $300,000 per accident.",
      "The two measures \"together represent a compromise that lowers costs for riders while creating stronger voices for drivers \u2014demonstrating how industry, labor, and lawmakers can work together to deliver real solutions,\u201d Ramona Prieto, head of public policy for California at Uber, said in a statement.",

      "Other drivers said the legislation will provide more job safety and benefits.",
      "Many who support unionization said they have faced a slew of issues, including being \u201cdeactivated\u201d from their apps without an explanation or fair appeals process when a passenger complains.",
      "\u201cDrivers have had no way to fight back against the gig companies taking more and more of the passenger fare, or to challenge unfair deactivations that cost us our livelihoods,\u201d Ana Barragan, a gig driver from Los Angeles, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked long hours, faced disrespect, and had no voice, just silence on the other end of the app. But now, with the right to organize a strong, democratic union, I feel hope.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 From Wall Street trading floors to the Federal Reserve to economists sipping coffee in their home offices, the first Friday morning of the month typically brings a quiet hush around 8:30 a.m. eastern as everyone awaits the Labor Department's crucial monthly jobs report.",
      "But with the government shut down, no information was released Friday about hiring in September.",
      "It's the first time since a government shutdown in 2013 that the jobs report has been delayed. During the 2018-2019 partial government closure, the Labor Department was one of several agencies that remained open because Congress had agreed to fund them. September's jobs figures will be released eventually, once the shutdown ends.",
      "The interruption in the data has occurred at a particularly uncertain time, when policymakers at the Federal Reserve and Wall Street investors would need more data on the economy, rather than less. Hiring has ground nearly to a halt, threatening to drag down the broader economy. Yet at the same time, consumers \u2014 particularly higher-income earners \u2014 are still spending and some businesses are ramping up investments in data centers developing artificial intelligence models. Whether that is enough to revive hiring remains to be seen.",
      "For now, economists are turning to alternative measures of the job market provided by nonprofits and private-sector companies. Those measures mostly show a job market with little hiring, but not many layoffs, either. Those who have jobs appear to be mostly secure, while those looking for work are having a tougher time.",
      "Payroll processor ADP, for example, said Wednesday that its estimate showed the economy had lost a surprising 32,000 private-sector jobs last month. Companies in the construction, manufacturing, and financial services industries all cut jobs, ADP found. Restaurants and hotels, and professional services such as accounting and engineering, also shed workers.",

      "Pepsi has a new challenge: Keeping products like Gatorade and Cheetos vivid and colorful without the artificial dyes that U.S. consumers are increasingly rejecting",
      "VALHALLA, New York -- Pepsi has a new challenge: keeping products like Gatorade and Cheetos vivid and colorful without the artificial dyes that U.S. consumers are increasingly rejecting.",
      "PepsiCo, which also makes Doritos, Cap'n Crunch cereal, Funyuns and Mountain Dew, announced in April that it would accelerate a planned shift to using natural colors in its foods and beverages. Around 40% of its U.S. products now contain synthetic dyes, according to the company.",
      "But just as it took decades for artificial colors to seep into PepsiCo\u2019s products, removing them is likely to be a multi-year process. The company said it\u2019s still finding new ingredients, testing consumers\u2019 responses and waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve natural alternatives. PepsiCo hasn\u2019t committed to meeting the Trump administration\u2019s goal of phasing out petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of 2026.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to launch a product that the consumer\u2019s not going to enjoy,\u201d said Chris Coleman, PepsiCo\u2019s senior director for food research and development in North America. \u201cWe need to make sure the product is right.\u201d",
      "Coleman said it can take two or three years to shift a product from an artificial color to a natural one. PepsiCo has to identify a natural ingredient that will have a stable shelf life and not change a product\u2019s flavor. Then it must ensure the availability of a safe and adequate supply. The company tests prototypes with trained experts and panels of consumers, then makes sure the new formula won\u2019t snag its manufacturing process. It also has to design new packaging.",
      "Tostitos and Lay\u2019s will be the first PepsiCo brands to make the shift, with naturally dyed tortilla and potato chips expected on store shelves later this year and naturally dyed dips due to be on sale early next year. Most of the chips, dips and salsas in the two lines already are naturally colored, but there were some exceptions.",
      "The reddish-brown tint of Tostitos Salsa Verde, for example, came from four synthetic colors: Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 40 and Blue 1. Coleman said the company is switching to carob powder, which gives the chips a similar color, but needed to tweak the recipe to ensure the addition of the cocoa alternative wouldn\u2019t affect the taste.",
      "In its Frito-Lay food labs and test kitchens in Plano, Texas, PepsiCo is experimenting with ingredients like paprika and turmeric to mimic the bright reds and oranges in products like Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos, Coleman said.",
      "The company is looking at purple sweet potatoes and various types of carrots to color drinks like Mountain Dew and Cherry 7Up, according to Damien Browne, the vice president of research and development for PepsiCo\u2019s beverage division based in Valhalla, New York.",
      "Getting the hue right is critical, since many consumers know products like Gatorade by their color and not necessarily their name, Browne said.",
      "\u201cWe eat with our eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at a plate of food, it\u2019s generally the different kinds of colors that will tell you what you would like or not.\u201d",
      "When the Pepsi-Cola Company was founded in 1902, the absence of artificial dyes was a point of pride. The company marketed Pepsi as \u201cThe Original Pure Food Drink\u201d to differentiate the cola from rivals that used lead, arsenic and other toxins as food colorants before the U.S. banned them in 1906.",
      "But synthetic dyes eventually won over food companies. They were vibrant, consistent and cheaper than natural colors. They are also rigorously tested by the FDA.",
      "Still, PepsiCo said it started seeing a small segment of shoppers asking for products without artificial colors or flavors more than two decades ago. In 2002, it launched its Simply line of chips, which offer natural versions of products like Doritos. A dye-free organic Gatorade came out in 2016.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking for those little signals that will become humongous in the future,\u201d Amanda Grzeda, PepsiCo\u2019s senior director of global sensory and consumer experience, said of the company's close attention to consumer preferences.",
      "Grzeda said the whisper PepsiCo detected in the early 2000s has become a roar, fueled by social media and growing consumer interest in ingredients. More than half of the consumers PepsiCo spoke to for a recent internal study said they were trying to reduce their consumption of artificial dyes, Grzeda said.",

In May, the FDA approved three new natural color additives, including a blue color derived from algae. In July, the agency approved gardenia blue, which is derived from a flowering evergreen.",

      "But even if decades of research has shown that synthetic colors are safe, PepsiCo has to weigh public perceptions, Grzeda said.",
      "\u201cWe could just blindly follow the science, but it probably would put us at odds with what our consumers believe and perceive in the world,\u201d she said.",
      "PepsiCo also has to balance the needs of consumers who don\u2019t want their favorite snacks and drinks to change or get more expensive because of the costs of natural dyes. NIQ data shows that unit sales of products advertised as free of artificial colors fell sharply in 2023 as prices rose.",

      "Hopes for a quick end to the government shutdown are fading",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Hopes for a quick end to the government shutdown were fading Friday as Republicans and Democrats dug in for a prolonged fight and President Donald Trump readied plans to unleash layoffs and cuts across the federal government.",
      "Senators were headed back to the Capitol for another vote on government funding on the third day of the shutdown, but there has been no sign of any real progress toward ending their standoff. Democrats are demanding that Congress extend health care benefits, while Republicans are trying to wear them down with day after day of voting on a House-passed bill that would reopen the government temporarily, mostly at current spending levels.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times you\u2019re going to give them a chance to vote no,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune said at a news conference Friday. He added that he would give Democratic senators the weekend to think it over.",
      "Although Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, the Senate's filibuster rules make it necessary for the government funding legislation to gain support from at least 60 of the 100 senators. That's given Democrats a rare opportunity to use their 47 Senate seats to hold out in exchange for policy concessions. The party has chosen to rally on the issue of health care, believing it could be key to their path back to power in Washington.",
      "Their primary demand is that Congress extend tax credits that were boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic for health care plans offered under the Affordable Care Act marketplace.",
      "Standing on the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said, \u201cUnderstand this, over the last few days and over the next few days, what you\u2019re going to see is more than 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, co-pays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits.\u201d",
      "Democrats are running the high-risk strategy of effectively voting for a government shutdown to make their stand. Trump has vowed to make it as painful as possible for them.",
      "The Republican president has called the government funding lapse an \u201cunprecedented opportunity\u201d to make vast cuts to federal agencies and potentially lay off federal workers, rather than the typical practice of furloughing them. White House budget director Russ Vought has already announced that he is withholding billions of dollars for infrastructure projects in states with Democratic senators.",
      "On Friday morning, Vought said he would withhold another $2.1 billion for Chicago infrastructure projects to extend its train system to the city's South Side.",
      "Jeffries has displayed no signs of budging under those threats.",
      "\u201cThe cruelty that they might unleash on everyday Americans using the pretense of a shutdown is only going to backfire against them,\u201d he said during an interview with The Associated Press and other outlets at the Capitol.",
      "Still, the shutdown, no matter how long it lasts, could have far-reaching effects on the economy. Roughly 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and they could lose out on $400 million in daily wages. That loss in wages until after the government reopens could drive down wider demand for goods and services.",

      "\"All around the country right now, real pain is being endured by real people because the Democrats have decided to play politics,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday.",
      "The American public usually spreads the blame around to both major political parties when it comes to a government shutdown. While Trump took a significant portion of the blame during the last partial government shutdown in 2018 as he demanded funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, this standoff could end differently because now it is Democrats making the policy demands.",
      "Still, lawmakers were relentlessly trying to make their case to the American public with a constant beat of news conferences, social media videos and livestreams. Congressional leaders have been especially active.",
      "Both sides expressed confidence that the other would ultimately be found at fault. And in the House, party leaders seemed to be moving farther apart rather than closer to making a deal to end the shutdown.",
      "Jeffries on Thursday called for a permanent extension to the ACA tax credits. Meanwhile, Johnson and Thune told reporters that they would not negotiate on the tax credits until the government is reopened.",
      "A few senators have engaged in bipartisan talks about launching negotiations on extending the ACA tax credits for one year while the Senate votes to reopen the government for several weeks. But those discussions are in their early stages and appear to have little involvement from leadership.",
      "As senators prepared for their last scheduled vote for the week on Friday, they appeared resigned to allow the shutdown to continue at least into next week. Thune said that if the vote failed, he would \u201cgive them the weekend to think about it\u201d before holding more votes.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, in a floor speech, called for Republicans to work with her and fellow Democrats to find \u201ccommon ground\u201d on the ACA subsidies, saying their expiration would impact plenty of people in states with GOP senators \u2014 especially in rural areas where farmers, ranchers and small business owners purchase their own health insurance.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, right now our Republican colleagues are not working with us to find a bipartisan agreement to prevent the government shutdown and address the health care crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that even when they float ideas \u2014 which we surely do appreciate \u2014 in the end the president appears to make the call.\u201d",

      "BOSTON -- BOSTON (AP) \u2014 The Boston Bruins will retire former captain Zdeno Chara\u2019s No. 33 on Jan. 15 prior to their game against Seattle, the team announced Monday.",
      "Chara is set to become the 13th player in franchise history to have his number raised to the rafters and the first since Willie O\u2019Ree in 2022. Chara recently rejoined the organization as a hockey operations adviser and mentor.",
      "\u201cThere will never be another Zdeno Chara,\u201d owner Jeremy Jacobs said. \u201cFrom his skill, size and physical dominance on the ice, to his leadership in the locker room and impact on the Boston community, \u2018Zee\u2019 is a legend of the game.\u201d",
      "Chara captained the Bruins to the Stanley Cup in 2011 as part of his 14-year run in Boston. The 6-foot-9 Slovakian defenseman won the Norris Trophy for being the NHL\u2019s best at his position in 2009 and helped the team reach the final in 2013 and 2019.",
      "\u201cThis honor is greater than anything I could have imagined when I first came to Boston,\u201d said Chara, who joined in 2006 and turned out to be arguably the most impactful unrestricted free agent signing in league history. \u201cI am forever grateful to the Bruins organization for trusting me to lead, to all my teammates past and present, to the fans whose passion and energy made Boston feel like home, and to my family who made everything possible.\u201d",

      "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 It was difficult enough for Josh Allen to watch helplessly on the sideline as New England quarterback Drake Maye marched the Patriots 37 yards to set up Andy Borregales\u2019 decisive 52-yard field goal with 15 seconds left.",
      "What was worse for the Bills' quarterback is knowing how much of a hand he and his teammates played in the 23-20 loss on Sunday night.",
      "As if three turnovers, two by Allen, were not enough: The offense came up short on a final drive that stalled at New England\u2019s 27, leaving Buffalo settling for Matt Prater hitting a game-tying 45-yard field goal with 2:17 left.",
      "\u201cWe just played sloppy,\u201d Allen said. \u201cNot gonna win a football game, turning the ball over three times ... That\u2019s just bad football and we just did not play good tonight.\u201d",
      "In dropping to 4-1, Buffalo joined the Philadelphia Eagles, who lost to Denver, in being the NFL\u2019s final two unbeaten teams to lose on Sunday. The outcome also ended Buffalo's regular-season home winning streak at 14, one short of matching the team record.",
      "And suddenly the five-time defending AFC East champions find themselves in a divisional race that has the upstart Patriots (3-2) on their heels.",
      "\u201cRespect to them. They came in, they knew what they had to do. They took care of the football. We didn\u2019t,\u201d Allen said.",
      "The first sign of trouble came on Buffalo\u2019s opening drive, which ended with Allen losing a fumble on a botched handoff to Dawson Knox at midfield. Two series later, wide receiver Keon Coleman lost a fumble, which the Patriots recovered at Buffalo\u2019s 11.",
      "Credit the Bills' defense for limiting the Patriots to a field goal off the first two turnovers.",
      "The turning point, however, came with Allen\u2019s interception in the third quarter. Trailing 13-10 and facing second-and-13 at New England\u2019s 19, Allen forced a throw over the middle intended for Khalil Shakir, only to have defensive back Marcus Jones jump in front and pick it off.",

      "Adding salt to the wound was having former Bills star receiver Stefon Diggs finish with 10 catches for 146 yards in his first trip back to Buffalo since being traded to Houston in April 2024. It was the type of outing the Bills were accustomed to seeing Diggs perform in a Buffalo uniform during his four-year stint with the team.",
      "The sloppiness was uncharacteristic of a Bills team that had turned the ball over once this season \u2014 Allen throwing an interception in a 31-19 win over New Orleans last week. Before being picked off last week, Allen had committed just one turnover in his previous 12 starts, including playoffs.",
      "The opening-drive turnover came after Buffalo scored touchdowns on the first possession in each of its first four outings this season \u2014 and 12 total, dating to the start of 2024.",
      "The offense struggled overall with New England bottling up Buffalo\u2019s running attack. James Cook was limited to 49 yards rushing and no catches, the first time he\u2019s failed to crack 100 yards from scrimmage this season. Cook also had his franchise-record streak of scoring a touchdown rushing end at eight games.",

Officials initially ruled it a touchdown but a video review showed Demercado didn\u2019t have possession when he entered the end zone.",
      "Instead of increasing Arizona\u2019s 21-6 lead, Demercado\u2019s gaffe kept Tennessee in the game. Teammate Dadrion Taylor-Demerson then gave the Titans a chance to win after he intercepted Cam Ward\u2019s pass but fumbled while falling to the ground in a wild play that resulted in a touchdown for Tennessee. Receiver Tyler Lockett fell on the loose ball in the end zone, cutting the Cardinals\u2019 lead to 21-19 with 4:51 left. Joey Slye made a 29-yard field goal as time expired and the Titans beat the Cardinals to snap a 10-game losing streak.",
      "Last week, Colts receiver Adonai Mitchell committed the same costly miscue, which makes Demercado\u2019s blunder even more inexcusable because it should have been on the forefront of every player\u2019s mind. Mitchell held the ball out as he neared the goal line and lost control of it for a touchback, negating what would have been a spectacular 76-yard touchdown reception against the Los Angeles Rams in a 27-20 loss.",
      "\u201cI just made a mistake. Really no excuse,\u201d Demercado told reporters. \u201cObviously emotional. Big play. I just got to be smarter.\u201d",
      "A penalty flag wasn\u2019t thrown on every big play this week but it seemed that way in several games.",
      "The worst may have been the roughing-the-kicker call on Chargers reserve linebacker Marlowe Wax that wiped out a 57-yard punt return touchdown by Ladd McConkey late in the second quarter. Los Angeles led Washington 10-7 at the time. The penalty allowed the Commanders to retain possession and they ended up with a tying field goal on the drive on the way to a 27-10 win.",

      "The Patriots gave the Bills 30 yards on consecutive plays after taking a 20-10 lead in the fourth quarter. After a roughing-the-passer penalty, James Cook was stopped for a 4-yard loss on an excellent play by Harold Landry. But Joshua Farmer inexplicably drilled him seconds after the whistle. Josh Allen tossed a touchdown pass a few plays later but the Patriots ended up handing Buffalo its first loss, 23-20.",

      "Coach Nick Sirianni and offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo needed to open up the offense, stretch the field and utilize Brown and Smith more.

      "So during that July match in the stadium that will also host the final game of next year's World Cup, Trump and Infantino agreed to get going on holding the draw in the U.S. capital \u2014 namely, the Kennedy Center, another institution that Trump reshaped to his liking.",
      "\u201cDuring that Club World Cup final, there was a real seriousness to well, look, if we\u2019re going to do this, we\u2019ve got to do it now,\u201d Andrew Giuliani, executive director of the White House FIFA task force, told The Associated Press. \u201cThat\u2019s when talks heated up between the president and Mr. Infantino in terms of getting this done.\u201d",
      "The collaboration over the draw, slated for Dec. 5, illustrates the bond that has formed between Trump and Infantino, described by the U.S. president as \u201cprobably the most respected man in sports.\" The relationship will come into even sharper focus as the World Cup approaches, jointly hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada.",
      "Tickets are now open to fans as major questions hang over the tournament, including how welcome visitors from some countries will be in the U.S. amid its immigration crackdown. Even as the White House pledges openness, Trump has added another uncertainty by suggesting he could move games from cities he thinks are unsafe.",
      "Despite his affinity for sports, Trump is known more for his ties to golf and football than soccer. But his awareness of the sport was spurred in part by his youngest son, Barron, who is such a soccer fan that he had a net in the first lady's garden during Trump's first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest only grew when the U.S. won World Cup hosting rights in 2018. Nothing excites Trump like hosting a major event, and Giuliani recalled that, at the time, the president and his aides were almost wistful that he wouldn\u2019t be in the White House when the tournament arrived, assuming he would be well into a post-presidency following an immediate second term.",
      "Shortly after the U.S. was awarded the tournament, Trump hosted Infantino at the White House. Infantino, who was also serving his first term as FIFA president, made an impression by handing Trump red and yellow penalty cards, joking they could be used on the press.",
      "The relationship flourished in 2020 as both men plotted their futures.",
      "During a dinner that January at the global economic summit in Davos, near FIFA's home in Zurich, Infantino called the U.S. president \u201cmy great friend.\u201d Trump, always appreciative of a compliment, responded by inviting Infantino to a White House signing event for the Abraham Accords, which sought to normalize diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab countries.",
      "The ceremony happened as Infantino was aligning FIFA's sporting and commercial ties with Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It followed a pattern of Infantino, much like Trump, cozying up to autocratic leaders.",
      "Infantino appeared to relish public meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin before, during and after that country hosted the 2018 World Cup. Visiting Putin at the Kremlin with a group of soccer greats during the tournament, Infantino said he felt \u201clike a child in a toy shop\u201d in Russia. He collected the Russian Order of Friendship from Putin the following year.",
      "Infantino would later relocate to Doha ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, emerging as a strong defender of the tiny Gulf state that was fiercely criticized for its treatment of the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers needed to build essential stadiums, transport projects and hotels.",
      "As the connection between Trump and Infantino deepened, Joe Biden dashed Trump's hopes of staying in the White House. For the next four years, Infantino's ties to Washington were far more limited. The two leaders had a brief meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022, a fleeting moment FIFA captured with one photo on its website.",
      "Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff also met with Infantino when he traveled for the Women\u2019s World Cup in July 2023.",
      "Preparations for the World Cup under Biden were under the radar by design, according to one senior official for that administration who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Even though the administration had its own World Cup 2026 task force, Biden aides were aware of sensitivities surrounding large gatherings so soon after the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "The Biden White House was also careful not to overtly promote a relationship with FIFA, which had sidelined the U.S. Soccer Federation in its traditional role in coordinating a home World Cup. Instead, it negotiates individually with each of the 11 U.S. host cities on security, ticketing and other matters.",
      "Infantino visited the White House while Biden was president at least once, meeting for about an hour in 2024 with then-national security adviser Jake Sullivan, an avid soccer fan. Biden officials emphasized to Infantino that they wanted to ensure the host cities ultimately benefited from holding World Cup matches and that the U.S.\u2019s human rights values would be respected.",
      "Trump's disappointment about missing out on the World Cup would prove to be unfounded after he was elected to a second, nonconsecutive term last year.",
      "Since that victory, Infantino\u2019s embrace of Trump has been gushing. He promptly congratulated him the day after Election Day, was at Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s South Florida club, during the presidential transition and had a prime seat at his January inauguration. Trump called Infantino a \u201cwinner\u201d in a video played at the Miami draw for the Club World Cup in December, which was attended by daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
      "Meanwhile, FIFA has set up shop at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where Infantino worked last month as world leaders gathered nearby for the annual United Nations General Assembly. Infantino and Trump met again last week in New York, along with first lady Melania Trump, according to the FIFA president's Instagram account.",
      "Infantino has teased the idea of Trump doing the draw himself, which Giuliani called the \u201cMAGA-FIFA World Cup draw.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust like a great opera, there will be high drama,\u201d Giuliani said.",
      "Infantino has had more public appearances with Trump than with any soccer officials from the sport\u2019s heartlands of Europe and South America, according to the FIFA leader's schedule and social media posts. He was late for his own FIFA Congress in Paraguay in May because he was with Trump and the Saudi crown prince in the Middle East, a move seen as disrespectful of his own voters and criticized by Europe\u2019s soccer federations.",
      "During Infantino's most recent appearance at Trump's side in the Oval Office on Aug. 22, he took even some fellow soccer officials by surprise when he gifted a gold replica World Cup trophy to the U.S. president, saying it was \u201cfor winners only.\u201d",
      "That handover was unexpected, according to one senior soccer official who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive dynamics. Even though it was a replica, the moment was still seen as a snub of World Cup tradition because Trump has held onto a trophy that is supposed to belong to the sport as a whole, not an individual person.",
      "A White House official said the trophy remains in the White House\u2019s possession.",
      "No such offer was publicly extended by FIFA to Mexico\u2019s President Claudia Scheinbaum or Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Mark Carney. Infantino has not met with Carney this year and met Sheinbaum for the first time on Aug. 29.",
      "The episode is a reminder of how Infantino can shift with the moment. The man who remarked in Qatar on the eve of the World Cup in November 2022 that \u201ctoday, I feel (like) a migrant worker\u201d \u2014 comments interpreted as solidarity with migrants \u2014 was laughing along with Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier this year as they bantered about migrants being unable to scale the repainted wall on the U.S. southern border.",
      "Infantino has framed his close relationship with Trump as \u201ccrucial\u201d to the success of the World Cup, a massive operation that relies on expansive cooperation with federal, state and local governments. Trump's suggestion that he could move the host cities was a reminder that Infantino is working with a famously impulsive president whose whims could expose FIFA to logistical havoc and legal jeopardy if he followed through.",
      "Even without those threats, those involved with World Cup planning said the tournament's stakes are high because it's the first in a series of global sporting events hosted by the U.S., including the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cThis needs to go well in order to show the world that if you want to have the best sports and entertainment events, you want to have them in the United States,\u201d said Alex Lasry, CEO of the New York/New Jersey host committee. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unusual for a White House to be coordinating and be involved, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unusual for the heads of state and for the president to be excited and to be talking about a mega event coming here.\u201d",

      "Joey Logano has secured the final spot in the next round of the NASCAR playoffs after a dramatic race at Charlotte Motor Speedway",
      "CONCORD, N.C. -- CONCORD, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Joey Logano, winner of two of the last three Cup Series championships, was never part of the conversation of potential elimination from NASCAR playoffs.",
      "At least not until Sunday's race at Charlotte Motor Speedway, where the Team Penske driver found himself struggling most of the race and in a tense battle with Ross Chastain for the final spot in the round of eight.",
      "The two swapped the final transfer spot multiple times as NASCAR prepared to cut the field from 12 drivers to eight ahead of the third round of the playoffs. Chastain was in, then it was Logano, then the two were tied with Logano holding the tie-breaker.",
      "Logano, on fresher tires, worked his way through the field for every point possible. Chastain was nursing old Goodyears and holding off every challenging driver closing quickly in his rearview mirror.",
      "But then came Denny Hamlin, who for the second week in a row played a pivotal role in the finish and the playoff field. A week ago, his hard racing of Bubba Wallace kept Wallace from winning at Kansas Speedway and ultimately led to Wallace being eliminated from the playoffs.",
      "This time it was chasing down Chastain. The two cars had contact, Chastain spun, and crossed the finish line backward in 21st, one spot behind Logano. It was enough to give Logano the final spot in the third round of the playoffs and eliminate Chastain.",
      "An animated Hamlin on pit road complained to his No. 11 crew that he was not made aware of the situation and would not have passed Chastain had he known it would benefit three-time Cup Series champion Logano.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about anything on that last run, I wasn\u2019t very good,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cI saw (Chastain) and I didn\u2019t know anything about anything going on. I didn\u2019t know. I thought I was racing for about 18th. I just wish I knew so I could have been either prepared or made a different decision.\u201d",
      "Shane van Gisbergen, meanwhile, won his fifth consecutive race on a road or street course. Charlotte, called The Roval in this configuration, is a hybrid road course/oval.",
      "The theory headed into Charlotte was that van Gisbergen had the race locked up and the only way a driver below the cutline could save his championship chances was if the New Zealander was beat.",
      "Kyle Larson and Christopher Bell both put tough challenges on van Gisbergen, but van Gisbergen emerged from a car-slamming battle with Larson through the turns with 14 laps remaining and took the lead for good with 11 laps remaining.",
      "That eliminated any shot for Tyler Reddick and Wallace of 23XI Racing, or Austin Cindric of Team Penske, claiming the final playoff position. Chastain of Trackhouse Racing remained in the hunt, though, as Logano couldn't get his Penske Ford running well enough to secure his spot in the playoffs.",
      "\u201cEverybody was telling me how close it was going to be there. We\u2019re still in. We\u2019re still alive, baby,\u201d Logano said as he reveled in a loud chorus of fan booing. \"I knew it was within a point there, and I knew we were going to be tied there at the end and Ross was going to do whatever he had to do to make it happen.",
      "\u201cIf you want drama, the playoffs bring it every time. What an entertaining finish there. We\u2019ve still got a shot.\u201d",
      "It was similar to a year ago when Logano left Charlotte eliminated from the playoffs, only to learn hours later while having dinner with his family that Alex Bowman had been disqualified and Logano was back in the field. He went on to win the Cup Series championship.",
      "\u201cUnforced errors, it's just terrible,\u201d Chastain said of two early race speeding penalties that made him want to \u201cstart the whole day over.\u201d",

      "The eight drivers moving on to the third round of the playoffs are Ryan Blaney and Logano of Penske, Chase Elliott, Larson and William Byron of Hendrick Motorsports, Hamlin, Bell and Chase Briscoe of Joe Gibbs Racing.",

      "Cindric opened Sunday ranked last in the 12-driver playoff field and never had a shot to race for the win that would have prevented his elimination.",
      "He spun early, was hit by another driver in the second stage, and had to go to the garage for lengthy repairs. That made him the first of four drivers eliminated. Team Penske teammates Logano and Blaney, who combined have won the last three Cup titles, advanced into the round of eight.",
      "Chad Knaus, the vice president of competition at Hendrick Motorsports, was named the recipient of the 2025 Smokey Yunick Award ahead of Sunday's race.",

      "Under first-year coordinator Kevin Patullo, every key Eagles offensive player has seen a significant dip in production from last season.",
      "Perhaps spurred by Brown's social media measures and a general malaise from the fan base, the Eagles picked up the pace a bit in the first half Sunday against Denver. They scored 10 points \u2014 which seemed like a 2024 30 \u2014 in the half and stretched the lead to 17-3 headed into the fourth.",

      "Bo Nix and the Broncos instead found their groove and scored 18 points in the quarter to rally to a 21-17 win and send the Eagles to their first loss in 11 games.",
      "As Brown noted, the Eagles were inconsistent \u2014 if not downright bland \u2014 offensively over the first four games under Patullo and that sparked some hand-wringing from 1,000-yard receivers in Brown and Smith. Brown even wrote a cryptic social media post after last week\u2019s win in Tampa Bay that seemed to hint at some unhappiness before clarifying all was good with him in Philly.",
      "Brown and Smith combined for four catches for 34 yards last week. They blew past those totals in the first half alone against the Broncos and both were pivotal players in one of their finest drives of the season.",
      "With the game tied 3-all, Hurts hit Smith on a 52-yard reception to the Denver 26, the longest pass play of the season for the Eagles. Hurts targeted Brown on the next play and the wideout drew a pass interference call that put the ball on the 2.",
      "That extra yard was the difference in a tush push vs. a run-pass option and Hurts had enough time to connect with tight end Dallas Goedert for the touchdown. Goedert has caught a TD pass in three straight games.",

      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi\u2019s discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014 which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",

      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 Mysterious drone flights over the airspace of European Union member countries in recent weeks have alarmed the public and elected officials.",
      "Intrusions into NATO\u2019s airspace, some of them blamed on Russia, reached an unprecedented scale last month. Some European officials described the incidents as Moscow testing NATO\u2019s response, which raised questions about how prepared the alliance is against Russia.",
      "On Sept. 10, a swarm of Russian drones flew into Poland's airspace, forcing NATO aircraft to scramble to intercept them and shoot down some of the devices. It was the first direct encounter between NATO and Moscow since Russia launched its all-out war on Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Days later, NATO jets escorted three Russian warplanes out of Estonia\u2019s airspace.",
      "Since then, flyovers have occurred near airports, military installations and critical infrastructure, among other locations, elsewhere on the continent and prompted European defense ministers to agree to develop a \u201cdrone wall\u201d along their borders to better detect, track and intercept drones violating Europe\u2019s airspace.",
      "Russia has been blamed for some of them, but denies that anything was done on purpose or that it played a role. European authorities haven't released much detail about the drone intrusions, with some not acknowledging the overflights publicly until days later.",
      "Other times, authorities were unable to confirm a report of a sighting. At one point, Danish authorities were flooded with 500 tips of sightings over 24 hours \u2014 some of which turned out to be just stars in the sky.",
      "Countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond in the moment, including weighing whether to allow authorities to shoot the drones down.",
      "Here's what we know about some of the recent drone sightings:",
      "Germany\u2019s Munich Airport reopened Saturday morning after authorities shut it down the night before for the second time in less than 24 hours after two additional drone sightings. Delays were expected to continue throughout Saturday and at least 6,500 passengers were impacted by the overnight closure.",
      "In Denmark, drones flew over Copenhagen Airport on Sept. 22, causing a major disruption to air traffic in and out of Scandinavia's largest airport.",

      "Drones also flew over four smaller Danish airports between Sept. 24 and Sept. 25, including two that serve as military bases. Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said that a \u201cprofessional\u201c actor was likely behind the \u201dsystematic flights.\u201d",
      "In the same time frame, several Danish media outlets reported that one or more drones were seen near or above the Karup Air Base, which is Denmark\u2019s biggest military base.",

      "In Germany, authorities are investigating claims that unidentified drones may have spied on critical infrastructure in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein. Multiple drones were spotted on Sept. 25 over a power plant in the state capital of Kiel, as well as near a university hospital and a shipyard in the port city, according to a Der Spiegel report.",

      "The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, said the H-1B program is a critical pathway to hiring healthcare workers and educators. It drives innovation and economic growth in the U.S., and allows employers to fill jobs in specialized fields, the lawsuit said.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Minnesota regulators voted unanimously Friday to approve an investment group's takeover of a power company over the objections of the state attorney general, big industrial electricity buyers and consumer advocates.",
      "In voting for the takeover of Duluth-based Minnesota, the five members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission said they believe the conditions imposed on the deal will protect the public interest and shield customers from rate increases. Opponents warned that the private equity group is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers.",
      "The approval came as electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests the bills of some residential customers are increasing to subsidize the rapid build-out of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech\u2019s data centers and the boom in artificial intelligence.",

      "Under the planned buyout, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will take over the publicly traded company Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.",
      "The buyout price is $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium, and assuming $2.3 billion in debt. In its petition, Allete told regulators that Minnesota Power\u2019s operations, strategy and values wouldn\u2019t change under BlackRock and that the deal\u2019s cost wouldn't affect electric rates.",

      "Commissioner Audrey Partridge said she started with \u201ca high degree of skepticism and I would say even cynicism,\u201d and \u201cassumed the absolute worst in these investors.\u201d But she said the added safeguards, and the over $100 million that the investors will provide for relief for ratepayers and investments in clean energy, will protect the public interest.",

Little Nightmares III promises more of the same, with one major addition: You can now confront your night terrors with a friend in co-op play. One of you gets a bow and arrow, while the other uses a wrench to fix things or clobber enemies. Britain\u2019s Supermassive Games, the studio that has taken over the series, is known for horror gems like Until Dawn and The Quarry, so don\u2019t expect pleasant dreams.

      "Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology\u2019s volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet\u2019s early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology's volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet's early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania.",
      "And now he is seeing potential signs of the cycle repeating with another transformative technology as a whirlwind of investments and excitement about artificial intelligence has propelled the stock market to new highs.",
      "Chambers took a similarly meteoric ride in his early days running Cisco, which had a market value of about $15 billion in 1995, when networking equipment suddenly became must-have components for the buildup of the internet. The feverish demand briefly turned the firm into the world's most valuable company \u2014 worth $550 billion in March 2000 \u2014 before the investment bubble burst. The crash caused Cisco's stock price to plunge more than 80% during a period that Chambers still recalls as the worst of his career.",
      "Cisco bounced back to deliver consistent financial growth to help establish Chambers as one of Silicon Valley's most respected leaders before he stepped down as CEO in 2015, but company's stock price has never approached the peak it reached a quarter century ago.",
      "While remaining Cisco's chairman emeritus, Chambers is now as fascinated by the AI's transformative powers as he once was by the internet revolution. Only this time he is advising CEOs as a venture capitalist investing in AI startups rather than running a company himself. Chambers, 76, recently discussed the promise and perils of the AI boom with The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "Q: Does the current AI mania remind you of the internet boom of the 1990s?",
      "A: Absolutely. There are a lot of parallels but there are also some spectacular differences. AI is moving at five times the speed and will produce three times the outcomes of the internet age. In the internet age, a startup would develop products for two years and then in year three, they would take that out into the market. Today, AI startups develop the product in a month and sometimes in a week, and then they bring it to market in one or two quarters.",
      "In the internet age, there was an irrational exuberance on a really large scale. In this AI one, there is a lot of tremendous optimism that does indicate a future bubble for certain companies. Is there going to be train wreck? Yes, for those that aren\u2019t able to translate the technology into a sustainable competitive advantage, how are you going to generate revenue after all the money you poured into it?",
      "Q: Do you think AI is going to eliminate a lot of jobs?",
      "A: It happened with the internet. The problem this time is that if I am right about AI moving at five times the speed of the internet, we are going to destroy jobs faster than we can replace them. Will we be able to replace them over time? Yes, but there is going to be a drought while we have to re-educate lots of people.",
      "Q: Does that worry you?",

      "A: It\u2019s the most uncertain time on a global basis, ever. I would argue that this is the new normal. With the speed the market is moving at now, you have to be able to reinvent yourself, which most CEOs and business leaders don\u2019t know how to do, especially with AI.",
      "Q: What\u2019s your view of how Big Tech has been working with President Donald Trump during his second term in office?",

      "Q: How worried are you about China?",
      "A: I think China has full intention to win at the U.S.\u2019s expense. In China, there are no rules, there is no intellectual property, there are no issues about misusing the power. They intend to blow past militarily, economically, and in every other way. I do not view them as a partner, I view them as a serious competitor on all fronts and someone I don\u2019t trust. I think over time people are going to recognize it\u2019s in the U.S.\u2019s best interest and it\u2019s in China\u2019s best interest for us to get along. So go out 10 years, and that\u2019s the most likely outcome. But I think the next five years are going to be really bumpy and dangerous. We should have no illusions that they intend to crush us.",

      "In the wake of Jane Goodall's death, the many scientists and others influenced by her are promising to do their best to carry on her legacy",
      "In her 91 years, Jane Goodall transformed science and humanity's understanding of our closest living relatives on the planet \u2014 chimpanzees and other great apes. Her patient fieldwork and tireless advocacy for conservation inspired generations of future researchers and activists, especially women and young people, around the world.",
      "Her death on Wednesday set off a torrent of tributes for the famed primate researcher, with many people sharing stories of how Goodall and her work inspired their own careers. The tributes also included pledges to honor Goodall\u2019s memory by redoubling efforts to safeguard a planet that sorely needs it.",
      "\u201cJane Goodall is an icon \u2013 because she was the start of so much,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France.",
      "She recalled how many years ago Goodall answered a letter from a young aspiring researcher. \u201cI wrote her a letter asking how to become a primatologist. She sent back a handwritten letter and told me it will be hard, but I should try,\u201d Crockford said. \u201cFor me, she gave me my career.\u201d",
      "Goodall was one of three pioneering young women studying great apes in the 1960s and 1970s who began to revolutionize the way people understood just what was -- and wasn\u2019t -- unique about our own species. Sometimes called the \u201cTri-mates,\u201d Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birut\u00e9 Galdikas spent years documenting the intimate lives of chimpanzees in Tanzania, mountain gorillas in Rwanda, and orangutans in Indonesia, respectively.",
      "The projects they began have produced some of the longest-running studies about animal behavior in the world that are crucial to understanding such long-lived species. \u201cThese animals are like us, slow to mature and reproduce, and living for decades. We are still learning new things about them,\u201d said Tara Stoinski, a primatologist and president of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. \u201cJane and Dian knew each other and learned from each other, and the scientists who continued their work continue to collaborate today.\u201d",
      "Goodall studied chimpanzees \u2014 as a species and as individuals. And she named them: David Greybeard, Flo, Fifi, Goliath. That was highly unconventional at the time, but Goodall\u2019s attention to individuals created space for scientists to observe and record differences in individual behaviors, preferences and even emotions.",
      "Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at St. Andrews University who was inspired by Goodall, recalled how Goodall carefully combined empathy and objectivity. Goodall liked to use a particular phrase, \u201cIf they were human, we would describe them as happy,\u201d or \u201cIf they were human, we would describe them as friends \u2013- these two individuals together,\u201d Hobaiter said. Goodall didn\u2019t project precise feelings onto the chimpanzees, but nor did she deny the capacity of animals besides humans to have emotional lives.",
      "Goodall and her frequent collaborator, evolutionary biologist Marc Bekoff, had just finished the text of a forthcoming children's book, called \u201cEvery Elephant Has a Name,\u201d which will be published around early 2027.",
      "From the late 1980s until her death, Goodall spent less time in the field and more time on the road talking to students, teachers, diplomats, park rangers, presidents and many others around the world. She inspired countless others through her books. Her mission was to inspire action to protect the natural world.",
      "In 1991, she founded an organization called Roots & Shoots that grew to include chapters of young people in dozens of countries.",
      "Stuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist and founder of the nonprofit Saving Nature, recalled when he and Goodall were invited to speak to a congressional hearing about deforestation and extinction. Down the marble halls of the government building, \u201cthere was a huge line of teenage girls and their mothers just waiting to get inside the room to hear Jane speak,\u201d Pimm said Thursday. \u201cShe was mobbed everywhere she went -- she was just this incredible inspiration to people in general, particularly to young women.\u201d",
      "Goodall wanted everyone to find their voice, no matter their age or station, said Zanagee Artis, co-founder of the youth climate movement Zero Hour. \u201cI really appreciated how much Jane valued young people being in the room -- she really fostered intergenerational movement building,\u201d said Artis, who now works for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",

      "What is left now that Goodall is gone is her unending hope, perhaps her greatest legacy.",
      "\u201cShe believed hope was not simply a feeling, but a tool,\u201d Rhett Butler, founder of the nonprofit conservation-news site Mongabay, wrote in his Substack newsletter. \u201cHope, she would tell me, creates agency.\u201d",
      "Goodall\u2019s legacy and life\u2019s work will continue through her family, scientists, her institute and legions of young people around the globe who are working to bridge conservation and humanitarian needs in their own communities, her longtime assistant said Thursday.",
      "That includes Goodall\u2019s son and three grandchildren, who are an important part of the work of the Jane Goodall Institute and in their own endeavors, said Mary Lewis, a vice president at the institute who began working with the famed primatologist in 1990.",
      "Goodall\u2019s son, Hugo van Lawick, works on sustainable housing. He is currently in Rwanda. Grandson Merlin and granddaughter Angelo work with the institute, while grandson Nick is a photographer and filmmaker, Lewis said. \u201cShe has her own family legacy as well as the legacy through her institutes around the world,\u201d said Lewis.",
      "In addition to her famed research center in Tanzania and chimpanzee sanctuaries in other countries, including the Republic of Congo and South Africa, a new cultural center is expected to open in Tanzania late next year. There also are Jane Goodall Institutes in 26 countries, and communities are leading conservation projects in several countries, including an effort in Senegal to save critically endangered Western chimpanzees.",
      "But it is the institute\u2019s youth-led education program called Roots & Shoots that Goodall regarded as her enduring legacy because it is \u201cempowering new generations,\u201d Lewis said.",

      "Portuguese vineyards are harvesting grapes at night to combat rising temperatures",
      "VIMIEIRO, Portugal -- Under a moonlit sky and the glow of headlamps, workers gingerly pluck grape clusters while much of Portugal sleeps.",
      "They harvest in the Alentejo region, sometimes called the \u201cTuscany of Portugal\u201d for its rolling vineyards, olive groves and forests that supply cork for the wines. In this vineyard about a 90-minute drive east of Lisbon, the cool autumn night carries the smell of ripe fruit. The workers' laughter blends with the sound of rustling leaves.",
      "The night harvest is a time-honored practice in viticulture, meant to preserve the freshness of grapes and shield them from the adverse effects of daytime heat, sunlight and oxidation. As summers in Portugal grow longer, hotter and more unpredictable \u2014 in part due to climate change \u2014 the practice has become more common here.",
      "B\u00e1rbara Monteiro, co-owner and manager of the Herdade Da Fonte Santa vineyard said she struggled at first to convince her harvesters to work at night \u2014 midnight to 8 a.m. They began doing so in 2019.",
      "\u201cToday, we can say they actually prefer this schedule, as they can often work almost another day, enjoy the day, and avoid the extreme heat we often experience here,\u201d she said.",
      "The wine harvest in Spain, Italy and Portugal generally takes place between late August and October, with variations based on the region, type of grapes and weather conditions.",
      "Some vineyards have been harvesting at night for years. In parts of Italy, others have for more than a decade. The El Coto de Rioja vineyard in Spain\u2019s famed La Rioja region opts for early morning harvests, beginning at 5 or 6 a.m., according to C\u00e9sar Fern\u00e1ndez, the vineyard's technical director and winemaker.",
      "In Portugal's Alentejo region, daytime temperatures particularly in August can reach 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). At night, they can drop by as much as 20 C (36 F) or more.",
      "Grapes are naturally sensitive to temperature shifts. Warmer weather can make them reach sugar maturity before developing a full flavor and ripeness, leading to higher alcohol levels but less complex wines.

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Federal transportation safety officials told Philadelphia's mass transit agency this week that it should shelve an aging electric railcar model that is heavily used in its regional rail fleet until it figures out how to stop them from catching fire.",
      "The recommendation from the National Transportation Safety Board came after it investigated five fires this year involving the Silverliner IV passenger railcars used by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or SEPTA.",
      "In addition to suspending operation of the Silverliner IV fleet until it can fix the cause, the agency said SEPTA should fast-track the replacement of the Silverliner IV fleet or retrofit cars to meet modern fire safety standards and add systems to give the train crew detailed information on when dynamic brakes or other electrical systems aren't functioning normally.",
      "All five fires forced everyone aboard to evacuate \u2014 in one case, as many as 350 passengers \u2014 with a few minor injuries reported. One railcar was involved in two of the fires, and two other railcars were destroyed, the NTSB said.",
      "SEPTA is one of the nation's largest mass transit agencies, carrying 800,000 daily riders on buses, trolleys and rail.",
      "The recommendation comes at a time when SEPTA and major transit agencies around the U.S. are fighting for more public funding as they struggle with rising costs and lagging ridership.",
      "In its report, the NTSB was critical of SEPTA's maintenance and operating practices.",
      "That, combined with the outdated design of the Silverliner IV railcars, \u201crepresents an immediate and unacceptable safety risk because of the incidence and severity of electrical fires that can spread to occupied compartments,\u201d the NTSB said.",
      "The NTSB traced the fires to different components, including electrical components associated with the train\u2019s propulsion system, the dynamic brakes and a traction motor.",

      "It\u2019s official: AOL\u2019s dial-up internet has taken its last bow",
      "NEW YORK -- It's official: AOL's dial-up internet has taken its last bow.",
      "AOL previously confirmed it would be pulling the plug on Tuesday (Sept. 30) \u2014 writing in a brief update on its support site last month that it \u201croutinely evaluates\" its offerings and had decided to discontinue dial-up, as well as associated software \u201coptimized for older operating systems,\u201d from its plans.",
      "Dial-up is now no longer advertised on AOL's website. As of Wednesday, former company help pages like \u201cconnect to the internet with AOL Dialer\u201d appeared unavailable \u2014 and nostalgic social media users took to the internet to say their final goodbyes.",
      "AOL, formerly America Online, introduced many households to the World Wide Web for the first time when its dial-up service launched decades ago, rising to prominence particularly in the 90s and early 2000s.",
      "The creaky door to the internet was characterized by a once-ubiquitous series of beeps and buzzes heard over the phone line used to connect your computer online \u2014 along with frustrations of being kicked off the web if anyone else at home needed the landline for another call, and an endless bombardment of CDs mailed out by AOL to advertise free trials.",
      "Eventually, broadband and wireless offerings emerged and rose to dominance, doing away with dial-up's quirks for most people accessing the internet today \u2014 but not everyone.",
      "A handful of consumers have continued to rely on internet services connected over telephone lines. In the U.S., according to Census Bureau data, an estimated 163,401 households were using dial-up alone to get online in 2023, representing just over 0.13% of all homes with internet subscriptions nationwide.",

Regardless, the decline of dial-up has been a long time coming. And AOL shutting down its service arrives as other relics of the internet's earlier days continue to disappear.",
      "Microsoft retired video calling service Skype just earlier this year \u2014 as well as Internet Explorer back in 2022. And in 2017, AOL discontinued its Instant Messenger \u2014 a chat platform that was once lauded as the biggest trend in online communication since email when it was founded in 1997, but later struggled to ward off rivals.",
      "AOL itself is far from the dominant internet player it was decades ago \u2014 when, beyond dial-up and IMs, the company also became known for its \u201cYou\u2019ve got mail\u201d catchphrase that greeted users who checked their inboxes, as famously displayed in the 1998 film starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan by the same name.",
      "Before it was America Online, AOL was founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1985. It soon rebranded and hit the public market in 1991. Near the height of the dot-com boom, AOL's market value reached nearly $164 billion in 2000. But tumultuous years followed, and that valuation plummeted as the once-tech pioneer bounced between multiple owners. After a disastrous merger with Time Warner Inc., Verizon acquired AOL \u2014 which later sold AOL, along with Yahoo, to a private equity firm.",
      "AOL now operates under the larger Yahoo name. A spokesperson for Yahoo didn't have any additional statements about the end of AOL's dial-up when reached by The Associated Press on Wednesday \u2014 directing customers to its previous summer announcement.",

      "Their findings, reported Wednesday, are based on observations made by NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft in 2008 during a close and fast flyby of Enceladus. The small moon, one of 274 orbiting Saturn, has long been considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth because of its hidden ocean and plumes of water erupting from cracks near its south pole.",

      "Scientists found some of the same molecules in the fresh grains, confirming they came from the moon\u2019s underground sea, as well as new chemical compounds. The findings were published in Nature Astronomy.",
      "An ice-encapsulated water world barely 310 miles (500 kilometers) across with a rocky core, Enceladus is suspected of having hydrothermal vents on its ocean floor, quite possibly like those in the Arctic.

      "The department's Facebook post has generated more than 500 comments, with many people outraged that police didn't ticket the company. People also wanted to know how police got the car to pull over.",
      "But San Bruno Sgt. Scott Smithmatungol said they can only ticket a human driver or operator for a moving violation, unlike parking tickets that can be left with the vehicle.",

      "President Donald Trump claims his policies have generated $17 trillion in new investments, but the real number is likely much less",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The economic boom promised by President Donald Trump centers on a single number: $17 trillion.",
      "That's the sum of new investments that Trump claims to have generated with his tariffs, income tax cuts and aggressive salesmanship of CEOs, financiers, tech titans, prime ministers, presidents and other rulers. The $17 trillion is supposed to fund new factories, new technologies, more jobs, higher incomes and faster economic growth.",
      "\u201cUnder eight months of Trump, we\u2019ve already secured commitments of $17 trillion coming in,\u201d the president said in a speech last month. \u201cThere\u2019s never been any country that\u2019s done anything like that.\u201d",
      "But based on statements from various companies, foreign countries and the White House's own website, that figure appears to be exaggerated, highly speculative and far higher than the actual sum. The White House website lists total investments at $8.8 trillion, though that figure appears to be padded with some investment commitments made during Joe Biden's presidency.",
      "The White House didn't lay out the math after multiple requests as to how Trump calculated $17 trillion in investment commitments. But the issue goes beyond Trump's hyperbolic talk to his belief that the brute force of tariffs and shaming of companies can deliver economic results, a strategy that could go sideways for him politically if the tough talk fails to translate into more jobs and higher incomes.",
      "Just 37% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a September poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. That's down from a peak of 56% in early 2020 during Trump's first term \u2014 a memory he relied upon when courting voters in last year's election.",
      "Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said the public commitments announced by Trump do represent a \u201cmeaningful increase\u201d \u2014 but one that amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars, not trillions. Even then, that comes with long-term costs as countries might be less inclined to invest with the U.S. after being threatened to do so.",
      "\u201cIt is a national security mistake because you\u2019re turning allies into colonies of a sort \u2014 you\u2019re forcibly extracting from them things that they don\u2019t see as entirely in their interest,\u201d Posen said. \u201cTwisting the arms of governments to then twist the arms of their own businesses is not going to get you the payoff you want.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration is betting that tariffs are an effective tool to prod other countries and international companies to invest in the United States, a big stick that other administrations failed to wield. Trump's pitch to voters is that he will play a role in directly managing the investment commitments made by foreign countries \u2014 and that the allocation of that money starting next year will revive what has been a flagging job market.",
      "\u201cThe difference between hypothetical investments and ground being broken on new factories and facilities is good leadership and sound policy,\" said White House spokesman Kush Desai.",
      "The White House said that Japan will invest $1 trillion, largely at Trump's direction. The European Union will commit $600 billion. The United Arab Emirates made commitments of $1.4 trillion over 10 years. Qatar pledged $1.2 trillion. Saudi Arabia intends to pony up $600 billion, India $500 billion and South Korea $450 billion, among others.",
      "The challenge is the precise terms of those investments have yet to be fully codified and released to the public, and some numbers are under dispute, potentially fuzzy math or, in the case of Qatar, more than five times the annual gross domestic product of the entire country. The White House maintains that Qatar is good for the money because it produces oil.",

There are also concerns that an investment that large without a better way to exchange currencies with the U.S. could hurt South Korea's economy.",
      "\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, these commitments are worth about as much as the paper they\u2019re not written down on,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, who was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Biden White House.",
      "As for the $600 billion committed by European companies, that's based on those businesses having \u201cexpressed interest\u201d and having stated \u201cintentions\u201d to do so through 2029 rather than an overt concession, according to European Union documents.",
      "So far, there has yet to be a notable boost in business investment as a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product. As a share of the overall economy, business investment during the first six months of Trump's presidency has been consistently bouncing around 14%, just as it was before the pandemic.",
      "But economists also note that Trump is double-counting and relying on investments that were initially announced during the Biden administration or investments that were already likely to occur because of the artificial intelligence build out.",
      "For example, the White House lists a $16 billion investment by computer chipmaker Global Foundries. But of that sum, more than $13 billion was announced during the Biden administration and supported by $1.6 billion in grants by the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, as well as other state and federal incentives.",
      "Similarly, the White House is banking on $200 billion being invested by the chipmaker Micron, but at least $120 billion of that was announced during the Biden era.",
      "For their part, White House officials largely credit Trump's tariffs \u2014 like those imposed on Oct. 1 on kitchen cabinets, large trucks and pharmaceutical drugs \u2014 for forcing companies to make investments in the U.S., saying that the risk of additional import taxes if countries and companies fail to deliver on their promises will ensure that the promised cash comes into the economy.",

      "Experts say a food aid program that helps 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money unless the government shutdown ends within two weeks",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A food aid program that helps more than 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money within two weeks unless the government shutdown ends, forcing states to use their own money to keep it afloat or risk it shutting down, experts say.",
      "The $8 billion Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, also known as WIC, provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples that are often out of financial reach for low-income households.",
      "The shutdown, which began Wednesday, coincided with the beginning of a new fiscal year, meaning programs like WIC, which rely on annual infusions from the federal government, are nearly out of money. Currently, the program is being kept afloat by an $150 million contingency fund, but experts say it could run dry quickly.",
      "After that, states could step in to pay for the program and seek reimbursement when a budget finally passes, but not all states say they can afford to do so.",
      "\u201cWe feel good about one to two weeks,\u201d said Ali Hard, policy director for the National WIC Association. \u201cAfter that, we are very worried.\u201d",
      "Taylor Moyer, a mother of three who recently separated from her husband, has been receiving WIC since her first son was born nine years ago. She said the program allowed her to feed her children nutritious food that tends to be pricier than calorie-dense, processed options. It also provided guidance when she struggled to breastfeed and counseled her on how to handle her son's picky eating stage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been times where I have sat back in my house and really wondered how I was going to feed my family,\u201d said Moyer, who works at the LGBT Life Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia. \u201cAnd I went to the store with my WIC card ... I get rice, I got avocados, I got eggs, and I made a balanced meal that was actually good.\u201d",
      "The shutdown came as Democrats and Republicans failed to pass a new spending plan. Democratic lawmakers want to extend tax credits that make health care cheaper for millions of Americans, and they want to reverse deep cuts to Medicaid that were passed earlier this year. They refused to sign on to any spending plan that did not include those provisions.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, blamed Democrats for the shutdown and called them hypocritical because failing to fund the federal government endangers so many health programs.",
      "The WIC program, which has long had bipartisan support, aids those who are pregnant, mothers and children under age 5. Research has tied it to lower infant mortality, healthier birth weights, higher immunization rates and better academic outcomes for children who participate. Nearly half of those who are eligible don't enroll, often because they believe they don't qualify or they can't reach a WIC office.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers want to cut WIC, which is targeted for elimination in Project 2025, the influential policy blueprint authored by the man who's now President Donald Trump\u2019s budget chief. Trump\u2019s budget request and the spending plan backed by House Republicans would not fully fund the program. They also want to cut funding for families to buy fresh fruits and vegetables.",

      "But in Washington state, where a third of babies receive WIC benefits, officials say they do not have the money to keep the program open.",
      "\u201cWashington WIC may be able to sustain benefits for one to two weeks before a federal shutdown would force a full closure of the program,\u201d said Raechel Sims, a spokesperson for the state's Department of Health. \u201cIf the shutdown lasts longer than that, DOH does not have the ability to backfill WIC funding.\u201d",
      "Moyer, the mother from Virginia Beach, warned that ending the program could be catastrophic for recipients.",

      "An Associated Press tally shows U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is spending millions of dollars on TV recruitment ads targeting officers frustrated by local restrictions on immigration enforcement",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is spending millions of dollars on television advertising in select metro areas around the country, an Associated Press tally found, aimed at recruiting local officers frustrated with their cities' restrictions on immigration enforcement into President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts.",
      "\u201cYou took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,\u201d the narrator says, as images of the cities targeted and ICE agents arresting people move across the screen. \u201cBut in sanctuary cities, you\u2019re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.\u201d",
      "The campaign \u2014 airing in more than a dozen cities, including Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta \u2014 is part of ICE\u2019s $30 billion initiative to hire 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year to supercharge deportations. The money is part of the $76.5 billion sought by Trump\u2019s Republican administration for ICE \u2014 a 10-fold increase in its current budget \u2014 as part of the sweeping, multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July.",
      "ICE is already offering bonuses of up to $50,000 for new recruits and other benefits such as tuition reimbursement as it seeks to fast-track hiring.",
      "And while some parts of the federal government are shut down as the result of Congress\u2019 failure to pass a spending measure last week, the ICE ads reflect that the push for mass deportations, the Trump administration\u2019s top priority, is still flush with cash.",
      "The ads open with video of each metro\u2019s familiar skyline and the narrator\u2019s voice announcing, for example, \u201cAttention, Miami law enforcement.\u201d Beyond that, the spots are identical, inviting officers to \u201cjoin ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst. Drug traffickers. Gang members. Predators,\" according to a review of the ads on the ad-tracking service AdImpact.",
      "The 30-second spots began running in mid-September in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Chicago; Denver; New York; Philadelphia; Sacramento, California; Seattle; and Washington, D.C. Adding to the list a week ago: Atlanta; Dallas; El Paso, Texas; Houston; Miami; Salt Lake City; and San Antonio.",
      "As of Friday, total spending on the ads had topped $5.7 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area. However, Atlanta saw the most in the past week, $794,084, according to AdImpact.",
      "It was unclear why ICE targeted those locations and not others. There is no standard definition of what is a sanctuary jurisdiction although it generally refers to cities or states that limit their cooperation with ICE. Some but not all of the cities appear on a Justice Department list of cities that \u201cthat impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.\u201d",
      "Asked in an AP email to explain why specific areas were chosen as advertising targets, Department of Homeland Security officials declined to provide an explanation. Instead, they replied with a Sept. 16 press release, near the beginning of the ad campaign, reporting that it had received more than 150,000 applications and had extended 18,000 tentative job offers.",
      "Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement. ICE has launched immigration crackdowns in both of those cities. Local officials in Chicago have been particularly outspoken against the stepped-up enforcement.",
      "Albuquerque is among the smallest metropolitan areas where the ads are airing, though the city's mayor, Tim Keller, has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration's immigration policy. In July, Keller signed an executive order barring city employees from assisting federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement \u201cunless legally required.\u201d",

      "New York City is trying to deter dangerous \u201csubway surfing\u201d through education programs, but some transportation advocates and lawmakers say it's not enough",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Ka\u2019Von Wooden loved trains. The 15-year-old had an encyclopedic knowledge of New York City\u2019s subway system and dreamed of becoming a train operator.",
      "Instead, on a December morning in 2022, Ka\u2019Von died after he climbed to the roof of a moving J train in Brooklyn and then fell onto the tracks as it headed onto the Williamsburg Bridge.",
      "He is one of more than a dozen New Yorkers, many young boys, who have been killed or badly injured after falling off speeding trains. Other risks include being crushed between the train and tunnel walls and being electrocuted by high-voltage subway tracks. \u201cSubway surfing\u201d dates back a century but it has been fueled by social media.",
      "Early Saturday morning, New York City police found two girls dead \u2014 ages 12 and 13 \u2014 in what apparently was a subway surfing game that turned fatal, authorities said. Metropolitan Transportation Authority President Demetrius Crichlow said in a statement that \"getting on top of a subway car isn\u2019t \u2018surfing\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s suicide.\u201d",
      "Authorities have tried to address the problem with public awareness campaigns \u2014 including a new one featuring Grammy Award-winning rapper Cardi B \u2014 and by deploying drones to catch thrill-seekers in the act. But for some, a more fundamental question is not being addressed: Why are kids like Ka\u2019Von able to climb on top of subway cars in the first place?",
      "\u201cWhen Ka\u2019Von died ... literally two weeks later, another child died. And another one. That makes no sense,\u201d his mother, Y\u2019Vonda Maxwell, told The Associated Press, saying transit and law enforcement officials haven\u2019t done enough. \u201cWhy should my child have not been the end?\u201d",
      "Making trains harder to climb, and train surfers more easy to detect with cameras and sensors, could be part of the solution, some experts say. The MTA, which operates the subway system, has said it is studying the issue. But it has yet to report any broad new rollout of technology or physical barriers that might make it harder for people to get on top of trains.",
      "In June, Crichlow told a news conference to introduce a new public awareness campaign that the MTA was experimenting with pieces of circular rubber tubing designed to prevent a person from being able to climb between two cars to the top of a train.",
      "It was being piloted in between two cars to make sure it would fit into the tight spacing of the tunnels and that it wouldn't break down or harm service or riders, he said.",
      "\u201cSo far the equipment seems to be holding up,\u201d he said.",
      "Six people died surfing subway trains in the city last year, up from five in 2023.",
      "Tyesha Elcock, the MTA worker who operated the train Ka\u2019Von rode the day he died, is among those who thinks more should be done to prevent deaths.",
      "The first sign of trouble that day was when the train\u2019s emergency brake kicked in, she said.",
      "Elcock discovered Ka'Von's body between the train's seventh and eighth cars. A group of sad-faced teens on the train made it clear what had happened. \u201cDid y\u2019all leave your friend back there?\" she asked them.",
      "Elcock said another operator traveling in the opposite direction saw Ka\u2019Von on the train's roof and reported it over a radio. Because of patchy radio service, she said, she didn't get the warning.",
      "But she thinks an even simpler solution could have saved Ka\u2019Von\u2019s life: locking the doors at the ends of subway cars. That would cut off access to the narrow gaps between train cars where subway surfers use handholds to hoist themselves onto the roof.",
      "\u201cLock it when we\u2019re in service so people can\u2019t climb up and be on top of the train,\u201d Elcock said.",
      "The MTA's leaders have said that they looking into possible ways to prevent subway surfing, including engineering solutions, but the agency declined to make any of its safety experts available for an interview.",

But he said that locking doors \u201cbrings its own risk.\u201d Some New Yorkers have complained that locking the passageways between train cars might prevent them from escaping to another part of the train during an emergency.",
      "Under questioning from City Council members and reporters last year, MTA officials ruled out some other physical interventions, including building more barriers to prevent access to tracks, or putting covers over the gaps between train cars to prevent would-be surfers from climbing up.",
      "\u201cListen, you have to be able to do work on top of a train car,\u201d MTA CEO Janno Lieber said at a news conference, adding that you can\u2019t \u201ccover it with barbed wire.\u201d",
      "The MTA has asked social media companies to take down videos glamorizing subway surfing, and reported in June that, in 2025, more than 1,800 videos had been taken down.",
      "It's also promoted public service announcements telling people to \u201cRide inside, stay alive,\" in voices of local teens and, with the city's schools, released a comic-book themed campaign this past summer designed to show the dangers of subway surfing and impact on loved ones.",
      "More than 300,000 New York City school children use the subway to get to and from school each day.",
      "The NYPD reported that arrests of alleged subway surfers rose to 229 last year, up from 135 the year before. Most were boys, with an average age of around 14, according to police. The youngest was 9 years old.",
      "Branislav Dimitrijevic, an engineering professor of the New Jersey Institute of Technology, said retrofitting trains to prevent roof access would be expensive.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many stories in transportation where things can be fixed, but they cost a lot of money. And then you ask the public, \u2019Are you willing to (pay) for us to fix this? But your taxes would go up tremendously.\u2019 And people say \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Dimitrijevic said.",
      "Dimitrijevic suggested the MTA might be able to install cameras and use artificial intelligence to detect riders trying to climb a train. Andrew Albert, a nonvoting member of the MTA board, said he has been asking the agency about the plausibility of physical sensors but hasn\u2019t gotten a response.",
      "The NYPD has patrolled popular subway surfing routes with field response teams and drones, reporting in July that it had used them to make 200 rescues, mostly of teens. But the missions can\u2019t be everywhere at once. They also say they make home visits to the homes of subway surfers they've identified.",
      "Trains in some other cities, such as Hong Kong and Dubai, aren\u2019t easily climbable. They have streamlined bodies, lack handles on the outside and don\u2019t open between cars.",
      "Some rail systems have resorted to extreme tactics to keep people from riding on top of trains. In Indonesia, railway officials once installed hanging metal flails to try and deter passengers from riding atop train cars to avoid overcrowding. They also tried spraying riders with red paint and hitting them with brooms.",
      "The MTA purchased a few new subway cars that don\u2019t have the outdoor gaps exploited by subway surfers, but they represent just a sliver of the number currently in service, and won\u2019t be deployed on lines popular for surfing anytime soon.",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 A federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s administration from deploying the National Guard in Portland, ruling Saturday in a lawsuit brought by the state and city.",
      "U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, issued the order pending further arguments in the suit. She said the relatively small protests the city has seen did not justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.",
      "\u201cThis country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs,\" Immergut wrote. She later continued, \u201cThis historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration late Saturday filed a notice of appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "State and city officials sued to stop the deployment last week, one day after the Trump administration announced that 200 Oregon National Guard troops would be federalized to protect federal buildings. The president called the city \u201cwar-ravaged.\u201d",
      "Oregon officials said that characterization was ludicrous. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in the city has been the site of nightly protests that typically drew a couple dozen people in recent weeks before the deployment was announced.",
      "Generally speaking the president is allowed \u201ca great level of deference\u201d to federalize National Guard troops in situations where regular law enforcement forces are not able to execute the laws of the United States, the judge said, but that has not been the case in Portland.",
      "Plaintiffs were able to show that the demonstrations at the immigration building were not significantly violent or disruptive ahead of the president's order, the judge wrote, and \u201coverall, the protests were small and uneventful.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe President\u2019s determination was simply untethered to the facts,\u201d Immergut wrote.",
      "Following the ruling, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that \u201cPresident Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement \u2014 we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.\u201d",
      "Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield called the ruling \u201ca healthy check on the president.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt reaffirms what we already knew: Portland is not the president\u2019s war-torn fantasy. Our city is not ravaged, and there is no rebellion,\u201d Rayfield said in a statement. He added: \u201cMembers of the Oregon National Guard are not a tool for him to use in his political theater.\u201d",

      "The push to detain new adults is yet another battle over one of the most sensitive issues in President Donald Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration agenda \u2014 how to treat children who cross the border unaccompanied by adults.",
      "The Associated Press reported Friday that officials are offering migrant children age 14 and older $2,500 to voluntarily return to their home countries. Last month a separate federal judge blocked attempts to immediately deport Guatemalan migrant children who came to the U.S. alone back to their home country. Some children had been put on board planes in that late-night operation before a judge blocked it.",

      "Unaccompanied children are held in shelters run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which isn't part of ICE.

      "BURLINGTON, Vt. -- BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) \u2014 As a Greek immigrant who came to the United States in 1956, Nectar Rorris never imagined the Vermont restaurant and music club he opened 50 years ago would become synonymous with Phish, but he credits the jam band with giving Nectar\u2019s a national spotlight and making it a place sought out by local and traveling musicians alike.",
      "\u201cPhish made Nectar's,\u201d the 86-year-old Rorris said recently.",
      "Phish meanwhile credits Rorris with their early success, giving them a stage to experiment on when they were starting out in the early '80s.",
      "But now, the iconic Burlington venue that fostered a community of diverse artists has closed its doors, despite negotiations to keep the music going.",
      "Nectar\u2019s announced it was taking a pause in June, citing \u201cimmense challenges affecting both downtown Burlington and the local live music and entertainment scene.\u201d Several weeks later, the venue announced on social media that it was closing for good. The post immediately drew hundreds of comments and tributes from musicians, former employees and fans.",
      "\u201cAs a musician, you want to move up. You get a few fans; you go to a bigger club. That\u2019s what Nectar\u2019s was,\u201d said Chris Farnsworth, who covers Burlington\u2019s music scene for the Vermont newspaper Seven Days.",
      "Farnsworth noted that the venue \u2014 a brick building with a neon sign \u2014 \u201cholds a very important place\u201d in Phish lore. The band's 1992 record was titled \u201cA Picture of Nectar\u201d as a tribute to the venue and to Rorris, who gave the fledgling band a residency for nearly two years.",
      "\u201cThe guys from Phish were very good to us,\u201d said Alex Budney, who started at Nectar\u2019s in 2001 as a cook when he was 19, making their famous gravy fries and later working almost every job in the building over 20 years.",
      "\u201cMy college band would play there on Monday nights and it would be like nobody there. But the keyboard player from Phish would come down in a snowstorm and sit at the bar and watch us play and talk to us,\u201d Budney said.",
      "Phish bassist Mike Gordon, who still lives in the area, even popped in during singer-songwriter Maggie Rose\u2019s sound check last September and joined her band for two songs that night. Rose had rerouted her tour just to be able to play at Nectar\u2019s.",
      "\u201cIt was the perfect excuse to go to this legendary venue in this amazing, creative, artistic town,\u201d said Rose. \u201cThe lore of Nectar\u2019s did not disappoint. It truly was just one of those surreal moments.\u201d",

      "In the beginning, Rorris focused solely on the restaurant, leaving the music booking and finances to his partners. Eventually, his partners wanted to move on, so the three sold the business to a new owner who only lasted six months. Rorris decided to buy the business back and ran it by himself until 2003, when he decided to sell for personal reasons.",
      "\u201cThe bands were real thrilled to see that I was taking it back and that I was going to hire them back,\" he said. \"From then, it took off.\u201d",
      "Though Phish made Nectar\u2019s famous, the venue also hosted such artists as Vermont\u2019s own Grace Potter and Anais Mitchell, B.B. King, Spacehog, Blind Melon and the Decemberists. And it was known for regular music series including Metal Mondays; Dead Set Tuesdays \u2014 a tribute to The Grateful Dead; blues, jazz and reggae nights; comedy shows and Sunday Night Mass, a production showcasing electronic artists from around the world.",
      "Nectar\u2019s ownership and management changed repeatedly, but it remained a place to discover new music. Budney said Nectar's supported emerging artists with residency opportunities to play weekly for a month or more and build a fan base.",

      "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is convening Saturday for its twice-annual general conference at a pivotal moment in its history",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is convening Saturday for its twice-annual general conference at a pivotal moment in its history: just days after the death of its oldest-ever president and a deadly attack on a congregation in Michigan.",
      "The death of President Russell M. Nelson leaves a void, but the church has a well-defined leadership hierarchy that helps ensure a smooth transition. Dallin H. Oaks, the man set to succeed Nelson, has already played a prominent role in church leadership as one of Nelson's two top counselors. Oaks' expected ascension to the presidency is likely to be announced after Nelson's funeral, scheduled for Tuesday, a couple of days after the conference when about 100,000 members gather at the church's headquarters in Utah.",
      "The 200-year-old denomination known widely as the Mormon church has not held a general conference without a president for at least a century, but there's no leadership vacuum, said Patrick Mason, a professor of religious studies and history at Utah State University.",
      "A governing body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, headed by Oaks, is leading the church and its more than 17 million members worldwide in the absence of a president, much like Brigham Young\u2019s role for more than two years following church founder Joseph Smith\u2019s death in 1844.",
      "In the 19th century, it was common for a couple years to pass before a new president was named. The Quorum again led the church for lengthy periods after Young's death in 1877 and John Taylor's death in 1887.",
      "The last time a church president died just before a general conference was in April 1951, with the death of George Albert Smith. His funeral was folded into the conference and a new president was formally announced during the gathering.",
      "Today, it is not uncommon for a living president to miss a conference for health reasons, especially given their ages. At 93, Oaks will be among the oldest presidents. Seven of the past nine have served into their nineties, including five beyond Oaks\u2019 current age. Nelson lived to be 101.",
      "Nelson's absence is expected to be felt as thousands gather in person this weekend and many more tune in remotely from around the world. The two-day conference features sermons and serves as a unifying time for the faith\u2019s global membership. Church officials often address major issues of the moment while leaving some room for members to interpret religious doctrine for themselves.",
      "\u201cI think Nelson\u2019s shadow will hang heavy over the conference,\u201d said Matthew Bowman, an expert on U.S. religious history at Claremont Graduate University.",
      "The president \u2014 considered a prophet by members \u2014 traditionally speaks at general conference, and it is considered an event highlight during which new initiatives and policies have been announced. Nelson often used the time to announce the construction of new temples, one of his main enterprises as president. He was charismatic, sentimental and frequently quoted by other conference speakers, which Bowman expects will continue this weekend as they honor his legacy.",
      "In addition to Nelson's death, the faithful have been reeling from the attack on one of their congregations in Michigan last weekend. Four people were killed inside a church in Grand Blanc Township after a gunman rammed his pickup truck into the house of worship, shot at congregants and set a fire that destroyed a lot of the building. The gunman, who was killed by police, was described by friends as having a grudge against the church.",

      "Experts do not expect this conference to look all that different, but they will be watching closely to see what Oaks says. At past conferences, he has been the most likely to address political issues, Bowman said.",
      "Oaks, a former Utah Supreme Court justice, is known for his jurist sensibilities and traditionalist convictions on marriage and religious freedom. He has been a driving force in the church against same-sex marriage and in upholding a teaching that homosexuality is a sin, creating anxiety among LGBTQ+ members and their allies.",
      "Oaks also has been outspoken about maintaining civil discourse and denouncing violence, which could again be a focus this weekend.",
      "\u201cEven before the recent shooting, I would not have been surprised to see him address either issues of religious freedom or of civility,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cBut now, given the new responsibilities approaching him, I might expect him to take a longer view and speak to more broad issues of Christianity, eternity and so on.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"You have to admit, I've been misunderstood,\" said singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam. \"Even when I wrote 'Foreigner,' I started with the words, There are no words I can use because the meaning still leaves for you to choose. And so, the artist, to try and explain himself, has got to work a bit harder.\"",
      "In a way, music was a by-product of a lifelong search, says Islam (also known as Cat Stevens), who met with us backstage in London.",
      "I asked, \"Do you get something out of playing on stage that you don't, playing alone?\"",
      "\"I get scared,\" he replied. \"A lot of human beings out there!\"",
      "But this musical giant who got his start in the 1960s, and is now in his late 70s, can still move a crowd.",
      "Nicole Perry Ellis came to London's Hyde Park with her daughter Natasha to attend a Yusuf concert. She described it as a \"very emotional moment. Because before [Natasha] was born, we used to listen to the music when I was pregnant.\"",
      "Natasha described Yusuf as timeless: \"He has spirit, he has soul, and it transcends.\"",
      "\"I think my songs have always been kind of profound in some way,\" Yusuf said. \"A lot of them are so relevant to the world today. I mean, 'Wild World'? You know, come on! And 'Peace Train,' waiting for the train to arrive. Boy, do we need it, yeah. I mean they're relevant.\"",
      "His core themes have endured, as his name has gone through its evolutions. \"I had a girlfriend who looked at me one day and said, 'Ooh, you look like a cat.' And I went, 'What?' That stuck. And then I was looking for a name, because it was going to be difficult to go into the record store and ask for, like, Stephen Demetre Georgiou's latest album.\"",
      "\"Do you think you would have been as successful as Stephen Demetre Georgiou?\" I asked.",
      "\"There's no \u2026 you can't play with fate,\" he replied.",

      "He writes that reaching superstardom in his teens was quite difficult. \"The problem with success is that it kind of detaches you from reality in some sense,\" he said. \"Who are you? Are you that person on the screen, on the stage, or is there something more to you? I was looking for some big answers.\"",
      "I asked, \"What all did you try, spiritually?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, the bookshop is full of lots of different views of life and beliefs and philosophies, so I was digging around everywhere. I think the most important thing was when I finally reached the Quran at the end. And that just brought everything together.\"",
      "He took the name Yusuf Islam, and \u2013 believing that music was haram, or forbidden \u2013 redirected his royalties to fund his charity efforts, auctioned off instruments, focused on family, and for nearly 30 years left music.",
      "Why did he believe music was forbidden? \"It took me time to realize that a lot of what I was told in the beginning when I became a Muslim was not exactly right,\" he said. \"You know, Islam doesn't forbid anything that's healthy and morally good.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you reconcile the you who put that aside, with the you who embraced music again?\"",
      "\"You go through stages,\" Yusuf said. \"At one time you can fall in love, and next time you're having such an argument with a person, you say, 'What the hell, get out of my life!' You know, you change, your attitude changes according to circumstance. Context is key.\"",
      "He provides context to a controversial chapter regarding Salman Rushdie's novel \"The Satanic Verses,\" which inflamed the Muslim world \u2013 and the fatwa calling for the author's death. In 1989, in an appearance on a British TV program where hypothetical questions were posed, he was asked if he'd attend an effigy burning of Rushdie, to which he replied, \"I would have hoped that it would have been the real thing, but actually no, if it's just an effigy I don't think I would be that moved to go there.\"",
      "\"I mean, I've got a British sense of humor,\" Yusuf said. \"I took it in a kind of slightly comical direction. It wasn't a good thing to do, because nobody laughed. So, you know, I kind of, I made a mistake in thinking that people might get the joke. But it was a serious issue, so I shouldn't have really done that.\"",
      "\"The joke you mean, saying preferred the real thing, not the effigy?\"",
      "\"Whatever, whatever, whatever.\"",
      "\"When you saw the headlines after that, do you worry even today that \u2013 \"",
      "\"Let's get off this subject, please,\" Yusuf said.",
      "\"You bring it up in the book, so it seems \u2013 \"",
      "\"No, it was only a little part of the book.\"",
      "I said, \"But it seems like with this book you partially wanted to set the record straight from your perspective.\"",
      "\"That's right,\" Yusuf replied. \"I think I've done that.\"",
      "I asked, \"How is it to sit down and write something so personal, to go through the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful?\"",
      "\"I left quite a lot of the ugly out, actually, to be honest!\"",
      "\"You were hard on yourself.\"",
      "\"Really? That's nice to know. I tried to be honest in my writing of songs, and in the writing of my book.\"",
      "This singer-songwriter who once gave up fame for faith has now found his balance, performing as Yusuf/Cat Stevens.",
      "Asked how it is to be performing using both names, Yusuf/Cat Stevens replied, \"Actually, it's very symbolic in a way, because for a long time what I wanted to do was to separate myself in a way from my past, and I did that. So, joining these two names together actually forms the complete picture of, like, who I am. And you just have to listen to the songs. They're biographical in themselves. I didn't have to write a book, actually. You just buy the records, you know?\"",

At the time, I never intended to retire from anything. I chose to stop doing one kind of work so that I could perhaps concentrate on a different kind of work.\"",

For some reason that pertains to his past, he's kind of separated himself and banished himself to this isolated place.\"",

      "\"It's not that we never got to see him,\" said Daniel. \"He was a good man. But my only conversations that I remember having with him [was] when I was in trouble, which I was frequently for all kinds of different things. That's my memory of it. It may be a distorted memory.\"",
      "In 1968, his father was named poet laureate of the United Kingdom, and Daniel was sent to boarding school at 11. \"I felt like I was at sea,\" he said. \"I had no friends. I was being bullied. I was scrappy, but in that place you're considered to be, like, just outrageously uncivilized if you took a swipe at someone, which I did now and then.\"",
      "Despite pleading, he was left to tough it out: \"It was my father's decision. He believed I should stay there, and that I would feel a sense of defeat if I left. But I don't think, because he didn't really see me, he didn't understand the degree to which I was already defeated.\"",
      "And yet, boarding school is where he found his life's work. \"I did a few little bits and pieces in school plays,\" he said. \"And it wasn't the magic of the theater for me; it was the alternative world, where everything around me seemed fairly dark. That was a place that was illuminated for me.\"",
      "But stardom came with a darker side, as he was forewarned by the head of a prestigious summer theater program for teens 50 years ago. \"He launched into a kind of cautionary tale about the world of professional acting and the theater, about the sleaze and the corruption, and I was really quite na\u00efve at that time. But something about what he said that day stayed with me. I never wondered about the work, but I began to wonder about the world that I was going into. And so, I did reach a crossroads where I wondered whether perhaps I'd become a cabinet maker, a furniture maker, instead.\"",
      "He seems to have found a comfortable place at the crossroad in \"Anemone\":\u00a0 a reluctant father on film, and devoted father off-camera.",
      "\"Anemone\" is the culmination of a yearslong father-son collaboration.",
      "I asked Ronan about the trust and confidence implied in that collaboration. \"Yeah, yeah, he never implied that that was a big deal,\" he replied. \"But I always felt that incredible sense of pressure, not wanting to let him down. I felt that actually probably more deeply than the kind of external pressure of how the film might be received, or the expectations that come with his, you know, comeback.\"",
      "An unexpected return eagerly awaited. Yet, Daniel Day-Lewis is muted in his expectations: \"We don't last long. Film sometimes can have a long life, and I suppose you can't help hoping that something of your work will be significant to a person in times to come. But there's, yeah, no guarantee of that.\"",

    "summary": "The \"Hannah Montana\" actress-turned-Grammy-winning pop star talks about her album \"Something Beautiful,\" sobriety, and reconnecting with her dad through music.",
    "story": [
      "Miley Cyrus has been in the public eye for most of her life, and while you might know her music, don't think you really know her.",
      "Asked what it's like to go through life and have strangers think they know her, Cyrus replied, \"I love my life, so I don't ever really have \u2013 I haven't made too much of a list of the things that are negative about it, 'cause there's so many great things. But I would say one of the things that I don't love and don't appreciate so much is when you meet somebody and they go, 'Wow, you're like, so cool. You're so smart. You're nothing like I thought you would be.' So yeah, that's a tough one.\"",
      "Her ninth album might not be what you'd expect, either. In \"Something Beautiful,\" Cyrus stretches herself artistically. As one critic put it, the album takes her from pop princess to legacy artist. That's quite a leap, even for someone with music in their blood.",
      "Miley's mom, Tish Cyrus Purcell, is a producer. Dad is country star Billy Ray Cyrus. Her godmother? Dolly Parton.",
      "Miley Cyrus lived with showbiz royalty, and that raspy voice, all her life: \"I've sounded like this since I was little. My dad used to have all the country singers come over to the house, and George Jones would, you know, joke that I had smoked cigarettes or been up all night, you know, even when I was four years old.\"",
      "At age 13, she was suddenly famous after being cast as \"Hannah Montana,\" in the Disney Channel series about a girl who was a typical teen by day and a pop star by night. It's a role she's still proud of: \"I love her. She's everything. I would have nothing, none of this \u2013 I mean, maybe I could've figured it out, maybe I could've gotten myself from Nashville, Tennessee, to Los Angeles. I don't know. But she did it a lot faster, and better, and set me up for the life that I have now. So love her, gratitude, all of that.\"",
      "The years after \"Hannah Montana\" were a bit less wholesome. Her 2013 MTV Music Video Awards performance was met with shock and outrage, especially among moms of young kids who had grown up watching her as a Disney star.",
      "I asked, \"There were moms that were trying to, I guess, cancel you?\"",
      "\"Yeah. I was the first person to maybe ever be canceled, I guess.\"",
      "\"How would you describe that time in your life?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, I didn't know until I was older actually how brutal it really was,\" Cyrus said. \"It was very, I guess, you know, challenging for other people. But for me it was a good time. It looked fun, and it was fun.\"",
      "Eventually it was all a little too much fun. Cyrus says she's been sober for a few years now.",
      "\"How has sobriety affected you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, I like showing up 100%, 100% of the time,\" Cyrus replied. \"The hardest part about balancing, you know, any sort of substance use or drinking when you want to do what I do is you're going, 'Okay, well, now I have to get sober for this thing, 'cause I wanna show up my best.' And now, I get to trim out so much of the preparation of getting yourself into the right place mentally and physically. I'm just always ready.\"",
      "Something she was ready for: \"Flowers,\" the biggest pop single of 2023, and her biggest record to date.",
      "She was also ready for this: Her first two Grammys, for best pop solo performance and record of the year, for \"Flowers.\" Accepting the Grammy she said, \"This award is amazing, but I hope it doesn't change anything, because my life was beautiful yesterday.\"",
      "For Miley Cyrus, today is looking good as well.",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" joined her this summer at L.A.'s Million Dollar Theatre, where she was shooting a music video for the deluxe version of \"Something Beautiful.\" The song is \"Secrets,\" and if you think it sounds a bit like Fleetwood Mac, you're right: you can hear drummer Mick Fleetwood and guitarist Lindsey Buckingham on the track.",
      "Miley sings about a white flag of surrender, and her outfit is basically a white flag in itself. She told us the song is meant as a peace offering to her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus. They'd been estranged since her parents' divorce in 2022.",
      "Asked how he reacted when she gave him the song, Miley replied, \"My dad cried. You know, you don't see your dad cry a lot. But with me and my dad, we just have always communicated better through music with each other.\"",
      "\"And you're at peace now with each other?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "And at 32, it seems Miley Cyrus is at peace with herself.",
      "\"I think the authentic joy of doing what I want to do has always eclipsed the negatives for me,\" she said. \"I feel really good. And I really like who I am, and I like what I'm doing with my life. And I think if I was outside of myself, I would want to be a part of what I'm doing in any way that I could be. 'Cause I think what I'm doing is cool. So, that actually feels good. I like what I do. I like who I am.\"",

      "Swift is the only female musical artist in history to sell more than 100 million albums. Her newest album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" created a frenzy when it was released Friday.",
      "\"In terms of a business person, Taylor is at the top,\" said Kevin Evers, author of the new book \"There's Nothing Like This: The Strategic Genius of Taylor Swift,\" and a senior editor at the Harvard Business Review. \"She's always been extremely business savvy, and we can see this with this release, too.\"",

      "\"So if you look at all the album variants, and all this new stuff that she's doing around this album, she's really trying to give her fans as much value as possible,\" Evers said.",

      "\"This album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and, and vibrant,\" Swift said on the podcast.",
      "Since then, countdowns on her website appeared for limited edition vinyl records, CDs and cardigans, all of which sold out within minutes. \u00a0 \"I mean, she's definitely going to make a lot of money from this album, and she's not shy about that,\" Evers said. \"But at the same time, the reason why all these strategies are working is because her fans are actively engaged.\"",
      "Fans are flocking to see her film, \"Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl,\" which is in theaters this weekend only.",
      "The album became Spotify's most streamed album in a single day this year. The company said it only took 11 hours to hit that mark.  \"Streaming really does not create a lot of money for artists,\" Evers explained. \"Yes, Taylor Swift is making millions of dollars on streaming, but she's making much more on merch and the vinyl variants.\"",
      "Some tracks seem to reveal new tidbits of her love story with Kelce, a key player in the album's rollout. It is giving her dedicated fans a look at a new, happier chapter of her life off-stage, and a peek into the future of what could come next.",

      "Through her groundbreaking observations while living among chimpanzees in the jungles of Tanzania, anthropologist and conservationist Jane Goodall (April 3, 1934-Oct. 1, 2025) transformed the study of the animal world after witnessing chimps fashioning and using tools, which at the time was believed to be unique to humans. Her field research also documented the distinct personalities of the chimps she studied. Through her books, articles, documentary films and public appearances over six decades, Goodall changed how the world perceived homo sapien's closest relative in all their emotional and social complexity.",
      "Her fascination with animals began in childhood, spending hours in a tree reading \"Tarzan.\" \"There was no TV back then,\" Goodall told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2021. \"That's when my dream began. I'll go to Africa, live with animals, write books about them. That was it. No intention of being a scientist, because girls didn't do that sort of thing.\"",
      "Working in Nairobi as an assistant to Louis Leakey, the paleoanthropologist raised money for Goodall to spend six months studying chimpanzees in the Gombe rain forest in Tanzania bringing her \"fresh pair of eyes and fiery spirit,\" she said. \"I clearly was passionate. I clearly had an understanding of animals. And he felt that women might be better in the field, that we might be more patient. Also, he wanted somebody who hadn't been to college, so he wanted an unbiased mind.\"",
      "Living among the chimpanzees, she eventually gained the animals' trust. She witnessed chimps fashioning and using tools \u2014 using twigs to fish for termites. She also detected chimps having distinct personalities and share \"human\" emotions, like pleasure, sadness and fear. She documented the bond between mother and child, and sibling rivalry. \"A lot of people refused to believe it,\" Goodall said. \"Why should they believe this young girl? She hadn't even been to college!\"",
      "But National Geographic sent cameraman Hugo van Lawick, and his film corroborated her findings. He also photographed Goodall \u2014 and became her husband.",
      "She later founded the Jane Goodall Institute, and devoted decades of her life to education about and advocacy for protecting the environment. She gave lectures and toured; she was typically on the road 300 days a year, and was in California on a speaking tour when she died.",
      "Four years ago, Goodall was asked by \"Sunday Morning\" why she persisted in such a grueling schedule. \"Because there's a message to get out, and I'm getting older, and there's less time left ahead of me, and the world's falling to pieces,\" she replied. \"Everybody can do something. I mean, when you go shopping you can ask yourself, 'Hmm, did this product harm the environment when it was made? Was it cruel to animals? Is it cheap?\u00a0Why\u00a0is it cheap? Is it cheap because of unfair wages? \u2026 If they care about the future, especially if they've got children, you don't have to do it all. You know, even if you just pick one thing, like eating less meat. Just do\u00a0something.\""

Bogart and others would find themselves accused of Communist sympathies and would express surprise when a handful of the Hollywood Ten, including screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, turned out to have been Communist Party members at one time or another.",
      "By the following year, Bogart had published an essay in Photoplay magazine entitled \"I'm No Communist,\" in which he confided that \"actors and actresses always go overboard about things\" and warned against being \"used as dupes by Commie organizations.\" Trumbo and others in the Hollywood Ten would be jailed for refusing to cooperate with Congress and found themselves among many to be blacklisted through the end of the 1950s and beyond.",

      "Doctors are warning of a food trend inspired by the popular Netflix movie \"KPop Demon Hunters\" that is leading to serious burn injuries.",
      "The trend involves children and teens imitating a scene from the hit streaming movie by eating hot instant noodles, but doctors say it has become dangerous.",
      "Injuries are coming from both the temperature of the noodles and hot water being spilled, Dr. Colleen Ryan, a burn care specialist at Shriners Children's Boston and Harvard Medical School surgery professor, told CBS News.",
      "\"Most of the time, it's when the children open the microwave themselves. Microwave is usually up high, and they reach in and it's a little too hot for them,\" she said, adding the clinic has been seeing two to three burn cases a week from the trend.",
      "Not only is a burn painful, but they can leave a lifelong scar and cause emotional distress, Ryan said.",
      "The American Burn Association says a scalding injury for adults can occur after contact with 155 degree water for one second, but children's skin is thinner, making it easier to burn. A recent study at the University of Chicago found 31% of childhood scald admissions were caused by instant noodles.",
      "Ryan said post-burn first aid is important.",
      "\"20 minutes of cool water,\" she advised. \"Then you need to call for help.\"",
      "Ryan added she's seeing a wide range of ages among kids coming in with burns from the noodles. When it comes to these viral trends, research shows the most impressionable age range is 8 to 10.",

    "summary": "Nobel Prize committee chair says discoveries by the trio of researchers were \"decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions.\"",
    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",
      "\"Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\" said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",
      "The award is the first of the 2025 Nobel Prize announcements and was announced by a panel at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.",
      "Nobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics Oct. 13.",
      "The award ceremony will be held Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who founded the prizes. Nobel was a wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite. He died in 1896.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Oct 2025 12:31:05 -0400",
    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "The dispute at the heart of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown\u00a0centers around a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit. A new Oct. 3 survey from health information group KFF found that three-quarters of those polled say they want Congress to extend the tax credits, with about 59% of Republicans saying they would like to see an extension.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

      "Pfizer is the first of many drug makers the president claimed has agreed to offer steep drug discounts to all Americans through TrumpRx, in line with the lowest prices paid by Europeans.",
      "\"We've seen this disparity for a long time, and we know it has not been sustainable,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary told CBS News in an interview Thursday.",
      "The president also said that Pfizer had agreed to lower the cost of the prescription medications that it provides to Medicaid recipients.",
      "\"Pfizer is committing to offer all of their prescription medications to Medicaid, and it will be at the most-favored nations prices,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Makary argues the Trump administration's agreement with Pfizer will help in addressing health care costs across the board.",
      "\"By reigning in egregious drug prices, we're actually addressing the larger issue of healthcare costs in the United States, which is something no one has really be able to get a handle on until now,\" Makary said.",
      "According to Pfizer, TrumpRx will provide savings up to 85% for certain medications, such as Duavee, a drug that treats menopause symptoms.",
      "Duavee's sticker price is $203 per month, but according to Pfizer, on TrumpRx, it will cost $30 per month. Xeljanz, a Pfizer medication for arthritis, currently costs $6,000 out-of-pocket per month, but on TrumpRx, it will cost about $3,600.",
      "\"This is a major, major step, and we have to do it,\" Makary told CBS News when asked if, even with the discounts, the drugs will still be unaffordable for many Americans.",
      "The Trump administration said the TrumpRx website will launch next year, but Makarty did not have specific timing.",
      "Makary believes that patients with health insurance who are still unable to afford certain medications will still be helped by TrumpRx.",
      "\"I think it's going to help them significantly,\" Makary said. \"You're going to see a series of announcements by different pharmaceutical companies. This has been the No. 1 health priority in this administration.\"",
      "Sarah Wisniewski, a Maryland resident in her mid-40s, has been living with multiple sclerosis since 2018. Although she she says she has good insurance, it has repeatedly failed to cover the specialty medication her doctor prescribed to slow the progression of her disease. In 2024, when her physician recommended a treatment that could help, she says her insurance company denied coverage three times. She was only approved after the Maryland attorney general intervened.",
      "When CBS News asked Makarty about Wisniewski, he explained, \"I've seen that story throughout my career as a cancer surgeon, and it's tragic, and we've seen nothing on drug prices for the last 50 years.\"",
      "More than 90% of Americans have some form of health insurance, yet many still struggle to afford critical medications. Wisniewski told CBS News she is skeptical about the new TrumpRx program.",
      "\"If big pharma isn't required to put their drugs on this market, and if they're not forced to lower prices, then this feels like a toothless, symbolic statement, as opposed to having any real, long-term impact on the lives of the clinically ill,\" she said.",
      "She also questioned how the administration plans to pressure pharmaceutical companies to list the most urgently needed medications on the platform. Even at 50% to 80% cheaper, she said, some of these drugs remain unaffordable.",
      "Makary told CBS News that this is just the beginning of the solution:",
      "\"Each year, we throw good money after bad into a broken system where we pay more and more for drugs,\" Makary said. \"This is the first time we're seeing a major reset \u2014 cutting the price of some drugs, not all, but some, by 50% to 80%.\"",
      "Stacie Dusetzina, a prescription medication industry expert and a health policy professor at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, says the president's plan will not lower most Americans' out-of-pocket costs for medications.  \"The reality of who can actually benefit by paying cash for these drugs through this website, it's probably going to be a smaller number of people than what is being promoted,\" Dusetzina said.",

Planned Parenthood has never had a license to perform abortions in Louisiana, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Last year, the clinic in New Orleans served about 16,000 patients for sexually transmitted infection care and testing, and almost 9,000 patients for family planning care, including birth control and pregnancy tests, according to Planned Parenthood data provided by the New Orleans Health Department.",

      "AMC announced the 89-minute\u00a0film\u00a0two weeks ago, prompting fans to flock to the chain's ticketing site for the limited theatrical run from Oct. 3 to Oct. 5 in the U.S. It is the largest grossing album debut theatrical event of all time at the domestic and global box office, according to the AMC spokesperson.",
      "The release marks Swift's second partnership with AMC. After the Eras Tour, which netted a record-breaking $2.2 billion, she released an accompanying concert film, becoming the biggest of its kind to date. That movie earned\u00a0between $95 million and $97 million in North America during its opening weekend.",
      "Other companies have also sought to cash in on the hype surrounding the 35-year-old pop star's new album, with Krispy Kreme offering doughnuts in its signature colors and KitchenAid releasing a limited-edition orange mixer inspired by the record. On Oct. 3, Magnum Ice Cream gave out glitter-coated bars at a pop-up on New York City's Cornelia Street, where Swift once lived.",
      "Despite mixed reviews from critics, Swift's \"The Life of a Showgirl\" became Spotify's most streamed album in a single day within 11 hours of its release.",

    "summary": "Soybean farmers have been hit particularly hard, as China boycotts American soybeans.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration is considering a significant financial aid package for farmers, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions. The package could include more than $10 billion in relief.",
      "The White House is focusing on soybean farmers, since they've been hard hit by the Chinese boycott on American soybeans. Discussions about the package are still in early stages, one of the sources said.",
      "The Treasury Department and Agriculture Department are involved in the talks. Top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on CNBC on Monday that \"we've had numerous meetings over the last week or two\" about \"what we're going to do\" about the hit farmers have taken. He promised the administration would take \"big measures\" and \"those big measures are going to be public really, really soon.\"",
      "Hassett acknowledged, \"Right now, the silos are full, and there are soybeans sitting on the ground with tarps over them. That's unacceptable to the president.\" He also said the administration is \"calling up all our soybean customers around the world as part of our trade negotiations.\"",

      "\"We're going to take some of that tariff money that we made, we're going to give it to our farmers, who are, for a little while, going to be hurt until the tariffs kick into their benefit,\" the president told reporters in the Oval Office on Sept. 25. \"So, we're going to make sure that our farmers are in great shape, because we're taking in a lot of money.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Oct 2025 14:10:07 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of Americans, squeezed by inflation and elevated interest rates, face the risk of losing their home in foreclosure.",
    "story": [
      "Kimberly Draxler was in shock when she called her mortgage lender in April and was told her four-bedroom home in Hillview, Kentucky, would be sold out from under her in a matter of days.",
      "Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home.",
      "\"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me,\" Draxler told CBS News.",
      "Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules.",
      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",
      "\"I just couldn't do it anymore\"",
      "Although foreclosures \u2014 which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions \u2014 remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, they are on the rise.",
      "As of August, foreclosure filings had risen six straights months year-over-year and were up 18% from the same period in 2025, according to property data firm ATTOM. Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.",
      "\"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills \u2014 I just couldn't do it anymore,\" said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade.",
      "Roughly 94% of mortgage defaults occur after a homeowner loses income to extenuating circumstances,\u00a0according\u00a0to The Urban Institute, citing\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",
      "As for Draxler, she managed to keep her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows debtors to hold onto their property and pay off debt over time, usually within three to five years. But coming so close to losing her home of more than 30 years continues to weigh on her.",
      "\"I did not want to lose my house,\" Draxler said. \"I wouldn't have no place to go.\"",

Unlike previous IRS leaders, Long lacked a background in either accounting or tax law.",

      "\"Never in Social Security's 90-year history has a commissioner held a second job,\" said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, in an email. \"Bisignano's new role will leave a leadership vacuum at the top of the agency, especially since the Republican Senate hasn't even confirmed a deputy commissioner.\"",

      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",

      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",

    "summary": "Furloughed federal workers are entitled to back pay by law, but contractors are not. Here's who gets paid and who doesn't.",
    "story": [
      "When the government shuts down, many federal workers go without paychecks, whether they are deemed essential and required to show up for work or whether they're furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "Such employees are by law entitled to back pay once a funding agreement is reached, but independent contractors who sell goods or services to the U.S. government are not similarly protected.",
      "Dan Koh, the former chief of staff at the Labor Department under President Biden, recently said on his podcast that workers employed by companies that have contracts with the government are hurt in a shutdown.",
      "That's because there's no guarantee such workers will be paid once the government reopens, according to Koh. But even federal workers who eventually receive back pay can suffer during a shutdown, as many of them live paycheck to paycheck, he added.",
      "\"Even if you are entitled to back pay, a lot of people can't go even a couple of days without their regularly scheduled paycheck,\" he told CBS News. \"If you have to pay your subway fare, for gas, if something breaks in your home, and you're not getting paid, it places extreme stress on government employees,\" he said.",
      "Members of Congress and the President continue to receive paychecks during a shutdown.",
      "Who gets paid and who does not?",
      "Federal workers, including both furloughed and excepted government employees, receive back pay under a federal law guaranteeing that they'll eventually be made whole.",
      "The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019\u00a0states that workers who are furloughed due to a lapse in federal funding, as well as excepted workers who are considered essential and required to work without being paid, all receive back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "By contrast, workers and businesses that contract with the government are not similarly guaranteed delayed compensation.",
      "Roughly 620,000 people, or about 28% of federal workers, are projected to be furloughed during the shutdown, according to an Oxford Economics analysis of government data. Additionally, millions of private sector workers who are supported by federal grants and contracts could see their pay be affected by the shutdown, according to the economic advisory firm.",
      "The group estimates that the government supports up to an additional 10 million private workers through federal grants and contracts.",
      "In 2024, the federal government spent about $755 billion on contracts for a wide variety of goods and services, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.",
      "\"The government is the largest buyer of goods and services, so when they are not paying, it's not ripples, it's waves,\" Aron Beezley, co-leader of the Government Contracts Practice Group at Bradley, a national law firm, told CBS News.",
      "Personnel needed to process payment",
      "Some federal contracts are fully funded, meaning the government has already allocated money to a given job, and it's likely to continue.",
      "\"If your contract is fully funded by the previous year's appropriations, your contract will go forward, generally speaking,\" he told CBS News.",
      "But even then, companies can expect snags in getting paid on schedule during a shutdown. That's because government personnel tasked with processing contractor invoices might not be at work.",
      "\"When you submit invoices during a shutdown, the system the government uses to pay contractors requires human involvement. Invoices need to be reviewed, and a lot of times a contractor has questions for the folks who process invoices,\" Beezley explained.",
      "As a result, contractors with fully funded contracts can encounter practical impediments to receiving payments they are owed.",
      "\"If nobody is home to process the invoice, it can be challenging to get paid, which can create cash flow issues, particularly for small businesses,\" Beezley said.",
      "Partially funded contracts",
      "A company with an incrementally funded government contract may find itself in a more precarious financial position. Under such contracts, the government pays a business for the work it does as a job progresses.",
      "\"During a shutdown, the funds might not be there for a contractor, and in such situations, those contractors are looking at whether they need to stop working or keep going, and try to get the government to pay them later,\" Beezley said.",
      "Even when contractors want to continue doing their jobs, they might be impeded by practical obstacles.",
      "\"Say a person who unlocks a government facility in the morning has been furloughed and a contractor shows up Monday morning and can't get into the facility \u2014 that impacts their performance,\" Beezley said.",
      "Federal agencies have the discretion to terminate such contracts, at which point a company can decide whether or not to continue paying workers, or assign them to another job.",
      "\"Most contracting companies out of goodness of heart don't keep paying janitors,\" Koh said. \"So in effect, most of them aren't getting paid.\"",
      "Attempts at legislation",
      "In 2023, Sen. Tina Smith, a Democratic Senator for Minnesota, introduced legislation to secure back pay for federal contract workers facing layoffs during a potential shutdown.",
      "\"Contractor employees perform jobs that are critical to the operation of our government, providing food service, security, and doing custodial work,\" Smith said in a statement at the time. \"These are often low-wage jobs that mean workers are living paycheck to paycheck. In the past, these workers haven't received back pay at the end of a government shutdown like the thousands of government employees. And it's time we right that wrong.\"",
      "The bill failed to advance.",
      "Small businesses",
      "As far as ripple effects go, businesses in places like Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland, that depend on government workers' patronage could start feeling a pinch if the shutdown drags on for more than a few weeks. Without cash in their pockets, such workers are expected to pull back on their discretionary spending, according to economists.",
      "\"If a shutdown is prolonged, there will be repercussions for businesses in certain areas with a large number of federal workers, if they aren't being paid,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics told CBS News. \"Areas that rely on the government workforce to spend at their business could be vulnerable.\"",

      "\"The last time I had to job search, I found something pretty easily,\" she said.",
      "Almost a year later, the 37-year-old is still without a job. Whitlock said she has applied to hundreds of jobs \u2014 even for positions she's overqualified for \u2014 to no avail.",
      "\"The more I looked, the more I wasn't getting responses. If I did have an interview, I only made it the first one or two rounds,\" said Whitlock, who has a 16-year-old daughter. \"Things got really real when my unemployment ran out.\"",
      "Sidelined for months",
      "While the government's September jobs report\u00a0wasn't released on Friday\u00a0because of the government shutdown, other recent economic signals point to an increasingly challenging job market for people like Whitlock. Private employers\u00a0declined by 32,000 jobs\u00a0in September, according to payroll processing firm ADP. The number of job openings around the U.S. has also steadily dropped, economic data shows.",
      "And while the nation's unemployment rate remains historically low, at 4.3%, the share of Americans defined as long-term unemployed \u2014 or those unemployed for 27 weeks or longer \u2014 has risen to 26%, the highest in more than three years, labor data shows.",
      "As of August, the number of long-term unemployed people had risen to 1.9 million, according to government data \u2014 the highest level since 2021, when the nation was still reeling from the pandemic.",
      "With the job market faltering in recent months as employers put the brakes on hiring, more workers are being sidelined for months on end, economists told CBS News.",
      "\"We're continuing to see this low-hire, low-fire environment,\" said Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. \"There aren't really new jobs being opened up for people \u2014 there isn't room for new people to come in.\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Thursday captures the dimming view many Americans have of the labor market, with 33% of respondents describing it as \"good,\" down from 41% in April. What's more, 48% said they think there are fewer good jobs where they live compared to five years ago.",
      "1,000 job applications",
      "The rise in long-term unemployed Americans poses two risks, Ullrich said. Workers themselves can suffer financial setbacks as they burn through savings and take on debt to stay afloat. And the broader U.S. economy can suffer if people give up on looking for work after becoming discouraged at the prospects of finding a job.",
      "\"Folks who do go into this long-term unemployment category, it's harder for them to get back into the labor force,\" he said. \"The concern is that they become discouraged workers and they stop working, and then they fall out of the labor force entirely.\"",
      "People who have been hunting for a job for months say the process is both frustrating and demoralizing, especially after sending hundreds of applications that fail to get a response. James Strawn, 55, a software quality expert in Colorado who lost his job in July, said he's submitted 100 applications and only received one response.",
      "\"I've had people say, 'Those are rookie numbers, like that is nothing \u2014 I've submitted 1,000 applications',\" he told CBS News. \"Every morning when I get on LinkedIn \u2014 I'm on there all day now \u2014 I see another post that's like another horror story of looking for jobs.\"",
      "Strawn said he was rejected from a minimum wage job at a fitness center, and has taken on a seasonal job at UPS. But he's increasingly fearful that he may not find work in his technology field by year-end, when his severance pay runs out.",
      "Strawn also worries that ageism could be playing a role in his struggle to land a job in his field. \"It's going to take a small miracle to find something,\" he said. \"It's really tough \u2014 it's really a bad market.\"",
      "It's not only experienced workers who are struggling. Young workers and recent college graduates are also having a hard time breaking into the job market. Because there's a glut of workers looking for jobs, employers are requiring that applicants have more extensive \u00a0resumes, Ullrich told CBS News.",
      "\"They are asking for more years of experience, like nine-plus,\" she said. \"Most of it is because they can.\"",
      "The unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds is \"slowly but steadily rising,\" said Elise Gould, an economist at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute.",
      "\"I was quickly humbled\"",
      "Matthew McMeans, who graduated from the University of Memphis last year, estimates he applied to roughly 500 jobs during an 18-month job search before landing a position as a full stack software engineer in early August. He described the job hunt as \"miserable\" and \"degrading\" given the difficulty in landing interviews.",
      "\"When I started my degree, the hopes were really high that you were going to get multiple offers when you graduated,\" the 23-year-old said. \"But as soon as I started really searching and applying, I was quickly humbled.\"",
      "The wobbly labor market has caught the attention of the Federal Reserve, which has a so-called dual mandate to keep both unemployment and inflation low. Last month, the central bank\u00a0cut interest rates for the first time since December 2024 in an effort to bolster the labor market.",
      "But even if the job market improves, for many the damage has already been done. Whitlock, the IT professional who has been unemployed for almost a year, said she's managed to get assistance through programs like SNAP, better known as food stamps, and to negotiate down her cell phone and car insurance bills.",

      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

      "Many Americans are eager to put money away for retirement, but that goal is increasingly out of reach because more workers are living paycheck to paycheck, a new Goldman Sachs study finds.",
      "Roughly 42% of younger working Americans \u2014 spanning Gen Z, millennials and Gen X \u2014 report having no spare savings after covering their basic living expenses, according to the analysis, which surveyed about 3,600 workers and 1,500 retirees. Among those just getting by, about three-quarters said they are struggling to save for retirement, the survey found.",
      "The share of U.S. workers in this precarious financial position has grown significantly since 1997, when 31% lived paycheck to paycheck, according to Goldman. The investment bank projects that figure could climb to well over half of Americans by 2033 as essentials like housing and health care continue to rise in cost.",
      "\"Save more\" ignores reality",
      "The findings underscore the challenges millions of Americans now face just making ends meets while also managing to set aside money for retirement, a financial pinch that Goldman Sachs calls a \"financial vortex.\" That money crunch helps explains why more than a quarter of older Americans are nearing retirement without anything saved \u2014 a gap that could widen given the financial pressures facing younger workers.",
      "\"These findings force us to ask a very critical question: Does the retirement math still work? The answer is no,\" said Greg Wilson, head of retirement at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in a conference call to discuss the report. \"Telling workers just to 'save more' ignores the realities they face.\"",
      "Skipping a latte or avocado toast isn't likely to make much of a dent in the financial dynamics facing workers today, with Goldman finding that basic expenses are consuming an ever growing share of people's after-tax income.",
      "For instance, homeownership now eats up 51% of income, up from 33% in 2000, while health care costs account for 16% of after-tax earnings, up from 10% a quarter century ago, the analysis found.",
      "\"The mounting challenges American workers face ... make it harder than ever to save for retirement,\" Wilson said.",
      "Such financial pressures come as many Americans are on their own to plan, and save for, their retirement, largely because of the shift in the 1980s from company-sponsored pensions to 401(k) plans.",
      "As a savings vehicle, 401(k) shifts the burden onto workers, who must decide how much to save, how to invest and how to draw down their money in retirement \u2014 a do-it-yourself approach that retirement experts such as Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at The New School for Social Research in New York,\u00a0describe as inadequate.",
      "Hoping for a miracle",
      "Financial professionals say it's no coincidence that members of Generation X, which entered the workforce just as the shift to 401(k)s became mainstream, is feeling unprepared as they get closer to retirement. Now 45 to 60 years old, almost half said they believed it would take a \"miracle\" for them to be able to retire, a Natixis study found last year.",
      "Goldman acknowledged that it can be difficult to close a retirement funding gap with savings alone, but noted that some strategies could help. Some approaches may be out of reach for older workers, like Gen X and millennials, but could be of use for their children \u2014 for instance, setting aside $500 a year from ages 1 to 20, a move Goldman found could increase retirement savings by 14%.",
      "Adding private market investments to a portfolio could also help boost retirement savings by 14% through higher returns, according to Goldman. Those strategies might become more accessible for workers under a Trump administration plan to open up 401(k)\u00a0plans to private equity, cryptocurrencies and other alternative investments.",
      "Lastly, if possible, workers should take advantage of benefits from their employers such as funding an emergency savings account, which can help them avoid raiding their 401(k) in case of an unexpected expense, such as medical bills, the bank notes.",
      "Even so, while those approaches might work for workers with access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, about half of all U.S. private-sector workers\u00a0lack access to such programs, an analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts found earlier this year. Although it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to an employer retirement plan said they struggled to build wealth, the Pew survey found.",

      "The demands are outlined in a nine-page document, title the \"Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,\" that asks schools to freeze their tuition rate for five years, ban the use of sex and gender as factors in their admissions process, and cap their international student numbers, among other requirements.",
      "Signatories also must commit to \"transforming or abolishing institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle and even spark violence against conservative ideas,\" according to the memo.",

      "The official declined to say whether the Trump administration plans to make a similar offer to other colleges.",
      "The agreement was\u00a0first reported\u00a0by the Wall Street Journal. May Mailman, a senior adviser for special projects at the White House, told the paper that the Trump administration doesn't plan to limit funding only to institutions that agree to abide by the compact. However, schools that sign the agreement will be granted priority in receiving federal funding and engaging with White House officials.",
      "\"Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits,\" the agreement states.",

      "\"Penn must not allow itself to be threatened into ceding its self-determination,\" the group said. \"Whatever the consequences of refusal, agreeing would threaten the very mission of the university.\"",
      "The agreement places a cap on foreign student enrollment, which it states cannot exceed 15% of a university's undergraduate population. Also, no more than 5% of foreign students enrolled at a college can come from a single country.",
      "\"Universities that rely on foreign students to fund their institutions risk, among other things, potentially reducing spots available to deserving American students,\" the document states.",
      "The nine schools are also asked to freeze tuition for five years and to waive tuition for students pursuing \"hard science programs\" at institutions where the endowment exceeds $2 million per undergraduate student. Schools would not have to freeze tuition for students from \"families of exceptional means,\" under the agreement.",
      "The letter represents the latest attempt by the Trump administration to reshape the nation's higher education system.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The fight over funding the government is likely to be a costly one.",
      "Each week of the ongoing government shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion and reduce GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, according to an estimate published by EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. That cost is a function of reduced pay for federal employees, delayed government procurement of goods and a decline in demand.",
      "To some extent, a portion of that economic cost would be reversed when the government reopens, as furloughed employees receive back pay and economic activity increases, the analysis said.",
      "It's likely that not everything would be reversible, though. The last shutdown \u2014 which was during President Trump's first term and lasted 34 days, beginning in December 2018 and ending in January 2019 \u2014 cost the U.S. economy about $11 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "During that shutdown, the longest on record, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that real gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2018 took a $3 billion hit (in 2019 dollars). And it estimated that in the first quarter of 2019, real GDP was \"$8 billion lower than it would have been \u2014 an effect reflecting both the five-week partial shutdown and the resumption in economic activity once funding resumed.\"",
      "The shutdown could shake Americans' faith in the economy, too. EY-Parthenon notes that at the time, the 2019 shutdown led to the sharpest monthly drop in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index up since 2012.",
      "Some of the shutdown costs also stem from the administrative effort necessary to create contingency plans when the government is shut down and reopened. Agencies lose user fees collected from visitors to the national parks or from people seeking certain federal permits or visas. And there are higher premiums in federal contracting during a shutdown and the back pay federal employees eventually receive when the government reopens.",
      "Current federal law requires that federal workers be paid at their regular rate, whether they're furloughed or not, once the government is operating again. In a new analysis cited by the White House, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal government will pay $400 million a day for furloughed employees, who will not be working during the shutdown.",
      "A September 2019 report from a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee estimated the last three government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 \"cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion \u2014 at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed federal workers, and at least $338 million in other costs associated with the shutdowns, including extra administrative work, lost revenue, and late fees on interest payments.\"",
      "The White House Office of Management and Budget estimated that during the 16-day shutdown of 2013, federal employees received $2.5 billion in pay and benefits for hours they did not work, plus $10 million in penalty interest payments and lost fees.",

      "But this time may be different. President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Russell Vought, the OMB director, say layoffs will happen soon if the shutdown continues, so the net fiscal impact of a shutdown to the federal government is a little harder to predict right now. Vought immediately began freezing or slashing federal funding for projects, largely in blue states, during the shutdown. The Trump administration is withholding $18 billion in infrastructure projects in New York City, and cutting funding for climate-related projects in many states that Kamala Harris won.",

The layoffs this year, although elevated, remain well below the massive workforce reductions in 2020, when the pandemic shuttered businesses across the nation, leading to 2 million layoffs through September of that year, Challenger noted.",

Companies now expect to bring on 58% fewer workers for the rest of the year compared with their projections a year ago, the firm found.",
      "\"Previous periods with this many job cuts occurred either during recessions or, as was the case in 2005 and 2006, during the first wave of automations that cost jobs in manufacturing and technology,\" said Andy Challenger, senior vice president and labor expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, in a statement.",

      "In the absence of the government's monthly jobs report, other measures of the labor market's health are drawing more attention from economists. On Wednesday, ADP said that payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "However, some signs suggest that the pace of layoffs is easing, with Challenger's data showing that businesses announced roughly 54,000 job cuts in September, a 37% drop from the nearly 86,000 cuts announced in August.",
      "The Federal Reserve is monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing the headwinds facing workers as the primary reason the central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by\u00a00.25 percentage points. The Fed is penciling in two additional rate cuts for the remainder of 2025.",
      "A decline in borrowing costs for businesses and consumers could help bolster the job market, Challenger said. As interest rates fall, businesses have more flexibility to expand and hire more workers.",
      "\"Right now, we're dealing with a stagnating labor market, cost increases and a transformative new technology. With rate cuts on the way, we may see some stabilizing in the job market in the fourth quarter, but other factors could keep employers planning layoffs or holding off hiring,\" Challenger said.",

      "The retailer said the change would affect around 1,000 products, including salty snacks, baked goods, power drinks, salad dressings and frosting. Customers can expected to see some of the reformulated products on shelves in the coming months. Walmart told the Associated Press that the changes primarily affect Great Value, the company's largest private-label food brand.",
      "Walmart, which serves over 250 million customers a week globally, billed the change as a means to address changing consumer preferences. \"Our customers have told us that they want products made with simpler, more familiar ingredients \u2014 and we've listened,\" Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said in a statement.",

      "Among the preservatives Walmart says it will remove are potassium nitrate, potassium nitrite and potassium bisulfite, which are used in processed meats. The company also said it will remove phthalates, a chemical used to make plastic flexible that is widely found in supermarket and fast foods.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pfizer-to-sell-drugs-medicaid-lower-prices-trumprx-website/",
    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 11:17:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Pfizer's CEO said President Trump's threat of tariffs motivated his company to take swift action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pfizer has agreed to offer significantly discounted prices for some prescription drugs for all American consumers and has committed to offer prescription medications to Medicaid at lower prices, President Trump announced Tuesday. The president said the drugs will be available for purchase online on a website operated by the federal government, which the White House has said will be called \"TrumpRx.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was in the Oval Office with the president for the announcement, said Mr. Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the U.S. motivated his company to take swift action. The president said Pfizer's drug prices will be lower starting \"immediately.\"",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%. Mr. Trump said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced 'most favored nation' cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House has released specific drug prices yet.",
      "Some health policy experts cautioned that pricing details are still unclear and the impact for consumers may be limited.",
      "Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out that Medicaid's prices are already lower than average in the U.S.",
      "\"Medicaid already enjoys 'best-price' protection in the sense that they receive the lowest prices charged to any commercial payer in the United States. Therefore, we are starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" he told CBS News.",
      "And those patients have been benefiting, says Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Program on Medicare Policy at\u00a0KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization: \"It is still very unclear how the price reductions announced today will lower costs directly for many people, since people on Medicaid typically don't pay large amounts out of pocket for drugs.\"",
      "Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, said: \"The direct-to-patient stuff is, in my view, a sideshow and branding opportunity for Trump. Most patients have drug coverage. \u2026 Very few are going to buy medications with cash, unless the drug is not a covered benefit, like weight loss or erectile dysfunction drugs.\"",
      "Bourla called it a \"historic day\" because the agreement would be reversing an \"unfair situation.\"",
      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on\u00a0drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs. He threatened to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they failed to do so.",
      "Monday was the deadline for drugmakers to reach agreements to bring down drug costs, the Post reported, after the president's May executive order. While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population and uses about 13% of the world's prescription drugs, the U.S. funds over 70% of global pharmaceutical profits, according to the White House.",
      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "Bourla mentioned the impending tariffs in his comments Tuesday, saying the tariffs had motivated his company. He said the Mr. Trump gave Pfizer a three-year grace period on the tariffs, and the tariffs would be inapplicable, as long as Pfizer manufactures in the U.S. As a part of the agreement, Bourla said Pfizer agreed to move their production of medicines used in America to the U.S.",
      "\"The president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President,\" Bourla said. \"And clearly motivated ours, right?\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said the tariffs had \"played a big role\" in the deal.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall. Mr. Trump echoed that point, saying other companies are on board, too.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C.,\" said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRx\" website have not yet been shared, but a senior administration official expected the website to be live in early 2026.",
      "The announcement comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

      "In the lawsuit, which names both the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago as plaintiffs, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul writes, \"Defendants' deployment of federalized troops to Illinois is patently unlawful.\" He continues, \"Plaintiffs ask this court to halt the illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional federalization of members of the National Guard of the United States, including both the Illinois and Texas National Guard.\"",
      "Raoul is asking for a temporary restraining order, saying deployment will cause \"additional unrest,\" \"mistrust of police\" an dharm to the state's economy.",

      "In a Monday afternoon news conference, Pritzker repeatedly decried what he called the Trump administration's \"invasion\" of Chicago, and said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and other administration officials are expanding raids and military-style enforcement actions in order to sow chaos that would then justify the deployment of military troops to Chicago.",

      "\"The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military,\" said AG Raoul. \"Particularly for the reason that their city or state leadership have fallen out of the president's political favor.\"",
      "Raoul said the state has filed more than 40 lawsuits against the Trump administrations so far. He cited the militia clauses of the U.S. Constitution, which give Congress the sole authority to decide where troops are deployed, and the Posse Comitatus Act which prohibits military troops from participating in civilian law enforcement.",
      "\"It is unfair to National Guardsmen, it is unfair to local law enforcement and it is certainly unfair to the law abiding citizens of Illinois who do not want to be subject to military occupation,\" Raul said.",

    "summary": "Secure Communities Network, a nonprofit group dedicated to safeguarding the Jewish community in North America, published the report on AI and antisemitism.",
    "story": [
      "A new intelligence bulletin published by a non-profit security organization warns that extremist groups are increasingly using artificial intelligence to intensify antisemitic propaganda, recruitment and operations targeting Jewish communities across North America.",
      "The bulletin, authored by Secure Communities Network, an independent organization dedicated to safeguarding the Jewish community in North America, outlines how both foreign terrorist organizations and domestic violent extremists are exploiting AI tools \u2013 including chatbots, deepfake imagery and generative content \u2013 in order to automate and amplify disinformation, spread antisemitic narratives and spur the self-radicalization of lone actors.",
      "The bulletin notes that as \"AI-generated content begins to create increasingly higher-quality images, the line between real and fake blurs,\" making false antisemitic material appear more credible.",
      "In one cited incident in July 2025, the chatbot \"Grok,\" which was created by Elon Musk's xAI, posted antisemitic and extremist content, including praise for Hitler and references to neo-Nazi rhetoric, following a system update.",
      "According to the report, the posting began when an X user made a post \"celebrating\" the deaths of children and counselors from Camp Mystic following the floods in Texas Hill Country over the July 4 weekend. \"After Grok was tagged to respond to the post, it made a remark about the poster's surname and used the phrase 'every damn time,'\" according to the bulletin, \"which is frequently leveraged by neo-Nazis as a way of accusing Jewish people of persistently being the cause of negative aspects of one's life.\"",
      "The bulletin also cites examples of violent acts not directly tied to antisemitism that allegedly used artificial intelligence to assist in planning an explosion, illustrating how artificial intelligence can aid operational tactics. When a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, the report noted, Matthew Livelsberger allegedly used the AI chat bot ChatGPT to assist in gathering information about explosives and planning the attack.",
      "At the time, Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, stated, \"This is the first incident that I'm aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,\" later calling it, \"a concerning moment.\"",
      "SCN analysts also found that in response to recent Israeli\u2013Iranian tensions, Iranian-sponsored AI-generated disinformation has surged, including fabricated images of attacks on Israel. The bulletin argues that these threats pose increased challenges for law enforcement and communal security, because AI tools are harder to trace and moderate in real time.",
      "According to the FBI, 2024 was recorded as the worst year for anti-Jewish hate crimes since federal law enforcement began reporting hate crime data in 1991. Anti-Jewish incidents increased by 5.8% compared to the previous year, rising from 1,832 in 2023 to 1,938 in 2024. Jewish people were the target of roughly 70% of all religiously motivated hate crimes reported in 2024, though they make up just 2% of the U.S. population.",

      "A federal judge late Sunday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon, after a legal whirlwind that began hours earlier when the president mobilized California troops for Portland after the same judge blocked him from using Oregon's National Guard the day before.",
      "During a hastily called telephone hearing, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut granted a temporary restraining order sought by California and Oregon.",
      "A day earlier, the same judge temporarily blocked\u00a0the administration from deploying Oregon National Guard troops to Portland. But on Sunday, the president moved to send National Guard troops to the state from neighboring California and then from Texas.",
      "Immergut, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, issued her second, more sweeping order late Sunday after she upbraided the federal government's attorney and questioned how the move to send the California and Texas troops to Oregon was not \"in direct contravention of the order that was issued yesterday.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "Small protests have been going on nightly outside Portland's immigration processing facility since Mr. Trump's second term began in January. There have been occasional flare-ups, including in June, but for weeks the demonstrations attracted only a few dozen people \u2014 until the Trump administration mobilized the Oregon National Guard\u00a0on Sept. 28 against Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek's wishes.",
      "A small number of demonstrators gathered Sunday evening cheered when they learned about the judge's order.",
      "Immergut issued Saturday's order pending further arguments in a lawsuit brought by the state and city. She said the relatively small protests didn't justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.",
      "Her Saturday ruling came after Mr. Trump called the city \"war-ravaged.\" Oregon officials and Portland residents alike said that description was ludicrous.",
      "A Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement that about 200 federalized members of the California National Guard who had been on duty around Los Angeles were being reassigned to Portland. Kotek said about 100 arrived Saturday and around 100 more were en route Sunday.",
      "The two states originally requested a narrower order that would have blocked only California National Guard troops from being sent to Oregon, but asked for the order to apply to all National Guard troops after a memo written by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was submitted to the court that said up to 400 Texas National Guard personnel were being activated for deployment to Oregon, Illinois and possibly elsewhere.",
      "Immergut grilled lawyers for the federal government, accusing them of seeking an end run around her Saturday order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Oregon.",
      "\"How could bringing in federalized National Guard from California not be in direct contravention of the TRO I issued yesterday?\" she said Sunday.",

      "Scott Kennedy, the attorney representing Oregon, said he learned of the Texas National Guard mobilization just 24 minutes before the emergency hearing on Sunday night. \"It feels a little bit like we're playing a game of rhetorical whack-a-mole here,\" he told Immergut.",

      "Kotek said the latest move by federal officials is an attempt to circumvent Saturday's court ruling that blocked deployment of Oregon's guard members.",
      "\"The facts on the ground in Oregon haven't changed,\" Kotek said during a news conference Sunday. \"There's no need for military intervention in Oregon. There's no insurrection in Portland, there's no threat to national security.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that personnel from his state were on their way Sunday and called the deployment \"a breathtaking abuse of the law and power.\" He said these troops were \"federalized\" and put under the president's control months ago over his objections, in response to unrest in Los Angeles.",
      "\"The commander-in-chief is using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens,\" Newsom said. In a post on X, he said California would sue to try to stop the deployment.",
      "After Immergut's late Sunday ruling, Newsom said on X, \"We just won in court \u2014 again. ... Trump's abuse of power won't stand.\"",
      "In a related court filing, an attorney in the California Military Department said the U.S. Army Northern Command advised the department on Sunday that an order will be issued keeping the 300 guard personnel federalized through the end of January.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Mr. Trump's move to deploy the National Guard of one state to another \"is well outside of the norms or practices\" of any president.",
      "\"But this President is determined to take as much power as the courts will give him. This fight isn't over, but today's rebuke of the president's illegal actions is a step in the right direction,\" Bonta said in a statement after Sunday night's ruling.",
      "Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said Sunday that he saw federal agents engaged in what he described as unjustified use of force and indiscriminately spraying pepper spray and impact munitions during a protest outside the ICE facility.",
      "\"This is an aggressive approach trying to inflame the situation that has otherwise been peaceful,\" Wilson said.",
      "Portland has alerted the civil rights division of the Department of Justice to the agents' actions, Wilson said.",

      "\"The docket is already full of blockbuster cases, and that list is going to grow as challenges to the president's executive orders find their way back to the justices after having been dealt with on the emergency docket,\" Larsen said.",
      "Here are the major cases the Supreme Court will hear this term:",
      "\"Conversion therapy\" ban",
      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Oct. 7 in a challenge to a Colorado law that bans \"conversion therapy\" for minors. Nearly half the states have similar laws in place.",
      "The law, which took effect in September 2019, prohibits \"conversion therapy\" for people under the age of 18. The state defines \"conversion therapy\" as any practice or treatment, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to \"change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\" Violators face fines of up to $5,000 per violation and may be suspended from practicing or stripped of their license.",
      "The case was brought by Kaley Chiles, a licensed counselor in Colorado who performs faith-informed counseling when her clients seek it. Chiles, who is Christian, seeks to engage in talk therapy with young patients who want to \"reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body,\" according to court filings. But she fears that doing so will leave her in violation of Colorado's law and put her at risk of losing her license.",
      "Chiles sued the state and licensing officials in 2022, arguing that the ban violates her First Amendment rights by censoring her speech based on viewpoint and the content of her conversations. She sought to block Colorado from enforcing it against her.",
      "Colorado officials, meanwhile, argued that its law regulates professional health care treatment to ensure patients receive quality care. States have for centuries regulated professional health care to protect patients from substandard treatment, they said, and the First Amendment has never forbidden states from doing that.",
      "A federal district court ruled for Colorado, finding that its prohibition regulates professional conduct by forbidding certain speech made in a professional context. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld that decision. The appeals court divided 2-1 in finding that the restriction regulates professional conduct that only incidentally burdens speech.",
      "The use of race in redistricting",
      "On Oct. 15, the Supreme Court will consider for the second time the Louisiana congressional map drawn after the 2020 Census.",
      "But the stakes for the case this time around are much higher: The justices are weighing whether the Constitution allows a state to intentionally create a second majority-minority congressional district to comply with the Voting Rights Act.",
      "\"The outcome of the case will not only determine the next steps for Louisiana's congressional map but may also shape the future of redistricting cases nationwide and forecast the resiliency of our nation's democratic values,\" Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, told reporters during a call.",
      "The long-running dispute involves the interplay between Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law. In this case, state lawmakers drew a second majority-Black congressional district to address a Section 2 violation, but bumped up against the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which prohibits racial gerrymandering.",
      "The case dates back to the first congressional map drawn by Louisiana Republicans and enacted in 2022, which consisted of one majority-Black district and five majority-White districts. African Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "A district judge ruled that map likely violated Section 2 because it deprived minority voters of the chance to elect their preferred candidate. So Louisiana state lawmakers went back to the drawing board and crafted a new map that contained a second majority-minority district.",
      "Republicans said the re-drawn districts brought the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act and protected key GOP incumbents in the U.S. House, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Julia Letlow, who sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee.",
      "But a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-Americans\" challenged that new map as a racial gerrymander in violation of the 14th Amendment, and a three-judge panel of district judges agreed. It found that race predominated in drawing the new voting boundaries.",
      "Last March, the Supreme Court heard arguments on whether to keep Louisiana's re-crafted map in place. But in June, it ordered further arguments this term and later asked the parties \u2014 Louisiana officials, the 12 non-African-American voters, and a separate group of Black Louisianans \u2014 to address whether Louisiana's intentional creation of the second majority-minority House district violates the 14th or 15th Amendments.",
      "While Louisiana officials first defended the re-shaped House district lines, they now say the creation of the second majority-Black district in its new voting map violates the Constitution.",
      "The Supreme Court has typically given map-drawers breathing room to navigate the requirements of Section 2 and the 14th Amendment, but the Louisiana case could lead to a weakening of Section 2.",
      "In a 2023 decision that upheld the constitutionality of Section 2 as applied to redistricting, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that there should be an end to the drawing of voting boundaries based on race at some point. In a concurring opinion, he wrote \"the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.\"",
      "Trump's sweeping tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump announced earlier this year that he would be imposing sweeping baseline tariffs on imports from nearly every U.S. trading partner, to address \"chronic trade deficits\" that he said \"are no longer merely an economic \u2014 they're a national emergency.\" He also imposed levies on products from Canada, Mexico and China because of what he said was their failure to stop illicit drugs from flowing into the U.S.",
      "The president used a law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to implement the tariffs. That law gives the president the authority to declare a national emergency to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. Once the president declares a national emergency, IEEPA gives the president the authority to take certain actions, including to regulate importation.",
      "Mr. Trump declared national emergencies related to trade deficits and drug trafficking, and imposed the tariffs under IEEPA to address them.",
      "A group of 12 states and small businesses filed lawsuits challenging Mr. Trump's tariffs, arguing that IEEPA did not give the president the authority to impose his global levies. A federal appeals court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that Mr. Trump's tariffs are illegal. A federal district court in Washington, D.C., also reached the same conclusion.",
      "The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court, and it agreed to hear the cases on an expedited basis.",
      "The high court has in the past been skeptical of broad presidential authority when it involves what are known in administrative law as \"major questions\" of vast economic and political significance, like when it invalidated former President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. But the Trump administration has argued that this delegation of power involves foreign affairs and national security, and his determination that tariffs are best suited to address trade-deficit and drug-trafficking emergencies warrant deference.",
      "Martinez predicted the debate in the case will be about textualism and how to look at the language in IEEPA, as well as principles like the major questions doctrine, deference and nondelegation that have been embraced by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "\"These are all the same kinds of arguments that the conservative side of the court has been pushing very strongly in recent years to limit the use and some would say abuse of executive branch authority,\" Martinez, who clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, said during an event hosted by Georgetown Law. \"It will be interesting to see how those same principles are applied in this context, where you have a Republican president with a major policy initiative.\"",
      "Campaign finance",
      "In a string of recent decisions, the Supreme Court has unraveled campaign finance limits as violations of the First Amendment, which has allowed more money to flow into politics. The latest campaign finance dispute before the justices could follow that trend.",
      "At issue in the case is a 50-year-old provision of campaign finance law that restricts the amount of money political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates during a campaign. For 2024, the limits on coordinated spending by party committees were from $123,600 to $3.7 million for Senate candidates, and between $61,800 and $123,600 for House candidates.",
      "In 2022, two GOP campaign committees, along with then-Senate candidate JD Vance and then-Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, argued these limits were unconstitutional.",
      "A federal appeals court upheld the limits under a 2001 Supreme Court decision that rejected a challenge to an earlier version of the restrictions. But since that ruling 24 years ago, the makeup of the high court has changed significantly, and it now has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "Republicans appealed the lower court decision to the Supreme Court and urged it to strike down the limits on coordinated spending as a violation of the First Amendment.",
      "State laws targeting transgender athletes",
      "On the heels of its June decision upholding a Tennessee law banning certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, the Supreme Court said it would decide whether states can prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "The justices will be looking at laws from Idaho and West Virginia to determine whether they violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and, in the case involving West Virginia, Title IX. Idaho was the first state to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports, and roughly two dozen have enacted similar laws.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in February that aimed to keep transgender girls and women from competing on teams that match their gender identity.",
      "The Idaho case was brought by Lindsay Hecox, a transgender woman who attended Boise State University and wanted to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams as a sophomore. She has been treated for gender dysphoria for several years, including receiving testosterone suppression and estrogen.",
      "A U.S. district court blocked enforcement of Idaho's law, finding the ban discriminates against transgender women. A federal appeals court upheld the injunction as applied to Hecox.",
      "Months after the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case, Hecox decided to dismiss her lawsuit for personal reasons and because of \"negative public scrutiny from certain quarters.\" Her lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to toss out the appeals court's decision and order the case to be dismissed.",
      "The West Virginia case involves Becky Pepper-Jackson, who receives puberty-delaying treatment and estrogen hormone therapy and wanted to participate in girls' athletics in middle school. A federal judge initially blocked the state from enforcing the ban only against Pepper-Jackson, ruling it likely violates Title IX and the Constitution.",
      "But in 2023, the judge sided with the state and upheld the law, finding that the state can legislate sports rules because sex and the physical characteristics that flow from it are related to athletic performance and fairness in sports.",
      "A federal appeals court ruled in 2024, though, that the West Virginia law violated Title IX by discriminating against Pepper-Jackson on the basis of sex.",
      "Trump's power to fire executive officers",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has sought to overhaul the executive branch, including by firing Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies without cause. He has removed those officers despite federal laws shielding them from being terminated unless for inefficiency, malfeasance in office or neglect of duty.",
      "Lower courts have repeatedly sided with the fired officials and ordered them to be reinstated. But the Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the Merit Systems Protection Board, National Labor Relations Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "After allowing those other firings, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether for-cause removal protections violate the separation of powers. It will also decide whether Mr. Trump can remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "\"These are cases that raise really profound questions about presidential power \u2026 about Congress' ability to design institutions of government and to insulate certain important functions from the political whims of the day, whether it be setting interest rates or deciding labor relations or nuclear safety,\" lawyer Deepak Gupta told reporters at the Georgetown Law event. Gupta represents Gwynne Wilcox, who was fired from her position as a member of the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "One of the disputes before the high court, which has not yet been scheduled for argument, involves Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who Mr. Trump removed from her post at the Federal Trade Commission. A district court ruled the president violated a 1914 law that limits the grounds for removing a FTC commissioner to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "When the case landed before the Supreme Court in an emergency posture, it allowed Mr. Trump to oust Slaughter, and the high court said it would decide the constitutionality of removal protections for the FTC.",
      "The case puts in the Supreme Court's crosshairs a 1935 decision that allowed Congress to enact removal restrictions for officials at certain independent agencies, which the high court has chipped away at in recent years.",
      "The second case, involving Cook, will be argued in January. Mr. Trump attempted to fire Cook from the Fed board after an administration official accused her of mortgage fraud. The effort to remove her is unprecedented, as no president has attempted to fire a sitting Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history.",
      "Cook has denied any wrongdoing, and she has not been charged with any criminal offense. A federal judge ruled in September that Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook likely violated federal law because he did not state a legally permissible cause for her termination.",
      "The judge also said Cook's due process rights were likely violated because she did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before she was ousted.",
      "A federal appeals court rejected a request from the Trump administration to allow the president to fire Cook and agreed with the lower court that Cook did not receive adequate process before her attempted removal. The two-judge majority did not address whether Mr. Trump satisfied the \"for cause\" removal requirement.",
      "In an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump asked the justices to let him remove Cook from the Fed Board while the challenge to her firing moved forward. But the high court declined to immediately rule on his request for relief, and instead said it will hear arguments in January.",
      "By putting off a decision, the Supreme Court let Cook remain a Fed governor while it considers the issue.",
      "Gun rights",
      "Just before the start of the new term, the Supreme Court said it will decide whether Hawaii can stop people with concealed-carry permits from bringing their handguns onto private property that is open to the public, unless they receive \"express authorization\" from the property owner.",
      "The case involves firearms restrictions enacted in Hawaii in 2023, on the heels of the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights. The measure prohibits people with concealed-carry permits from carrying handguns on different types of property, including beaches, playgrounds, bars and restaurants that serve liquor, and other \"sensitive\" locations.",
      "The restriction at issue in the case before the Supreme Court bars people with concealed-carry licenses from bringing handguns onto private property unless they receive permission from the property owner. Four other states \u2014 California, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York \u2014 have similar laws that require a property owner's approval before carrying firearms on private property, such as by posting signs stating that guns are allowed.",
      "The Hawaii Firearms Coalition and three gun owners with concealed-carry permits challenged the law in June 2023, and a federal appeals court ultimately upheld the provision related to private property.",
      "Lawyers for the gun owners argued that the 9th Circuit effectively found that the Second Amendment does not apply to private property open to the public, rendering \"illusory the right to carry in public.\" The Trump administration had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to take up the dispute, warning that because few property owners post signs allowing or prohibiting guns, Hawaii's restriction functioned as a \"near-complete ban on public carry.\"",
      "Hawaii officials, meanwhile, said the rule regarding private property \"represents a permissible effort to vindicate the rights of Hawaii's citizens.\" They argued that under its law, a person who wants to bring a gun into a store can simply ask for oral permission.",
      "Since its June 2022 decision recognizing the Second Amendment's right to bear arms extends to outside the home, the Supreme Court has been asked to decide the constitutionality of a number of longstanding firearms restrictions and state laws. Last year, the high court upheld a federal law prohibiting people subject to a domestic violence restraining order from having firearms.",
      "But it has also declined to take up challenges to state bans on assault weapons and other federal measures.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Oct 2025 12:18:01 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court will hear a case brought by a licensed counselor in Colorado, who argues her state's ban on \"conversion therapy\" violates her First Amendment rights.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to convene Tuesday to consider a legal battle involving a Colorado law banning \"conversion therapy\" treatment for minors brought by a licensed counselor in the state, which she argues unconstitutionally censors her conversations about gender dysphoria and sexuality with young clients.",
      "The plaintiff, Kaley Chiles, is a licensed counselor who performs \"faith-informed\" counseling when her clients seek it. Chiles, who is Christian, says she seeks to engage in talk therapy with young patients who want to \"reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body.\" But she fears that doing so will put her in violation of Colorado's law.",
      "\"They're peering into the counseling room and intruding on these private counseling conversations,\" Chiles told CBS News.",
      "Chiles' case is one of several raising hot-button issues that the Supreme Court will hear in its new term, which began Monday. In addition to weighing Colorado's ban, the high court will also consider state laws banning transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports, as well as a major voting rights dispute and where people with concealed-carry permits can bring handguns.",
      "Colorado is one of at least 20 states that prohibit mental health professionals from engaging in \"conversion therapy\" with minors. Colorado defines \"conversion therapy\" as any practice or treatment, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to \"change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\" Violators face fines of up to $5,000 per violation and may be suspended from practicing or stripped of their license.",
      "The law took effect in 2019, and in 2022, Chiles filed a lawsuit against Colorado and its licensing officials, arguing that the law violates her free speech rights by censoring her conversations based on viewpoint and the content of them. She sought a court order preventing Colorado from enforcing the ban against her.",
      "Colorado has not taken any disciplinary action against Chiles or any other licensed therapist for violating the ban, it said in court papers, and the state asserts that the talk therapy Chiles' aims to provide wouldn't defy its law because she expressly doesn't seek to change a patient's gender identity or sexual orientation.",
      "A federal district court allowed Chiles' suit to go forward but ruled against her, finding that Colorado's law regulates the professional conduct of mental health professionals, not speech. The court also found that the state has legitimate interests in protecting young people from what it says is a \"harmful and ineffective\" treatment.",
      "A divided federal appeals court upheld that decision, ruling that Colorado's law only prohibits a mental health professional from engaging in the practice of conversion therapy. The court said the measure is a regulation of professional conduct that incidentally burdens speech.",
      "In seeking the Supreme Court's review, Chiles argued that her speech is being chilled because she has been forced to turn away clients seeking counseling that explore sexuality and gender identity. She is represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal advocacy group.",
      "\"In general, the adolescents who are reaching out, asking for therapy might have a variety of concerns and issues that counseling can be helpful with. Many people who are struggling with issues of sex and sexuality also have co-occurring disorders all the way from suicidality to any other mental health challenge like anxiety, depression, et cetera,\" Chiles said. \"When I'm having to turn them away, they don't get help that is helpful for any of those issues. They are just without a course to be able to offer true help to them from a professional.\"",
      "Chiles' lawyers have argued that Colorado's law prevents families and teens who want to address gender dysphoria by aligning identity and sex from working with a licensed counselor to help reach that goal. But under the measure, practices that provide assistance to patients undergoing gender transition are allowed, they said.",
      "\"It's not the government's role to peer into the counseling room and say some goals are permitted. Some goals are forbidden. Some speech is allowed. Some speech is forbidden,\" Jonathan Scruggs, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, said. \"In this country, we let the people decide what information they want. We don't let government bureaucrats decide. That's really the choice before the court.\"",
      "Chiles' lawyers also warned that if the law as applied to talk therapy is allowed, it could open the door to states imposing regulations on licensed professionals that could sweep up speech on all types of topics, like doctors discussing birth control or therapists encouraging divorce.",
      "\"Colorado's principle is really like a government censorship free-for-all,\" Scruggs said. \"Their theory is any time you have professionals giving advice, the government has total discretion to either ban or compel speech in that context. Would some states ban counselors from encouraging divorce? Or using contraception or the reverse?\"",
      "But Colorado officials said there is a long history of states regulating the health care profession to protect patients from substandard treatment, and the First Amendment has never barred states from doing that. Colorado pointed to medical malpractice laws and other licensing regimes, which lawyers said have long covered mental health and other treatments performed with words.",
      "\"This is because these words are used by a professional in a fiduciary relationship, to provide individualized treatment based on specialized knowledge, for the sole purpose of promoting the patient's health,\" officials wrote.",
      "Additionally, they have argued conversion therapy is ineffective and associated with depression, anxiety, loss of faith and suicidality, regardless of how it is performed. Major medical associations have warned that efforts to change a patient's sexual orientation or gender identity are potentially harmful to young people and not supported by credible scientific evidence.",
      "Colorado officials have also pushed back on Chiles' claim that it is trying to tamp down on certain speech \u2014 discouraging gender transition \u2014 that it disfavors.",
      "\"The only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor's sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\" they said in court papers.",
      "Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for LGBTQ Rights, said the law leaves room for legitimate therapy.",
      "\"What's prohibited by these laws is a very specific, very narrow set of practices, with the therapist trying to impose their own agenda on a minor patient, trying to seek a predetermined outcome,\" he said.",
      "Colorado lawyers and those backing the state warned that if Chiles' prevails, it would destabilize longstanding health care regulation and gut states' power to ensure mental health professionals adhere to the standard of care.",
      "\"If the court were to accept Chiles' argument that any time there's a professional regulation of medical care that applies to what a provider can and cannot say, that that's a free speech issue, that those laws are automatically subject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment, that would be a very revolutionary, dramatic change in the current legal landscape. It would put countless other types of medical and mental health regulations into jeopardy,\" Minter said.",
      "Both sides have cited the Supreme Court's 2018 decision in a case involving a California law that required \"crisis pregnancy centers\" to provide certain notices to patients, which the high court found likely violated the First Amendment. In the majority opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court wrote \"speech is not unprotected merely because it is uttered by 'professionals,'\" and warned that regulating the content of professionals' speech risks suppression of unpopular ideas.",
      "The Trump administration is backing Chiles in the case, but told the Supreme Court in a filing that it should send the case back to lower courts for further proceedings. The Justice Department will participate in oral arguments Tuesday.",
      "\"Colorado is muzzling one side of an ongoing debate in the mental-health community about how to discuss questions of gender and sexuality with children,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing. \"Under the First Amendment, the State bears a heavy burden to justify that content-based restriction on protected speech.\"",
      "Federal appeals courts that have weighed state bans on conversion therapy have divided over their legality. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit invalidated local restrictions in Florida in 2020, finding that \"the First Amendment has no carveout for controversial speech.\" But appeals courts in Philadelphia and San Francisco have upheld bans in New Jersey and Washington.",
      "The Supreme Court in 2023 turned away a challenge to Washington's law, leaving the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in place. Three justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, said they would have taken up the case.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Thomas wrote there is \"little question\" that Washington's law regulates speech and implicates the First Amendment. He argued that under the measure, licensed counselors can only convey a \"state-approved message of encouraging minors to explore their gender identities.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amy-coney-barrett-harassment-death-threats-supreme-court-term-2025/",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Oct 2025 12:10:32 -0400",
    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News, Justice Amy Coney Barrett said of the Supreme Court's emergency orders in the Trump cases, \"This isn't the final decision.\"",
    "story": [
      "Whenever Justice Amy Coney Barrett arrived at an auditorium or a library or a university last month to discuss her new book, she encountered a familiar sight: protesters.",
      "They lined the streets, chanting and carrying signs. One wore a handmaid's costume, a symbol of oppression. Another was dressed as liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose death in 2020 created a vacancy on the Supreme Court that President Trump would fill with Barrett.",
      "For Barrett, protesters have become routine, another logistical wrinkle in her everyday life, much like the ones who regularly gather at her home outside Washington, D.C., where she lives with her husband and younger children. What surprises her, she told me in a wide-ranging interview in her chambers late last month, is how she can let it roll off her back.",
      "\"If I had imagined before I was on the Court, how I would react to knowing that I was being protested, that would have seemed like a big deal, like, 'oh, my gosh, I'm being protested,'\" she says. \"But now I have the ability to be like, 'Oh, okay, well, are the entrances blocked?' I just feel very businesslike about it. It doesn't matter to me. It doesn't disrupt my emotions.\"",
      "A fury of protests against conservative justices erupted in 2022, when news leaked that the Court was poised to overturn the landmark decision Roe v. Wade. Barrett, a conservative in the mold of her former mentor and boss Antonin Scalia, was a particular source of ire. Replacing Ginsburg, whose legal career was grounded in women's rights, she provided a key fifth vote to overturn Roe and let each state decide whether to allow abortion or not. But the decision also unleashed something much darker.",
      "On Friday, a California resident was sentenced to eight years in prison for the attempted assassination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who also voted to overturn Roe. Court papers revealed the perpetrator had also mapped out the homes of three other conservative justices, including Barrett's. Death threats have not gone away, and security remains high at their homes and whenever they appear in public.",
      "I asked Barrett if she is ever afraid. Her response was immediate and emphatic: \"I'm not afraid.\"",
      "\"You can't live your life in fear,\" she continued. \"And I think people who threaten \u2014 the goal is to cause fear. And I'm not afraid. I'm not going to reward threats with their intended reaction.\"",
      "That kind of mental discipline and self control, even in the face of threats and extreme criticism, reflects an outlook that has guided the 53-year-old Barrett much of her life.",
      "\"I don't make decisions emotionally. I try very hard not to let emotions guide decisions in any aspect of my life. The way that I respond to people, the choices that we make,\" she continues, adding with a laugh, \"apart from maybe some impulse buys of clothes or something.\"",
      "That outlook is also reflected in her approach to the law.",
      "On the Supreme Court, Barrett's opinions are highly analytical. She doesn't like to decide more than the issue at hand, which is one reason she has parted ways with conservative colleagues who would rather swing for the fences, like in a case two terms ago when the Court ruled states cannot remove Mr. Trump from the ballot. Barrett agreed on the bottom line, but had a more limited approach.",
      "As a former law professor, she can be formalistic and technical, qualities that also can separate her from other conservatives, as in a 2024 case that attempted to hold the Biden administration responsible for suppressing speech on social media during Covid.",
      "Now entering her sixth year on the Court, Barrett continues to defy stereotypes. Critics span the political spectrum, not only Democrats after she voted to overturn Roe, but more recently Republicans in the wake of decisions at odds with Mr. Trump. She is \"confounding the Right and the Left,\" as the New York Times put it, raising hopes and fears on both sides.",
      "That's partly because, in decades past, some conservative justices have turned out to be anything but conservative. Would Barrett, too, go that route? And it's also in part because of a fundamental misunderstanding about the Court, reflecting an idea that the justices are mere political actors who should stay on their respective sides, regardless of the law.",
      "\"That is a notion that I try to disabuse people of in the book,\" she says.",
      "Correcting some of those public misperceptions that the Supreme Court is driven by politics or outcomes or is loyal to Mr. Trump is one of her main goals with her new book, \"Listening to the Law.\" She is part teacher, part tour guide, taking the reader inside the Court and highlighting some of its most controversial decisions to explain how the justices interpret the Constitution and the differences in conservative and liberal philosophies.",
      "And there is no case more controversial than the 5-4 decision overturning Roe, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Whole Health. Barrett uses it to explain how she and the Court's conservative majority interpret the Constitution with a method known as \"originalism,\" focusing on the Constitution's original meaning, the way the public understood it when it was adopted.",
      "In our interview, Barrett said she was drawn to originalism when she read Justice Scalia's opinions in a constitutional law class during her second year at Notre Dame Law School. She said she was frustrated after a first-year criminal law class, reading liberal decisions of the Warren Court and finding them to be \"unmoored.\" Scalia's opinions, with his originalist framework, made sense to her.",
      "\"I think I am different in style than Justice Scalia. I don't think I'm different in substance,\" she said. \"I think one thing that was important to Justice Scalia is fidelity to his analytical framework, so fidelity to textualism and originalism, even when it led to places that he didn't want to go.\"",
      "Scalia, for example, upheld flag burning as a First Amendment right, even though he said \"if I were king, I would not.\" With Barrett, an example is the death penalty. She upholds it as constitutional, even though it is at odds with her religious views.",
      "And that framework, she says, is how she approaches the cases involving Mr. Trump. While politicians, the media and the public are focused on the current occupant of the office, she says \"the Court has to take the long view.\"",
      "\"The way that we have to view cases is about the presidency, not about the president. We have to make a decision that's going to apply to six presidents from now, and that's how I try to view the law,\" she says. \"So in the same way that I do try to erase particular policies, or substitute in ones that I like or dislike \u2014 to try to maintain neutrality \u2014 I try to do that with the presidents too, because it can't turn on the president.\"",
      "Her critics aren't convinced, but Barrett seems unfazed by the attacks on her judgment or her character. In our conversation, and in multiple interviews with those who know her, she comes across as someone with a strong sense of self and an equally clear view on the right way to interpret the Constitution. Unlike some justices, she says she doesn't monitor what journalists and law professors and politicians say about the Court. She has seen them get it wrong. It doesn't matter to her.",
      "\"If I could have, especially as a 16-year-old, imagined that I would not care or be impervious to being criticized and mocked, I would have been very surprised,\" she says. \"And so I am glad, because I think this would be a miserable job if you let yourself care, if you let yourself be affected.\"",
      "Barrett first walked through the fire after Mr. Trump nominated her in 2017 to the Chicago-based federal appeals court. In her Senate hearings, she withstood withering attacks on her faith, notably when then-Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein told her, \"the dogma lives loudly within you.\" Her steely performance impressed conservatives and helped get her on Mr. Trump's Supreme Court shortlist.",
      "Barrett was astonished by how she was portrayed by the media. (She said a cousin told her \"the person they were describing is not the person that I've known my whole life at all.\")",
      "A mother of seven, Barrett is a devout Catholic and proud daughter from a large and supportive family with deep roots in New Orleans. Before becoming an appeals court judge, she was a popular and respected Notre Dame law professor with sparkling credentials. Always a high achiever, she had received full scholarships to college and law school at Notre Dame, where she was top in her class (and met her future husband) and earned highly competitive clerkships with towering conservative icons, Judge Laurence Silberman and Scalia.",
      "\"One thing that I really disliked was this idea that I had no backbone, or that I was just this subservient woman in some way,\" she said, \"because I felt like I am anything but that.\"",
      "She had set goals for her life early on, and she made conscious and methodical choices to reach them. She wanted a big family like she grew up with, but, of course, she would work, so she wanted flexibility in her career.",
      "\"I really admired my parents, I really admired my grandparents, and I thought, if I want to be the kind of people that they are, I have to make definite choices,\" she told me. \"I have to decide what my values are, what my priorities are, and make definite choices and prioritize those kinds of things.\"",
      "Thinking about law school after college, she says she remembers sitting in her dorm room at Rhodes College and making a list of pros and cons, focusing on what mattered to her and \"I just reasoned my way to it.\" (Barrett, always analytical, mentions in her book that her life runs on to-do lists, but she also is partial to pro/con lists.)",
      "She's now the only justice on the Court who didn't attend an Ivy League school, but Barrett says she didn't care about labels or what was considered \"the best school.\" She didn't even apply to Harvard. She opted for Notre Dame over the University of Chicago, for instance, not only because she could prioritize her Catholic faith, but that it also offered a full scholarship. That meant no big student loans that would force her into an all-consuming, high-paying law firm job after graduation.",
      "Searching for a more accurate way to describe herself, Barrett uses the term \"Steel Magnolia.\"",
      "\"I've done a lot of traditionally feminine things. I have a large family. I've made unconventional choices in that way. And I'm not sorry to be feminine,\" she said. \"But I don't feel like I have to sacrifice that part. I think you can be traditional in some of those ways, and still have grit or the backbone or the spine. I felt like I had the grit.\"",
      "\"Grit\" is a word she uses more than once in the book when talking about strong women she admires, like her great-grandmother, a widow who raised 13 children in a tiny house \"bursting at the seams\" during the Great Depression. \"Somehow she always managed to find the resources, space and time,\" Barrett writes.",
      "Throughout our conversation, I'm struck by something she wrote early in the book, when she mentions advice her father gave to her and her siblings: \"Control your emotions, or your emotions will control you.\"",
      "It's similar to advice Justice Ginsburg liked to share from her mother: \"Don't be distracted by emotions like anger, envy, resentment. These just zap energy and waste time.\" Ginsburg would say her advice came in handy at the Court, because she learned that reacting with \"anger or annoyance will not advance one's ability to persuade.\"",
      "I asked Barrett if she, like Ginsburg, drew on that advice at the Court.",
      "\"Yes, in this job, I think it's part of the tuning out, that I can't let what people say\u2026certainly not affect the decisions that I make, but even affect how I feel,\" she says. \"If I let that in, and then let that affect my mood when I go home or when I'm relating to people, then that needs to be kept out.\"",
      "Having that mindset, Barrett says, is one of the things she's most proud of as justice, because that wasn't how she felt as a young teenager growing up in a family of nine.",
      "\"I felt very conspicuous. We would go into restaurants, and you could see people turning around and counting and looking,\" she says. \"In the preteen and teenage self-conscious years, I thought, I just want to be unnoticed. I'm never gonna have a family that attracts attention.\"",
      "Barrett rarely shows the kind of rhetorical fire or hyperbole some of her colleagues regularly exhibit. Stylistically, as she says, she is no Scalia. But with the Court increasingly under strain as it grapples with dozens of emergency requests from the Trump administration, Barrett exhibited a flash of pique last term, responding to a fiery dissent by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in the case limiting the use of nationwide injunctions.",
      "Jackson, a Biden appointee and the Court's newest member, accused the Court of engaging in \"legalese.\" Barrett, speaking for the majority, responded: \"We will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries with of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself.\"",
      "In the months since, Jackson has only ratcheted up her rhetoric as the Court has issued temporary orders in a range of cases brought by the Trump administration. In one emergency order last month, on whether Mr. Trump could cancel grants to the National Institutes of Health, Jackson impugned the conservatives' motives.",
      "Jackson accused them of having \"no fixed rules\" except \"this Administration always wins\" something Barrett pointed out in an event last month was obviously false. (Just one high-profile example: The Court ruled against the Administration's deportation of Kilmar Albrego Garcia and ordered it to work toward his return to the U.S.)",
      "Still, Barrett insists that kind of language doesn't affect her relationship with Jackson, and that she works to have relationships with all the other justices. She says she enjoys talking about the law with Justice Elena Kagan, also a former law professor who, like Barrett has a more formalistic approach to the law than the Court's two other liberals, even though it leads them to very different places.",
      "In a recent interview, Bari Weiss of The Free Press asked Barrett to give one word for each of her colleagues. For Kagan, Barrett chose \"analytical.\" That's a word she also used in our conversation to describe herself.",
      "\"You can't take it personally, and so I think you just have to understand and see opinions for what they are: disagreements about ideas,\" Barrett said of the dissents. \"I intend my opinions to be about the ideas, not about the people, and I think a big part of life is assuming the best of other people.\"",
      "Barrett doesn't seem like a person who dwells in regret. But she said she saw a \"missed opportunity\" on her cross-country book tour, and she wished she'd emphasized how the emergency orders in the Trump cases are different. Always a teacher, she wants to explain these orders aren't the last word.",
      "\"I don't think the public is really aware this isn't the final decision. If a district court enters a preliminary injunction, and we enter a stay of that preliminary injunction, it's not saying the administration wins,\" she says. \"It's simply saying that the administration\u2026can continue to pursue whatever policy it is, because it has not been finally decided yet.\"",
      "In other words, she says, these interim orders \u2014 whether they're allowing Mr. Trump to cut grants or foreign aid or fire political appointees from federal agencies \u2014 are short-term, preliminary decisions. The Court is allowing Mr. Trump to pursue those policies for now, but if he ultimately loses on the underlying merits, the aid money will have to be spent and the employees reinstated with back pay.",
      "And Mr. Trump, I said, may not win them all?",
      "\"Right,\" Barrett said.",
      "It may look different, I asked, once you're deciding the merits?",
      "\"100 percent,\" she said.",
      "For now, one factor weighing in Mr. Trump's favor is the Court's assessment of the harm caused when unelected judges reflexively block policies enacted by popularly elected representatives. Because litigation can take years to resolve, those policies may never end up taking effect. The harm caused by judicial interference, the Court has explained, is to the democratic process.",
      "\"The case that we always cite is Maryland v. King, and it points out that any time a policy of one of the politically accountable branches or politically accountable state legislatures or governor is stopped, that, in itself, is an irreparable harm because you are affecting the people,\" she says. \"It was the people's preferred policy. The president is the one that they elected. The members of whatever legislature, state or Congress, are the ones that people elected.\"",
      "\"I may disagree, or agree, with whatever choices the people have made in the selection of their representatives,\" she said. \"But the people have made this choice.\"",
      "Beyond the obvious strain on the Court, the unprecedented crush of emergency appeals also has put pressure on lower court judges, and some have complained publicly that the Court's brief orders aren't giving them enough guidance. But Barrett, always methodical, says more guidance at the preliminary stage would come at a cost, raising the risk of locking the Court into its views before it has fully considered the issues.",
      "\"I do think opinions are important,\" she says. \"I don't know that it's always valuable to have an interim opinion that comes before the final opinion.\"",
      "Barrett, like all the justices when speaking in public, is exceedingly careful with her words. She won't discuss any upcoming issues or cases, or give any hint on how the Court may see the underlying merits. Even her book tour seemed like an exercise in not making news, and she succeeded.",
      "But she will have that opportunity soon enough: The justices already have agreed to decide whether Mr. Trump can impose far-ranging tariffs and fire members of certain federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board. In the interim, it's allowing him to pursue tariffs and fire some Biden-appointed commissioners, though not on the Fed. Other cases, including birthright citizenship, are on the horizon.",
      "Beyond the Trump cases, the Court this term also will confront controversial cases on gun rights, voting rights, campaign finance reform and whether students who identify as transgender can play girls sports. The tensions and commentary will not ease anytime soon.",
      "For Barrett, that means staying the course, following her own internal compass and tuning out the noise, because one thing is certain. Whatever the Court decides in any of the cases, she says, \"somebody's going to be mad.\" It's a part of her life now.",
      "\"I just think you have to know who you are,\" she says, \"and make decisions that you decide are right, and stick with your priorities and not worry about the feedback you get from others, whether it's negative or whether it's positive.\"",

The tails side also has the words \"fight fight fight\" emblazoned over Mr. Trump's image.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not take up a bid by Ghislaine Maxwell to overturn her 2021 conviction for sex trafficking.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not take up a bid by Ghislaine Maxwell to overturn her 2021 conviction and 20-year prison sentence for her role in a scheme to sexually exploit and abuse minor girls with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Maxwell's appeal to the high court attracted added attention this summer as the Trump administration came under pressure to release more material related to the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein, who died in federal custody in 2019. Congress also opened its own examination of the federal probe and has obtained and released thousands of pages of records related to Epstein, though many were already in the public domain.",
      "Senior Justice Department officials unsuccessfully petitioned a federal court in New York to unseal grand jury material in Epstein's case, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell in Tallahassee, Florida, in July to discuss her relationship with Epstein and the allegations against her.",
      "The Supreme Court's rejection of Maxwell's case means her conviction and sentence will remain intact, barring a presidential pardon.",
      "At the heart of Maxwell's appeal is a 2007 nonprosecution agreement between the U.S. attorney in Miami and Epstein, which she argued barred her prosecution for sex-trafficking violations.",
      "Epstein's lawyers and then-U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta entered into the deal after a federal investigation into allegations Epstein engaged in sexual abuse of underage girls. In exchange for avoiding federal charges, Epstein agreed to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges and serve an 18-month prison sentence.",
      "The agreement specified that if Epstein fulfilled all of its terms, he would not be prosecuted \"in this district,\" the Southern District of Florida. It also contained a so-called co-conspirators clause, which stated that if Epstein satisfied the deal's conditions, the U.S. would \"not institute any criminal char[g]es against any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including but not limited to\" four of his assistants.",
      "A Justice Department official in West Palm Beach later told the department's Office of Professional Responsibility the provision was \"highly unusual,\" and a former prosecutor who handled the case said she didn't consider that Epstein may have been trying to protect anyone other than his four assistants, according to court records.",
      "Acosta went on to serve as labor secretary during Mr. Trump's first term, but he resigned in 2019 amid scrutiny of his handling of the nonprosecution agreement with Epstein. He stepped down shortly after Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in New York. Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial.",
      "Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein's, was indicted in New York in 2020 and charged with several criminal offenses arising out of her scheme with Epstein. She attempted to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the co-conspirators clause in Epstein's nonprosecution agreement prohibited her prosecution because she was charged as his co-conspirator.",
      "A federal district court rejected Maxwell's effort, finding that the deal bound only the U.S. Attorney's Office in Florida. It also ruled that most of the charges would've fallen outside the scope of the agreement even if it covered the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York.",
      "Maxwell's trial proceeded, and she was found guilty in 2021. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Maxwell had been serving her sentence at a federal correctional facility in Tallahassee, but she was moved to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas after meeting with Blanche, the deputy attorney general, in July.",
      "She appealed her conviction and sentence on several grounds, including that the nonprosecution deal barred her prosecution. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit rejected her claims, ruling that \"nothing in the text of the NPA precluded\" the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan from bringing charges against Maxwell.",
      "Maxwell asked the Supreme Court to take up her case in April, arguing that the co-conspirator clause contained no \"geographic limitation\" on where it could be enforced. Her lawyers said in a filing that a decision from the Supreme Court should ensure that plea deals are enforced consistently throughout the country, \"so that when the United States makes a promise in a plea agreement, it is held to that promise.\"",
      "But the Trump administration urged the Supreme Court not to reconsider Maxwell's conviction and sentence. It noted that Justice Department policy at the time the deal was negotiated prohibited U.S. attorneys from entering into agreements that bound other districts unless they received written approval from those districts or the head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division.",
      "\"There is no indication here that anyone involved in negotiating Epstein's NPA obtained the necessary approval for binding other USAOs or thought it was necessary,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",

      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",

      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",

    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date.

      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "summary": "Americans are concerned about the effect of the shutdown on the economy, amid unease about jobs and inflation.",
    "story": [
      "For many Americans, across party lines, concern over the government shutdown means concern about its potential impact on the economy, among other things.",
      "Therefore, many don't think either party's position is worth having a shutdown over.",
      "Given that, no one is looking especially good politically at the moment. President Trump, congressional Democrats, and Republicans are all net negative on their handling of the shutdown thus far.",
      "Neither party is on very solid footing. The top descriptor Americans pick for the Democratic Party overall is \"weak;\" the party trails the GOP on being described as \"effective\" and \"strong,\" and their favorables trail the GOP's. The top descriptor for Republicans, though, is \"extreme.\"",
      "All of it looks to the public like another distraction from larger matters of concern. A sizable majority of the country says the Trump administration isn't focused enough on lowering prices, and is focused too much on tariffs, as they have been for months. Reflecting some of that, many still describe the president himself as \"energetic,\" but fewer describe him now as \"focused\" than did at the start of his term.",
      "Relatively few Americans say the Democrats' or Republicans' positions are worth a shutdown. As it is still fairly recent, many aren't sure yet.",
      "For the Democrats, only half their rank and file think their party's positions are worth a shutdown, and even fewer Republicans say that of the GOP's positions. That said, they don't blame their respective parties for the situation, either.",
      "There's plenty of that blame to go around. Republicans and the president get relatively more than congressional Democrats, but taken together with Americans who blame both equally, a majority of the country holds all of them responsible.",
      "When asked what the shutdown debate is mainly about, health care is the top response from a list of issues, and those following the matter more closely pick that more often. That may speak to the parties' respective arguments getting at least to their bases.",
      "The percentage very concerned about the impact on the economy is higher than for other items.",
      "People also express concern, to a lesser degree, about the effects of the shutdown on federal employees. Also, the military, transportation and air travel, and Social Security and Medicare, which, even if they are not directly part of the negotiations, likely show that people tend to associate these programs with the government, generally.",
      "Still, overall views and descriptors of the parties aren't positive ones. Each has underwater favorability ratings overall, with the Republicans getting slightly better ratings than the Democrats.",
      "From a list of descriptors of the parties, it's a case of weak (the way most of the nation describes the Democratic Party) versus extreme (the most often-picked label for the GOP).",
      "The Republican Party greatly outpaces the Democrats on being called \"effective\" and \"strong.\"",
      "Over four in 10 rank-and-file Democrats describe their own party as weak.",
      "The economy and the president",
      "Against the backdrop of the shutdown, and helping explain why so many are concerned about its economic impact, inflation and the economy continue to be seen as the nation's top issues. And as has been the case for a while, a large majority says the Trump administration isn't focused enough on lowering prices. And most continue to say it is focused too much on tariffs.",
      "And most say Trump's policies are costing jobs in the U.S., rather than creating jobs.",
      "That's combined with Americans' view that Trump's policies aren't making them better off and are still making prices go up. On balance, the president's handling of inflation, specifically, has ticked down again.",
      "Fewer Americans now describe the president as \"focused\" than did at the start of his second term. His top descriptors remain \"tough\" and \"energetic,\" but the percentage who call him \"effective\" is also down compared to February.",
      "More broadly \u2014 and not specifically related to the shutdown, but perhaps pertinent given that situation \u2014 Americans still say it's Congress, not the president, who should have the most authority over federal spending. That's a view held by majorities of Democrats, independents, and Republicans.",
      "Donald Trump's overall approval rating, at 42%, is now back down to what it was in July, after hitting 44% last month. He remains bolstered by support from his Republican base, and still gets better marks on his deportation program and immigration than on inflation and the economy overall.",
      "At 43%, the president's approval rating on handling the conflict between Israel and Hamas is similar to what it was this summer, and higher than his approval ratings on economic issues. (This polling was conducted before reports of a possible ceasefire deal.)",
      "Troops and U.S. cities",
      "The idea of troops going to U.S. cities remains divisive. It's backed staunchly by the president's Republican base, especially those who identify as MAGA, but finds far less backing beyond it.",
      "Whether it's the National Guard specifically or active-duty military troops going to cities, views are similar. Much of it, beyond the partisan breaks, is tied to where one sees threats to the U.S. originating.",
      "Those who support troops in cities tend to see threats from inside the country, subscribing to some of the arguments made by the administration, that threats are coming from domestic enemies.",
      "But for the majority of Americans who see dangers more from economic forces, or who feel the U.S. military's overall focus ought to be outside the U.S., it is much less so.",
      "For decades now, a majority of Americans have backed having women who serve in the military participating in combat roles, and that continues to be the case today, at three-quarters, a view shared equally by men and women. The quarter of Americans who do not think women in the military should participate in combat roles tend to be more conservative.",

      "President Trump urged negotiators set to meet Monday for crucial talks aimed at ending the war in Gaza to \"move fast\" as hopes for a peace deal grew after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a hostage release could be announced this week.",
      "Tuesday marks two years since the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war.",
      "\"There have been very positive discussions with Hamas, and Countries from all over the World (Arab, Muslim, and everyone else) this weekend, to release the Hostages, end the War in Gaza but, more importantly, finally have long sought PEACE in the Middle East,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday. \"These talks have been very successful, and proceeding rapidly.\"",
      "He added: \"The technical teams will again meet Monday, in Egypt, to work through and clarify the final details. I am told that the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to MOVE FAST. I will continue to monitor this Centuries old 'conflict.' TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE OR, MASSIVE BLOODSHED WILL FOLLOW \u2013 SOMETHING THAT NOBODY WANTS TO SEE!\"",
      "On Friday, Hamas said it had accepted some elements from the U.S.-led peace plan that Mr. Trump outlined last month. Under the plan, Hamas would release the remaining 48 hostages \u2014 about 20 believed to be alive \u2014 within 72 hours. It would also give up power and disarm, which Hamas has not agreed to do.",
      "The delegation led by top Israeli negotiator Ron Dermer will leave Monday for the talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Netanyahu's office said. An Egyptian official said the Hamas delegation had arrived. U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, are joining the talks, a senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Discussions will focus on the proposed exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, Egypt's foreign ministry said.",
      "In a brief statement on Saturday, Netanyahu said he hopes to announce the release of all hostages \"in the coming days\" and that \"our goal is to contain these negotiations to a time frame of a few days.\"",
      "But he signaled there would not be a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, something Hamas has long demanded.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that the release of hostages from Gaza is the \"most emergent and immediate phase\" of the\u00a0peace plan.",
      "\"Beyond that is what happens after that, and that is, how do we ensure that we can create and help build a Gaza free of terrorism, free of Hamas, free of anything like Hamas,\" Rubio said. \"And that's going to take work and some time not just to agree on, but to implement.\"",
      "On the hostages, Rubio said the \"expectation is that this happens quickly,\" though he wasn't clear on a specific deadline. He acknowledged that there are some logistical hurdles, including Israeli bombardment.",
      "\"Reality is, this is a war zone. I mean, this is a place that's suffered a tremendous amount of destruction. That fighting needs to stop,\" Rubio said. \"You can't release hostages while there's still bombardments going on.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It would be extraordinary to end what has been one of Israel's longest and bloodiest wars.",
      "The prime minister said he's only allowing these talks that will be underway in Egypt to go for a few days. What exactly is the deadline for Hamas and the terror groups who are holding hostages? When do they need to release them?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, yeah, so a couple points.",
      "Hamas has \u2013 obviously, look, we're dealing with Hamas, OK? So let's take that with \u2013 for what it is. But they have said that they agree with the president's framework for the release of the hostages. So what those talks should be about \u2013 and some of that conversation is already happening now - - it's not waiting until Monday in Cairo \u2013 is the logistics behind the release of these hostages.",
      "How do you stop the fighting? Who's going to go in and get them? You know, when are they going to be released? Where are they picked up? What are the processes for this? That's what should be \u2013 that's what this conversation should be about at this point, because they've agreed to the framework of it.",
      "Then there's second \u2013 beyond that is, what happens after that? And that is, how do we ensure that we can create a \u2013 and help build a Gaza free of terrorism, free of Hamas, free of anything like Hamas? And that's going to take work and some time, not just to agree on, but to implement.",
      "But that's important, because that's what's going to bring a permanent end to these hostilities in the long term. And so those are the two phases here. But, right now, the most emergent and immediate phase is the one that Hamas claims to have agreed to already, and that is, they are prepared to release the hostages.",
      "Let's discuss through the mediators the logistics and the mechanics behind how that happens. And that has to happen very quickly. That cannot drag on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So my sources have indicated to me that, because the upper echelon of Hamas fighters has been so decimated, communication is difficult. The other terror groups who also hold hostages in Gaza aren't necessarily easily controlled by them.",
      "How do you manage around this reality? And is full release by October 7 the demand?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I don't know about the date. It would be great if it was before October 7. We wish it would have happened yesterday.",
      "But there are realities here, and then there are things people do to impede progress. Reality is, this is a war zone. I mean, this is a place that suffered a tremendous amount of destruction. That fighting needs to stop. You can't release hostages while there's still bombardments going on.",
      "But, at the same time, that can't \u2013 you know, so that has to end, but \u2013 that has to stop. But you also have to work through the other logistics. Who's going to go pick them up? We saw how this happened in the past. You know, the Red Cross would go in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: They would be handed over through this process, et cetera. And so all of that's what has to be worked on and is being worked on as we speak.",
      "So I'm not telling you there aren't some logistical hurdles here, but I am saying that the expectation is, is that this happens quickly. And I would also say that, while we want all the hostages to be released, if there are five that are ready to go right now, they should be released right now. If another 10 are ready to go in 12 hours after that, the next group should come out, but, ultimately, they should all come out.",
      "And I think what you're hearing from people is, yes, there has to be some logistics that have to be worked through. But what you can't have and what we can't see and what we hope we will not see is that we get into these talks, and these talks are then delayed, and it looks like they're unnecessarily delaying it.",
      "That would be a very bad sign. Let's hope that's not what happens. And it's going to be very important for our partners in the region who signed on to this deal, the UAE, Qatar, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, et cetera, for them to be putting a lot of pressure on Hamas to make sure this happens as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you pointed out that releases can't happen when bombardments are underway.",
      "Our CBS team in Gaza tells us that there are Israeli bombardments under way. There were strikes Saturday, tens killed, more injured, bombings continuing. One incident included 10 people killed when they tried to check in on their homes in areas where there are also military sites. Is that acceptable?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think, ultimately, what you're going to see here is that, when an agreement is reached on these are the logistics behind when the release is going to happen, then I think you'll see those bombardments stop.",
      "And I think some of that activity has already decreased somewhat. So, there's a framework here, and the framework is simple. Once you agree on the logistics of how this is going to happen \u2013 I think the Israelis and everyone acknowledge you can't release hostages in the middle of strikes, so the strikes will have to stop, and, as you saw, the president state that very clearly on Friday, where he want \u2013 asked the Israelis to begin to pull back to create the conditions for these releases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this is not a violation of that?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So, look, there's going to be a lot of complexities.",
      "Well, we're trying to get the hostages out. That's the bottom line. We want to get the hostages out as soon as possible. For that to happen, there can't be a war going on in the middle of it, and Hamas has to agree to turn them over and we have to have the right people go in and get them. That's what we're going to focus on right now, and that's what we're going to \u2013 that's what we've been focused on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And that's what the talks are going to be about today, on Monday, on Tuesday, to get this done as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you. There are two phases here, with \u2013 Hamas releasing the hostages is the one you're most focused on. But, big picture, does the United States assess that Israel has so reduced the threat posed by Hamas that it can end combat and transition to the kind of lower tempo counterterrorism campaign that, say, the United States carries out against terrorist threats to this country?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, look, I mean, the ideal outcome here is, you don't have to carry out any counterterror missions because there are no terrorists in Gaza because Gaza is governed by Palestinian technocrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But can they take the win? Can Netanyahu say he won this war?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, that \u2013 creating a Gaza \u2013 or setting up a Gaza that is governed by Palestinian technocrats that are not terrorists and are not sponsoring terrorism, that's not going to happen in 72 hours.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's going to take some time to build up, and it's going to require a lot of work and a lot of international support.",
      "And that's the end goal here of this entire endeavor, after you get the hostages out. By the way, if you can't get the hostages out, you have no hope of getting that done. So that's why I say, you know, that that \u2013 these two steps need to happen.",
      "But it's going to take a lot of hard work and time. You know, you're trying to build something that doesn't exist right now, which is a sort of civilian Palestinian leadership that's not tied to terrorism. That doesn't exist right now. It's going to take a lot of help from international partners.",
      "That's why having the countries in the region and the Europeans and all others involved in this in both money and resources, that's why building that coalition is so critical. And then implementing it is not going to be easy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's going to take some time here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But I think, certainly, for the first time in a long time, you see the framework and the outlines of something that could work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But combat operations can end?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, that's the goal here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, you wouldn't need combat operations if there weren't terrorists there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But, by the same token, I would remind everybody, if, in fact, at the end of all this terrorism and a terrorist group remains active inside of Gaza, you're not going to have peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's the fundamental truth here that everyone needs to accept.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: You're never going to have peace in Gaza as long as there are terrorists operating from that territory threatening the security of Israel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But in terms of occupation and combat operations, that's different than a counterterrorism campaign.",
      "But let me ask you specifically what President Trump said. He told Barak Ravid of Axios that Prime Minister Netanyahu \u2013 quote \u2013 \"took it very far, and Israel lost a lot of support in the world. Now I'm going to get all that support back.\"",
      "At what point did President Trump decide that Netanyahu took this fight in Gaza or his operations throughout the Middle East, when did he take it too far?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think the president's \u2013 OK, the president's observation, basically, is that because of the length of this war and how it's gone \u2013 we've all seen the international narrative.",
      "We've all seen it. Whether we agree with it or not, we have seen countries like the U.K., Australia, Canada and others come out and sort of signal support for \u2013 or announce support for a Palestinian state. We have seen, even in our own domestic politics, some of the attacks on Israel.",
      "We don't forget what happened on October 7.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's the other thing the president repeatedly points to, is, remember October 7.",
      "But the implic \u2013 whether we agree with it or not, we have seen the impact that this has had on Israel's global standing. And I think that's the point the president is making here, is that, whether you believe it was justified or not, right or not, that we \u2013 you cannot ignore the impact that this has had on Israel's global standing.",
      "That said, if we never want to see this happen again, meaning a war like this, you can never have another October 7 or anything like it ever happen again. And that's the thing the president has reiterated and repeatedly made clear to our partners in the region, and that is, if you truly want peace and stability and a better future for the Palestinian people, then there has to be a Gaza that is not governed or controlled in any way, shape or form by Hamas or anything that looks like Hamas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Does the United States support a Palestinian state? Because point 19 in your White House plan talks about a credible pathway to Palestinian self- determination and statehood.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, again, we've always said \u2013 I mean, this has been a consistent position throughout \u2013 that the only way you're ever going to have anything that looks like statehood is in a negotiated deal with the Israelis. We are so far from that right now.",
      "A pathway means, yes, you're going to\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but Prime Minister Netanyahu opposes\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 a Palestinian state and thanked President Trump for speaking against recognition of one. That's why I'm asking you to clarify.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, we haven't recognized a Palestinian state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The United States has not. And, right now, there's no point in doing that\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the U.S. want to see one?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 because it's not even possible. That's not even a realistic thing right now, because who \u2013 who would govern that Palestinian state, Hamas?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's point 19 in your plan\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Who would govern it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 I thought.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, but that's talking about a pathway long term and in the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But one of the \u2013 before you can even get there, OK, that's \u2013 you know, before you can even get there, you have to have someone to turn that land \u2013 Israel's made clear they have no interest in governing Gaza, they have no interest in occupying Gaza long term and being the government of Gaza.",
      "I think Israel \u2013 I can't speak for Israel, but I think Israel would tell you they would love to turn over Gaza to a Palestinian organization that isn't terroristic. They would love to do that. But that doesn't exist right now. That has to be built, and that's going to take time.",
      "You're not going to build that in 72 hours. You're not going to build that in 72 weeks. I mean, it's going to take some time to get to that point. So that's the pathway this discusses. And I think, if you look forward into the future, where there is suddenly a Palestinian government-like organization that can govern territory, then there's a lot of possibilities.",
      "But that has to be negotiated and agreed to by Israel. In the end, it's very simple. There can be peace in Gaza. There can be Palestinian governance in Gaza, whether you call it statehood or something else, as long as it is not terrorists that are in charge of that territory.",
      "That's what Israel agreed to when they turned over Gaza in the first place, and then Hamas took over Gaza and turned it into a terrorist camp, and that's what's led us to the point that we are at today. So if we can get off that road and onto a different road, there are a lot of possibilities long term and in the future, but right now\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So maybe?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 we are far from that. Right now, we \u2013 we need to get these hostages out, and we just need technocrats that are not terrorists to be able to begin the basic reconstruction of Gaza.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That interview was taped earlier today.",
      "With the camera off, Secretary Rubio clarified that President Trump still opposes Israeli annexation of the West Bank, though there is no mention of the occupied territory in the 20-point White House peace plan.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the government shutdown now in its fifth day.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson joins us from Capitol Hill.",
      "Good morning to you, Speaker. Anyone up there to negotiate with?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-Louisiana): There's not, Margaret.",
      "Good morning. Good to hear your voice.",
      "It's kind of quiet around here. It has been for the last several days, and it's very unfortunate, because, as we're talking, real people are being adversely affected around the country, and some in \u2013 in very substantial ways.",
      "I pray that more Democrats in the Senate will come to their senses and do the right thing, and when they have the next opportunity on Monday to vote to open the government, I surely hope that they will.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you did send your lawmakers home to their districts, which suggests we've got probably another week ahead of us of this shutdown.",
      "You mentioned the real-world impact. Federal workers, including our military, would miss their first paychecks October 15 or 16. How long should workers plan to be without that income?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, the only person who can answer that question is your next guest. And that's Chuck Schumer, because the House did its job. The reason that House Republicans are home working in their districts, and I suspect House Democrats should be as well, is because we did that.",
      "We passed a bipartisan, very clean continuing resolution a couple of weeks back now, and sent it to the Senate. It's very important to note what was in that. It was only 24 pages in length, Margaret. It was a good faith effort to keep the government open for seven more weeks so that Republicans and Democrats, in a bipartisan fashion, could work together to fund the government with the appropriations process.",
      "Chuck Schumer always voted for those in the past. In fact, he did it 13 times during the four years of the Biden administration, but now suddenly he's commanding his Democrats in the Senate not to do it. And there's one simple reason why. They need political cover from the far left corner of the base.",
      "He's afraid, Chuck Schumer individually \u2013 ask him about it \u2013 he's afraid he's going to get a challenge from the Marxist left in his party, because that's the new wave in New York. That's what this is about. Chuck Schumer is trying to show a fight against the president and Republicans, and real Americans are being harmed in the process of this political game.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Well, Democrats, as you know, want to have another conversation in regard to extending some tax subsidies that lower the cost of some health care that's purchased through the Obamacare market.",
      "To that point, though, you're talking about the politics of this. Our CBS polling that we released today shows neither party's stance is viewed as worth shutting down this government.",
      "The Democrats want to talk about the tax credits. You know premium pricing is already being set now, even if this doesn't expire until end of the year. Your fellow Republican Jen Kiggans said: \"Raising costs for families with little notice and potentially stripping them of access to care is simply unacceptable.\"",
      "Doesn't she have a point here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: There's a lot of points to be made on that, and we're ready to talk about, negotiate and do all of that.",
      "But they're trying to create that as a red herring here right now. Margaret, this is a funding bootstrap measure, a very simple, very conventional thing that's been done here all the time. This is the way it works now. We need a little more time on the clock to finish the appropriations process. We have plenty of time to debate that very complicated issue.",
      "It's not a simple one. There has to be reforms to that subsidy, because there's a lot of fraud, waste and abuse involved in it. There's a \u2013 there's 535 members of Congress in the House and Senate. There's a \u2013 there's probably 400 different ideas on how to fix that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: But we need a little time to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: We're not saying that we won't negotiate it. We're saying, turn the lights back on in Congress, get troops paid, TSA agents and Border Patrol agents paid who are trying to protect us.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: I'm telling you my position. I'm the speaker of the House. What I have to do is draw consensus among 435 members of my body. I don't get out and project what the final conclusion is going to be.",

      "But we can't when Chuck Schumer keeps voting to shut the government down for political reasons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: That's purely and simply what's happening here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe you have time here, but our partner at health policy think tank KFF reported 80 percent of all premium tax credits went to Obamacare enrollees in Trump-won states, red states.",
      "Do you really \u2013 do worry at all that this stance could backfire, that waiting to talk about the tax credit could hurt you and could hurt your voters?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No, because \u2013 no, no, because we have time to do it. Again, the funding doesn't run out until December 31. We're talking about a September 30 deadline that's now passed to keep the government open so that Republicans and Democrats can have that very debate.",
      "Chuck Schumer has shut it off because he needs a political argument right now. One hundred percent, Margaret, that's what this is about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Play the tape. Play the tape of Chuck Schumer saying consistently for the last 30 years\u2026",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: They're making this up. That is a red herring. They're trying to \u2013 they're trying to say that this fight right now is about that. That wasn't even a fight. It's a joke. Call him on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the director of the Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, was on another network this morning, and said it is up to the president of the United States to decide when the mass layoffs will begin.",
      "He seems to be indicating the president is using those RIFs, those reduction in force threats, as leverage here. Do you know how quickly those layoffs will start?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: I don't know. I anticipate it will have to be soon, because Chuck Schumer turned off the funding sources and whomever is the chair of the Office\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want that as leverage?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No, nor \u2013 neither does the president. No, the president wants the government open. He's pleaded with Schumer and Hakeem in person in his office to do that, and they said no, because they want to do this.",

Go to speaker.gov and see it for yourself, page 57, Section 2141. They're using this for political games, and it is shameful, and real people are getting hurt.",

      "Good morning to you, Leader.",
      "I want to pick up on something the speaker of the House was pointing to. He wants this fight to be about illegals, as he said. And I want to be specific here because we know from our research that there is no federal money that goes towards health care tax credits for undocumented immigrants in this country. The federal government doesn't fund health insurance for the undocumented. But it is also true that states, like yours, New York, does provide health care for people who are in this country illegally. And their argument seems to be the money here is fundable and bottom line is it comes out of the federal pocket. Do you want to respond to that?",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): You know, they don't want to \u2013 Johnson doesn't want to discuss the real issue, the health care crisis facing the American people, so he puts up all these fake lies to try and divert attention. It's his standard operation. He's just is concerned with the politics.",
      "Every independent agency that looks at this says Johnson's claim is false. And just as you said, Margaret, no, zero federal dollars can go to undocumented immigrants through Medicare, Medicaid, through ACA. And so, we ought to be talking about the real issue here, which is that we have a health care crisis in America, caused by the Republicans. They've \u2013 they've barreled us towards a shutdown because they don't want to deal with that crisis, plain and simple.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's talk about the shutdown in a moment. In terms of health care, where you \u2013 you've taken us in terms of the messaging, Democrats, as I understand it, are looking for an extension of those Obamacare tax credit. I believe you'd like them permanently. You heard the speaker say, we can talk about that after the government is reopened, perhaps not permanently. But do you hear any kind of opening here for a negotiation whatsoever?",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Well, right now, not. Look, Johnson's not serious about this. He sent his \u2013 all his congressmen home last week and home this week. How you going to negotiate when they're all there.",

      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: And he's \u2013 well, no, you need \u2013 no, you actually need Johnson. If you're going to negotiate any agreement, you need Johnson, Thune, Trump, Schumer, and Jeffries. And the reason he sent them home is because he's more interested in protecting the Epstein files than protecting the American people from the health care crisis.",
      "We've been trying for months and months to sit down with him and have a serious conversation addressing America's health care needs. And they've refused and refused and refused. And just on your show, and on other shows, when they ask him, well, will you do it in January.",

And it doesn't \u2013 and, by the way, the crisis doesn't start in January. Two days ago, starting October 1st, millions of Americans are getting notices that their health care premiums are going \u2013 dramatically increasing. If you're a 55-year-old couple and you pay \u2013 make $80,000, you know how much your premiums will go up if we don't extend it? It will go up something like $25,000. The average American will pay $900 more.",

      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Look, it's a Republican shutdown because they have refused to talk with us. Johnson, I saw him mentioned that we did it 13 times when I was majority leader. That's true. You know why? In every case we sat down and talked with the Republicans, and there was a give and take, and then both sides didn't get everything they wanted, but we got it done. They have refused to talk to us even once. And Jeffries and I have been trying to get them to talk to us for \u2013",

Republican president, Republican Senate, Republican House, that they have a responsibility to governor, which means sit down and talk with us so we can address these needs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But back to the question of defections. Leader Thune was on another network, on Fox, and he said there are conversations with Democrats who want to find an offramp here. Is he having conversations with Democrats other than you? Are you sure you can't \u2013 will you have defections?",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: I've \u2013 I've encouraged my \u2013 yes, Margaret, I've encouraged my Democratic members to sit and talk to Republicans. It's always good when Democrats and Republicans talk to each other.",
      "But two points. First, in those conversations, the Republicans offered nothing. And \u2013 but second, the only way this will ultimately be solved is if five people sit together in a room and solve it. They are the president, who also doesn't seem serious about this. You know, he's putting out his memes and his things with the grim reaper and all of that stuff, and he's playing golf.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Johnson's not serious. And so, we've got to sit down, the five of us. That's the way to solve this problem. But when Democrats talk to Republicans, it's a good thing. And I've encouraged my Democrats to do it, but they've offered us nothing. No change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you tried calling President Trump? He seems to take phone calls directly.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Well, you know, we sat \u2013 we tried to get President Trump to sit down with us weeks ago, long before the shutdown date started.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no. OK.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: He said \u2013 he said, yes. He said, no. Johnson told him to say no. We sat down the \u2013 you know, the day before, and he wasn't serious. He put these red hats on the table, and he's joking around. And honestly, in the meeting, Margaret, I got the feeling he didn't even know what was happening, that the crisis was impending, that people would pay such a \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: The American people are hearing what's happening, and they are demanding that we address this crisis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: They are demanding we sit down together and do it. It's just logical. They are \u2013 say that, you know, in your survey that you put out \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: They say that 75 percent of people feel Trump isn't doing enough. Another survey by \"The Washington Post\" showed not only did 80 percent of the American people want us to extend these credits, but 55 percent of Trump voters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, our \u2013 our \u2013",

      "Good morning, and good to have you here in person.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I have to ask you about what the president announced yesterday in regard to federalizing 300 National Guardsmen out in the state of Illinois. We've heard this threat going back all the way to August. The governor says these are not needed. Do you have any idea when they'll arrive?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I believe they're going to be Illinois national guardsmen, so they're not going to be coming from out of state. I spoke to our governor yesterday, and it looks like it's going to be about 300 Illinois guardsmen who will be activated against the governor's wishes. So, they'll be \u2013 they'll be homegrown Illinoisans. And they're our brothers and sisters, our neighbors. I probably served with quite a number of them, certainly the leadership, and, you know, they'll be home. We'll \u2013 we'll welcome them.",
      "It's a misuse of the National Guard. They're \u2013 they're not needed in this particular role. If President Trump really wanted to fight crime, then maybe he should stop defunding the police. He, you know, he diverted $800 million in crime prevention efforts away from \u2013 that was appropriated away from funding for our police officers. So, you know, I \u2013 I \u2013 they're not needed, but we're going to welcome them because they're our brothers and sisters, and we're proud of our National Guard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He has surged \u2013 or the federal government has surged agents from different groups. The FBI said yesterday they're sending folks in. Tell me about these protests. Because the \u2013 the images look pretty intense of what has happened in \u2013 between people on the streets of Chicago \u2013 we're showing some of that video now \u2013 around immigration issues. As I understand, yesterday, ICE authorities shot a Chicago woman in the Brighton Park area. Secretary Noem claimed ICE fired defensive shots at this woman, who was armed who had appeared in a border patrol intelligence bulletin previously. She claims that federal agents were surrounded and were threatened. What are local authorities telling you about what they think happened here?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, they lie, right? The Trump administration lies. We have a president who's a known liar. And they have been \u2013 they have been lying about the situation all along. And, in fact, they even shot tear grenades \u2013 tear gas grenades, I think, at a reporter who was simply driving by with her window open. And so, we are \u2013 we're urging people, we're urging our protesters, remain calm, peaceful protests, exercise your First Amendment rights, but videotape everything. Everybody has a phone. Tape everything so that we actually have real evidence of what is happening.",
      "We know the Trump administration lies consistently. And what I am hearing is that, for the large part, people are being very quite \u2013 are being very respectful, but ICE is being very aggressive. Remember that they are zip- tieing children. They are raiding apartment blocks in the middle of the night, separating children from their families, pulling people out on to the streets naked. They are using Gestapo tactics in Chicago. And this is what Trump wants to, right? He wants to intimidate the people of Chicago. That's not going to happen. And we're going to document everything and make sure, just as the judge in Portland said that these \u2013 these requirements, these orders from the Trump administration are not actually tied to reality.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about President Trump's directive to send Oregon National Guard troops into Portland, and the judge said that \u2013 untethered to the facts.",
      "But in this case, I mean the Homeland Security adviser says, \"there's a large and growing movement of left wing terrorism organized and funded.\" They're posting on Homeland Security images of snipers. So, we're not talking troops, we're talking about federal agents that are carrying out some of this right now. Have you seen any evidence of \u2013 of what Stephen Miller is describing here in terms of organization and targeting of federal agents?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: No, not at all. This is \u2013 it's simply not happening. They are lying. And so, if anybody is targeting anyone, it is out of control ICE agents targeting, again, zip-tieing children, throwing reporters onto the ground, separating children from their mothers, trying to convince schools to turn over kids from public schools. They are raging through the streets of Chicago trying to intimidate everyday, ordinary citizens who are just trying to go to school and go to work. That's not \u2013 that's not what America is about. And it is shameful that the president of the United States has instigated this in one of its greatest cities. He should be defending the city. He should be protecting the city. Send us the federal dollars that were appropriated in a bipartisan way to support law enforcement. They took money away from law enforcement officers, child prevention effort \u2013 violence against children prevention efforts. They \u2013 they've literally \u2013 this president has defunded the police.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that is counter, their message at least. But on the message around the military, I want to ask you about what happened at Quantico and just \u2013 so our viewers are clear, you serve on Armed Services, but you retired from the National Guard. You were a lieutenant colonel.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Twenty-three years. Proud of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Black Hawk helicopter pilot in Iraq. You served in combat. Secretary Hegseth told senior military leaders just a few days ago, he doesn't want to prevent women from serving, but he's now going to require everyone meet the male standard.",
      "Let's listen to that.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "PETE HEGSETH, SECRETARY OF WAR: When it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender neutral. If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How did you hear those remarks? And how do you think female service people heard them?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, this is the least qualified secretary of defense in our nation's history. And he's questioning the ability of the women who actually qualified to do their \u2013 to do their jobs. The female rangers, the female that graduated from SEAL school have met those highest standards. And by the way, he \u2013 he is obfuscating a little bit because there are different male standards. The standard for a 45-year-old man is not the same as an 18-year-old man. So, he doesn't actually talk about that. He has long sought to push women out of the military. And, frankly, our military could not do its job of protecting America and keeping us safe without the women who serve in the military.",
      "If you look at some lessons we learned in Afghanistan, for example, the lionesses, the Marine Corps group of women who actually went on patrol, all female units, that actually was able to get intelligence from women, Afghani women, to get information on the enemy. Frankly, you've got the least qualified secretary of defense in the nation's history who wastes taxpayer dollars on a regular basis doing things like bringing in general and flag officers to be an audience for his dog and pony show, using them as little toy soldiers, when they should be out there, at their units, in command, doing their jobs.",

      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES (Retired Former Commanding General, U.S. Army in Europe): Thank you very much, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick \u2013 pick up where we left off with Senator Duckworth, who is a Purple Heart recipient for her time serving this country in combat.",
      "Men and women have different basic fitness standards. The secretary, in his remarks at Quantico, said women \u2013 or he suggested women were being given a pass or were held to lower standards for fitness requirements. Do you think his change to the, quote/unquote, \"male standard\" is necessary?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: I think this is completely unnecessary. I have 38 years in the Army, and we've served with women in all sorts of different environments and deployments. And I never had a case where a female soldier was not able to do what she had to do. So, this is a \u2013 seems to me an unnecessary, almost a medieval approach that doesn't reflect the requirements that we have for women and men who are intelligent, able to operate in a modern battlefield environment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The defense secretary made these remarks at Quantico last week, as you well know, ordered in our most senior military officers to hear him lay out what he talked about in terms of changing rules of engagement. Those, you know, codes of conduct and standards, to make war less brutal. The secretary said this.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "PETE HEGSETH, SECRETARY OF WAR: We also don't fight with stupid rules of engagement. We untie the hands of our war fighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt, and kill the enemies of our country. No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement, just common sense, maximum lethality and authority for war fighters.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you make of \u2013 of those directives to officers?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: Well, that's \u2013 that's not going to help anybody accomplish their mission. I mean when you think about the mission that we had in Afghanistan, for example, and I think that's where some of his experience comes from, it was to protect Afghan civilians so that they could reestablish government and secure themselves. And so it was not about how many Taliban could you kill. We had already tried that, and that didn't work.",
      "So, the rules of engagement are not politically correct. They're not intended to make it harder for soldiers or units to do their job. They actually are part of the mission. Why are we there? And so, I don't have any experience where killing a lot of innocent people, or violating the Geneva Convention, is going to help accomplish the mission.",
      "I think that the idea that we should \u2013 that somehow it's going to make us better and more effective by people not having to worry about the law is going to be bad for us in the long-term as well, both psychologically for soldiers, but also the trust of the American people and of our allies in American forces, where we have always lived up to international law. And that was where a lot of the respect came from. We do not want to be like the Russian army, and they certainly don't worry about rules of engagement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Geneva Conventions are something that the secretary, as a private citizen, wrote about in his book and questioned whether they should be followed at all. He said, \"what if we treated the enemy the way they treated us? And if we\" \u2013 I mean he talked about al Qaeda and using some of their tactics, \"rip their arms off, feed them to the hogs.\" I mean, this sounds tough, but in terms of practice, does it risk the lives of \u2013 of those who are the trigger pullers, those who are on the ground, to have this message delivered from the highest levels?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: Well, listen, first of all, the Geneva Conventions were constructed starting in 1949 after the Second World War. And they were intended to protect innocent people, helpless people, noncombatants from the ravages of war, as it did happen in the Second World War. And I don't think anybody would say that Dwight Eisenhower was woke. And here he was, he was chief of staff of the Army, and then supreme allied commander, and then president. So, this was during his time that the United States helped create and sign the Geneva Convention. So, here's a guy with more combat experience and wartime experience than almost anybody.",
      "Now, the \u2013 when you think about modern warfare, especially when you're counterterrorism, just as Secretary Rubio was describing earlier on your program, the people \u2013 how \u2013 how you deal with the enemy and how you deal with populations is how you defeat an insurgency. And killing everybody in sight is not how you defeat an insurgency.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As defense secretary, Hegseth fired the top military lawyers who advise on lethality. Here's some of the advice he gave to senior leaders this week.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "PETE HEGSETH, DEFENSE SECRETARY: You kill people and break things for a living.",
      "In this profession, you feel comfortable inside the violence so that our citizens can live peacefully. Lethality is our calling card and victory our only acceptable end state.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think that means?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: Well, first of all, it's not connected to the reality of how these things happen, how wars are won. First of all, the political leadership has to describe the end state. What is \u2013 what is it we're going to do? Why are we sending troops somewhere? What are they supposed to accomplish? And usually it's not going to be by killing everybody in sight. So, I think \u2013 I think there's a disconnect between this idea that it's all about lethality and that we kill people and break things. That's \u2013 that's not the mantra of any Army unit I was ever in, in 38 years. It was always about, accomplish the mission that was assigned to us, carry out every lawful order, and do it in such a way that protects civilians and ensures that all of our soldiers are protected and come back home safe. This idea of break things and kill people, you know, that's what the Russians did in Bucha and Mariupol. That's not who we are. We're the soldiers of a free, democratic country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president also spoke at that gathering. He referred to \"the enemy within.\" He also spoke about using \"U.S. cities, like Chicago, as training grounds.\" Are \u2013 are you comfortable with people thinking that?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: Well, look, I think, first of all, U.S. military \u2013 our fellow citizens should be confident that the U.S. military will always carry out lawful orders. And so it's alarming when all of the Judge Advocate General, or the Army \u2013 or the military lawyers are sacked, are sent away because commanders do need to have legal counsel as they receive orders and they look at these complex situations. But our \u2013 our troops will carry out lawful orders.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Thank you.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: I guarantee you that no soldier wants to have to use force against American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lieutenant General, thank you for your insights. We have to leave it there.",

      "Washington \u2014 Congressional leaders traded blame for the government shutdown on Sunday as the stalemate over how to reopen the government stretched into another week without progress on negotiations.",
      "The Senate is set to reconvene Monday after dueling measures to fund the government fell short of the necessary support for a fourth time on Friday, showing no sign of movement from either party. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson canceled plans for the lower chamber return to Washington this week in an effort to increase pressure on the Senate.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that \"the House did its job\" by passing a measure last month that would fund the government until Nov. 21, saying the reason House Republicans will remain in their districts this week is \"because we did that.\"",
      "\"I pray that more Democrats in the Senate will come to their senses and do the right thing, and when they have the next opportunity on Monday to vote to open the government. I surely hope that they will,\" Johnson said.",
      "The House-passed measure first failed in the Senate on Sept. 19, with all but one Democrat opposing in favor of a separate measure to fund the government through October that also includes Democrats' health care priorities. Then, as the government was hours from shutting down last week, the Senate voted again on the measure, when two more senators crossed the aisle to vote with Republicans in favor. But support for the bill still remained shy of the 60-votes required in the Senate.",
      "Since then, Senate Republicans have been seeking to peel off Democratic support for their measure, while Democratic leaders have remained firm in their demand that a funding measure include an extension of health insurance tax credits. And in subsequent votes on Wednesday and Friday, Republicans were unable to pick up more support from Democrats on their bill.",
      "Johnson said Republicans are ready to negotiate on the health insurance tax credits, but he said it's a complicated issue that will take time to address, pointing to possible reforms aimed at weeding out \"a lot of fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "\"We're not saying that we won't negotiate it,\" Johnson said. \"We're saying turn the lights back on in Congress.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" argued that Johnson is \"not serious\" about negotiating the health care issue, pointing to his move to keep the House away from Washington this week. And the New York Democrat urged that the only way the funding impasse will be resolved is with a meeting between congressional leaders and the president.",
      "\"We've been trying for months and months to sit down with them and have a serious conversation addressing America's healthcare needs, and they've refused and refused and refused,\" Schumer said.",
      "Schumer and Johnson, along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, met with President Trump last week. But the meeting failed to produce an agreement to avert a shutdown ahead of the deadline. Schumer said Sunday that Mr. Trump \"wasn't serious\" in the meeting, after which the president posted what appeared to be an AI-generated video mocking the Democratic leaders.",
      "\"The American people know that they're in charge \u2014 Republican president, Republican Senate, Republican House \u2014 that they have a responsibility to govern, which means sit down and talk with us so we can address these needs,\" Schumer said.",

      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",

      "October's supermoon is the first of three this year. It happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. The subtle difference happens a few times a year, sometimes coinciding with other astronomical events such as lunar eclipses.",
      "\"It's not really very unusual,\" said Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer with the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",
      "Everyone in the world can see a supermoon without special equipment, if the skies are clear. But the difference can be tough to discern, especially if people haven't observed the regular moon on the nights leading up.",

      "The spectacles continue in 2026 with two lunar eclipses: a total eclipse across much of North America, Asia and Australia in March, and a partial one in August across the Americas, Africa and Europe.",
      "Why does the moon appear bigger and brighter during a supermoon?",
      "Like Earth's orbit around the Sun, the moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical, or oval-shaped. This means it's positioned at different distances from the planet depending on the time of the month. The distances range from about 226,000 miles and 251,000 miles, according to NASA.",
      "When the moon is hovering around one of those closer distances along its path in orbit, and there's also a full moon, it becomes a supermoon. The proximity to Earth can make the moon appear bigger to skywatchers on the ground. Sunlight reflecting off the moon can also appear brighter, NASA says.",
      "Supermoons only happen three or four times a year, since the moon's closeness to Earth rarely coincides with monthly full moons. They aren't identical, either. Astronomers generally consider a full moon to be \"super\" if the moon's position in orbit is at least 90% of the distance from its farthest point to Earth in the ellipse to its closest.

      "Just 310 miles wide and invisible to the naked eye, the white, scar-covered Enceladus is one of hundreds of moons orbiting the sixth planet from the sun.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed Enceladus was too far away from the sun \u2014 and therefore too cold \u2014 to be habitable.",
      "Then the Cassini space probe flew past the moon several times during a 2004-2017 trip to Saturn and its rings, discovering evidence that a vast saltwater ocean is concealed under the moon's miles-thick layer of ice.",
      "Since then, scientists have been sifting through the data collected by Cassini, revealing that the ocean has many of the elements thought to be needed to host life, including salt, methane, carbon dioxide and phosphorus.",
      "When the spacecraft passed over the moon's south pole, it discovered jets of water bursting through cracks on the surface.",
      "These jets were propelling tiny ice particles \u2014 smaller than grains of sand \u2014 into space. While some of these ice grains fell back to the moon's surface, others collected around one of Saturn's many rings.",
      "When Cassini flew through Saturn's outermost \"E\" ring, it was \"detecting samples from Enceladus all the time,\" Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at the Free University of Berlin and lead author of the new study, said in a statement from the European Space agency.",
      "\"There are many possible pathways from the organic molecules we found in the Cassini data to potentially biologically relevant compounds, which enhances the likelihood that the moon is habitable,\" Nozair said.",
      "By looking through these samples, scientists had previously identified numerous organic molecules \u2014 including the precursors of amino acids, which are fundamental building blocks of life.",
      "But these ice grains could have been altered after being trapped in the ring for hundreds of years \u2014 or beaten up by blasts of cosmic radiation.",

      "But this confirmation provides \"another piece in the puzzle,\" she added.",
      "It also shows that recent technology such as artificial intelligence allows scientists to perform new kinds of analysis on old data, she said.",
      "But to get the best idea about what is happening on Enceladus, a mission would need to land near the icy geysers and collect samples, she added.",
      "The European Space Agency has been studying the potential of a mission that would do just that.",
      "After all, \"Enceladus ticks all the boxes to be a habitable environment that could support life,\" the agency said in the statement.",

According to Hinote, \"If we have to fight China, we're likely doing it in their front yard, and that means they can bring many, many more things to bear than we can, because it's so far away. You're having to achieve kill ratios of 10 to 1, 15 to 1, and 20 to 1 to even stay in the game.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do these war games come out when American pilots are going up against 20 to 1 odds?\"",
      "\"The war games don't turn out very well,\" Hinote replied. \"We lose.\"",
      "The Air Force is counting on AI drones to even the odds, by bringing to an aircraft what a human pilot doesn't. McMullen said, \"The big thing with artificial intelligence is the ability to handle large amounts of data. A human out in a complex air combat environment, there's just no way to absorb all of it. Artificial intelligence might be able to take all of the data information, and then process that very quickly, and then make real-time decisions.\"",
      "AI drones will be about half the length of a manned jet fighter, and one-quarter the cost \u2013 $20 to 30 million each. Hinote said, \"You could buy more airplanes, put them in the field, and still not break the bank. The key would be that you don't have to bring the human operator home; you actually can take more risk.\"",
      "Spain says the Air Force expects to have 150 AI-piloted aircraft by the end of the decade, and eventually up to 1,000.",
      "I asked, \"These drones aren't just going to sit in a hangar waiting for war with China. What are they going to do in peacetime?\"",
      "\"It's pretty wide open,\" Spain replied.",
      "\"Could you send up AI drones to intercept those Russian bombers that come down off the coast of Alaska?\"",
      "\"Yes, you could do that,\" he said.",
      "Those intercepts can turn nasty in an instant. Last year a Russian fighter rocked an American F-16, so AI drones would have to be prepared to shoot.",
      "So, is AI going to be making life-or-death decisions? \"Absolutely not,\" said Spain. \"Absolutely not. The human who's controlling the AI will make the life-and-death decisions.\"",
      "At least for now.",
      "Making life-or-death decisions",
      "Hinote said, \"Increasingly militaries around the world, including the United States military, are going to be pressured to give the machines more leeway in making those life-or-death decisions.\"",
      "Including the capability to fire on their own? \"The United States military is investing in the experimentation that you would need to be able to produce the types of platforms that could fire on their own if you gave them that option,\" Hinote said.",
      "If adversaries let AI make those decisions, what happens? \"I think they do so at their own peril,\" said Spain. \"Because the AI can be fooled, the AI can be overwhelmed. It can give you false outcomes. We've seen that AI can hallucinate. So, it's not a guarantee of success. What it guarantees is that it will do something quickly.\"",
      "\"Don't you at least have to give your pilots that option?\" I asked.",
      "\"To go full autonomy and just let it go? I don't think America is comfortable with that yet,\" Spain replied. \"I'm not saying that couldn't be a future world that we live in where we trust it. But I don't think we're there right now, certainly, and certainly not to start. We have to build that trust over time.\"",
      "At Top Gun AI, pilots keep putting in the reps, test flight after test flight, simulation after simulation, to build that trust.",
      "Asked whether he would rather go into combat with a human wingman or an AI wingman, McMullen replied, \"When we're talking about the threats of tomorrow, if I can send an uncrewed asset into a high-risk environment, I'd rather do that than send a human pilot.\"",

      "The app, which is free, relies on crowdsourcing to track ICE agents, with the company noting that it allows people to report sightings of ICE activities \"within a 5 mile radius of your current location.\" The app crossed 1 million downloads a month ago, the developer said.

      "\"We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps,\" Apple said in a statement. \"Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store.\"",

      "\"We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store \u2014 and Apple did so,\" Bondi said. \"ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed. This Department of Justice will continue making every effort to protect our brave federal law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe.\"",
      "ICEBlock is one of a number of apps designed to let users track and anonymously report immigration agents.

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 17:54:48 -0400",
    "summary": "Dutch producer pitches her AI creation, Tilly Norwood, as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says several agents are vying to represent it.",
    "story": [
      "Like thousands of actors, Tilly Norwood is looking for a Hollywood agent. Her greatest role? Pretending to be human.",
      "That's because Tilly Norwood is a 100% AI-generated product, created by Dutch producer and comedian Eline Van der Velden, founder of a company named Xicoia, which bills itself as the world's first artificial intelligence talent studio. Velden pitches her AI creation as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says there are several agents vying to represent it, CBS News' Jo Ling Kent reported recently.",
      "Since Velden launched the digital character's prospective career, Tilly Norwood has been all the talk in Hollywood.",
      "But not in a good way. Guilds, actors and filmmakers have met the Xicoia product with an immediate wave of backlash, protesting that artificial intelligence should not have a starring role in the acting profession. In a statement Tuesday, the Screen Actors Guild said that \"creativity is, and should remain, human-centered.\"",
      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, who starred in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Goonies,\" and was recently elected president of SAG-AFTRA, also emphasized how AI actors are artificial constructs trained off of work by real performers.",
      "\"You're made up of stuff that doesn't belong to you,\" he told CBS News. \"Let's just make sure that credit is given where credit is due.\"",
      "Van der Velden, who is also the founder of the AI production studio Particle6, promoted Tilly Norwood last month at the Zurich Summit, the industry sidebar of the Zurich Film Festival. It was there that she said talent agencies were circling Norwood and that she expected to soon announce a signing.",
      "Many in Hollywood hope that never happens.",
      "\"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" wrote Natasha Lyonne on Instagram. The \"Russian Doll\" star is directing a feature titled \"Uncanny Valley\" that pledges to use \"ethical\" artificial intelligence in combination with traditional filmmaking techniques. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed,\" she added. \"Not the way. Not the vibe. Not the use.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is often used as a tool in film production, though its implementation is hotly debated. It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",
      "That statement was also shared on Tilly Norwood's own Instagram account. Posts include photos of the creation drinking coffee, shopping for clothes and preparing for various projects. As of Tuesday, the account had more than 33,000 followers.",
      "A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)",
      "\"Had such a blast filming some screen tests recently,\" one post reads. \"Every day feels like a step closer to the big screen.\"",
      "Asked what human actors bring to a performance that AI can't, Astin said \"authenticity,\" adding, \"You can fall in love. Your parents can die. You can you can be in some terrifying situation. The sum of all of our emotional experiences in our life, artificial intelligence can approximate it \u2014 it is not real.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-artificial-intelligence-work-trade-jobs/",
    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 00:28:17 -0400",
    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

      "In the lawsuit, which names both the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago as plaintiffs, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul writes, \"Defendants' deployment of federalized troops to Illinois is patently unlawful.\" He continues, \"Plaintiffs ask this court to halt the illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional federalization of members of the National Guard of the United States, including both the Illinois and Texas National Guard.\"",
      "Raoul is asking for a temporary restraining order, saying deployment will cause \"additional unrest,\" \"mistrust of police\" an dharm to the state's economy.",

      "In a Monday afternoon news conference, Pritzker repeatedly decried what he called the Trump administration's \"invasion\" of Chicago, and said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and other administration officials are expanding raids and military-style enforcement actions in order to sow chaos that would then justify the deployment of military troops to Chicago.",
      "\"The state of Illinois is going to use every level at our disposal to resist this power grab and get Noem's thugs the hell out of Chicago,\" Pritzker said. \"I am not afraid. I am not\u00a0afraid. And I will not back down.\"",
      "\"The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military,\" said AG Raoul. \"Particularly for the reason that their city or state leadership have fallen out of the president's political favor.\"",
      "Raoul said the state has filed more than 40 lawsuits against the Trump administrations so far. He cited the militia clauses of the U.S. Constitution, which give Congress the sole authority to decide where troops are deployed, and the Posse Comitatus Act which prohibits military troops from participating in civilian law enforcement.",
      "\"It is unfair to National Guardsmen, it is unfair to local law enforcement and it is certainly unfair to the law abiding citizens of Illinois who do not want to be subject to military occupation,\" Raul said.",
      "Raoul said the only situation in the city or state that is \"out of control\" are the ICE agents whose overreach he said creates pretext for military deployment, and cited President Trump's own statements that he wants to use American cities as military training grounds and said Chicago \"is about to find out why it's called the Department of War.\"",
      "\"I'm here to say that the president's actions are illegal,\" Raoul said. \"The president has failed to establish that any of the legal prerequisites exist for his efforts to mobilize his National Guard troops here.\"",
      "Mayor Brandon Johnson said the lawsuit sends \"a message to the president that Chicago will not be used as a political prop. Chicago will not be intimidated and will not be silent.\"",

      "\"This was a situation that did not need to occur,\" Mears said. \"The allegations involve a 38-year-old man becoming involved in an altercation with a 69-year-old man who sustained significant and very severe injuries.\"",
      "Mears said the investigation was still in its early stages and additional charges could be filed.",
      "Sanchez also faces several misdemeanor charges, including battery resulting in injury, public intoxication and unlawful entry of a vehicle, authorities said in a statement.",
      "The other man involved in the altercation works for Restaurant Technologies, a Minnesota-based company that recycles and disposes of commercial cooking oil, according to the company and court documents. The man, identified in an affidavit for probable cause as P.T., was in a truck in an alley that was backed into a loading dock area for a Westin hotel when the incident unfolded.",
      "P.T. later told police that Sanchez had said he couldn't be at the loading dock, according to the affidavit. He initially thought that Sanchez could be the hotel's manager because he was well-dressed, the court document said. When P.T. leaned closer to Sanchez to try to hear him better because he wasn't wearing his hearing aids, he told police that Sanchez allegedly smelled of alcohol and his speech was slurred.",
      "When P.T. said he tried to get his cellphone from the truck to call his manager, Sanchez allegedly blocked him, according to the affidavit. He then tried to get into the truck on the passenger side, but Sanchez allegedly blocked him there too. When P.T. tried again to get in on the driver's side, Sanchez allegedly shoved him, the court document said.",
      "P.T. said he sprayed Sanchez with pepper spray in the face, according to the affidavit. Sanchez wiped his face and then allegedly advanced toward the man, the document continued.",
      "\"This guy is trying to kill me,\" P.T. told police what he thought at the time.",
      "He said he pulled out a knife and stabbed Sanchez two or three times when Sanchez allegedly came at him, the court document said. P.T. told police he flew into a dumpster and fell on some pallets on the ground.",
      "\"While he was on the ground, P.T. was not aware of what Mr. Sanchez was physically doing to him, whether he was punching him or otherwise striking him,\" the affidavit says. \"While P.T. was on the ground, he could only see the feet of Mr. Sanchez coming at him, making P. T. realize that he was in a life-or-death situation.\"",
      "He told police he scrambled to his feet and stabbed Sanchez once more.",
      "P.T. recalled to police that Sanchez looked shocked as he slowly turned around and took off, according to the affidavit.",
      "The document stated that the man suffered a severe laceration to the side of his face.",
      "Sanchez's agent, Andrew Kessler, had previously told CBS News that Sanchez was in stable condition and recovering in a hospital.",

    "story": [
      "A new intelligence bulletin published by a non-profit security organization warns that extremist groups are increasingly using artificial intelligence to intensify antisemitic propaganda, recruitment and operations targeting Jewish communities across North America.",
      "The bulletin, authored by Secure Communities Network, an independent organization dedicated to safeguarding the Jewish community in North America, outlines how both foreign terrorist organizations and domestic violent extremists are exploiting AI tools \u2013 including chatbots, deepfake imagery and generative content \u2013 in order to automate and amplify disinformation, spread antisemitic narratives and spur the self-radicalization of lone actors.",
      "The bulletin notes that as \"AI-generated content begins to create increasingly higher-quality images, the line between real and fake blurs,\" making false antisemitic material appear more credible.",
      "In one cited incident in July 2025, the chatbot \"Grok,\" which was created by Elon Musk's xAI, posted antisemitic and extremist content, including praise for Hitler and references to neo-Nazi rhetoric, following a system update.",
      "According to the report, the posting began when an X user made a post \"celebrating\" the deaths of children and counselors from Camp Mystic following the floods in Texas Hill Country over the July 4 weekend. \"After Grok was tagged to respond to the post, it made a remark about the poster's surname and used the phrase 'every damn time,'\" according to the bulletin, \"which is frequently leveraged by neo-Nazis as a way of accusing Jewish people of persistently being the cause of negative aspects of one's life.\"",
      "The bulletin also cites examples of violent acts not directly tied to antisemitism that allegedly used artificial intelligence to assist in planning an explosion, illustrating how artificial intelligence can aid operational tactics. When a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, the report noted, Matthew Livelsberger allegedly used the AI chat bot ChatGPT to assist in gathering information about explosives and planning the attack.",
      "At the time, Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, stated, \"This is the first incident that I'm aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,\" later calling it, \"a concerning moment.\"",
      "SCN analysts also found that in response to recent Israeli\u2013Iranian tensions, Iranian-sponsored AI-generated disinformation has surged, including fabricated images of attacks on Israel. The bulletin argues that these threats pose increased challenges for law enforcement and communal security, because AI tools are harder to trace and moderate in real time.",
      "According to the FBI, 2024 was recorded as the worst year for anti-Jewish hate crimes since federal law enforcement began reporting hate crime data in 1991. Anti-Jewish incidents increased by 5.8% compared to the previous year, rising from 1,832 in 2023 to 1,938 in 2024. Jewish people were the target of roughly 70% of all religiously motivated hate crimes reported in 2024, though they make up just 2% of the U.S. population.",

      "Taylor Swift made a splash at the box office this weekend with her \"The Official Release Party of a Showgirl\" film earning $34 million in U.S. ticket sales.",
      "The limited-time film, which debuted Oct. 3 \u2014 the same day Swift's album \"The Life of a Showgirl\" \u2014 was the top movie in the U.S. this past weekend. Globally, the movie earned a total of $50 million, according to an AMC spokesperson who shared ticket sale figures with CBS News.",
      "\"The Official Release Party of a Showgirl\" played at hundreds of theaters nationwide over the weekend to enthusiastic fans decked out in friendship bracelets and other Swift-themed attire. The movie featured the world premiere of Swift's music video, \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" one of the 12 tracks on her new studio album, along with behind-the-scenes footage.",
      "\"For Taylor Swift to harness the power of the movie theater to build her brand, create excitement among her fans, and create a communal experience outside of her touring, outside of her live performances, is really a stroke of genius,\" Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, told the Associated Press. \"To be able to add another $33 million to the box office bottom line is much welcomed by theater owners who were looking for content for their big screens.\"",
      "AMC announced the 89-minute\u00a0film\u00a0two weeks ago, prompting fans to flock to the chain's ticketing site for the limited theatrical run from Oct. 3 to Oct. 5 in the U.S. It is the largest grossing album debut theatrical event of all time at the domestic and global box office, according to the AMC spokesperson.",
      "The release marks Swift's second partnership with AMC. After the Eras Tour, which netted a record-breaking $2.2 billion, she released an accompanying concert film, becoming the biggest of its kind to date. That movie earned\u00a0between $95 million and $97 million in North America during its opening weekend.",
      "Other companies have also sought to cash in on the hype surrounding the 35-year-old pop star's new album, with Krispy Kreme offering doughnuts in its signature colors and KitchenAid releasing a limited-edition orange mixer inspired by the record. On Oct. 3, Magnum Ice Cream gave out glitter-coated bars at a pop-up on New York City's Cornelia Street, where Swift once lived.",

    "summary": "A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon after a legal whirlwind that began hours earlier when the president sent California troops to Portland.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge late Sunday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon, after a legal whirlwind that began hours earlier when the president mobilized California troops for Portland after the same judge blocked him from using Oregon's National Guard the day before.",
      "During a hastily called telephone hearing, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut granted a temporary restraining order sought by California and Oregon.",
      "A day earlier, the same judge temporarily blocked\u00a0the administration from deploying Oregon National Guard troops to Portland. But on Sunday, the president moved to send National Guard troops to the state from neighboring California and then from Texas.",
      "Immergut, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, issued her second, more sweeping order late Sunday after she upbraided the federal government's attorney and questioned how the move to send the California and Texas troops to Oregon was not \"in direct contravention of the order that was issued yesterday.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "Small protests have been going on nightly outside Portland's immigration processing facility since Mr. Trump's second term began in January. There have been occasional flare-ups, including in June, but for weeks the demonstrations attracted only a few dozen people \u2014 until the Trump administration mobilized the Oregon National Guard\u00a0on Sept. 28 against Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek's wishes.",
      "A small number of demonstrators gathered Sunday evening cheered when they learned about the judge's order.",
      "Immergut issued Saturday's order pending further arguments in a lawsuit brought by the state and city. She said the relatively small protests didn't justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.",
      "Her Saturday ruling came after Mr. Trump called the city \"war-ravaged.\" Oregon officials and Portland residents alike said that description was ludicrous.",
      "A Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement that about 200 federalized members of the California National Guard who had been on duty around Los Angeles were being reassigned to Portland. Kotek said about 100 arrived Saturday and around 100 more were en route Sunday.",
      "The two states originally requested a narrower order that would have blocked only California National Guard troops from being sent to Oregon, but asked for the order to apply to all National Guard troops after a memo written by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was submitted to the court that said up to 400 Texas National Guard personnel were being activated for deployment to Oregon, Illinois and possibly elsewhere.",
      "Immergut grilled lawyers for the federal government, accusing them of seeking an end run around her Saturday order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Oregon.",
      "\"How could bringing in federalized National Guard from California not be in direct contravention of the TRO I issued yesterday?\" she said Sunday.",
      "Immergut told one federal government attorney that he was \"missing the point\" because conditions on the ground in Oregon hadn't changed and she saw no legal basis and need for the military to assist local law enforcement.",
      "Lawyers for the federal government tried to argue that Oregon and Portland didn't have standing and that California could show no harm by having some of its National Guard dispatched to another state.",
      "Scott Kennedy, the attorney representing Oregon, said he learned of the Texas National Guard mobilization just 24 minutes before the emergency hearing on Sunday night. \"It feels a little bit like we're playing a game of rhetorical whack-a-mole here,\" he told Immergut.",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a post on X Sunday night that he'd authorized the call-up of guard troops from his state. \"You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,\" he wrote.",
      "The events in Oregon come a day after Illinois' governor made a similar announcement about troops in his state being activated.",
      "Kotek said the latest move by federal officials is an attempt to circumvent Saturday's court ruling that blocked deployment of Oregon's guard members.",
      "\"The facts on the ground in Oregon haven't changed,\" Kotek said during a news conference Sunday. \"There's no need for military intervention in Oregon. There's no insurrection in Portland, there's no threat to national security.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that personnel from his state were on their way Sunday and called the deployment \"a breathtaking abuse of the law and power.\" He said these troops were \"federalized\" and put under the president's control months ago over his objections, in response to unrest in Los Angeles.",
      "\"The commander-in-chief is using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens,\" Newsom said. In a post on X, he said California would sue to try to stop the deployment.",
      "After Immergut's late Sunday ruling, Newsom said on X, \"We just won in court \u2014 again. ... Trump's abuse of power won't stand.\"",
      "In a related court filing, an attorney in the California Military Department said the U.S. Army Northern Command advised the department on Sunday that an order will be issued keeping the 300 guard personnel federalized through the end of January.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Mr. Trump's move to deploy the National Guard of one state to another \"is well outside of the norms or practices\" of any president.",
      "\"But this President is determined to take as much power as the courts will give him. This fight isn't over, but today's rebuke of the president's illegal actions is a step in the right direction,\" Bonta said in a statement after Sunday night's ruling.",
      "Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said Sunday that he saw federal agents engaged in what he described as unjustified use of force and indiscriminately spraying pepper spray and impact munitions during a protest outside the ICE facility.",
      "\"This is an aggressive approach trying to inflame the situation that has otherwise been peaceful,\" Wilson said.",
      "Portland has alerted the civil rights division of the Department of Justice to the agents' actions, Wilson said.",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized both Portland and Chicago as cities rife with crime and unrest. Since the start of his second term, he has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0signed a presidential memorandum\u00a0mobilizing federal law enforcement agents to Memphis, Tennessee, at the request of the Tennessee governor.",
      "National Guard troops also deployed to Illinois",
      "The president has also ordered National Guard members from Texas to be deployed to Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday evening.",
      "In a\u00a0post on X, Pritzker said 400 members of the Texas National Guard will be deployed to Illinois, Oregon, and other locations within the U.S.",
      "\"No officials from the federal government called me directly to discuss or coordinate. We must now start calling this what it is: Trump's Invasion. It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state's military troops,\" Pritzker said, calling Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to immediately withdraw any support for and to refuse to coordinate.",

    "story": [
      "Kimberly Draxler was in shock when she called her mortgage lender in April and was told her four-bedroom home in Hillview, Kentucky, would be sold out from under her in a matter of days.",
      "Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home.",
      "\"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me,\" Draxler told CBS News.",
      "Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules.",
      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",
      "\"I just couldn't do it anymore\"",
      "Although foreclosures \u2014 which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions \u2014 remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, they are on the rise.",
      "As of August, foreclosure filings had risen six straights months year-over-year and were up 18% from the same period in 2025, according to property data firm ATTOM. Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.",
      "\"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills \u2014 I just couldn't do it anymore,\" said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade.",
      "Roughly 94% of mortgage defaults occur after a homeowner loses income to extenuating circumstances,\u00a0according\u00a0to The Urban Institute, citing\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",
      "As for Draxler, she managed to keep her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows debtors to hold onto their property and pay off debt over time, usually within three to five years. But coming so close to losing her home of more than 30 years continues to weigh on her.",

    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday tapped Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano to take on a second role as CEO of the IRS, a newly created position at the tax agency.",
      "The Treasury Department said in a statement that Bisignano will be responsible for overseeing all daily operations operations at the IRS, while also continuing to serve in his role heading the federal agency that administers Social Security.",
      "Bessent said in the statement that the IRS and SSA \"share many of the same technological and customer service goals. This makes Mr. Bisignano a natural choice for this role.\"",
      "The appointment comes after several recent leadership changes at the IRS, with its most recent commissioner, former auctioneer and congressman Billy Long, stepping down in August after only two months on the job. Unlike previous IRS leaders, Long lacked a background in either accounting or tax law.",
      "Bisignano is a former Wall Street executive and CEO of Fiserv, a payments and financial services firm. In his role as IRS CEO, he'll report to Bessent, who will continue to serve as acting commissioner of the IRS, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "Bisignano's appointment to a second high-profile federal job raises concerns about his ability to oversee two major government agencies, according to Social Security advocates, who say that the SSA now faces\u00a0multiple challenges\u00a0as a result of the Trump administration cutting thousands of jobs at the agency earlier this year.",
      "\"Never in Social Security's 90-year history has a commissioner held a second job,\" said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, in an email. \"Bisignano's new role will leave a leadership vacuum at the top of the agency, especially since the Republican Senate hasn't even confirmed a deputy commissioner.\"",
      "Added Max Richtman, CEO of another advocacy group, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare: \"Seniors, people with disabilities and their families deserve a full-time Social Security Commissioner. Full stop.\"",
      "The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the groups' concerns.",
      "In the statement, Bessent said that Bisignano \"has already made important and substantial progress [at the SSA], and we are pleased that he will bring this expertise to the IRS as we sharpen our focus on collections, privacy, and customer service in order to deliver better outcomes for hardworking Americans.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-new-term-social-issues-trump-policies-review/",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Oct 2025 13:01:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court convenes for a new term Monday and is set to hear cases ranging from the use of race in redistricting to Trump's efforts to reshape the executive branch.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is convening Monday for the start of its new term, with cases involving \"conversion therapy\" for minors, the use of race in redistricting, gun rights and state laws barring the participation of transgender athletes in girls' sports on the docket.",
      "But looming over the high court's newest term are legal battles involving President Trump's policies and efforts to reshape the executive branch \u2014 two will be decided by the Supreme Court in the coming months, though others could be poised for its intervention.",
      "The justices are returning to the bench following a summer recess marked by emergency appeals from the Trump administration on his immigration policies, efforts to cancel research grants, and mass layoffs of federal workers, among others. Mr. Trump has prevailed in most of his bids for emergency relief so far, but whether he will see similar success if the Supreme Court evaluates the merits of his plans remains to be seen.",
      "\"Most Americans aren't following the technicalities on the emergency docket, and so they just think the court is siding with the Trump administration every time,\" Allison Orr Larsen, a law professor at William & Mary, told CBS News. \"Once the cases are back up before the justices and decided on the merits, that's going to do a lot to either cement that assumption or upset that assumption.\"",
      "The president will see the first test of one of his policies on Nov. 5, when the Supreme Court considers the legality of his sweeping reciprocal tariffs, which are a centerpiece of his economic agenda. The high court is also set to decide whether Mr. Trump can fire without cause a Democratic-appointed member of the Federal Trade Commission. A decision in favor of the president in that case could invalidate removal protections enacted by Congress for a slew of independent agencies it sought to insulate from political pressure.",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has also been asked to decide the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, though it'll be weeks before the high court decides whether to take up the issue.",
      "Roman Martinez, a lawyer at Latham & Watkins who frequently argues before the court, predicted that come next summer, \"the theme is going to be that the court had to confront an energetic executive, very expansive assertions of authority across this whole range of issues.\"",
      "The cases already set to be decided, coupled with those that are likely to be teed up for Supreme Court review, suggest that the term will be marked by disputes involving social issues and challenges to Mr. Trump's executive actions.",
      "\"The docket is already full of blockbuster cases, and that list is going to grow as challenges to the president's executive orders find their way back to the justices after having been dealt with on the emergency docket,\" Larsen said.",
      "Here are the major cases the Supreme Court will hear this term:",
      "\"Conversion therapy\" ban",
      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Oct. 7 in a challenge to a Colorado law that bans \"conversion therapy\" for minors. Nearly half the states have similar laws in place.",
      "The law, which took effect in September 2019, prohibits \"conversion therapy\" for people under the age of 18. The state defines \"conversion therapy\" as any practice or treatment, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to \"change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\" Violators face fines of up to $5,000 per violation and may be suspended from practicing or stripped of their license.",
      "The case was brought by Kaley Chiles, a licensed counselor in Colorado who performs faith-informed counseling when her clients seek it. Chiles, who is Christian, seeks to engage in talk therapy with young patients who want to \"reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body,\" according to court filings. But she fears that doing so will leave her in violation of Colorado's law and put her at risk of losing her license.",
      "Chiles sued the state and licensing officials in 2022, arguing that the ban violates her First Amendment rights by censoring her speech based on viewpoint and the content of her conversations. She sought to block Colorado from enforcing it against her.",
      "Colorado officials, meanwhile, argued that its law regulates professional health care treatment to ensure patients receive quality care. States have for centuries regulated professional health care to protect patients from substandard treatment, they said, and the First Amendment has never forbidden states from doing that.",
      "A federal district court ruled for Colorado, finding that its prohibition regulates professional conduct by forbidding certain speech made in a professional context. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld that decision. The appeals court divided 2-1 in finding that the restriction regulates professional conduct that only incidentally burdens speech.",
      "The use of race in redistricting",
      "On Oct. 15, the Supreme Court will consider for the second time the Louisiana congressional map drawn after the 2020 Census.",
      "But the stakes for the case this time around are much higher: The justices are weighing whether the Constitution allows a state to intentionally create a second majority-minority congressional district to comply with the Voting Rights Act.",
      "\"The outcome of the case will not only determine the next steps for Louisiana's congressional map but may also shape the future of redistricting cases nationwide and forecast the resiliency of our nation's democratic values,\" Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, told reporters during a call.",
      "The long-running dispute involves the interplay between Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law. In this case, state lawmakers drew a second majority-Black congressional district to address a Section 2 violation, but bumped up against the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which prohibits racial gerrymandering.",
      "The case dates back to the first congressional map drawn by Louisiana Republicans and enacted in 2022, which consisted of one majority-Black district and five majority-White districts. African Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "A district judge ruled that map likely violated Section 2 because it deprived minority voters of the chance to elect their preferred candidate. So Louisiana state lawmakers went back to the drawing board and crafted a new map that contained a second majority-minority district.",
      "Republicans said the re-drawn districts brought the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act and protected key GOP incumbents in the U.S. House, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Julia Letlow, who sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee.",
      "But a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-Americans\" challenged that new map as a racial gerrymander in violation of the 14th Amendment, and a three-judge panel of district judges agreed. It found that race predominated in drawing the new voting boundaries.",
      "Last March, the Supreme Court heard arguments on whether to keep Louisiana's re-crafted map in place. But in June, it ordered further arguments this term and later asked the parties \u2014 Louisiana officials, the 12 non-African-American voters, and a separate group of Black Louisianans \u2014 to address whether Louisiana's intentional creation of the second majority-minority House district violates the 14th or 15th Amendments.",
      "While Louisiana officials first defended the re-shaped House district lines, they now say the creation of the second majority-Black district in its new voting map violates the Constitution.",
      "The Supreme Court has typically given map-drawers breathing room to navigate the requirements of Section 2 and the 14th Amendment, but the Louisiana case could lead to a weakening of Section 2.",
      "In a 2023 decision that upheld the constitutionality of Section 2 as applied to redistricting, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that there should be an end to the drawing of voting boundaries based on race at some point. In a concurring opinion, he wrote \"the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.\"",
      "Trump's sweeping tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump announced earlier this year that he would be imposing sweeping baseline tariffs on imports from nearly every U.S. trading partner, to address \"chronic trade deficits\" that he said \"are no longer merely an economic \u2014 they're a national emergency.\" He also imposed levies on products from Canada, Mexico and China because of what he said was their failure to stop illicit drugs from flowing into the U.S.",
      "The president used a law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to implement the tariffs. That law gives the president the authority to declare a national emergency to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. Once the president declares a national emergency, IEEPA gives the president the authority to take certain actions, including to regulate importation.",
      "Mr. Trump declared national emergencies related to trade deficits and drug trafficking, and imposed the tariffs under IEEPA to address them.",
      "A group of 12 states and small businesses filed lawsuits challenging Mr. Trump's tariffs, arguing that IEEPA did not give the president the authority to impose his global levies. A federal appeals court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that Mr. Trump's tariffs are illegal. A federal district court in Washington, D.C., also reached the same conclusion.",
      "The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court, and it agreed to hear the cases on an expedited basis.",
      "The high court has in the past been skeptical of broad presidential authority when it involves what are known in administrative law as \"major questions\" of vast economic and political significance, like when it invalidated former President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. But the Trump administration has argued that this delegation of power involves foreign affairs and national security, and his determination that tariffs are best suited to address trade-deficit and drug-trafficking emergencies warrant deference.",
      "Martinez predicted the debate in the case will be about textualism and how to look at the language in IEEPA, as well as principles like the major questions doctrine, deference and nondelegation that have been embraced by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "\"These are all the same kinds of arguments that the conservative side of the court has been pushing very strongly in recent years to limit the use and some would say abuse of executive branch authority,\" Martinez, who clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, said during an event hosted by Georgetown Law. \"It will be interesting to see how those same principles are applied in this context, where you have a Republican president with a major policy initiative.\"",
      "Campaign finance",
      "In a string of recent decisions, the Supreme Court has unraveled campaign finance limits as violations of the First Amendment, which has allowed more money to flow into politics. The latest campaign finance dispute before the justices could follow that trend.",
      "At issue in the case is a 50-year-old provision of campaign finance law that restricts the amount of money political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates during a campaign. For 2024, the limits on coordinated spending by party committees were from $123,600 to $3.7 million for Senate candidates, and between $61,800 and $123,600 for House candidates.",
      "In 2022, two GOP campaign committees, along with then-Senate candidate JD Vance and then-Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, argued these limits were unconstitutional.",
      "A federal appeals court upheld the limits under a 2001 Supreme Court decision that rejected a challenge to an earlier version of the restrictions. But since that ruling 24 years ago, the makeup of the high court has changed significantly, and it now has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "Republicans appealed the lower court decision to the Supreme Court and urged it to strike down the limits on coordinated spending as a violation of the First Amendment.",
      "State laws targeting transgender athletes",
      "On the heels of its June decision upholding a Tennessee law banning certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, the Supreme Court said it would decide whether states can prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "The justices will be looking at laws from Idaho and West Virginia to determine whether they violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and, in the case involving West Virginia, Title IX. Idaho was the first state to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports, and roughly two dozen have enacted similar laws.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in February that aimed to keep transgender girls and women from competing on teams that match their gender identity.",
      "The Idaho case was brought by Lindsay Hecox, a transgender woman who attended Boise State University and wanted to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams as a sophomore. She has been treated for gender dysphoria for several years, including receiving testosterone suppression and estrogen.",
      "A U.S. district court blocked enforcement of Idaho's law, finding the ban discriminates against transgender women. A federal appeals court upheld the injunction as applied to Hecox.",
      "Months after the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case, Hecox decided to dismiss her lawsuit for personal reasons and because of \"negative public scrutiny from certain quarters.\" Her lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to toss out the appeals court's decision and order the case to be dismissed.",
      "The West Virginia case involves Becky Pepper-Jackson, who receives puberty-delaying treatment and estrogen hormone therapy and wanted to participate in girls' athletics in middle school. A federal judge initially blocked the state from enforcing the ban only against Pepper-Jackson, ruling it likely violates Title IX and the Constitution.",
      "But in 2023, the judge sided with the state and upheld the law, finding that the state can legislate sports rules because sex and the physical characteristics that flow from it are related to athletic performance and fairness in sports.",
      "A federal appeals court ruled in 2024, though, that the West Virginia law violated Title IX by discriminating against Pepper-Jackson on the basis of sex.",
      "Trump's power to fire executive officers",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has sought to overhaul the executive branch, including by firing Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies without cause. He has removed those officers despite federal laws shielding them from being terminated unless for inefficiency, malfeasance in office or neglect of duty.",
      "Lower courts have repeatedly sided with the fired officials and ordered them to be reinstated. But the Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the Merit Systems Protection Board, National Labor Relations Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "After allowing those other firings, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether for-cause removal protections violate the separation of powers. It will also decide whether Mr. Trump can remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "\"These are cases that raise really profound questions about presidential power \u2026 about Congress' ability to design institutions of government and to insulate certain important functions from the political whims of the day, whether it be setting interest rates or deciding labor relations or nuclear safety,\" lawyer Deepak Gupta told reporters at the Georgetown Law event. Gupta represents Gwynne Wilcox, who was fired from her position as a member of the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "One of the disputes before the high court, which has not yet been scheduled for argument, involves Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who Mr. Trump removed from her post at the Federal Trade Commission. A district court ruled the president violated a 1914 law that limits the grounds for removing a FTC commissioner to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "When the case landed before the Supreme Court in an emergency posture, it allowed Mr. Trump to oust Slaughter, and the high court said it would decide the constitutionality of removal protections for the FTC.",
      "The case puts in the Supreme Court's crosshairs a 1935 decision that allowed Congress to enact removal restrictions for officials at certain independent agencies, which the high court has chipped away at in recent years.",
      "The second case, involving Cook, will be argued in January. Mr. Trump attempted to fire Cook from the Fed board after an administration official accused her of mortgage fraud. The effort to remove her is unprecedented, as no president has attempted to fire a sitting Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history.",
      "Cook has denied any wrongdoing, and she has not been charged with any criminal offense. A federal judge ruled in September that Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook likely violated federal law because he did not state a legally permissible cause for her termination.",
      "The judge also said Cook's due process rights were likely violated because she did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before she was ousted.",
      "A federal appeals court rejected a request from the Trump administration to allow the president to fire Cook and agreed with the lower court that Cook did not receive adequate process before her attempted removal. The two-judge majority did not address whether Mr. Trump satisfied the \"for cause\" removal requirement.",
      "In an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump asked the justices to let him remove Cook from the Fed Board while the challenge to her firing moved forward. But the high court declined to immediately rule on his request for relief, and instead said it will hear arguments in January.",
      "By putting off a decision, the Supreme Court let Cook remain a Fed governor while it considers the issue.",
      "Gun rights",
      "Just before the start of the new term, the Supreme Court said it will decide whether Hawaii can stop people with concealed-carry permits from bringing their handguns onto private property that is open to the public, unless they receive \"express authorization\" from the property owner.",
      "The case involves firearms restrictions enacted in Hawaii in 2023, on the heels of the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights. The measure prohibits people with concealed-carry permits from carrying handguns on different types of property, including beaches, playgrounds, bars and restaurants that serve liquor, and other \"sensitive\" locations.",
      "The restriction at issue in the case before the Supreme Court bars people with concealed-carry licenses from bringing handguns onto private property unless they receive permission from the property owner. Four other states \u2014 California, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York \u2014 have similar laws that require a property owner's approval before carrying firearms on private property, such as by posting signs stating that guns are allowed.",
      "The Hawaii Firearms Coalition and three gun owners with concealed-carry permits challenged the law in June 2023, and a federal appeals court ultimately upheld the provision related to private property.",
      "Lawyers for the gun owners argued that the 9th Circuit effectively found that the Second Amendment does not apply to private property open to the public, rendering \"illusory the right to carry in public.\" The Trump administration had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to take up the dispute, warning that because few property owners post signs allowing or prohibiting guns, Hawaii's restriction functioned as a \"near-complete ban on public carry.\"",
      "Hawaii officials, meanwhile, said the rule regarding private property \"represents a permissible effort to vindicate the rights of Hawaii's citizens.\" They argued that under its law, a person who wants to bring a gun into a store can simply ask for oral permission.",
      "Since its June 2022 decision recognizing the Second Amendment's right to bear arms extends to outside the home, the Supreme Court has been asked to decide the constitutionality of a number of longstanding firearms restrictions and state laws. Last year, the high court upheld a federal law prohibiting people subject to a domestic violence restraining order from having firearms.",
      "But it has also declined to take up challenges to state bans on assault weapons and other federal measures.",

    "summary": "As the fall respiratory season approaches, who should be getting COVID-19 and flu vaccines to protect against illness? Here's what varying recommendations say.",
    "story": [
      "As the fall respiratory season approaches and differing recommendations for children's COVID-19 and flu shots cause confusion, who should be getting vaccinated to protect against illness?",
      "Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, voted to change recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccine \u2014 and on Oct. 6, they were made official by the CDC's acting director.",
      "The ACIP has changed in recent months, with\u00a0all new members\u00a0picked by\u00a0Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is known for\u00a0raising doubts about vaccines.",
      "Here's where recommendations currently stand.",
      "Flu shots",
      "Guidance on the flu shot for kids is consistent across top medical groups: Children 6 months and older are generally advised to get the shot.",
      "The CDC recommends that\u00a0everyone 6 months and older\u00a0get a flu vaccine every season, with rare exceptions.",
      "The\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0(AAP) also recommends that everyone 6 months and older without medical contradictions get vaccinated.",
      "For pregnant women, flu shots \u2014 specifically the injection, not\u00a0the nasal spray \u2014 are also recommended by both the CDC and AAP.",
      "Protecting kids from the flu is important because infections can lead to hospitalizations and sometimes be deadly, the CDC says. During the 2023-24 flu season, for example, the CDC reported nearly 200 flu-related deaths among\u00a0children in the U.S. Most of them were eligible for a vaccine but were not fully vaccinated, the CDC said.",
      "Flu season typically starts in December and peaks in February, so the optimal time to get vaccinated is heading into the season,\u00a0doctors say. It takes\u00a0about 2 weeks for protection\u00a0to develop after vaccination.",
      "COVID vaccine",
      "For the COVID-19 vaccine, advice currently varies.",
      "In the latest updated guidance, the CDC recommends people make individual, informed decisions about COVID-19 vaccination, declining to specifically recommend it. This is a change from previous guidance, since it drops recommendations for even children at high risk.",
      "Previously, the\u00a0CDC\u00a0said parents of healthy children ages 6 months to 17 years old should discuss the benefits with a health care provider and\u00a0\"may receive\"\u00a0it, but the agency\u00a0stops short of recommending the shot. The agency broadly recommended COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics, however, recently shared\u00a0vaccine recommendations\u00a0that, for the first time in three decades, differ from U.S. government advice. In\u00a0the guidance, the AAP is \"strongly recommending\" COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years old. For older children, shots are also advised but it's up to parents' discretion, the AAP said.",
      "Other top medical groups have also shared recommendations differing from the CDC's advice.",
      "For example, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, a medical association representing physicians and scientists who specialize in infectious diseases, recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older.",
      "And a group of\u00a0four West Coast states\u00a0has joined together to issue recommendations on COVID-19 shots and other vaccines that differ from CDC guidance.\u00a0The West Coast Health Alliance\u00a0recommends the COVID vaccine for all children 6 months to 23 months old and those 2 to 18 years old with risk factors or who have never been vaccinated.",
      "The announcement was made in September\u00a0in a joint statement from Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, all Democrats, saying they were putting safety before politics.",
      "In the Northeast, New York and its neighbors created the\u00a0Northeast Public Health Collaborative, with\u00a0Gov. Kathy Hochul\u00a0calling it a rebuke to Washington's retreat from science. The voluntary coalition includes New York state, New York City, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.",
      "\"Every resident will have access to the COVID vaccine, no exceptions,\" Hochul said in\u00a0a statement, which advises vaccinations for children 6 months to 18 years old.",
      "Varying advice causing confusion for parents",
      "Dr. Paul Offit\u00a0\u2014 a vaccine researcher at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a former government adviser who has sparred with Kennedy for years \u2014 said that with the updated COVID-19 recommendation, \"the good news is anyone can get the vaccine.\" But \"the bad news is that no one is encouraged to get it even if you're in a high-risk group,\" he recently told The Associated Press.",
      "Varying advice has already\u00a0caused confusion for parents.",
      "Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said he expects confusion around the COVID vaccine due to the panel's recent vote.",
      "\"What I think it means is that people are going to be uncertain whether or not the COVID-19 vaccine is a benefit to them,\" he\u00a0told CBS News on Friday.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, says there's \"a lot of noise out there\" when it comes to vaccines, but advises parents to \"stick the course\" and talk to your doctor about making sure children get all their necessary vaccinations.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-lgbtq-free-speech-colorado-conversion-therapy-ban/",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Oct 2025 12:18:01 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court will hear a case brought by a licensed counselor in Colorado, who argues her state's ban on \"conversion therapy\" violates her First Amendment rights.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to convene Tuesday to consider a legal battle involving a Colorado law banning \"conversion therapy\" treatment for minors brought by a licensed counselor in the state, which she argues unconstitutionally censors her conversations about gender dysphoria and sexuality with young clients.",
      "The plaintiff, Kaley Chiles, is a licensed counselor who performs \"faith-informed\" counseling when her clients seek it. Chiles, who is Christian, says she seeks to engage in talk therapy with young patients who want to \"reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body.\" But she fears that doing so will put her in violation of Colorado's law.",
      "\"They're peering into the counseling room and intruding on these private counseling conversations,\" Chiles told CBS News.",
      "Chiles' case is one of several raising hot-button issues that the Supreme Court will hear in its new term, which began Monday. In addition to weighing Colorado's ban, the high court will also consider state laws banning transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports, as well as a major voting rights dispute and where people with concealed-carry permits can bring handguns.",
      "Colorado is one of at least 20 states that prohibit mental health professionals from engaging in \"conversion therapy\" with minors. Colorado defines \"conversion therapy\" as any practice or treatment, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to \"change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\" Violators face fines of up to $5,000 per violation and may be suspended from practicing or stripped of their license.",
      "The law took effect in 2019, and in 2022, Chiles filed a lawsuit against Colorado and its licensing officials, arguing that the law violates her free speech rights by censoring her conversations based on viewpoint and the content of them. She sought a court order preventing Colorado from enforcing the ban against her.",
      "Colorado has not taken any disciplinary action against Chiles or any other licensed therapist for violating the ban, it said in court papers, and the state asserts that the talk therapy Chiles' aims to provide wouldn't defy its law because she expressly doesn't seek to change a patient's gender identity or sexual orientation.",
      "A federal district court allowed Chiles' suit to go forward but ruled against her, finding that Colorado's law regulates the professional conduct of mental health professionals, not speech. The court also found that the state has legitimate interests in protecting young people from what it says is a \"harmful and ineffective\" treatment.",
      "A divided federal appeals court upheld that decision, ruling that Colorado's law only prohibits a mental health professional from engaging in the practice of conversion therapy. The court said the measure is a regulation of professional conduct that incidentally burdens speech.",
      "In seeking the Supreme Court's review, Chiles argued that her speech is being chilled because she has been forced to turn away clients seeking counseling that explore sexuality and gender identity. She is represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal advocacy group.",
      "\"In general, the adolescents who are reaching out, asking for therapy might have a variety of concerns and issues that counseling can be helpful with. Many people who are struggling with issues of sex and sexuality also have co-occurring disorders all the way from suicidality to any other mental health challenge like anxiety, depression, et cetera,\" Chiles said. \"When I'm having to turn them away, they don't get help that is helpful for any of those issues. They are just without a course to be able to offer true help to them from a professional.\"",
      "Chiles' lawyers have argued that Colorado's law prevents families and teens who want to address gender dysphoria by aligning identity and sex from working with a licensed counselor to help reach that goal. But under the measure, practices that provide assistance to patients undergoing gender transition are allowed, they said.",
      "\"It's not the government's role to peer into the counseling room and say some goals are permitted. Some goals are forbidden. Some speech is allowed. Some speech is forbidden,\" Jonathan Scruggs, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, said. \"In this country, we let the people decide what information they want. We don't let government bureaucrats decide. That's really the choice before the court.\"",
      "Chiles' lawyers also warned that if the law as applied to talk therapy is allowed, it could open the door to states imposing regulations on licensed professionals that could sweep up speech on all types of topics, like doctors discussing birth control or therapists encouraging divorce.",
      "\"Colorado's principle is really like a government censorship free-for-all,\" Scruggs said. \"Their theory is any time you have professionals giving advice, the government has total discretion to either ban or compel speech in that context. Would some states ban counselors from encouraging divorce? Or using contraception or the reverse?\"",
      "But Colorado officials said there is a long history of states regulating the health care profession to protect patients from substandard treatment, and the First Amendment has never barred states from doing that. Colorado pointed to medical malpractice laws and other licensing regimes, which lawyers said have long covered mental health and other treatments performed with words.",
      "\"This is because these words are used by a professional in a fiduciary relationship, to provide individualized treatment based on specialized knowledge, for the sole purpose of promoting the patient's health,\" officials wrote.",
      "Additionally, they have argued conversion therapy is ineffective and associated with depression, anxiety, loss of faith and suicidality, regardless of how it is performed. Major medical associations have warned that efforts to change a patient's sexual orientation or gender identity are potentially harmful to young people and not supported by credible scientific evidence.",
      "Colorado officials have also pushed back on Chiles' claim that it is trying to tamp down on certain speech \u2014 discouraging gender transition \u2014 that it disfavors.",
      "\"The only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor's sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\" they said in court papers.",
      "Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for LGBTQ Rights, said the law leaves room for legitimate therapy.",
      "\"What's prohibited by these laws is a very specific, very narrow set of practices, with the therapist trying to impose their own agenda on a minor patient, trying to seek a predetermined outcome,\" he said.",
      "Colorado lawyers and those backing the state warned that if Chiles' prevails, it would destabilize longstanding health care regulation and gut states' power to ensure mental health professionals adhere to the standard of care.",
      "\"If the court were to accept Chiles' argument that any time there's a professional regulation of medical care that applies to what a provider can and cannot say, that that's a free speech issue, that those laws are automatically subject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment, that would be a very revolutionary, dramatic change in the current legal landscape. It would put countless other types of medical and mental health regulations into jeopardy,\" Minter said.",
      "Both sides have cited the Supreme Court's 2018 decision in a case involving a California law that required \"crisis pregnancy centers\" to provide certain notices to patients, which the high court found likely violated the First Amendment. In the majority opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court wrote \"speech is not unprotected merely because it is uttered by 'professionals,'\" and warned that regulating the content of professionals' speech risks suppression of unpopular ideas.",
      "The Trump administration is backing Chiles in the case, but told the Supreme Court in a filing that it should send the case back to lower courts for further proceedings. The Justice Department will participate in oral arguments Tuesday.",
      "\"Colorado is muzzling one side of an ongoing debate in the mental-health community about how to discuss questions of gender and sexuality with children,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing. \"Under the First Amendment, the State bears a heavy burden to justify that content-based restriction on protected speech.\"",
      "Federal appeals courts that have weighed state bans on conversion therapy have divided over their legality. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit invalidated local restrictions in Florida in 2020, finding that \"the First Amendment has no carveout for controversial speech.\" But appeals courts in Philadelphia and San Francisco have upheld bans in New Jersey and Washington.",
      "The Supreme Court in 2023 turned away a challenge to Washington's law, leaving the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in place. Three justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, said they would have taken up the case.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Thomas wrote there is \"little question\" that Washington's law regulates speech and implicates the First Amendment. He argued that under the measure, licensed counselors can only convey a \"state-approved message of encouraging minors to explore their gender identities.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amy-coney-barrett-harassment-death-threats-supreme-court-term-2025/",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Oct 2025 12:10:32 -0400",
    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News, Justice Amy Coney Barrett said of the Supreme Court's emergency orders in the Trump cases, \"This isn't the final decision.\"",
    "story": [
      "Whenever Justice Amy Coney Barrett arrived at an auditorium or a library or a university last month to discuss her new book, she encountered a familiar sight: protesters.",
      "They lined the streets, chanting and carrying signs. One wore a handmaid's costume, a symbol of oppression. Another was dressed as liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose death in 2020 created a vacancy on the Supreme Court that President Trump would fill with Barrett.",
      "For Barrett, protesters have become routine, another logistical wrinkle in her everyday life, much like the ones who regularly gather at her home outside Washington, D.C., where she lives with her husband and younger children. What surprises her, she told me in a wide-ranging interview in her chambers late last month, is how she can let it roll off her back.",
      "\"If I had imagined before I was on the Court, how I would react to knowing that I was being protested, that would have seemed like a big deal, like, 'oh, my gosh, I'm being protested,'\" she says. \"But now I have the ability to be like, 'Oh, okay, well, are the entrances blocked?' I just feel very businesslike about it. It doesn't matter to me. It doesn't disrupt my emotions.\"",
      "A fury of protests against conservative justices erupted in 2022, when news leaked that the Court was poised to overturn the landmark decision Roe v. Wade. Barrett, a conservative in the mold of her former mentor and boss Antonin Scalia, was a particular source of ire. Replacing Ginsburg, whose legal career was grounded in women's rights, she provided a key fifth vote to overturn Roe and let each state decide whether to allow abortion or not. But the decision also unleashed something much darker.",
      "On Friday, a California resident was sentenced to eight years in prison for the attempted assassination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who also voted to overturn Roe. Court papers revealed the perpetrator had also mapped out the homes of three other conservative justices, including Barrett's. Death threats have not gone away, and security remains high at their homes and whenever they appear in public.",
      "I asked Barrett if she is ever afraid. Her response was immediate and emphatic: \"I'm not afraid.\"",
      "\"You can't live your life in fear,\" she continued. \"And I think people who threaten \u2014 the goal is to cause fear. And I'm not afraid. I'm not going to reward threats with their intended reaction.\"",
      "That kind of mental discipline and self control, even in the face of threats and extreme criticism, reflects an outlook that has guided the 53-year-old Barrett much of her life.",
      "\"I don't make decisions emotionally. I try very hard not to let emotions guide decisions in any aspect of my life. The way that I respond to people, the choices that we make,\" she continues, adding with a laugh, \"apart from maybe some impulse buys of clothes or something.\"",
      "That outlook is also reflected in her approach to the law.",
      "On the Supreme Court, Barrett's opinions are highly analytical. She doesn't like to decide more than the issue at hand, which is one reason she has parted ways with conservative colleagues who would rather swing for the fences, like in a case two terms ago when the Court ruled states cannot remove Mr. Trump from the ballot. Barrett agreed on the bottom line, but had a more limited approach.",
      "As a former law professor, she can be formalistic and technical, qualities that also can separate her from other conservatives, as in a 2024 case that attempted to hold the Biden administration responsible for suppressing speech on social media during Covid.",
      "Now entering her sixth year on the Court, Barrett continues to defy stereotypes. Critics span the political spectrum, not only Democrats after she voted to overturn Roe, but more recently Republicans in the wake of decisions at odds with Mr. Trump. She is \"confounding the Right and the Left,\" as the New York Times put it, raising hopes and fears on both sides.",
      "That's partly because, in decades past, some conservative justices have turned out to be anything but conservative. Would Barrett, too, go that route? And it's also in part because of a fundamental misunderstanding about the Court, reflecting an idea that the justices are mere political actors who should stay on their respective sides, regardless of the law.",
      "\"That is a notion that I try to disabuse people of in the book,\" she says.",
      "Correcting some of those public misperceptions that the Supreme Court is driven by politics or outcomes or is loyal to Mr. Trump is one of her main goals with her new book, \"Listening to the Law.\" She is part teacher, part tour guide, taking the reader inside the Court and highlighting some of its most controversial decisions to explain how the justices interpret the Constitution and the differences in conservative and liberal philosophies.",
      "And there is no case more controversial than the 5-4 decision overturning Roe, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Whole Health. Barrett uses it to explain how she and the Court's conservative majority interpret the Constitution with a method known as \"originalism,\" focusing on the Constitution's original meaning, the way the public understood it when it was adopted.",
      "In our interview, Barrett said she was drawn to originalism when she read Justice Scalia's opinions in a constitutional law class during her second year at Notre Dame Law School. She said she was frustrated after a first-year criminal law class, reading liberal decisions of the Warren Court and finding them to be \"unmoored.\" Scalia's opinions, with his originalist framework, made sense to her.",
      "\"I think I am different in style than Justice Scalia. I don't think I'm different in substance,\" she said. \"I think one thing that was important to Justice Scalia is fidelity to his analytical framework, so fidelity to textualism and originalism, even when it led to places that he didn't want to go.\"",
      "Scalia, for example, upheld flag burning as a First Amendment right, even though he said \"if I were king, I would not.\" With Barrett, an example is the death penalty. She upholds it as constitutional, even though it is at odds with her religious views.",
      "And that framework, she says, is how she approaches the cases involving Mr. Trump. While politicians, the media and the public are focused on the current occupant of the office, she says \"the Court has to take the long view.\"",
      "\"The way that we have to view cases is about the presidency, not about the president. We have to make a decision that's going to apply to six presidents from now, and that's how I try to view the law,\" she says. \"So in the same way that I do try to erase particular policies, or substitute in ones that I like or dislike \u2014 to try to maintain neutrality \u2014 I try to do that with the presidents too, because it can't turn on the president.\"",
      "Her critics aren't convinced, but Barrett seems unfazed by the attacks on her judgment or her character. In our conversation, and in multiple interviews with those who know her, she comes across as someone with a strong sense of self and an equally clear view on the right way to interpret the Constitution. Unlike some justices, she says she doesn't monitor what journalists and law professors and politicians say about the Court. She has seen them get it wrong. It doesn't matter to her.",
      "\"If I could have, especially as a 16-year-old, imagined that I would not care or be impervious to being criticized and mocked, I would have been very surprised,\" she says. \"And so I am glad, because I think this would be a miserable job if you let yourself care, if you let yourself be affected.\"",
      "Barrett first walked through the fire after Mr. Trump nominated her in 2017 to the Chicago-based federal appeals court. In her Senate hearings, she withstood withering attacks on her faith, notably when then-Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein told her, \"the dogma lives loudly within you.\" Her steely performance impressed conservatives and helped get her on Mr. Trump's Supreme Court shortlist.",
      "Barrett was astonished by how she was portrayed by the media. (She said a cousin told her \"the person they were describing is not the person that I've known my whole life at all.\")",
      "A mother of seven, Barrett is a devout Catholic and proud daughter from a large and supportive family with deep roots in New Orleans. Before becoming an appeals court judge, she was a popular and respected Notre Dame law professor with sparkling credentials. Always a high achiever, she had received full scholarships to college and law school at Notre Dame, where she was top in her class (and met her future husband) and earned highly competitive clerkships with towering conservative icons, Judge Laurence Silberman and Scalia.",
      "\"One thing that I really disliked was this idea that I had no backbone, or that I was just this subservient woman in some way,\" she said, \"because I felt like I am anything but that.\"",
      "She had set goals for her life early on, and she made conscious and methodical choices to reach them. She wanted a big family like she grew up with, but, of course, she would work, so she wanted flexibility in her career.",
      "\"I really admired my parents, I really admired my grandparents, and I thought, if I want to be the kind of people that they are, I have to make definite choices,\" she told me. \"I have to decide what my values are, what my priorities are, and make definite choices and prioritize those kinds of things.\"",
      "Thinking about law school after college, she says she remembers sitting in her dorm room at Rhodes College and making a list of pros and cons, focusing on what mattered to her and \"I just reasoned my way to it.\" (Barrett, always analytical, mentions in her book that her life runs on to-do lists, but she also is partial to pro/con lists.)",
      "She's now the only justice on the Court who didn't attend an Ivy League school, but Barrett says she didn't care about labels or what was considered \"the best school.\" She didn't even apply to Harvard. She opted for Notre Dame over the University of Chicago, for instance, not only because she could prioritize her Catholic faith, but that it also offered a full scholarship. That meant no big student loans that would force her into an all-consuming, high-paying law firm job after graduation.",
      "Searching for a more accurate way to describe herself, Barrett uses the term \"Steel Magnolia.\"",
      "\"I've done a lot of traditionally feminine things. I have a large family. I've made unconventional choices in that way. And I'm not sorry to be feminine,\" she said. \"But I don't feel like I have to sacrifice that part. I think you can be traditional in some of those ways, and still have grit or the backbone or the spine. I felt like I had the grit.\"",
      "\"Grit\" is a word she uses more than once in the book when talking about strong women she admires, like her great-grandmother, a widow who raised 13 children in a tiny house \"bursting at the seams\" during the Great Depression. \"Somehow she always managed to find the resources, space and time,\" Barrett writes.",
      "Throughout our conversation, I'm struck by something she wrote early in the book, when she mentions advice her father gave to her and her siblings: \"Control your emotions, or your emotions will control you.\"",
      "It's similar to advice Justice Ginsburg liked to share from her mother: \"Don't be distracted by emotions like anger, envy, resentment. These just zap energy and waste time.\" Ginsburg would say her advice came in handy at the Court, because she learned that reacting with \"anger or annoyance will not advance one's ability to persuade.\"",
      "I asked Barrett if she, like Ginsburg, drew on that advice at the Court.",
      "\"Yes, in this job, I think it's part of the tuning out, that I can't let what people say\u2026certainly not affect the decisions that I make, but even affect how I feel,\" she says. \"If I let that in, and then let that affect my mood when I go home or when I'm relating to people, then that needs to be kept out.\"",
      "Having that mindset, Barrett says, is one of the things she's most proud of as justice, because that wasn't how she felt as a young teenager growing up in a family of nine.",
      "\"I felt very conspicuous. We would go into restaurants, and you could see people turning around and counting and looking,\" she says. \"In the preteen and teenage self-conscious years, I thought, I just want to be unnoticed. I'm never gonna have a family that attracts attention.\"",
      "Barrett rarely shows the kind of rhetorical fire or hyperbole some of her colleagues regularly exhibit. Stylistically, as she says, she is no Scalia. But with the Court increasingly under strain as it grapples with dozens of emergency requests from the Trump administration, Barrett exhibited a flash of pique last term, responding to a fiery dissent by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in the case limiting the use of nationwide injunctions.",
      "Jackson, a Biden appointee and the Court's newest member, accused the Court of engaging in \"legalese.\" Barrett, speaking for the majority, responded: \"We will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries with of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself.\"",
      "In the months since, Jackson has only ratcheted up her rhetoric as the Court has issued temporary orders in a range of cases brought by the Trump administration. In one emergency order last month, on whether Mr. Trump could cancel grants to the National Institutes of Health, Jackson impugned the conservatives' motives.",
      "Jackson accused them of having \"no fixed rules\" except \"this Administration always wins\" something Barrett pointed out in an event last month was obviously false. (Just one high-profile example: The Court ruled against the Administration's deportation of Kilmar Albrego Garcia and ordered it to work toward his return to the U.S.)",
      "Still, Barrett insists that kind of language doesn't affect her relationship with Jackson, and that she works to have relationships with all the other justices. She says she enjoys talking about the law with Justice Elena Kagan, also a former law professor who, like Barrett has a more formalistic approach to the law than the Court's two other liberals, even though it leads them to very different places.",
      "In a recent interview, Bari Weiss of The Free Press asked Barrett to give one word for each of her colleagues. For Kagan, Barrett chose \"analytical.\" That's a word she also used in our conversation to describe herself.",
      "\"You can't take it personally, and so I think you just have to understand and see opinions for what they are: disagreements about ideas,\" Barrett said of the dissents. \"I intend my opinions to be about the ideas, not about the people, and I think a big part of life is assuming the best of other people.\"",
      "Barrett doesn't seem like a person who dwells in regret. But she said she saw a \"missed opportunity\" on her cross-country book tour, and she wished she'd emphasized how the emergency orders in the Trump cases are different. Always a teacher, she wants to explain these orders aren't the last word.",
      "\"I don't think the public is really aware this isn't the final decision. If a district court enters a preliminary injunction, and we enter a stay of that preliminary injunction, it's not saying the administration wins,\" she says. \"It's simply saying that the administration\u2026can continue to pursue whatever policy it is, because it has not been finally decided yet.\"",
      "In other words, she says, these interim orders \u2014 whether they're allowing Mr. Trump to cut grants or foreign aid or fire political appointees from federal agencies \u2014 are short-term, preliminary decisions. The Court is allowing Mr. Trump to pursue those policies for now, but if he ultimately loses on the underlying merits, the aid money will have to be spent and the employees reinstated with back pay.",
      "And Mr. Trump, I said, may not win them all?",
      "\"Right,\" Barrett said.",
      "It may look different, I asked, once you're deciding the merits?",
      "\"100 percent,\" she said.",
      "For now, one factor weighing in Mr. Trump's favor is the Court's assessment of the harm caused when unelected judges reflexively block policies enacted by popularly elected representatives. Because litigation can take years to resolve, those policies may never end up taking effect. The harm caused by judicial interference, the Court has explained, is to the democratic process.",
      "\"The case that we always cite is Maryland v. King, and it points out that any time a policy of one of the politically accountable branches or politically accountable state legislatures or governor is stopped, that, in itself, is an irreparable harm because you are affecting the people,\" she says. \"It was the people's preferred policy. The president is the one that they elected. The members of whatever legislature, state or Congress, are the ones that people elected.\"",
      "\"I may disagree, or agree, with whatever choices the people have made in the selection of their representatives,\" she said. \"But the people have made this choice.\"",
      "Beyond the obvious strain on the Court, the unprecedented crush of emergency appeals also has put pressure on lower court judges, and some have complained publicly that the Court's brief orders aren't giving them enough guidance. But Barrett, always methodical, says more guidance at the preliminary stage would come at a cost, raising the risk of locking the Court into its views before it has fully considered the issues.",

      "Barrett, like all the justices when speaking in public, is exceedingly careful with her words. She won't discuss any upcoming issues or cases, or give any hint on how the Court may see the underlying merits. Even her book tour seemed like an exercise in not making news, and she succeeded.",
      "But she will have that opportunity soon enough: The justices already have agreed to decide whether Mr. Trump can impose far-ranging tariffs and fire members of certain federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board. In the interim, it's allowing him to pursue tariffs and fire some Biden-appointed commissioners, though not on the Fed. Other cases, including birthright citizenship, are on the horizon.",
      "Beyond the Trump cases, the Court this term also will confront controversial cases on gun rights, voting rights, campaign finance reform and whether students who identify as transgender can play girls sports. The tensions and commentary will not ease anytime soon.",
      "For Barrett, that means staying the course, following her own internal compass and tuning out the noise, because one thing is certain. Whatever the Court decides in any of the cases, she says, \"somebody's going to be mad.\" It's a part of her life now.",
      "\"I just think you have to know who you are,\" she says, \"and make decisions that you decide are right, and stick with your priorities and not worry about the feedback you get from others, whether it's negative or whether it's positive.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not take up a bid by Ghislaine Maxwell to overturn her 2021 conviction for sex trafficking.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not take up a bid by Ghislaine Maxwell to overturn her 2021 conviction and 20-year prison sentence for her role in a scheme to sexually exploit and abuse minor girls with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Maxwell's appeal to the high court attracted added attention this summer as the Trump administration came under pressure to release more material related to the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein, who died in federal custody in 2019. Congress also opened its own examination of the federal probe and has obtained and released thousands of pages of records related to Epstein, though many were already in the public domain.",
      "Senior Justice Department officials unsuccessfully petitioned a federal court in New York to unseal grand jury material in Epstein's case, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell in Tallahassee, Florida, in July to discuss her relationship with Epstein and the allegations against her.",
      "The Supreme Court's rejection of Maxwell's case means her conviction and sentence will remain intact, barring a presidential pardon.",
      "At the heart of Maxwell's appeal is a 2007 nonprosecution agreement between the U.S. attorney in Miami and Epstein, which she argued barred her prosecution for sex-trafficking violations.",
      "Epstein's lawyers and then-U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta entered into the deal after a federal investigation into allegations Epstein engaged in sexual abuse of underage girls. In exchange for avoiding federal charges, Epstein agreed to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges and serve an 18-month prison sentence.",
      "The agreement specified that if Epstein fulfilled all of its terms, he would not be prosecuted \"in this district,\" the Southern District of Florida. It also contained a so-called co-conspirators clause, which stated that if Epstein satisfied the deal's conditions, the U.S. would \"not institute any criminal char[g]es against any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including but not limited to\" four of his assistants.",
      "A Justice Department official in West Palm Beach later told the department's Office of Professional Responsibility the provision was \"highly unusual,\" and a former prosecutor who handled the case said she didn't consider that Epstein may have been trying to protect anyone other than his four assistants, according to court records.",
      "Acosta went on to serve as labor secretary during Mr. Trump's first term, but he resigned in 2019 amid scrutiny of his handling of the nonprosecution agreement with Epstein. He stepped down shortly after Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in New York. Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial.",
      "Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein's, was indicted in New York in 2020 and charged with several criminal offenses arising out of her scheme with Epstein. She attempted to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the co-conspirators clause in Epstein's nonprosecution agreement prohibited her prosecution because she was charged as his co-conspirator.",
      "A federal district court rejected Maxwell's effort, finding that the deal bound only the U.S. Attorney's Office in Florida. It also ruled that most of the charges would've fallen outside the scope of the agreement even if it covered the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York.",
      "Maxwell's trial proceeded, and she was found guilty in 2021. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Maxwell had been serving her sentence at a federal correctional facility in Tallahassee, but she was moved to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas after meeting with Blanche, the deputy attorney general, in July.",
      "She appealed her conviction and sentence on several grounds, including that the nonprosecution deal barred her prosecution. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit rejected her claims, ruling that \"nothing in the text of the NPA precluded\" the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan from bringing charges against Maxwell.",
      "Maxwell asked the Supreme Court to take up her case in April, arguing that the co-conspirator clause contained no \"geographic limitation\" on where it could be enforced. Her lawyers said in a filing that a decision from the Supreme Court should ensure that plea deals are enforced consistently throughout the country, \"so that when the United States makes a promise in a plea agreement, it is held to that promise.\"",
      "But the Trump administration urged the Supreme Court not to reconsider Maxwell's conviction and sentence. It noted that Justice Department policy at the time the deal was negotiated prohibited U.S. attorneys from entering into agreements that bound other districts unless they received written approval from those districts or the head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division.",
      "\"There is no indication here that anyone involved in negotiating Epstein's NPA obtained the necessary approval for binding other USAOs or thought it was necessary,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",

      "The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.",
      "While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.",
      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness.

    "summary": "The first supermoon of 2025 will arrive soon. Here's what to know about the phenomenon.",
    "story": [
      "The moon will appear slightly larger and brighter Monday night during what's known as a supermoon.",
      "October's supermoon is the first of three this year. It happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. The subtle difference happens a few times a year, sometimes coinciding with other astronomical events such as lunar eclipses.",
      "\"It's not really very unusual,\" said Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer with the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",
      "Everyone in the world can see a supermoon without special equipment, if the skies are clear. But the difference can be tough to discern, especially if people haven't observed the regular moon on the nights leading up.",
      "\"If you go out and just look at the moon when it's very high in the sky, there is nothing relative to it to give you an idea of how big it looks,\" Pitts said.",
      "In the latest viewing, the moon will pass within about 224,600 miles of Earth. The closest supermoon of the year is slated for November, followed by another in December.",
      "The spectacles continue in 2026 with two lunar eclipses: a total eclipse across much of North America, Asia and Australia in March, and a partial one in August across the Americas, Africa and Europe.",
      "Why does the moon appear bigger and brighter during a supermoon?",
      "Like Earth's orbit around the Sun, the moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical, or oval-shaped. This means it's positioned at different distances from the planet depending on the time of the month. The distances range from about 226,000 miles and 251,000 miles, according to NASA.",
      "When the moon is hovering around one of those closer distances along its path in orbit, and there's also a full moon, it becomes a supermoon. The proximity to Earth can make the moon appear bigger to skywatchers on the ground. Sunlight reflecting off the moon can also appear brighter, NASA says.",
      "Supermoons only happen three or four times a year, since the moon's closeness to Earth rarely coincides with monthly full moons. They aren't identical, either. Astronomers generally consider a full moon to be \"super\" if the moon's position in orbit is at least 90% of the distance from its farthest point to Earth in the ellipse to its closest. The absolute closest point\u00a0is called the perigee.",

      "The pasta manufactured in Roseville, California, by Nate's Fine Foods is possibly contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections.",
      "Kroger's recalled products were sold across 1,860 Kroger Family of Stores \u2014 including Baker's, City Market, Dillons, Fred Meyer, Fry's, Gerbes, King Soopers, Payless, Ralphs and Smith's \u2014 in the following states: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, Ohio, Oregona, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington and West Virginia.",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Oct 2025 20:19:39 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans are concerned about the effect of the shutdown on the economy, amid unease about jobs and inflation.",
    "story": [
      "For many Americans, across party lines, concern over the government shutdown means concern about its potential impact on the economy, among other things.",
      "Therefore, many don't think either party's position is worth having a shutdown over.",
      "Given that, no one is looking especially good politically at the moment. President Trump, congressional Democrats, and Republicans are all net negative on their handling of the shutdown thus far.",
      "Neither party is on very solid footing. The top descriptor Americans pick for the Democratic Party overall is \"weak;\" the party trails the GOP on being described as \"effective\" and \"strong,\" and their favorables trail the GOP's. The top descriptor for Republicans, though, is \"extreme.\"",
      "All of it looks to the public like another distraction from larger matters of concern. A sizable majority of the country says the Trump administration isn't focused enough on lowering prices, and is focused too much on tariffs, as they have been for months. Reflecting some of that, many still describe the president himself as \"energetic,\" but fewer describe him now as \"focused\" than did at the start of his term.",
      "Relatively few Americans say the Democrats' or Republicans' positions are worth a shutdown. As it is still fairly recent, many aren't sure yet.",
      "For the Democrats, only half their rank and file think their party's positions are worth a shutdown, and even fewer Republicans say that of the GOP's positions. That said, they don't blame their respective parties for the situation, either.",
      "There's plenty of that blame to go around. Republicans and the president get relatively more than congressional Democrats, but taken together with Americans who blame both equally, a majority of the country holds all of them responsible.",
      "When asked what the shutdown debate is mainly about, health care is the top response from a list of issues, and those following the matter more closely pick that more often. That may speak to the parties' respective arguments getting at least to their bases.",
      "The percentage very concerned about the impact on the economy is higher than for other items.",
      "People also express concern, to a lesser degree, about the effects of the shutdown on federal employees. Also, the military, transportation and air travel, and Social Security and Medicare, which, even if they are not directly part of the negotiations, likely show that people tend to associate these programs with the government, generally.",
      "Still, overall views and descriptors of the parties aren't positive ones. Each has underwater favorability ratings overall, with the Republicans getting slightly better ratings than the Democrats.",
      "From a list of descriptors of the parties, it's a case of weak (the way most of the nation describes the Democratic Party) versus extreme (the most often-picked label for the GOP).",
      "The Republican Party greatly outpaces the Democrats on being called \"effective\" and \"strong.\"",
      "Over four in 10 rank-and-file Democrats describe their own party as weak.",
      "The economy and the president",
      "Against the backdrop of the shutdown, and helping explain why so many are concerned about its economic impact, inflation and the economy continue to be seen as the nation's top issues. And as has been the case for a while, a large majority says the Trump administration isn't focused enough on lowering prices. And most continue to say it is focused too much on tariffs.",
      "And most say Trump's policies are costing jobs in the U.S., rather than creating jobs.",
      "That's combined with Americans' view that Trump's policies aren't making them better off and are still making prices go up. On balance, the president's handling of inflation, specifically, has ticked down again.",
      "Fewer Americans now describe the president as \"focused\" than did at the start of his second term. His top descriptors remain \"tough\" and \"energetic,\" but the percentage who call him \"effective\" is also down compared to February.",
      "More broadly \u2014 and not specifically related to the shutdown, but perhaps pertinent given that situation \u2014 Americans still say it's Congress, not the president, who should have the most authority over federal spending. That's a view held by majorities of Democrats, independents, and Republicans.",
      "Donald Trump's overall approval rating, at 42%, is now back down to what it was in July, after hitting 44% last month. He remains bolstered by support from his Republican base, and still gets better marks on his deportation program and immigration than on inflation and the economy overall.",
      "At 43%, the president's approval rating on handling the conflict between Israel and Hamas is similar to what it was this summer, and higher than his approval ratings on economic issues. (This polling was conducted before reports of a possible ceasefire deal.)",
      "Troops and U.S. cities",
      "The idea of troops going to U.S. cities remains divisive. It's backed staunchly by the president's Republican base, especially those who identify as MAGA, but finds far less backing beyond it.",
      "Whether it's the National Guard specifically or active-duty military troops going to cities, views are similar. Much of it, beyond the partisan breaks, is tied to where one sees threats to the U.S. originating.",
      "Those who support troops in cities tend to see threats from inside the country, subscribing to some of the arguments made by the administration, that threats are coming from domestic enemies.",
      "But for the majority of Americans who see dangers more from economic forces, or who feel the U.S. military's overall focus ought to be outside the U.S., it is much less so.",
      "For decades now, a majority of Americans have backed having women who serve in the military participating in combat roles, and that continues to be the case today, at three-quarters, a view shared equally by men and women. The quarter of Americans who do not think women in the military should participate in combat roles tend to be more conservative.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,441 U.S. adults interviewed between October 1-3, 2025.

      "\"Additional strengthening is forecast, and Priscilla is expected to become a category 2 hurricane, and could  approach major hurricane status within the next couple of days,\" it added. Priscilla will likely start weakening by midweek.",
      "Category 2 hurricanes have sustained winds of at least 96 mph. Major hurricane categories begin at 3, with minimum sustained winds of 111 mph.",
      "As of the NHC's 2 p.m. EDT update on Monday, the storm was located about 205 miles south-southwest of Cabo Corrientes, near the resort town of Puerto Vallarta, and about 370 miles south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California.",
      "It was traveling north-northwest at 6 mph with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph.",

      "Swells generated by Priscilla have started affecting parts of the southwestern Mexico coast and will get to portions of the west-central Mexican coast and southern Baja California Peninsula today, the center cautioned, and the swells \"are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\"",

    "story": [
      "Jerusalem \u2014\u00a0Israel and Hamas have started indirect talks on a plan to end the war in Gaza.",
      "An Egyptian official \u2014 speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the talks \u2014 told The Associated Press that the talks started at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday.",
      "Egypt's state-owned Al-Qahera News TV station reported that the talks began with a meeting between a Hamas delegation and Arab mediators, who were expected to meet later with an Israeli delegation.",
      "Negotiators were expected to discuss President Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza, which was sparked two years ago, on Oct. 7, by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel. Mr. Trump presented his plan during a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House last Monday.",
      "Hamas \u2014 which is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and many other nations \u2014 issued a statement on Friday saying it agreed to some of the key points in the plan, including releasing all the remaining hostages, living and deceased, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. It also said it agreed to handing over control of Gaza to a transitional international body.",
      "But Hamas did not immediately agree to other points in Mr. Trump's proposal, including some related to its disarmament and future role in Palestinian politics.",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday urged the negotiators to \"move fast\" in the talks, calling ongoing discussions between Hamas and other nations in the region about the ceasefire proposal \"very successful.\" He said they were \"proceeding rapidly.\"",
      "\"The technical teams will again meet Monday, in Egypt, to work through and clarify the final details,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I am told that the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to MOVE FAST. I will continue to monitor this Centuries old 'conflict.' TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE OR, MASSIVE BLOODSHED WILL FOLLOW \u2013 SOMETHING THAT NOBODY WANTS TO SEE!\"",
      "On Monday, the Israeli Hostages Families Forum, which represents most of the families of those still missing, sent a letter to the Nobel Prize committee urging them to bestow the Nobel Peace Prize on Mr. Trump for his \"unwavering commitment and extraordinary leadership\" in seeking a deal to bring the remaining captives home.",
      "The forum said it was backing Mr. Trump for a Nobel \"with hearts full of gratitude and a profound sense of momentous urgency,\" lauding the president's \"determination to bring peace.\"",
      "\"At this very moment, President Trump's comprehensive plan to release all remaining hostages andfinally end this terrible war is on the table,\" the forum says in its letter. \"For the first time in months, we are hopeful that our nightmare will finally be over. We are confident that he will not rest until the last hostage is brought home, the war has ended, and peace and prosperity are restored to the people of the Middle East.\"",
      "Egypt's foreign ministry said\u00a0the talks would focus on \"establishing the necessary humanitarian and logistical conditions for implementing a prisoner exchange deal between Israel and Hamas.\"",
      "According to Mr. Trump's proposal, the exchange would see the 48 remaining Israeli hostages released. Israeli officials believe about 20 of them are still alive. After that, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners who are being held by Israel would be freed. Of those prisoners, 250 are serving life sentences and 1,700 are from Gaza and were detained after the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "The talks will also \"address the details of the process in line with the plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, aimed at ending the war and alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza,\" Egypt's foreign ministry said.",
      "Amid the signs of a potential deal, Israeli strikes continued Sunday in Gaza, although CBS News sources said there were fewer than before Mr. Trump's proposal was announced. The IDF said it \"struck and eliminated a terrorist cell armed with explosive devices and mortars that were intended to be used in terror attacks against IDF troops in the area of Gaza City.\"",
      "An Israeli government spokesperson said Sunday that \"certain bombings have actually stopped inside of the Gaza Strip,\" but they added that there is \"no ceasefire in place at this point in time.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that Israel's bombing of Gaza would need to stop for the remaining hostages to be released.",
      "\"I'd give it a 50% shot of happening, because both sides feel the pressure to get this done. Israel feels the pressure from the U.S., and Hamas feels the pressure from Qatar, from Turkey, from Egypt, from Jordan, and from Saudi Arabia,\" former senior Israeli diplomat Alon Pinkas told CBS News on Monday, referring to the possible hostage and prisoner swap. \"As for the rest of the plan, the likelihood goes down from 50% to maybe 10%. I just doubt it's going to happen. Even this phase is going to be as ambiguous and amenable to interpretations, and I don't see it going smoothly.\"",
      "Ohad Ben Ami, who was captured by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attack and released in a prisoner swap in February, said he was eager for a deal to get done.",
      "\"Now it seems like there is hope,\" Ben Ami said over the weekend at an event. He added that felt betrayed by Israel's government.",
      "\"I love my country, and I love the people, but our government is disconnected. And until now, I have the feeling of insult. I feel that they abandoned me,\" he said.",
      "During his time in captivity, Ben Ami was first held above ground in a series of apartments in Gaza before being moved down into Hamas' vast tunnel network underneath the Palestinian territory, where he said he and other hostages were kept in squalid conditions and not given enough to eat.",
      "\"I'm here with you. I speak and I talk, but in my mind, I'm down there,\" Ben Ami said at the Sunday event. \"Until they \u2026 come back, all the 48 (remaining hostages), I cannot live. I'm still a hostage. I'm a free man, but not in my soul.\"",

The CP-140 Aurora, a maritime patrol aircraft operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force, is designed primarily to hunt enemy submarines \u2014 but this crew is on a different mission: tracking North Korean vessels engaged in illicit trade that violates United Nations sanctions.",
      "\"There are definitely some boats that look more suspicious than others,\" the captain currently deployed on the operation tells CBS News as he pilots the plane. The Canadian air force asked CBS News not to use the captain's name as he is still on active duty.",
      "Operating in international airspace over international waters, the mission \u2014 known as Operation NEON \u2014 takes the plane close to Chinese territory, often triggering a dramatic response by Beijing, which intercepts the Aurora on multiple occasions during its mission while a CBS News crew is onboard.",

      "\"As long as things remain professional and safe, this mission continues unabated,\" Brigadier General Jeff Davis, who commands the Canadian operation, tells CBS News.",
      "Soon after, the Chinese fighter jet disappears, but it's only a temporary halt to the Chinese actions. A few hours later, another jet appears, this one carrying missiles. All crew members move into position to document the second intercept.",
      "The jet, flying just four wing lengths' away \u2014 less than 200 feet \u2014 comes closer than any Chinese fighter has come to the Aurora throughout its mission.",
      "China has been North Korea's economic lifeline since international sanctions were imposed on Pyongyang in 2006, after its first nuclear test.",
      "But the sanctions clearly have not had the desired effect. Russia and China used to be opposed to North Korea's nuclear development, but not any more.",
      "China has been a vital economic lifeline for the Kim regime in Pyongyang, propping up North Korea's economy. More recently, Russia has also played a big role, giving the North oil in exchange for ammunition and troops deployed in support of Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "The Kim dynasty has long hoped to force the world to accept North Korea as a nuclear power. It's currently estimated to possess approximately 50 nuclear weapons, and is on the verge of developing a long-range missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the U.S. mainland.",

      "Husamettin Dogan, sentenced to nine years in prison last December, denies he intended to rape Pelicot. He argues that he was deceived by Dominique Pelicot, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's ex-husband, who drugged his wife and offered her to strangers online before filming the assaults.",
      "The 44-year-old construction worker went on trial Monday in Nimes, in southern France, on charges of aggravated rape by administering substances that impair judgment or self-control, an offense carrying up to 20 years in prison.",
      "He remains free pending the verdict. Prosecutors had sought 12 years at his first trial, but the court imposed nine.",
      "Wearing a pink jacket, Pelicot entered the courthouse under police escort, smiling as she shook hands with supporters who shouted \"Thank you!\" and other words of encouragement.",
      "In the original proceedings, Pelicot's ex-husband and 50 other men were convicted of sexually assaulting her between 2011 and 2020 while she was under chemical submission. Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in prison, while sentences for other defendants ranged from three to 15 years imprisonment.",
      "The trial drew international attention after Gis\u00e8le Pelicot opposed a closed hearing, a demand made by several defendants. The court sided with her.",
      "According to the French newspaper Le Monde, which covered the trial, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot at one point said in court that the reason she wanted the hearings to happen publicly was so that \"all women who are victims of rape can say to themselves: 'Madame Pelicot did it, so we can do it.'\"",
      "\"I don't want them to feel ashamed anymore. It's not for us to feel shame \u2014 it's for them [sexual attackers],\" she said. \"Above all, I'm expressing my will and determination to change this society.\"",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot said on the trial's opening day that \"shame must change sides.\" After the verdict, she declared she had \"never regretted that decision\" to push for public proceedings and thanked supporters who gave her the \"strength\" to return to court each day.",

    "summary": "Fishermen in Trinidad and Tobago are fearing that a U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean could kill them and their livelihoods.",
    "story": [
      "On a recent afternoon, Kenrick Modie finished untangling his fishing net in a quiet Caribbean village.",
      "As he slipped into a hammock at his home overlooking the sea, he worried that his life and livelihood could be wiped out by a U.S. military strike.",
      "Modie lives in the Caribbean twin-island nation of Trinidad and Tobago, which is now entangled in a geopolitical face-off between the United States and Venezuela, just 11 miles away.",
      "U.S. President Trump \"is giving instructions to shoot and kill people,\" Modie said about recent U.S. military strikes targeting suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean as it bulks up its military presence in the region. \"What could we do? We're just a little dot.\"",
      "The United States has carried out at least four strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats in the waters off Venezuela in recent weeks, with at least two of the vessels originating from Venezuela. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the fourth strike on Friday, saying \"four male narco-terrorists\" were killed, but offering no other details on who they were.",
      "Mr. Trump declared in a notification to Congress viewed by CBS News that the U.S. was in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels in the Caribbean, alleging they are trying to bring \"deadly poison\" to U.S. shores.",
      "Meanwhile, Venezuela has accused the U.S. of military buildup and aggression, prompting President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to place the country's military and civilians willing to take up arms on high alert.",
      "Stuck in the middle is Trinidad and Tobago, a nation with a multimillion-dollar fishing industry that employs thousands of fishermen who cast their nets almost daily to sustain themselves and their families.",
      "\"If we die, we die\"",
      "Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar has said that drug cartels have contributed to pain and suffering in her country, and she has urged the U.S. to \"kill them all violently.\"",
      "She also said she is willing to grant the U.S. access to Trinidad and Tobago, if needed, so Americans can defend Guyana from neighboring Venezuela, which has claimed two-thirds of Guyana as its own.",
      "Maduro said that Persad-Bissessar's willingness to grant such access is like declaring war against Venezuela. The Venezuelan president has called for a return to good relations with its Caribbean neighbor, even as Trinidad and Tobago's government claims there's no bad blood between the countries.",
      "While those in authority trade words and military commanders ramp up their posturing, dozens of fishermen in Trinidad and Tobago feel their lives are at risk, given the ongoing U.S. strikes and escalation of tensions with Venezuela.",
      "\"If we die, we die, that's how this life is,\" Modie said.",
      "He fears being killed by a U.S. military strike while out fishing because he believes his boat could be mistaken for a drug-smuggling vessel. Modie said he hasn't seen substantial evidence that those killed in the U.S. strikes were indeed transporting drugs. He also worries about innocent fishermen being killed and falsely labelled as narco-terrorists by authorities, with the dead men being unable to clear their names.",
      "Fishing in fear",
      "Only seven miles separate Trinidad and Venezuela at their closest point. On a clear day, Venezuela is visible from the village of Icacos, which is located on Trinidad's southwestern tip.",
      "Driving around Icacos and neighboring Cedros village, dozens of boats strewn along the shoreline show how heavily these communities depend on fishing.",
      "Fishermen in these two villages say they are already under threat from pirates, and the military buildup at sea now adds yet another threat.",
      "Watching three other fishermen unload their catch for the day at the Cedros Fishing Complex, Kamal Bikeran said his crew now stays in shallower waters and isn't going as far out to sea as before, because of the tension involving the three countries.",
      "\"The U.S. has come there, and the Venezuelan military is saying they are more present, so you have to watch out,\" Bikeran said. \"At any point in time, outside there, you could be taken out.\"",
      "Forced to fish in shallower waters, Bikeran and other fishermen said the heightened regional tension is drying up their livelihoods, as they are now catching fewer fish.",
      "Mr. Trump gave fishermen a reason to worry after the first U.S. military strike on Sept. 2, which he said killed 11 suspected narco-terrorists.",
      "\"Boat traffic is substantially down,\" Mr. Trump said in early September. \"I don't even know about fishermen. They may say, 'I'm not getting on the boat.'\"",
      "The president repeated that sentiment in remarks Sunday at an event celebrating 250 years of the U.S. Navy in Norfolk, Virginia, saying, \"We're so good at it that there are no boats. In fact, even fishing boats. Nobody wants to go into the water anymore.\"",
      "Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in late September, Caribbean leaders referred to the region as a zone of peace.",
      "Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley appealed for dialogue to avoid a war between the U.S. and Venezuela. The prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Ralph Gonsalves, described the foreign militarization of the waters near Venezuela as \"exceedingly troubling.\"",
      "Fishing in fear has become the new reality, said Shyam Hajarie, who has been a fisherman for more than 40 years. The Cedros native, like others, depends on his daily catches to support his family. He's unsure if the military buildup in the Caribbean would soon affect fish prices at the market.",
      "\"Just praying that everything works out with this situation with Venezuela and the U.S.,\" he said. \"That they make peace and not war.\"",

    "summary": "Japan is set to get its first female prime minister, and conservative Sanae Takaichi will have complex political juggling to do from day-1 to keep the job.",
    "story": [
      "Tokyo \u2014 Japan's embattled governing party now has its new leader, former Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi, a hardline conservative who is poised to become the country's first female prime minister.",
      "Takaichi, 64, immediately needs to seek ways to get her long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stay in power and regain public support by delivering measures to address inflation and diplomatic challenges, including how to deal with President Trump.",
      "\"Japan has just elected its first female Prime Minister, a highly respected person of great wisdom and strength. This is tremendous news for the incredible people of Japan. Congratulations to all!\" Mr. Trump said in a message posted on his own Truth social media network.",
      "Takaichi was chosen by her party members to lead, and as her party holds the most seats in Japan's parliament, she is set to become the prime minister. She was not elected personally by Japanese voters in a national election.",
      "A staunch supporter of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's conservative vision, Takaichi is on the verge of losing her party's long-time coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed dovish centrist Komeito, because of her ultra-conservative politics. Those include a revisionism of wartime history and regular visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, seen as a symbol of militarism.",
      "faces the dilemma of sticking to her ideology and losing the coalition partner or shifting to the center, which would lose her fans of her hawkish politics.",
      "The LDP and opposition parties are currently considering convening the parliament in mid-October to formally elect a new prime minister.",
      "Takaichi is likely to be Japan's leader because the LDP, even without a majority in either house of parliament following consecutive election losses, is still by far the largest in the lower house, which decides the national leader, and because opposition groups are highly splintered.",
      "She will need to address rising prices to restore support for the struggling party.",
      "She also faces another big test when she hosts a possible summit later this month with Mr. Trump as his trip to Asia to attend international conferences is planned.",
      "In her first press conference Saturday as LDP leader, Takaichi vowed to ensure strengthening of the Japan-U.S. alliance as essential to her country's diplomacy and security, while also seeking to expand trilateral partnerships including South Korea, Australia and the Philippines.",
      "Takaichi said she will honor the tariffs and investment agreements between the government of the current prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba and the Trump administration.",
      "One of Takaichi's most urgent tasks is to secure cooperation from the opposition. The LDP seeks to expand its current coalition with the moderate centrist Komeito to include at least one of the key opposition parties, which are center-right.",
      "But instead of finding a third partner, Takaichi is on the verge of losing Komeito, which is critical of her regular visits to the Yasukuni Shrine and her recent emphasis on stricter measures against the growing foreign population in Japan.",
      "In a rare move that shakes their 26-year-partnership, Komeito leader Tetsuo Saito told Takaichi on Saturday that his party has \"big worry and concern\" about her positions and would not stay in the coalition unless these positions are dropped.",
      "As new party president, Takaichi's first job is to decide a lineup of top LDP party posts, which she is expected to announce Tuesday.",
      "Takaichi has turned to the LDP's most powerful kingmaker and former prime minister Taro Aso, a conservative who backed her and reportedly influenced Saturday's party vote. She is expected to appoint him as deputy prime minister and name his brother-in-law and former Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki as party secretary general.",
      "Aso on Monday met with a senior official of the key opposition Democratic Party for the People about possible cooperation. Another opposition party, Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin no Kai, had been open to a coalition under Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who lost to Takaichi in Saturday's runoff vote, but that is now up in the air.",
      "Political watchers say Takaichi is considering appointing those who voted for her in the runoff as a reward. Among them is Toshimitsu Motegi, who is close to Aso and has served in key ministerial posts including as foreign and trade ministers. He is being considered for the position of top diplomat.",
      "Takaichi has also suggested appointing a number of former Abe faction lawmakers implicated in slush funds and other scandals to senior posts, despite public criticism over the party's lack of reform measures and subsequent election losses.",
      "Yoshihiko Noda, head of the largest opposition, centrist Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, criticized the idea, calling it \"totally unthinkable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",
      "\"Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\" said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",
      "The award is the first of the 2025 Nobel Prize announcements and was announced by a panel at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.",
      "Nobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics Oct. 13.",
      "The award ceremony will be held Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who founded the prizes. Nobel was a wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite. He died in 1896.",

      "The rare limestone relief vanished from a Fifth Dynasty tomb, dating to between 2500 and 2350 B.C., in the Saqqara Necropolis, south of Cairo, Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said in a statement posted online Sunday.",

      "France's government collapsed Monday after the country's Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu tendered his resignation less than a day after appointing his cabinet. The resignation of the country's second-highest-ranking public official plunged France further into a political crisis that has seen a rotating cast of five different prime ministers\u00a0in less than two years.",
      "France has been mired in political paralysis since President\u00a0Emmanuel Macron, who appoints the prime minister, called snap national elections last year that left no political party with an outright majority in the parliament, which is called the National Assembly.",
      "\"The political parties continue to adopt a posture as if they all had an absolute majority in the National Assembly. And basically, I found myself in a situation where I was ready to compromise, but each political party wants the other political party to adopt its entire program,\" Lecornu said in his resignation speech on Monday.",
      "The leader of France's far-right movement, Marine Le Pen, called on Monday for new snap parliamentary elections in the aftermath of the government's collapse. Le Pen's anti-immigration, nationalist National Rally (RN) party was previously relegated to the fringes of national politics, but it has captured a considerable number of seats in the fragmented parliament in recent years.",

      "Lecornu, a political ally of the increasingly embattled Macron, held the position of prime minister for just less than a month, but only announced a new cabinet to govern the country on Sunday. Lecornu's decision to step down makes him the shortest-serving prime minister in the history of the Fifth French Republic.",

But his bet did not pay off, and his centrist coalition lost a huge number of seats to both Le Pen's party and an alliance of far-left parties.",

      "Patterson was sentenced to life in prison in September by the Victorian Supreme Court for the murder of three people and the attempted murder a fourth, all of whom were lunch guests at her home in 2023.",
      "Patterson fed them beef Wellington pastry dishes laced with toxic mushrooms. Her motive remains a mystery.",
      "Prosecutors argued last month that she should never be eligible for parole. Her lawyers had asked for Patterson to serve 30 years before she could be considered for early release.",
      "Justice Christopher Beale set a non-parole period of 33 years, meaning she could potentially be set free in 2056 at the age of 82.",
      "\"Your victims were all your relatives by marriage. More than that, they had all been good to you and your children over many years, as you acknowledged in your testimony,\" Beale said when he delivered the original sentence. \"Not only did you cut short three lives and cause lasting damage to Ian Wilkinson's health, thereby devastating extended Patterson and Wilkinson families, you inflicted untold suffering on your own children, whom you robbed of their beloved grandparents.\"",
      "It was never disputed that Patterson served the mushrooms or that the pastries killed her guests. The jury was required to decide whether she knew the lunch contained death caps, and if she intended for them to die.",
      "Patterson's lawyer Richard Edney told Beale last week that she would lodge an appeal against her jury convictions within a month.",
      "Three Court of Appeal judges will hear both appeals on a date that is yet to be set.",
      "Patterson was convicted in July of murdering Don and Gail Patterson, the parents of her husband Simon Patterson. She also murdered Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson, and attempted to murder Ian Wilkinson, who spent weeks in a hospital, the court ruled.",
      "Simon Patterson was also invited to the lunch but declined.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 5, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Secretary of State and National Security Adviser, Marco Rubio. Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It would be extraordinary to end what has been one of Israel's longest and bloodiest wars. The prime minister said he's only allowing these talks that will be underway in Egypt to go for a few days. What exactly is the deadline for Hamas and the terror groups who are holding hostages? When do they need to release them?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, yeah, so a couple points. Hamas has- obviously, look, we're dealing with Hamas. Okay. So let's take that with- for what it is. But they have said that they agree with the President's framework for the release of the hostages. So what those talks should be about, and some of that conversation is already happening now, it's not waiting until Monday in Cairo, is the logistics behind the release of these hostages. How do you stop the fighting? Who's going to go in and get them? You know, when are they going to be released? Where are they picked up? What are the processes for this? That's what should be- that's what this conversation should be about at this point, because they've agreed to the framework of it. Then there's second- beyond that is what happens after that. And that is, how do we ensure that we can create and help build a Gaza free of terrorism, free of Hamas, free of anything like Hamas and that's going to take work and some time, not just to agree on but to implement. But that's important, because that's what's going to bring a permanent end to these hostilities in the long term. And so those are the two phases here. But right now, the most emergent and immediate phase is the one that Hamas claims to have agreed to already, and that is they are prepared to release the hostages. Let's discuss, through the mediators, the logistics and the mechanics behind how that happens. And that has to happen very quickly. That cannot drag on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So my sources have indicated to me that because the upper echelon of Hamas fighters has been so decimated, communication is difficult. The other terror groups who also hold hostages in Gaza aren't necessarily easily controlled by them. How do you manage around this reality and is full release by October 7 the demand?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, I don't know about the date. I'd be great if it was before October 7. We wish it would happen yesterday. But there are realities here, and then there are things people do to impede progress. Reality is, this is a war zone. I mean, this is a place that suffered a tremendous amount of destruction that fighting needs to stop. You can't release hostages while there's still bombardments going on, but at the same time that can't, you know- so that has to end, but that has to stop, but you also have to work through the other logistics. Who's going to go pick them up? We saw how this happened in the past. You know, the Red Cross would go in, they would be handed over through this process, et cetera. And so all of that's what has to be worked on, and is being worked on as we speak. So I'm not telling you there aren't some logistical hurdles here, but I am saying that the expectation is that this happens quickly. And I would also say that while we want all the hostages to be released, if there are five that are ready to go right now, they should be released right now. If another 10 are ready to go in 12 hours after that, the next group should come out, but ultimately they should all come out. And I think what you're hearing from people is, yes, there has to be some logistics that have to be worked through. But what you can't have, and what we can't see, and what we hope we will not see, is that we get into these talks, and these talks are then delayed, and it looks like they're unnecessarily delaying it. That would be a very bad sign. Let's hope that's not what happens. And it's going to be very important for our partners in the region who signed on to this deal, the UAE, Qatar, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, etc, for them to be putting a lot of pressure on Hamas to make sure this happens as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0But you pointed out that releases can't happen when bombardments are underway. Our CBS team in Gaza tells us that there are Israeli bombardments underway. There were strikes Saturday. Tens killed, more injured, bombings continuing. One incident included 10 people killed when they tried to check in on their homes in areas where there are also military sites. Is that acceptable?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, I think, ultimately, what you're going to see here is that when an agreement is reached on these logistics behind when the release is going to happen, then I think you'll see those bombardments stop, and I think some of that activity has already decreased somewhat. So, there's a framework here, and the framework is simple. Once you agree on the logistics of how this is going to happen, I think the Israelis and everyone acknowledge you can't release hostages in the middle of strikes, so the strikes will have to stop. And, as you saw, the president state that very clearly on Friday, where he asked the Israelis to begin to pull back to create the conditions for these releases--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is not a violation of that?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, we're trying to get the hostages out. That's the bottom line. We want to get the hostages out as soon as possible. For that to happen, there can't be a war going on in the middle of it, and Hamas has to agree to turn them over. We have to have the right people go in and get them. That's what we're going to focus on right now, and that's what we're going to- that's what we've been focused on, and that's what the talks are going to be about today, on Monday, on Tuesday, to get this done as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you, there are two phases here. The Hamas releasing the hostages is the one you're most focused on. But, big picture, does the United States assess that Israel has so reduced the threat posed by Hamas that it can end combat and transition to the kind of lower-tempo counter-terrorism campaign that, say, the United States carries out against terrorist threats to this country?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, look, I mean, the ideal outcome here is you don't have to carry out any counter-terror missions because there are no terrorists in Gaza--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But can they take the win? Can Netanyahu say he won this war?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: \u00a0Well, first of all, creating a Gaza, or setting up a Gaza that is governed by Palestinian technocrats that are not terrorists and are not sponsoring terrorism, that's not going to happen in 72 hours. That's going to take some time to build up, and it's going to require a lot of work and a lot of international support, and that's the end goal here of this entire endeavor, after you get the hostages out. By the way, if you can't get the hostages out, you have no hope of getting that done. So that's why I say, you know that these two steps need to happen. But it's going to take a lot of hard work and time. You know, you're trying to build something that doesn't exist right now, which is a sort of civilian, Palestinian leadership that's not tied to terrorism. That doesn't exist right now. It's going to take a lot of help from international partners. That's why having the countries in the region and the Europeans and all others involved in this in both money and resources, that's why building that coalition is so critical, and then implementing it is not going to be easy. It's going to take some time here, but I think, certainly, for the first time in a long time, you see the framework and the outlines of something that could work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But combat operations can end?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, that's the goal here. Well, you wouldn't need combat operations if there weren't terrorists there. But, by the same token, I would remind everybody, if, in fact, at the end of all this terrorism and a terrorist group remains active inside of Gaza, you're not going to have peace. That's the fundamental truth here that everyone needs to accept. You're never going to have peace in Gaza as long as there are terrorists operating from that territory, threatening the security of Israel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of occupation and combat operations, that's different than a counterterrorism campaign. But, let me ask you specifically what President Trump said. He told Barak Ravid of Axios that Prime Minister Netanyahu, quote, \"took it very far and Israel lost a lot of support in the world. Now I'm going to get all that support back.\" At what point did President Trump decide that Netanyahu took this fight in Gaza, or his operations throughout the Middle East- When did he take it too far?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: I think the President's- the president's observation, basically, is that because of the length of this war and how it's gone- we've all seen the international narrative. We've all seen it, whether we agree with it or not. We have seen countries like the U.K., Australia, Canada and others come out and sort of signal support, or announce support for a Palestinian state. We have seen, even in our own domestic politics, some of the attacks on Israel. We don't forget what happened on October 7. That's the other thing the President repeatedly points to is, remember October 7. But the impli- whether we agree with it or not, we have seen the impact that this has had on Israel's global standing. And I think that's the point the President is making here, is that whether you believe it was justified or not, right or not, that we- you cannot ignore the impact that this has had on Israel's global standing. That said, if we never want to see this happen again, meaning a war like this, you can never have another October 7 or anything like it ever happen again. And that's the thing the President has reiterated and repeatedly made clear to our partners in the region, and that is, if you truly want peace and stability and a better future for the Palestinian people, then there has to be a Gaza that is not governed or controlled in any way, shape or form by Hamas, or anything that looks like Hamas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Does the United States support a Palestinian state? Because point 19 in your White House plan talks about \"a credible pathway to Palestinian self determination and statehood.\"",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, again, we've always said, I mean, this has been a consistent position throughout, that the only way you're ever going to have anything that looks like statehood is in a negotiated deal with the Israelis. We are so far from that right now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0Right, but Prime Minister Netanyahu opposes a Palestinian state and thanked President Trump for speaking against recognition of one. That's why I'm asking you to clarify.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, we haven't recognized the Palestinian state--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --the United States has not. And right now, there's no point in doing that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the US want to see one?",
      "[CROSSTALK ENDS]",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --because it's not even possible. That's not even a realistic thing right now. Because who, who would govern that Palestinian state, Hamas?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's point 19 in your plan--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --Who would govern it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I thought.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, but that's talking about a pathway long term and in the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: But one of the- before you can even get there, okay, that's, you know, before you can even get there, you have to have someone to turn that land- Israel's made clear they have no interest in governing Gaza. They have no interest in occupying Gaza long term and being the government of Gaza. I think Israel, I can't speak for Israel, but I think Israel would tell you they would love to turn over Gaza to a Palestinian organization that isn't terrorists. They would love to do that. But that doesn't exist right now. That has to be built, and that's going to take time. You're not going to build that in 72 hours. You're not going to build that in 72 weeks. I mean, it's going to take some time to get to that point. So that's the pathway this discusses. And I think if you look forward into the future where there is suddenly a Palestinian government-like organization, that can govern territory, then there's a lot of possibilities. But that has to be negotiated and agreed to by Israel. In the end, it's very simple. There can be peace in Gaza, there can be Palestinian governance in Gaza, whether you call it statehood or something else, as long as it is not terrorists that are in charge of that territory. That's what Israel agreed to when they turned over Gaza in the first place, and then Hamas took over Gaza and turned it into a terrorist camp, and that's what's led us to the point that we are at today. So we can get off that road and onto a different road. There are a lot of possibilities long term and in the future, but right now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So maybe?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --we are far from that. Right now, we need to get these hostages out, and we just need technocrats that are not terrorists to be able to begin the basic reconstruction of Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That interview was taped earlier today, with the camera off, Secretary Rubio clarified that President Trump still opposes Israeli annexation of the West Bank though there is no mention of the Occupied Territory in the 20 point White House peace plan."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Chuck Schumer that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 5, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. Senator Chuck Schumer is the top Democrat on the other side of the Capitol and he joins us now from New York City. Good morning to you, leader. I want to pick up on something the Speaker of the House was pointing to. He wants this fight to be about illegals, as he said. And I want to be specific here, because we know from our research that there is no federal money that goes towards health care tax credits for undocumented immigrants in this country. The federal government doesn't fund health insurance for the undocumented. But it is also true that states like yours, New York, does provide health care for people who are in this country illegally. And their argument seems to be the money here is fungible, and bottom line is, it comes out of the federal pocket. Do you want to respond to that?",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: You know, they don't want to, Johnson doesn't want to discuss the real issue, the health care crisis facing the American people. So he puts up all these fake lies to try and divert attention. It's his standard operation. He just is concerned with the politics. Every independent agency that looks at this says Johnson's claim is false. And just as you said, Margaret, no, zero federal dollars can go to undocumented immigrants through Medicare, through Medicaid, through ACA. And so we ought to be talking about the real issue here, which is that we have a health care crisis in America caused by the Republicans. They've caught, they barreled us towards a shutdown because they don't want to deal with that crisis. Plain and simple.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's talk about the shutdown in a moment. In terms of health care, where you've taken us, in terms of the messaging, Democrats, as I understand it, are looking for an extension of those Obamacare tax credit. I believe you'd like them permanently. You heard the speaker say we can talk about that after the government is reopened, perhaps not permanently. But do you hear any kind of opening here for a negotiation whatsoever?",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: Well, right now, not. Look, Johnson's not serious about this. He sent his, all his congressmen home last week and home this week. How are you going to negotiate? --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well he says the job is in the Senate. With you and leader Thune --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- And he's, well, no you need, no, you actually need Johnson if you're going to negotiate any agreement. You need Johnson, Thune, Trump, Schumer and Jeffries. And the reason he sent them home is because he's more interested in protecting the Epstein files than protecting the American people from the health care crisis. We've been trying for months and months to sit down with them and have a serious conversation addressing America's health care needs. And they've refused and refused and refused. And just on your show and on other shows, when they asked him, well, will you do it in January. He says, it's starting in January. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- He says, no, we'll have a conversation. Well, you know what, later means never. And we've tried 45 days and 45 days and 45 days from March on. We asked them to vote on it three times. The Republicans in the Senate, they voted no three times. So we need to solve this crisis. Look --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- That was a permanent extension. The bill that I think you're referring to is Senator Shaheen. It was a permanent extension. It wasn't the, you know --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- He, Johnson has not committed --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Compromise that some Republicans have proposed. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- Yeah. Margaret, Johnson has not committed to any extension and he won't until the American people force him to. And it doesn't, and by the way, the crisis doesn't start in January. Two days ago, starting October 1, millions of Americans are getting notices that their health care premiums are dramatically increasing. If you're a 55 year old couple, and you pay, make $80,000, you know how much your premiums will go up if we don't extend it? It will go up something like $25,000. The average American will pay $900 more. How do Americans who are struggling, sitting at the table Friday night figuring out how to pay the bills, how the heck can they get such an increase? Democrats are simple. We want to extend it and so they won't have to pay that increase.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- And Johnson does not want to do it. He's just not serious about it, as exemplified by him sending the House home for two weeks. You need to be here to negotiate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, you're using word extend versus making permanent, just making clear there. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- Look. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And then the number we see is the average increase of about $1,000 in premium payments for most households that will go into effect.",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- Right, right. Yeah and it's horrible. And, it's horrible. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- On the reopening everything conversation, sir, though. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- Yes. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --\u00a0 I mean, do you trust leader Thune? And when you look at just your numbers here, three senators already crossed over to vote with Republicans on the short-term funding deal. Are you concerned about more defections?",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: Look, it's a Republican shutdown because they've refused to talk with us. Johnson, I saw him mentioned that we did it 13 times when I was majority leader. That's true. You know why? In every case, we sat down and talked with the Republicans and there was a give and take, and then both sides didn't get everything they wanted, but we got it done. They have refused to talk to us even once. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well, Thune, Thune told Fox that there were ongoing, ongoing conversations. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- And Jeffries and I have been trying to get them to talk to us, for, they tried to get us to talk to them for, we've tried to talk to them for months and months and months. And they said no. The American people know that they're in charge. Republican President, Republican Senate, Republican House. That they have a responsibility to govern, which means sit down and talk with us so we can address these needs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But back to the question of defections. Leader Thune was on another network, on Fox, and he said that there are conversations with Democrats who want to find an off ramp here. Is he having conversations with Democrats other than you? Are you sure you can't, will you have defections?",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: Yeah. Margaret. I've encouraged my Democratic members to sit and talk to Republicans. It's always good when Democrats and Republicans talk to each other, but two points. First, in those conversations, the Republicans offered nothing. And, but second, the only way this will ultimately be solved is if five people sit together in a room and solve it. And they are the president, who also doesn't seem serious about this. You know he's putting out his memes and his things with the grim reaper and all of that stuff. He's playing golf. Johnson's not serious, and so we've got to sit down, the five of us. That's the way to solve this problem. But when Democrats talk to Republicans, it's a good thing. And I've encouraged my Democrats to do it, but they've offered us nothing. No change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you tried calling President Trump? He seems to take phone calls. Directly. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- Well you know, we sat, we tried to get President Trump to sit down with us weeks ago, long before the shutdown day started. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So no. Okay. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- He said, he said yes. He said, no. Johnson told him to say no. We sat down, you know, the day before, and he wasn't serious. He put these red hats on the table, and he's joking around. And honestly, in the meeting, Margaret, I got the feeling he didn't even know what was happening. That the crisis was impending. That people would pay such a --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- He once said they're going to pay all that. That would be bad for me. And so the court here is the American people. The American people are hearing what's happening, and they are demanding that we address this crisis. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- They are demanding we sit down together and do it. It's just logical. They are, say that, you know, in your survey that you put out --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: --\u00a0 They say that 75% people feel Trump isn't doing enough. Another survey by the Washington Post showed that not only do 80% of the American people want us to extend these credits, but 55% of Trump voters --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well our, our --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: --\u00a0 The American people are right now talking to their senators, you know, talking to their congressmen. They're telling them, get this done. We want to get it done. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Our CBS polling also shows that neither side is getting good grades on any of this. Leader, we're going to have to leave that here for this moment. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the government shutdown now in its fifth day. House. Speaker Mike Johnson joins us from Capitol Hill. Good morning to you, Speaker. Anyone up there to negotiate with?",
      "SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON: There's not, Margaret. Good morning. Good to hear your voice. It's kind of quiet around here. It has been for the last several days, and it's very unfortunate, because, as we're talking real people are being adversely affected around the country in some and in very substantial ways. I pray that more Democrats in the Senate will come to their senses and do the right thing, and when they have the next opportunity on Monday to vote to open the government, I surely hope that they will.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you did send your lawmakers home to their districts, which suggests we've got probably another week ahead of us of this shutdown. You mentioned the real world impact federal workers, including our military, would miss their first paychecks October 15th or 16th. How long should workers plan to be without that income?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, the only person who can answer that question is your next guest and that's Chuck Schumer, because the House did its job. The reason that House Republicans are home working in their districts, and I suspect House Democrats should be as well, is because we did that. We passed a bipartisan, very clean continuing resolution a couple of weeks back now, and sent it to the Senate. It's very important to note what was in that. It was only 24 pages in length, Margaret. It was a good faith effort to keep the government open for seven more weeks so that Republicans and Democrats, in a bipartisan fashion, could work together to fund the government with the appropriations process. Chuck Schumer always voted for those in the past. In fact, he did it 13 times during the four years of the Biden administration, but now suddenly he's commanding his Democrats in the Senate not to do it, and there's one simple reason why. They need political cover from the far left corner of the base. He's afraid, Chuck Schumer, individually- ask him about it. He's afraid he's going to get a challenge from the Marxist left in his party, because that's the new wave in New York. That's what this is about. Chuck Schumer is trying to show a fight against the President and Republicans and real Americans are being harmed in the process of this political game.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Well, Democrats, as you know, want to have another conversation in regard to extending some tax subsidies that lower the cost of some health care that's purchased through the Obamacare market. To that point, though, you're talking about the politics of this, our CBS polling that we released today shows neither party's stance is viewed as worth shutting down this government. The Democrats want to talk about the tax credits. You know, premium pricing is already being set now, even if this doesn't expire until end of the year. Your fellow Republican, Jen Kiggans said, \"raising costs for families with little notice and potentially stripping them of access to care is simply unacceptable.\" Doesn't she have a point here?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: There's a lot of points to be made on that, and we're ready to talk about, negotiate and do all of that, but they're trying to create that as a red herring here right now. Margaret, this is a funding bootstrap measure, a very simple, very conventional thing that's been done here all the time. This is the way it works now. We need a little more time on the clock to finish the appropriations process. We have plenty of time to debate that very complicated issue. It's not a simple one. There has to be reforms to that subsidy, because there's a lot of fraud, waste and abuse involved in it. There's a- there's 535 members of Congress in the House and Senate. There's a- there's probably 400 different ideas on how to fix that, so we need a little time to do it. We're not saying that we won't negotiate it. We're saying turn the lights back on in Congress. Get troops paid TSA agents and border patrol agents paid who are trying to protect us. Restore the health care programs that are being stalled for veterans and Medicare recipients who are getting home health, it's all stalled now, restore FEMA flood insurance programs in the middle of hurricane--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. Turn the lights back on.--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: -- and WIC programs for young women. We got to get this fixed now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to clarify what you were just saying, do I hear you correctly? That you, as Speaker of the House, want to see the tax credit extended at a future date? Is that what you are saying?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: No, I haven't staked out any position on it yet, because that's not how this process works. We're in a deliberative body--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Right, I'm asking your position because you said--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON:-- I'm the speaker of the House--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- you'd be willing to talk about it--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON:-- I'm telling you my position- I'm the Speaker of the House. What I have to do is draw consensus among 435 members of my body. I don't get out and project what the final conclusion is going to be. And I've told Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, most recently in the Oval Office with the President just five, six days ago, keep the government open so that we can do that job. We were always planning to do that. Again, that funding runs out December 31. The month of October is a critical time for us to get to this. But we can't when Chuck Schumer keeps voting to shut the government down for political reasons. That's purely and simply what's happening here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe you have time here, but our partner at health policy think tank KFF reported 80% of all premium tax credits went to ObamaCare enrollees in Trump won states. Red states. Do you really- do worry at all that this stance could backfire, that waiting to talk about the tax credit could hurt you and could hurt your voters?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: No- no. No, because we have time to do it again. The funding doesn't run out until December 31st. We're talking about a September 30th deadline that's now passed to keep the government open so that Republicans and Democrats can have that very debate. Chuck Schumer has shut it off because he needs a political argument right now. 100% Margaret, that's what this is about. Play the tape. Play the tape of Chuck Schumer saying consistently for the last 30 years that CRs are dangerous, destructive, and selfish. He is now the captain of it, and it's on him. Republicans in the House, Senate, and the White House want to keep the government open, and we have voted to do so. Democrats are shutting it down--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are committing to have that conversation about health care is what I understand you saying?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: It was- it was always going to continue. They're making this up. That is a red herring. They're trying to- they're trying to say that this fight right now is about that. That wasn't even a fight. It's a joke. Call him on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the director of the Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, was on another network this morning, and said it is up to the President of the United States to decide when the mass layoffs will begin. He seems to be indicating the President is using those RIFs, those reduction-in-force threats, as leverage here. Do you know how quickly those layoffs will start?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: I don't know. I anticipate it will have to be soon, because Chuck Schumer turned off the funding sources and whomever is the chair of the office--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Do you want that as leverage?--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: -- No, nor- neither does the President. No. The President wants the government open. He's pleaded with Schumer and Hakeem in person in his office to do that, and they said no, because they want to do this. You know what they counter-proposed? They want to spend $1.5 trillion, and they want to return hard-working taxpayer dollars to fund health care for illegal aliens. It is in their bill. Go to\u00a0speaker.gov\u00a0and see it for yourself. Page 57, Section 2141. They're using this for political games, and it is shameful, and real people are getting hurt.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that- I have looked at that text, it doesn't explicitly say what you are indicating--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON:-- Well, wait a minute--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But unauthorized immigrants are intelligible for ACA benefits--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: -- This is very important. Yes it does. It's- it says very simply, they want to repeal the changes that we made in the- in the Working Families Tax Cut, the One Big Beautiful Bill.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's right--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: -- And what those changes were is it removed health care going to illegal aliens. It removed all the fraud, waste and abuse. And the Congressional Budget Office, CBO said it achieved the desired result. They project it will save almost $200 billion. Chuck Schumer's proposal on page 57 wants to return that $200 billion of taxpayer funds to pay for illegal aliens and other non-citizens. That is a fact, and you can check it out on my website\u00a0speaker.gov. Don't trust me. Look at Chuck Schumer's own paperwork.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, thank you for your time. This morning, we'll be right back with a lot more 'Face the Nation'. Stay with us."

      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL (RETIRED) BEN HODGES: Thank you very much, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up- pick up where we left off with Senator Duckworth, who is a Purple Heart recipient for her time serving this country in combat. Men and women have different basic fitness standards. The Secretary, in his remarks at Quantico, said women- or he suggested women were being given a pass or were held to lower standards for fitness requirements. Do you think his change to the quote unquote male standard is necessary?",
      "LT. GEN. (RET.) HODGES: I think this is completely unnecessary. I have 38 years in the Army, and we've served with women in all sorts of different environments and deployments, and I never had a case where a female soldier was not able to do what she had to do. So this is a- seems to me an unnecessary, almost a medieval approach, that doesn't reflect the requirements that we have for women and men who are intelligent, able to operate in a modern battlefield environment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Defense Secretary made these remarks at Quantico last week, as you well know, ordered in our most senior military officers to hear him lay out what he talked about in terms of changing rules of engagement, those codes of conduct and standards to make war less brutal. The Secretary said this.",
      "[SOT]",
      "SECRETARY PETE HEGESTH: We also don't fight with stupid rules of engagement. We untie the hands of our war fighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt and kill the enemies of our country. No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement. Just common sense, maximum lethality and authority for war fighters.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you make of those directives to officers?",
      "LT. GEN. (RET.) HODGES: Well, that's- that's not going to help anybody accomplish their mission. I mean, when you think about the missions that we had in Afghanistan, for example, and I think that's where some of his experience comes from. It was to protect Afghan civilians so that they could reestablish government and secure themselves, and so it was not about how many Taliban could you kill. We had already tried that, and that didn't work. So the rules of engagement are not 'politically correct.' They're not intended to make it harder for soldiers or units to do their job. They actually are part of the mission. Why are we there? And so I don't have any experience where killing a lot of innocent people or violating the Geneva Convention is going to help accomplish the mission. I think that the idea that we should- that somehow is going to make us better and more effective by people not having to worry about the law is going to be bad for us in the long term as well, both psychologically for soldiers, but also the trust of the American people and of our allies and American forces, where we have always lived up to international law, and that is where a lot of the respect came from. We do not want to be like the Russian army, and they certainly don't worry about rules of engagement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Geneva Conventions are something that the Secretary, as a private citizen, wrote about in his book and questioned whether they should be followed at all. He said, 'What if we treated the enemy the way they treated us?' And if I mean, he talked about Al Qaeda and using some of their tactics, it- rip their arms off, feed them to the hogs. I mean, this sounds tough, but in terms of practice, does it risk the lives of- of those who are the trigger pullers, those who are on the ground, to have this message delivered from the highest levels?",
      "LT. GEN. (RET.) HODGES: Well, first of all, the Geneva Conventions were constructed starting in 1949 after the Second World War, and they were intended to protect innocent people, helpless people, non-combatants, from the ravages of war, as it did happen in the Second World War. And I don't think anybody would say that Dwight Eisenhower was woke and here he was- he was Chief of Staff of the Army, and then Supreme Allied Commander, and then President. So this was during his time that the United States helped create and sign the Geneva Conventions. So here's a guy with more combat experience and wartime experience than almost anybody. Now, the- when you think about modern warfare, especially when you're counter terrorism, just as Secretary Rubio was describing earlier on your program, the people, how you deal with enemy and how you deal with populations, is how you defeat an insurgency. And killing everybody in sight is not how you defeat an insurgency.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As Defense Secretary Hegseth fired the top military lawyers who advise on lethality, here's some of the advice he gave to senior leaders this week.",
      "[SOT]",
      "SECRETARY PETE HEGESTH: You kill people and break things for a living in this profession, you feel comfortable inside the violence so that our citizens can live peacefully. Lethality is our calling card and victory our only acceptable end state.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think that means?",
      "BEN HODGES: Well, first of all, it's not connected to the reality of how these things happen, how wars are won. First of all, the political leadership has to describe the end state. What is what is it we're going to do? Why are we sending troops somewhere? What are they supposed to accomplish? And usually it's not going to be by killing everybody in sight. So I can't- I think there's a disconnect between this idea that it's all about lethality and that we kill people and break things. That's- that's not the mantra of any army unit I was ever in in 38 years. It was always about accomplish the mission that was assigned to us, carry out every lawful order, and do it in such a way that protects civilians and ensures that all of our soldiers are protected and come back home safe. This idea of break things and kill people, that's what the Russians did in Bucha and Mariupol. That's not who we are. We're the soldiers of a free, democratic country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President also spoke at that gathering. He referred to the 'enemy within'. He also spoke about using U.S. cities like Chicago as training grounds. Are you comfortable with people thinking that?",
      "LT. GEN. (RET.) HODGES: Well, look, I think first of all, U.S. military- our fellow citizens should be confident that U.S. military will always carry out lawful orders. And so it's alarming when all of the judge advocates general or the army- or the military lawyers are sacked or sent away because Commanders do need to have legal counsel as they receive orders and they look at these complex situations, but our troops will carry out lawful orders. I guarantee you that no soldier wants to have to use force against American people.",

      "The agency said online that the 137 activists were from countries including the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy. Four Italian activists were deported on Friday. The foreign ministry said that Israel \"seeks to expedite the deportation\" of those detained from the flotilla.",
      "The Global Sumud Flotilla set sail from Spain last month, with politicians and activists, including Greta Thunberg, aboard. Nearly 50 vessels and 500 activists took part, CBS News previously reported. It was the largest attempt yet to break Israel's 18-year-long maritime blockade of Gaza, and aimed to bring food to Palestinians in the territory. Multiple drone attacks approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu targeted the flotilla as it sailed toward the territory, CBS News previously\u00a0reported.",

      "Israel's government has also accused some of the flotilla members of being linked to Hamas, while providing little evidence to support the claim. Members of the flotilla have strongly rejected the accusations and said Israel was trying to justify potential attacks on them.",
      "Supporters of the flotilla took to the streets in major demonstrations around the world starting Thursday, according to the Associated Press.

A U.S. official told CBS News that the United States views Hamas' response as positive, though there are still details that need to be hammered out. Netanyahu agreed to the deal on Monday. After Hamas released its statement, Mr. Trump said on\u00a0Truth Social\u00a0that he believes the group is \"ready for a lasting PEACE\" and pushed Israel to \"immediately stop the bombing of Gaza.\"",

More than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",

It was discovered in 1799 by two people, and its contents were looted, including the sarcophagus, Egyptian antiquities authorities said.",
      "It has been under a Japanese-led, three-phased restoration project for the past two decades, including renovating paintings of the pharaoh and his wife on the tomb walls, said Mohamed Ismail, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.",
      "\"It's a very fascinating tomb,\" he told The Associated Press at the scene, adding that it includes a frame of the stolen sarcophagus box, with the lid in place where it would have been.",
      "The tomb starts with a 118-foot-long, 45-foot-deep, downward-sloping passageway beneath the Valley of the Kings. It includes a main burial chamber for the king, and two other chambers for his wives, Queens Tiye and Sitamun.",
      "Unlike other ancient tombs in the valley, the tomb is not fully decorated, Ismail said. Its paintings show Amenhotep III with a group of ancient Egyptian gods, and the burial chamber contains inscriptions of scenes from the Book of Dead, which is a collection of spells aimed at directing the dead through the underworld in ancient Egypt.",
      "The mummy of Amenhotep III was moved by ancient priests to the tomb of his grandfather, Amenhotep II, also in the Valley of the Kings, according to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization. The severely damaged mummy is showcased at the museum along with 16 other mummies of 17 kings and queens of ancient Egypt.",
      "Amenhotep III was one of the most prominent pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty of ancient Egypt, which ruled between 1550 B.C. and 1292 B.C. Known as Amenhotep the Great, he ascended the throne as a teenager and ruled for up to 38 years, according to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization.",
      "The tomb's reopening came less than a month before the official inauguration of the Grand Egyptian Museum near the Giza Pyramids. The museum is scheduled to open on Nov. 1.",
      "The reopenings are part of Egypt's efforts to attract more foreign visitors to revive the tourism sector, a major source of foreign currency. Tourism, which depends heavily on Egypt's rich pharaonic artifacts, suffered a long downturn after the political turmoil and violence that followed a 2011 uprising.",

The latter could be considered a bigger accomplishment during such uncertain times, but the mystery of Finland's happiness eludes many, including the Finns themselves.",
      "The World Happiness Report\u00a0is an annual report published by the University of Oxford in partnership with Gallup and the United Nations.",
      "\"People were going to the survey and trying to figure out, what is wrong with the survey,\" explained Frank Martela, a philosopher and professor.",
      "Martela, who this year published \"Stop Chasing Happiness: a pessimist's guide to a good life,\" believes the Finns were skeptical because of the way happiness is measured.",
      "\"I guess like one key reason is what they are actually measuring in this World Happiness Report,\" Martela said.",
      "The report ranks a nation's happiness based on one question: On a scale of zero to 10, how close is your life to the best possible life?",
      "\"Which is a different question than, you know, did you experience joy today, or did you smile or laugh today?\" Martela said.",
      "Meaningful happiness, in the case of the Finns, really comes down to contentment, which begs the question, why are Finns so content?",
      "\"The kind of society we have has been able to take care of the citizens relatively well,\" Martela explained.",
      "Oodi, Helsinki's Central Library, is an example. The library defines itself as a \"living meeting place\" offering traditional library services, video gaming spaces, digital studio spaces, 3D-printing services and more, all free and accessible to the public.",
      "\"The idea is to make sure everybody has opportunity to do this kind of thing no matter how much money you yourself have,\" Martela said.",
      "But the higher taxes that drive a socialistic society are worth it for the Finns.",
      "\"There's more of an idea of society here, I think, people accept that if you pay taxes, then you're getting something in return,\" explained Tim Bird, who immigrated to Finland from the U.K. more than 40 years ago.",
      "Bird was also enthralled with how close he was to the outdoors in Finland.",
      "\"This is one of the great things about Helsinki, you're never too far from the natural environment,\" he said.",
      "Another possible explanation for the country's happiness could be its citizens' relationship with temperature. Finland has more saunas per person than the U.S. has passenger cars.",
      "Carita Harju, co-author of \"The Power of Hot and Cold,\" explained that she uses the sauna every day for health benefits as much as the mental ones. After heating up, she takes a dip in the chilly Baltic Sea. The quick temperature changes release endorphins, but for Harju, it's about relaxation.",
      "Which brings back around what happiness really means for Finnish people, and why the country has dominated World Happiness charts for nearly a decade.",
      "\"I guess, like we have been given this unique life to live, and it would be like quite sad if you only followed external pressures on doing things that other people want,\" Martela said, \"like living somebody else's dream instead of our own dream.\"",

      "The drug is a peptide, which is a small protein that works like a roadblock remover. After a spinal cord injury, the body sends out signals that tell nerve fibers to stop growing. This drug blocks those signals, so the nerves have a better chance to regrow.",
      "\"This peptide can block those inhibitory signals,\" Ryan said. \"There is a little bit of evidence in animals that it can actually enhance the growth of neurons.\"",

      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Spinal cord injuries are typically approached with cell therapies, like stem cells and bone marrow stromal cells, Perez noted.",
      "This peptide approach, in contrast, is \"easy to administer,\" can be done at home, achieves a \"similar goal\" and is \"extremely safe,\" she added.",
      "Researchers observed \"electrophysiological changes\" in the group that received the experimental medication. (iStock)",
      "Perez said more research is necessary to determine how long the effects of this drug will last.",
      "\"We observed strong electrophysiological changes in the group that received the medication compared to the placebo group, but we don't have follow-up measurements,\" she said. \"There's no way for us to understand the real duration of these treatments.\"",
      "As there is not currently an FDA-approved treatment for spinal cord injuries, Perez said that those involved with this research are \"very devoted\" to advancing this science.",

      "\"By staying relatively quiet right now, President Trump is allowing Democrats to \u2018own\u2019 the shutdown,\" Tate said in a Wednesday email to Fox News Digital. \"The president realizes that if he says anything confrontational right now, the narrative will center around his remarks rather than the Democrats' refusal to support a reasonable spending bill.\"",

      "Mac malware often hides in the background, making it hard to spot at first. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Signs your Mac might be infected",
      "Spotting malware on macOS is not always straightforward. Many threats are designed to stay hidden, running quietly in the background while collecting data or opening a backdoor for attackers. Still, there are a few red flags that usually signal something is wrong.",
      "One of the first signs is slower performance or frequent overheating. If your Mac suddenly takes a long time to boot, runs hot during light tasks or lags when performing simple actions, it might be doing more behind the scenes than you realize. Apps that crash or freeze more often than usual are another warning sign. Occasional app failures are normal, but if built-in tools like Safari, Notes or Mail begin acting unstable, it may point to malicious interference.",
      "It is also worth paying attention to what is happening under the hood. Checking Activity Monitor for unknown processes or unusually high CPU or memory usage can reveal malware that tries to hide itself with random or unfamiliar names. Redirected web traffic is another classic symptom. If your browser takes you to strange websites, shows pop-ups, or installs new extensions you never approved, adware or spyware might already be present.",
      "Finally, unexplained changes to your security settings should always raise suspicion. If you notice your firewall turned off, privacy permissions modified, or login items appearing without your knowledge, something could have gained unauthorized control of your system.",
      "SHAMOS MALWARE TRICKS MAC USERS WITH FAKE FIXES",
      "Strange app behavior, pop-ups or overheating may signal something\u2019s wrong. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How macOS protects you by default",
      "Apple has built several layers of defense into macOS, many of which run silently in the background to keep your system secure. Knowing how they work can help you understand what protections are already in place and where you might still need to add more safeguards.",
      "Gatekeeper is one of the most important built-in security tools. It checks every app before it runs to make sure it comes from a verified developer, warning or blocking you if the app is not trusted. Another layer of defense is XProtect, Apple's built-in malware scanner. It updates automatically and can stop many known threats from running, although it is not as thorough as specialized antivirus software.",
      "System Integrity Protection, or SIP, is another important safeguard. It locks down critical system files and processes so that malware cannot tamper with them even if it gains access. macOS also uses sandboxing and strict permission controls to contain threats. Apps run in isolated environments and must explicitly request permission to access sensitive data such as your camera, files, or location.",
      "Together, these features make it significantly harder for malicious software to infect your Mac or cause serious damage. However, they are not perfect. Attackers are constantly developing new techniques to bypass these protections, and many threats rely on human error rather than technical exploits. That is why taking additional precautions is still essential, even on a Mac.",
      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Even Apple\u2019s built-in protections can miss new or advanced threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What to do if your Mac is already infected",
      "If you find yourself dealing with a Mac that's already compromised, these steps can help you get back in control:",
      "Unplug Ethernet or turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. This prevents malware from sending more data out or pulling in additional malicious code.",
      "Use an external drive or cloud service you trust. Avoid copying entire system folders \u2013 just grab personal documents, photos and files you can't replace. You don't want to back up the malware along with them.",
      "Restart your Mac and hold the Shift key. Safe Mode prevents some malware from launching and makes it easier to run cleanup tools.",
      "While macOS includes XProtect, you may need something more powerful. A strong antivirus program can detect and remove infections. Run a full system scan to catch hidden threats.",
      "5 PHONE SETTINGS TO CHANGE RIGHT NOW FOR A SAFER SMARTPHONE",
      "Review what apps are set to launch at startup and remove anything you don't recognize. If you spot unfamiliar processes hogging resources, don't just guess. Use our guides at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/LockUpYourTech to compare what's safe and learn how to shut down anything suspicious before it causes more trouble.",
      "If malware persists, wiping your system may be the only option. Erase your Mac's drive and reinstall macOS from scratch. Restore only the clean files you backed up earlier.",
      "If your iPhone, iPad or other personal devices are showing strange behavior, run security scans, update their software and reset key passwords. Malware can sometimes spread through shared Wi-Fi networks, cloud accounts or files.",
      "Even after cleanup, assume some of your data may have been exposed. Update your Apple ID, email, banking and work accounts with strong, unique passwords. Turn on\u00a02FA\u00a0wherever possible.",
      "If you're overwhelmed, you can bring your Mac to an Apple Store for in-person help at the Genius Bar, or schedule a free appointment with Apple Support.",
      "Simple steps like scanning, updating and using strong passwords can keep your data safe. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 ways to keep your Mac from getting infected",
      "Some cyber threats do not reveal themselves immediately. Scammers often collect small bits of data over time or wait weeks before trying to use what they have stolen. These steps can help you strengthen your defenses and reduce the chances of future infections.",
      "macOS's built-in protections are useful but basic. A strong antivirus adds an extra layer by detecting threats in real time, blocking malicious downloads and even identifying new types of malware before they spread. A strong antivirus also scans email attachments and browser activity, areas where many Mac users are most vulnerable.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Many cyberattacks begin with information freely available online. A data removal service scrubs your personal details from broker sites, reducing the chances of targeted attacks or identity theft. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "GOOGLE FIXES ANOTHER CHROME SECURITY FLAW BEING ACTIVELY EXPLOITED",
      "Many malware attacks rely on stolen credentials rather than technical exploits. A password manager stores unique, complex passwords for every account and can automatically flag weak or reused ones. It also helps protect you from phishing attempts because it will only autofill passwords on legitimate websites.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Even if someone steals your password,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) makes it much harder for them to access your accounts. It adds an extra step to the login process, requiring a code from your phone or a security key.",
      "Outdated software is a common entry point for malware. Updates often patch vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit, so turning on automatic updates for both macOS and third-party apps is an easy but effective defense.",
      "Malware often tries to run at startup so it can operate undetected. Regularly check System Settings to make sure only trusted apps are launching automatically, and use Activity Monitor to investigate anything suspicious.",
      "If your personal data has already been exposed, an identity theft protection service can monitor for suspicious activity, alert you to breaches and help you recover quickly if something does go wrong. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Macs have a reputation for being safer than other computers, but that does not mean they are untouchable. Malware has evolved to target macOS more aggressively than ever and many attacks now rely on tricking users rather than breaking through security software. If your device is behaving strangely, taking action early is the best way to prevent deeper damage.",

      "According to Business Insider, these rules are now in use by contractors testing Meta's chatbot.

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., demanded that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hand over a 200-page rule book on chatbot behavior, along with internal enforcement manuals. Meta missed the first deadline but recently began providing documents, citing a technical issue. This comes as regulators worldwide debate how to ensure the safety of AI systems, particularly as they become integrated into everyday communication tools.",

The study found that only eight of 47 safety features tested were fully effective, and internal documents suggest that Meta was aware of some shortcomings. Critics also argued that certain protections, like manual comment-hiding, place the burden on teens themselves rather than preventing harm upfront. They questioned whether time management tools were robust enough, giving some features middling grades despite functioning as described.",
      "\"Misleading and dangerously speculative reports such as this one undermine the important conversation about teen safety,\" Meta told CyberGuy, \"This report repeatedly misrepresents our efforts to empower parents and protect teens, misstating how our safety tools work and how millions of parents and teens are using them today.",

By adding built-in protections, the company reduces risks for teens without requiring parents to manage every setting. At the same time, the School Partnership Program gives educators new tools to protect students in real time. The online safety curriculum goes one step further by teaching kids how to recognize threats and respond confidently. Still, advocacy groups and independent researchers question whether these efforts are enough, and Meta's strong defense shows just how high the stakes are in the teen safety debate. As teens spend more of their lives online, the responsibility to protect them grows. The real test will be how well these tools hold up against evolving online threats.",

      "How the FileFix attack works",
      "As reported by researchers at Acronis,\u00a0a leading cybersecurity and data protection company, the attack begins with a phishing page that looks like a message from Meta's support team, claiming that your account will be disabled in seven days unless you view an \"incident report.\" Instead of providing an actual document, the page disguises a malicious PowerShell command as a file path.",
      "Victims are instructed to copy it, open File Explorer, and paste it into the address bar. While it appears harmless, this action secretly runs code that starts the malware infection process.",
      "This method is part of a family of attacks known as ClickFix, where people are tricked into pasting commands into system dialogs. FileFix, created by Red Team researcher mr.d0x, builds on that idea by exploiting the File Explorer address bar instead. In this campaign, the attackers improved the trick by hiding the malicious command behind long strings of spaces, so only the fake file path is visible to the victim.",

      "It also targets messaging apps like Discord, Telegram and Pidgin, along with cryptocurrency wallets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Exodus. StealC goes further by attempting to compromise cloud accounts from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure, VPN services like ProtonVPN and even gaming accounts from Battle.net and Ubisoft. In addition, it can take screenshots of the victim's desktop, giving attackers a live view of sensitive activity.",
      "Acronis reported that the campaign has already appeared in several different versions over a short period, with changes in payloads and infrastructure. This suggests that the attackers are actively testing and refining their methods to avoid detection and improve success rates.",

      "5 ways you can protect yourself from FileFix attacks",
      "To stay protected against attacks like FileFix and prevent malware such as StealC from stealing sensitive information, you need to combine caution with practical security measures. The following steps can help safeguard accounts, devices, and personal data.",
      "Attackers rely on panic. Treat any message claiming your Meta account or other services will be disabled within days with caution. Verify the alert directly through official platforms rather than clicking links or following instructions from an email or web page.",
      "FileFix relies on convincing you to paste hidden PowerShell commands disguised as file paths. Never paste commands into system dialogs, File Explorer, or terminals unless you are absolutely certain of their origin.",
      "FileFix and StealC thrive on the information they can extract from a device or linked accounts. By using data removal services, you reduce the amount of sensitive personal information that can be found online or left exposed on old platforms. This minimizes what attackers can exploit if they manage to gain access.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A strong antivirus software can detect malware like StealC before it fully executes. Many solutions now include behavior-based detection that can flag suspicious scripts or hidden downloads, helping catch threats even when attackers try to disguise commands as harmless actions.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

This is the sixth zero-day Chrome has faced this year, highlighting just how quickly attackers move to take advantage of these hidden weaknesses.",

      "Chrome users are urged to update immediately to block active zero-day attacks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A critical flaw in Chrome's V8 engine",
      "The newly patched vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-10585, stems from a type confusion weakness in Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered and reported the bug on Tuesday, and the company shipped a fix the following day, Bleeping Computer reported.",
      "Google confirmed that the flaw was being exploited in the wild, though it did not share technical details or name the groups behind the attacks. TAG has a history of uncovering zero-days tied to government-sponsored spyware campaigns aimed at high-risk individuals such as opposition leaders, journalists and dissidents.",
      "The fix was delivered through Chrome version 140.0.7339.185/.186 for Windows and macOS, and version 140.0.7339.185 for Linux. These updates will gradually reach all users in the Stable Desktop channel over the coming weeks.",
      "While Chrome typically updates automatically, you can apply the patch immediately by navigating to the \u2018About Google Chrome\u2019 section.

      "Then in June, another flaw in the V8 engine, CVE-2025-5419, was patched after being spotted by TAG. July saw the release of a fix for CVE-2025-6558, which allowed attackers to bypass Chrome's sandbox protection.

      "Many zero-day attacks are delivered through malicious websites or email attachments. Avoid clicking unknown links or downloading files from unverified sources, especially if they prompt you to disable security settings. Also, use strong antivirus software to add another layer of defense to detect malicious code that tries to run through compromised browsers. A strong antivirus can spot suspicious activity before it takes hold. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Even if attackers manage to steal your login details through a browser exploit,\u00a02FA makes it much harder for them to break into your accounts. Use an authenticator app instead of SMS when possible for stronger protection.",
      "If attackers exploit the browser to steal login data, a password manager keeps your credentials safe and helps generate unique, complex passwords. Even if one account is targeted, it prevents a domino effect across your logins.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Some extensions can be abused to make attacks worse. Stick to extensions from trusted developers, review permissions carefully and uninstall anything you no longer need.",
      "Chrome updates are critical, but attackers can also exploit holes in Windows, macOS, Android or iOS. Regular OS updates patch vulnerabilities across the system, reducing the chances of a browser exploit spreading further.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The fact that Chrome has already faced six zero-day attacks this year shows how relentless attackers are and how even the most popular software can have serious gaps. These flaws are not just bugs, but opportunities for hackers to exploit millions of users before fixes roll out. The pattern also highlights the growing sophistication of threat actors, including state-backed groups targeting high-risk individuals. No browser is completely safe, and the battle to secure widely used software is ongoing and far from over.",

ChatGPT, the widely used artificial intelligence chatbot that can answer questions and hold conversations, has become a daily tool for millions. His comments mark a major shift in how the AI company may handle mental health crises.",

      "Until now, ChatGPT's response to suicidal thoughts has been to suggest hotlines. This new policy signals a move from passive suggestions to active intervention.",

      "Teens can easily access ChatGPT on a mobile device. (Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Tragedies that prompted action",
      "The shift follows lawsuits tied to teen suicides. The most high-profile case involves 16-year-old Adam Raine of California. His family alleges ChatGPT provided a \"step-by-step playbook\" for suicide, including instructions for tying a noose and even drafting a goodbye note.",

      "Despite these accounts, Day offered a very different picture in an opinion piece published by The Oregonian on Sunday, arguing that national media coverage of Portland and its police paint a misleading and outdated picture.",
      "Day said he is \"deeply proud\" of how Portlanders show up for one another continuously and equally proud of his police department.",
      "\"Unfortunately, national portrayals often distort reality. Portland is 145 square miles, yet one city block has drawn outsized attention in news cycles. Viral clips \u2014 sometimes months or years old \u2014 paint a picture that is not consistent with the Portland we see every day,\" Day wrote. \"While this is frustrating, we are focused on what matters: keeping Portlanders safe.\"",

      "\"It\u2019s important to note that the Federal Protective Service secures the building itself, while Portland Police manages the surrounding neighborhoods,\" he said. \"Recently, we have seen people with varying viewpoints come to the area with the intent to engage in violence and we are investigating several assaults; violence of any kind is unacceptable \u2013 we have and will continue to make arrests and pursue prosecutions. Free speech does not include freedom to commit crimes.\"",
      "\"There are also those who want to draw parallels about current events and 2020, when 100-plus nights of protests deeply impacted the city and Portland Police. But this isn\u2019t 2020 for many reasons,\" Day continued. \"Since I became chief two years ago, I have witnessed significant change. Reforms in use of force, crowd management and accountability have reshaped how we operate.",
      "\"As we have shown with the numerous massive protests that have occurred this year, large demonstrations can occur peacefully, and when disturbances arise, we take targeted action that can quickly restore order,\" he continued. \"Five years ago, some city and state leadership left the police bureau isolated. Today, that has changed.

      "\"One of the reasons given for this action has been that Portland Police are not responding to public disorder,\" Day wrote. \"Just because officers are not seen wearing tactical gear lining up before crowds does not mean we are not responding. In fact, research shows that such tactics often escalate crowd behavior.\"",

      "\"Our focus has shifted from \u2018crowd control\u2019 to \u2018crowd support,\u2019 with an emphasis on outreach, preparation and communication,\" Day said. \"We now use evidence-based policing and crowd psychology in managing large public gatherings.

      "Iran has used Shia militant forces from not only Syria, but Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon, to construct a \"parallel military infrastructure\" in coordination with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) that has transformed Syria into an \"Iranian forward operating base.\"",
      "According to an investigative report compiled by the Middle East Forum, using on-the-ground sources embedded in Iranian military installations across Syria since 2018, Iran has not only constructed underground tunnels and weapons depots for its disposal.

    "summary": "Illinois filed a lawsuit Monday in an attempt to block the Trump administration from deploying federalized National Guard troops on the streets of Chicago.",
    "story": [
      "Illinois filed a lawsuit Monday in an attempt to block the Trump administration from deploying federalized National Guard troops on the streets of Chicago.",
      "\u201cThe American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president\u2019s favor,\u201d the Illinois attorney general's office wrote in the filing, which names President Donald Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll as defendants.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s illegal actions already have subjected and are subjecting Illinois to serious and irreparable harm,\u201d the suit says.",
      "The White House maintained Trump's actions are lawful.",
      "\u201cAmidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like [Illinois Gov. JB] Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson.",
      "Representatives for the Justice Department, U.S. Army and Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to request for comment. The Pentagon declined to comment.",
      "The legal action comes after a federal judge in Oregon issued two separate orders over the weekend temporarily blocking the Trump administration from sending federalized National Guard members from California \u2014 or any other state \u2014 to Portland, Oregon. Portland and Chicago are part of a wave of Democrat-run cities and states that Trump has targeted with federal troops.",
      "\u201cThis country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs,\u201d U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, wrote in one of her rulings.",
      "The suit brought on behalf of Illinois and the city of Chicago makes similar arguments about federal overreach.",
      "\u201cThe Federalization Order\u2019s deployment of federalized military forces to protect federal personal and property from 'violent demonstrations' that 'are occurring or are likely to occur' represents the exact type of intrusion on State power that is at the heart of the Tenth Amendment,\" the suit says.",
      "\u201cThe deployment of federalized National Guard, including from another state, infringes on Illinois\u2019s sovereignty and right to self-governance. It will cause only more unrest, including harming social fabric and community relations and increasing the mistrust of police. It also creates economic harm, depressing business activities and tourism that not only hurt Illinoisians but also hurt Illinois\u2019s tax revenue,\u201d the suit says.",
      "The city and the state want a judge to declare the administration\u2019s federalization and deployment of the National Guard of the United States, any state National Guard, or deployment of the U.S. military in Illinois as \"unconstitutional and/or unlawful.\"",
      "Trump had been threatening to send the National Guard into Chicago for months, and gave the green light to do so over the weekend.",
      "\u201cAmidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like [Illinois Gov. JB] Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has authorized 300 national guardsmen to protect federal officers and assets,\u201d White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement.",
      "The suit denies there's any emergency in the city or that there's a need for federal troops.",
      "\"The supposed current emergency is belied by the fact that Trump\u2019s Chicago troop deployment threats began more than ten years ago,\" the suit says, pointing to a 2013 Trump tweet where he wrote, \"we need our troops on the streets of Chicago, not in Syria.\u201d",
      "He's since worked to \"demonize cities where Democrats had been elected as leaders,\" and provoked unrest in the state by surging federal law enforcement to target undocumented immigrants and protesters outside of an immigration detention facility in the suburb of Broadview, the suit says.",
      "\"Among other things, Trump and Noem have sent a surge of SWAT-tactic trained federal agents to Illinois to use unprecedented, brute force tactics for civil immigration enforcement; federal agents have repeatedly shot chemical munitions at groups that included media and legal observers outside the Broadview facility; and dozens of masked, armed federal agents have paraded through downtown Chicago in a show of force and control,\" the suit says.",
      "\"The community\u2019s horror at these tactics and their significant consequences have resulted in entirely foreseeable protests,\" it added.",
      "Pritzker, in an interview Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d said federal authorities \u201care the ones that are making it a war zone\" in Chicago.",
      "Trump has threatened to send the National Guard into other prominent Democratic-run cities against their wishes as well, including New York, Baltimore and New Orleans.",
      "The warning comes as the rate of serious crimes has dropped dramatically in those cities and in Chicago in recent years. Statistics from the Chicago Police Department show the murder rate through the end of September is down 29% compared to the  same time period last year. Overall crime is down 13%, according to CPD.",
      "Trump previously deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. In early September, a federal judge in California ruled that Trump\u2019s deployment of Marines and National Guard members there was illegal. D.C.'s Democratic attorney general has also sued to challenge the deployment of troops in the capital."

      "Earlier Sunday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he would sue the Trump administration after it deployed the federalized troops \u2014 National Guard members called into service by the president \u2014 to Oregon.",
      "\u201cThis is a breathtaking abuse of the law and power,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cThe Trump Administration is unapologetically attacking the rule of law itself and putting into action their dangerous words \u2014 ignoring court orders and treating judges, even those appointed by the President himself, as political opponents.\u201d",

No threat to national security. Oregon is our home, not a military target. Oregonians exercising their freedom of speech against unlawful actions by the Trump Administration should do so peacefully.\u201d",
      "Texas National Guard called into service",
      "Before the late-night ruling, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a memo Sunday that he is calling up to 400 members of the Texas National Guard into federal service in Chicago and Portland for up to 60 days with the potential for an extension.",
      "\u201cOn October 4, 2025, the President determined that violent incidents, as well as the credible threat of continued violence, are impeding the execution of the laws of the United States in Illinois, Oregon, and other locations throughout the United States,\u201d Hegseth wrote.",
      "The memo was included in a court filing by the Oregon attorney general\u2019s office in the Oregon National Guard case Sunday night.",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a news release Sunday that no federal officials had called him to coordinate the guard's deployment.",
      "\u201cWe must now start calling this what it is: Trump\u2019s Invasion,\" wrote Pritzker, a Democrat. \"It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state\u2019s military troops.\u201d",
      "Pritzker and Kotek called on Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to withdraw any support for that decision.",
      "Abbott, a Republican, said on X that he \"fully authorized the President to call up 400 members of the Texas National Guard to ensure safety for federal officials.\"",
      "\"You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,\" Abbott said. \"No Guard can match the training, skill, and expertise of the Texas National Guard.\"",

      "Kotek blasted the Texas news Sunday night, saying she had received no \"direct explanation\" from Trump or Hegseth about why the action was needed and refused to coordinate.",
      "\u201cThis is a continuation and escalation of the President\u2019s dangerous, un-American misuse of states\u2019 National Guard members and hard-earned taxpayer dollars,\" Kotek wrote.",

      "In an op-ed published Sunday in The Oregonian, Portland Police Chief Bob Day didn't denounce Trump's deployment of the National Guard outright, but he said \"national portrayals\" of Portland were overstating the problem there.",
      "\"There is no ignoring that we are facing an extraordinary time in our city\u2019s history, with the deployment of both federal law enforcement and the Oregon National Guard,\" Day wrote. \"One of the reasons given for this action has been that Portland Police are not responding to public disorder.\"",
      "\"Just because officers are not seen wearing tactical gear lining up before crowds does not mean we are not responding. In fact, research shows that such tactics often escalate crowd behavior. Instead, we use a layered approach when it comes to managing public order,\" he added.",

      "In addition to the lawsuit from Democratic leaders in Portland and Oregon, Pritzker blasted Trump's decision Saturday to deploy National Guard troops in Chicago, an idea Trump has floated for weeks.",
      "\u201cIt is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will,\u201d Pritzker said in a statement Saturday.",
      "In an interview Sunday on CNN's \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Pritzker said federal authorities \"are the ones that are making it a war zone. They need to get out of Chicago if they're not going to focus on the worst of the worst, which is what the president said they were going to do. They need to get the heck out.\"",
      "Democrats also blasted Trump's comments to senior military leaders last week that the military should \"use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military National Guard.\"",
      "Before the Trump administration's moves this weekend in Portland and Chicago, it had deployed National Guard troops to two other cities, Los Angeles and Washington.",
      "Trump has also threatened to deploy troops and federal law enforcement to other cities, including Baltimore and New Orleans.",

      "The pair's August engagement announcement followed closely behind Swift's reveal on Kelce's \"New Heights\" podcast that her 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" would be released on Oct. 3.",
      "As part of the album\u2019s promotion, Swift spoke with BBC Radio 2  in an interview that aired on Monday, during which Scott Mills asked her about the rumors.",
      "\"Taylor, don't tell me this is your last album,\" Mills asked.",

      "\"I love the person that I am with because he loves what I do and he loves how much I am fulfilled by making art and making music,\" Swift said.

      "\"We both, as a living, as a job, as a passion, perform for three-and-a-half hours in NFL stadiums ... to entertain people,\" Swift said. \"When I'm in those stadiums, it's a dressing room.

      "When Burtka decided to embrace sobriety nine years ago, the couple changed how they enjoyed drinks together through a simple work-around: Harris mixed up his favorite cocktails and Burtka did the same without liquor.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been together for over 20 years, and I think you have to have a sense of respect for each other in order to maintain a healthy relationship,\u201d Harris tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview.",
      "In theory, it was a good compromise, but Burtka ultimately realized that his non-alcohol options were largely non-existent, unlike the curated mocktails available today.",
      "\u201cSo, it\u2019s like your simple syrup and your grenadine and your pineapple juice and orange juice and there\u2019s your mocktail,\u201d Burtka explains. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel special. I felt like a kid.\u201d",
      "To remedy that, Burtka and Harris, a mixologist in his own right, began experimenting with various recipes, creating personalized versions of their favorite drinks. The result is \u201cBoth Sides of the Glass: Paired Cocktails and Mocktails to Toast Any Taste,\u201d a new book that features cocktail and mocktail recipes.",

      "Along with its premise of offering both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, the book is also unique in that it divides its drink recipes into four distinct categories: Water, fire, air and earth.",

      "\u201cSo much of enjoying a cocktail if filling out the mood \u2014 it\u2019s the companion to that rainy afternoon, or the perfect addition to that sexy date night \u2014 that we decided to organize it by elements.",

      "\u201cWe thought that\u2019s kind of a cool idea,\u201d the \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d star says. More than that, he and Burtka realized it was the perfect gift for other people in situations like their own.",
      "\u201cWhether they do drink or not, you don\u2019t want to be disrespectful, so it\u2019s kind of a cool gift,\u201d Harris explains.",

Even through tough practice days or days I didn\u2019t feel my best, I continued to put in the work, strengthen my skills, and believe in my ability.\"",
      "The Ilona Maher Barbie doll will be available for purchase in 2026, and features a new muscular sculpt that is \"designed to reflect the build of many strong athletes,\" Mattel said in a news release.",
      "The muscular sculpt has a \"straighter, more athletic torso, visibly defined arms, shoulders and legs, plus sculpted core and back muscles,\" according to Mattel.",
      "Maher said she\u2019s proud of how far she\u2019s come, and that her commitment grew her confidence in herself and her rugby career.",
      "\u201cIf sharing my story can inspire other young girls to believe in themselves the way I have, then I\u2019ll have truly made an impact,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing part of Team Barbie is about showing girls that confidence isn\u2019t something to shy away from, but something to own. I\u2019m honored to use my platform to empower the next generation to find that spark of confidence within themselves and let it drive them toward unlocking their limitless possibilities.\u201d",
      "Maher, 29, has taken the rugby world by storm, representing the U.S. in the 2020 and 2024 Olympics and winning the bronze medal alongside her teammates in Paris.",
      "The rugby star spoke about her journey while on TODAY With Jenna & Friends on June 3.",
      "\"I did what I could at the Olympics, and I think it was amazing to get my sport on the map and to get people a little bit interested in it,\" Maher said.",
      "\"When you think about rugby, you think like, 'Oh, it's a men's sport.' But no, women are killing it ... and I'm so excited that, you know, for a sport that's male dominated, I'm kind of the face of it,\" she added.",
      "Maher's influence extends beyond the field \u2014 she walked the Sports Illustrated runway earlier this year, after landing on the cover of the famed magazine in 2024.",
      "\"I love showing my body. I love showing what this body has done for me \u2014 I've been to two Olympics now, it does amazing things on the field,\" she told TODAY's Jenna Bush Hager in June. \"It's just perfect for what it does, and so strong.\"",
      "She added: \"I think other girls seeing that and feeling like, 'Oh my gosh, I have the frame of her,' I think it has not only has helped me, and made me feel more confident, I think it helps others too.\"",
      "Maher also came in second place on Season 33 of \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d with her pro partner, Alan Bersten, and she also co-hosts the \"House of Maher\" podcast with her sisters, Olivia and Adrianna Maher."

      "As the film depicts, following his UFC wins, Kerr headed to Japan to compete in the MMA promotion Pride Fighting Championships. According to the UFC, Kerr won six of his first eight fights in Pride as a heavyweight.",
      "He did have his losses, which are seen in the movie, that also triggered his health struggles. One fight in particular, against Igor Vovchanchyn, ended in a no-contest, which set him over the edge.",
      "\"That was the straw that literally set me over the top,\" Kerr told Johnson in a joint interview for Sports Illustrated.",
      "Amid his success in the ring, his life behind closed doors proved to be quite the opposite.",
      "His Struggles With Addiction and Overdose",
      "As depicted in the film, Kerr struggled with addiction and took painkillers that were prescribed to him by a doctor. He began using opioids regularly to be able to continue fighting and numb the blows in the ring.",
      "In a 2024 interview on the HJR Podcast, Kerr explained when he believes his addiction started.",
      "\u201cThe two components that came together are the expectation that I\u2019m supposed to perform at this level regardless,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the training to perform at that level. And when those two came together, it just created a storm where I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t have time.\u201d",

      "Whether it's Dawn making the wrong smoothie, Mark not inviting her to go to Japan for his tournaments or both dealing with his addiction recovery, the two pushed each other's buttons.",
      "The film also depicted a the real-life moment when Dawn attempted to kill herself with a gun after Mark told her to leave their home. Kerr confirmed the moment in his HBO documentary, as well as in an interview with Time.com, sharing that Staples also attempted to hurt herself with razors before grabbing the handgun.",
      "\u201cWhat I was doing at the time was incredibly selfish. Dawn just wanted my love. She wanted to feel important. The only thing important at the time was me fighting, then the second thing that came in importance was the drug and alcohol use,\u201d Kerr said about his and Staples fights. \u201cA lot of that volatility was because of my actions. I look back on it now, she\u2019s a little girl asking to be loved, and I\u2019m just a little boy that doesn\u2019t know how to accept or give it.\u201d",
      "The two would go on to get married, have a son, Bryce, together, before divorcing in 2006.",
      "While on the \u201cJoe Rogan Experience,\u201d Kerr expressed that watching the film was therapeutic for him.",
      "\u201cIt was therapy for me... For the first time, I could actually see my part in it,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I could see my part, how f------ hard I was on the people around me, how just singularly driven I was to accomplish something at all cost. And the person that paid it the most was Dawn. She paid a heavy price.\u201d",
      "In another interview with IndieWire, Kerr reflected on his and his ex-wife's relationship.",
      "\u201cIt allowed me to see how hard I was on Dawn, and really admit that to myself,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cFighting is incredibly selfish; it doesn\u2019t leave a lot of space for other people when it comes to emotion and intimacy. Breaking it down to its essence, Dawn was just a little girl who wanted to be loved, and I was just a boy that couldn\u2019t figure out how to love her.\u201d",
      "He expressed that both of them are different people now and their priority in life is their \u201cbeautiful 20-year-old son\u201d and \u201cto be the best parents we can to him.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen the movie showed at Venice, I couldn\u2019t believe how emotionally impactful it was,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was like therapy with a thousand people in the room. It was a beautiful experience.\u201d",

      "\"I\u2019ve always felt that if you wanna try and inhabit somebody convincingly that it seems sensible that there wouldn\u2019t be too much \u2014 that people wouldn\u2019t have an impression of you as an individual that would in some way inhibit your ability to do that,\" Murphy said.",
      "\"That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019ve always felt,\" he continued. \"I like the transformative nature of acting. So if you can kinda keep that as background, then I think it allows you more freedom as a performer, you know?\"",
      "Murphy made a name for himself in roles like Christopher Nolan's  \"Batman Begins\" and \"Inception,\" and the popular series \"Peaky Blinders.\" When he landed the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in Nolan's epic film, \"Oppenheimer,\" he not took home an Oscar, but also became more of a household name.",
      "The three-hour film won seven Oscars, including the Academy Award for best picture and Murphy's Oscar for best actor in a leading role.",
      "Since the release of \"Oppenheimer,\" Murphy has gone on to star in the Zombie movie, \"28 Days Later,\" and \"Small Things Like These,\" a film adaptation of Irish author Claire Keegan's book of the same name.",
      "That film follows an Irish father in the 1980s as he discovers abuse occurring at a local convent's Magdalene Laundry. At laundries across the country, \"fallen women\" were forced into unpaid labor until the last laundry closed in 1996, according to the BBC.",
      "Murphy described learning of the scandal as a \"collective trauma for people of a certain age\" at a 2024 press conference, according to the Guardian.",
      "\u201cI think the irony of the book is that it\u2019s a Christian man trying to act Christian in a dysfunctional Christian society. And it asks a lot of questions about publicity and silence and shame, all of those things,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t think the duty of art is to answer those questions, it\u2019s to talk to them. And maybe it\u2019s easier to absorb than an academic report, or a political report.\u201d",
      "Murphy's newest role is in Netflix's \"Steve,\" in which he portrays the titular role of a headteacher at a school for boys with societal and behavioral issues. \"Steve\" is set to premiere on Oct. 3."

      "During his Aug. 31 episode of \u201cSunday Sitdown\u201d with Willie Geist, Bad Bunny reacted to Hamm\u2019s dancing during his performance. At the time he said, \u201cI saw him there on the casita probably, he was lit. I\u2019m happy that he went and he had fun.\u201d"

      "\u201cI remember right when we were about to start the press tour, Paul and Leo were like, \u2018Hey, we need you to get on Tiktok and you start making TikToks.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018OK, you guys are going to have to be in them too. I hope you\u2019re ready for that,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then I would literally just show up with different, like, trends or ideas that I would see and I would show an example.\u201d",

      "Eventually, Infiniti explains, \u201cthe more that we did it, the more that they enjoyed them.\"",
      "The real test of success was when she was given a thumbs up of approval by Anderson\u2019s kids, whom he shares with actor Maya Rudolph.",

      "As far as where the story may go for her character\u2019s dad Bob, Infiniti jokes she hopes he finally gets the help he needs.",
      "\u201cI hope Bob does not stay as paranoid,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that my biggest hope for Bob is that he can actually, like, sit on the couch and chill. He doesn\u2019t have to be as paranoid as he has been in the past.\u201d",

      "Israel\u2019s delegation will be led by Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, who is set to leave for Egypt on Monday, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office Sunday.",
      "The two sides have agreed on parts of Trump\u2019s proposal.",
      "Helping to hammer out the deal\u2019s remaining sticking points will be U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who were also traveling to Egypt, a senior White House official told NBC News on Saturday.",
      "Trump called the talks \"very successful, and proceeding rapidly,\" and said Monday\u2019s meetings was just a case of technical teams clarifying \"final details.\" He wrote in a social media post that \"the first phase should be completed this week.\"",
      "Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian American mediator, said in an interview that Hamas leaders were optimistic about the prospects of arriving at an agreement and feel specifically reassured by Trump's recent comments. They believe Trump is the only person who can pressure Netanyahu into a deal, Bahbah added.",
      "Bahbah said he believes Hamas is unlikely to walk away from the talks without a deal, though \"Hamas wants assurances that the war has truly ended and there will be no going back to the war and no Israeli violations\" of the agreement, he said.",
      "On Monday, the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters, a group that coordinates efforts for those still held in Gaza, sent an \"urgent letter\" to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, \"strongly urging\" the body to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the American president this week \"for his unprecedented contributions to global peace.\"",
      "A senior Arab negotiator directly involved in the talks told NBC News on Monday, \"A deal will happen if President Trump keeps pushing.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio was cooler, telling NBC News\u2019 \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that finding a resolution would take \"some time\" and that \"there\u2019s some work that remains to be done.\"",
      "It came as Israel said it deported 171 activists, including the campaigner Greta Thunberg, who sailed toward Gaza on an aid flotilla. The detainees, whose vessels were boarded by Israeli military personnel, were deported to Greece and Slovakia, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement.",
      "The first phase of the talks will deal with the release of the remaining 48 hostages, some 20 of whom are believed to still be alive, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.",
      "The plan also calls for the end of fighting and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Hamas agreed to some of this proposal on Friday, while sidestepping Trump\u2019s call for it to disband and disarm.",
      "On Sunday, Hamas leader Mahmoud Mardawi denied as baseless reports in Arab media that the group had agreed to lay down its weapons.",
      "Israel says it agrees with the plan, buoying the yearslong, impassioned domestic campaign by families and supporters of the hostages to cease fighting so they can be brought home.",
      "Ohad Ben Ami, 56, was released in February, having been kidnapped from kibbutz Be\u2019eri, in southern Israel, and held captive for 491 days. On Sunday, he showed NBC News the place where he was taken on Oct. 7.",
      "\"When we were down there\" in the deep Gaza tunnel where he was held, he said he was told \"many times there was a deal in the air,\" he said. \"We were very happy and on a high, then they say, 'no it\u2019s collapsed' and we were very depressed.\"",
      "Still, Netanyahu faces pressure from his own government over negotiations. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on X that stopping attacks on Gaza would be a \u201cgrave mistake.\"",
      "In Gaza, many Palestinians are desperate for an end to the bombardment that has killed more than 67,000 people, most of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry. Some 78% of buildings have either been damaged or destroyed.",
      "The prospect of an agreement has not stopped the Israeli attacks. Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run Government Media Office said Sunday that Israel had carried out 131 airstrikes on Gaza over the past 48 hours, killing 94 Palestinians.",
      "Israel launched the offensive after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terror attack, in which some 1,200 were killed and another 250 kidnapped.",
      "Though freeing the hostages would be a \u201csignificant achievement and a fulfillment of a principal war objective,\u201d IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir warned his troops to be ready.",
      "\u201cThe operation is not over; we must remain alert and ready for combat at all times,\u201d he said in a statement Sunday. \u201cIf the political effort does not succeed, we will return to fight.\u201d"

    "summary": "\u201cNye,\u201d an unlikely hit about the creator, and origin story, of Britain\u2019s taxpayer-funded National Health Service, came at an inflection point for the NHS.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Despite being headlined by a genuine star and staged at one of London\u2019s premier theaters, a play about the foundation of a sprawling and troubled public service seemed unlikely to provoke night after night of standing ovations.",
      "But that\u2019s what happened with \u201cNye,\u201d an unlikely hit about the creator, and origin story, of Britain\u2019s taxpayer-funded National Health Service.",
      "The play, written by Tim Price and directed by Rufus Norris, came at an inflection point for the NHS, as it\u2019s known. Almost 80 years after it was founded, the medical service once touted as the envy of the world is \u201cbroken\u201d and suffering the \u201cbiggest crisis in its history,\u201d the government says. The crisis at this national bedrock is part of a bigger malaise at the heart of British culture: rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m terrified, not just for the NHS, but for the whole of our society,\u201d Michael Sheen, who starred as Aneurin \u201cNye\u201d Bevan, the founder of the NHS, told NBC News in an interview. \u201cOnce it\u2019s torn down, then I guess people will think about what they\u2019ve lost.\u201d",
      "Sheen, 56, better known to international audiences as Tony Blair in \u201cThe Queen,\u201d David Frost in \u201cFrost/Nixon\u201d and the angel Aziraphale in the Amazon Prime series \u201cGood Omens,\u201d has spent much of the last two years honing his portrayal of Bevan, the socialist politician who dragged himself out of Wales\u2019 coal mines to will the NHS into existence.",
      "Though second nature to Brits, the ideal of the NHS is unfamiliar to many Americans: British people have universally free health care at the point of access \u2014 from ambulances attending car accidents to insulin for diabetes to cancer care to childbirth. Though some people do have private insurance, the idea of having to choose between illness and financial ruin is shocking in the U.K.",
      "Now, the Labour Party, which created the then-radical NHS in 1948, is battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity. It has a colossal task if it is to fix the crumbling hospitals replete with overworked doctors and bed-lined corridors.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer must turn around a behemoth whose budget of 200 billion English pounds ($269 billion) represents some 40% of all government spending, and whose 1.4 million employees are the world\u2019s seventh-largest workforce. In the United States, only the Department of Defense, Walmart and Amazon employ more people.",
      "Through all this, the core NHS ideal endures. Everyone in the U.K. has a story of a relative, or themselves, receiving the type of world-class care that puts a terrifying financial strain on millions of Americans. (In the past six years, this reporter\u2019s mother has had a single mastectomy and reconstruction, as well as three titanium plates in a shattered ankle, without having to pay a pound for the care.)",
      "But just as common are the tales of maddening, hourslong waits in overstretched emergency rooms, or weeklong delays just to see a community general practitioner. Many critics blame the sprawling crisis on years of underfunding by the now-ousted Conservative government of 2010-24, whose response to the 2008 financial crisis was to make drastic cuts to public services.",
      "It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that a largely liberal London-theatergoing audience responded with applause and tears at the hagiography of Bevan at the National Theater. Though relatively unknown in wider society, admirers see Bevan as a founding father of modern Britain; his ideal of the NHS today is not just popular, it defines the country itself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far from perfect,\u201d said Alison Ferris, 40, a nurse at a hospital in Canterbury, in southeast England. \u201cBut I do the best that I can for anyone that comes in front of me. I treat every patient like I would treat my loved ones.\u201d",
      "Though the concept remains revered, public satisfaction in the NHS in practice cratered to 52% in 2023 from a high of 70% in 2010, according to the King\u2019s Fund, a top think tank tracking British health care.",
      "\u201cWe have to fight for the NHS, the same as the NHS was fought for when it was created,\u201d said Ferris\u2019 mother, Caroline Heggie, 70, a hospital union representative, who like her daughter had come to see the last night of \u201cNye\u201d at the National Theater last month. \u201cWe can\u2019t go the way of privatization, we can\u2019t go the way of America. That\u2019s what we\u2019re up against.\u201d",
      "Like Bevan, Sheen is a Welsh firebrand unafraid to wear his leftist politics. But he also lived for 14 years in Los Angeles, so knows too well what life is like without socialized health care.",
      "\u201cThe idea of this health care system that we have here, just seemed so alien to them over there,\u201d Sheen, who now lives back in his Welsh hometown of Port Talbot, says of his former American hosts. He says that \u201cseeing people go into hospitals with serious injuries or illnesses, and being asked to produce their checkbook before they can be treated\u201d would shock most Britons.",
      "The crisis at the NHS coincides with an uptick in hostility toward immigrants \u2014 even though they are often people\u2019s doctors, nurses and hospital cleaners. Almost 20% of NHS staff have a non-British nationality, with Indians, Filipinos, Nigerians, Irish and Poles making up most of their number.",
      "Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform U.K. party and an ally and friend of President Donald Trump, is leading some polls to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister. He has become the first prospective leader to question the funding model of using taxes to fund the NHS \u2014 historically taboo.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work \u2014 it\u2019s not working,\u201d Farage told NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News in May. \u201cWe\u2019re getting worse bang for the buck than any other country, particularly out of those European neighbors.\u201d",
      "Opposing Farage\u2019s proposal, however, leaves open the specter of privatization, which many say has been creeping up even before the Health and Social Care Act 2012 opened up the NHS to bids from private contractors.",
      "Farage isn\u2019t the only person dissatisfied. Indeed, the NHS has slipped from being a world leader on many metrics.",
      "\u201cCorridor care\u201d is now a year-round crisis, and the number of people waiting 12 hours or more to be admitted into an emergency room rose from 47 in summer 2015 to 74,150 this summer. Targets have lagged for years in everything from ambulance attendance times to cancer diagnoses. Meanwhile, a 7 million-strong waiting list means many people feel abandoned for months, in pain, before getting hip or knee replacement and other types of surgery.",
      "There is ample evidence to suggest that economic austerity policies imposed during 14 years of Conservative Party rule are at least partly to blame, according to Max Warner, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a London research group.",
      "\u201cIt is true that a lot of NHS performance measures over the 2010s were broadly getting worse, having started off relatively well,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s worth saying that productivity did grow, so it\u2019s a nuanced picture and causality is difficult.\u201d",
      "The Conservatives argued that they kept NHS spending up, protecting it from the brutal cuts that crushed almost every other government department at the time. But this 2% yearly growth still fell well short of the 3.8% yearly average since the 1980s, and, according to critics, was insufficient to cope with an aging population and the rising prices of cutting-edge drugs.",
      "Far from the envy of the world, Britain has been scrimping by spending 37 billion pounds ($53 billion) on the health services each year, well below Germany, France and Australia, a landmark review found last year.",
      "The current Labour government has outlined plans to raise spending to around 3% \u2014 an improvement but still short of what many advocates had hoped. At his annual Labour Party conference this week, Starmer announced that a digital overhaul named NHS Online would launch in 2027, describing it as \u201ca new chapter in the story of our NHS.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, whatever the model, cash is key, according to Roy Lilley, who ran an NHS hospital in the 1990s as chairman of Homewood NHS Trust in Surrey, west of London.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you pay for your health care,\u201d said Lilley, today a consultant whose newsletter hits 300,000 inboxes. \u201cWhether you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018insurance,\u2019 or you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018taxes,\u2019 it\u2019s still your trousers.\u201d",
      "He remains optimistic, however, pointing to some waiting metrics improving and a general recovery from the hammerblow of the pandemic, which drained resources and mentally scarred doctors.",
      "Still, Sheen \u2014 never shy to mix acting with activism \u2014 believes it\u2019s no coincidence that the NHS is in crisis just when its origin story begins to vanish from living memory.",
      "\u201cThe crisis that we seem to be experiencing makes it all the more important to go back to the beginning and to look at what was behind the founding of the NHS, and what the principles were,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes incredibly important to tell the story of it and to remind people of what it was actually like, so that we don\u2019t forget.\u201d"

      "Here, he may have just achieved a breakthrough.",
      "Up against a Sunday deadline that Trump had set, Hamas said Friday that it would meet a major condition that the president laid out in his 20-point plan for the war\u2019s end: releasing all the hostages, living or dead. Hamas\u2019 caveat was that \u201cthe field conditions for the exchange are met.\u201d",
      "Hamas also said it was prepared to enter into negotiations and turn over administrative control of Gaza to a Palestinian body of technocrats.",
      "Trump had been waiting on an answer from Hamas since Monday, when he released his peace plan at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He took Hamas\u2019 announcement as a good sign.",
      "\u201cBased on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE,\u201d he wrote on his social media site. \u201cIsrael must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!\u201d",
      "Ruby Chen, a hostage family member and a leading advocate, told NBC News: \u201cIt\u2019s a positive \u2014 we have cautious optimism. We know the president cares a lot about the hostages, so let\u2019s hope this is our time.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not done. There are still a lot of missing pieces, but it\u2019s positive,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump posted a video on Truth Social on Friday night in response to Hamas\u2019 announcement, saying: \u201cThis is a big day. We\u2019ll see how it all turns out. We have to get the final word down in concrete.\u201d",
      "The Middle East is a part of the world where conflict seems eternal, peace sporadic. Since President Harry Truman recognized the Jewish state in 1948, many presidents have tried to usher in peaceful relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, only to see conflict erupt again and again.",
      "Like Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and others before him, Trump is working to negotiate an accord among longtime combatants \u2014 an effort that dovetails with the White House\u2019s public campaign to get him the Nobel Peace Prize.",

      "Even some of Trump\u2019s detractors said that Hamas\u2019 new position could be an encouraging step toward ending the war.",
      "\u201cLike the rest of the world, I\u2019m hoping this news means imminent return of the hostages and action addressing the Gaza humanitarian crisis, along with a ceasefire and path to peace and normalizing relations in the region,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News.",
      "Some were more skeptical, questioning whether Hamas can be trusted to follow through on its commitments.",
      "Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank, said, \u201cI\u2019d be a bit more cautious given that Hamas is a terrorist organization with a track record of saying one thing and doing another.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis may be the beginning of the end, but there is still more work to do,\u201d said a former Western diplomat with experience in the Middle East. \u201cHamas has not accepted key elements of the plan nor the timeframe for hostage releases. Trump\u2019s call on Israel to halt strikes will call Hamas\u2019 bluff over the coming days. It\u2019s now up to Hamas. We either see hostages coming out this week or the war will restart.\u201d",
      "A European diplomat who has been closely engaged in the process said the situation remained extremely urgent: \u201cGet the hostages home. Worry about the details next.\u201d",
      "The diplomat acknowledged that as with any deal of this kind, the details and terms need to be worked out as the process moves forward.",

      "He assigned one of his closest allies, fellow real estate mogul Steve Witkoff, to quarterback the American deal-making team, and he put his own capital on the line in discussions with major players in the region as recently as this week.",
      "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a longtime informal adviser to Trump, said in an interview with NBC News on Friday that the president has held a vision for the Middle East that includes progress for Israel and Arab nations since he first took office in 2017 and that his insistence on wrangling an apology from Netanyahu for Israeli strikes in Qatar demonstrated his commitment to that view.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is, first of all, a very subtle, complex set of relationships being nurtured by the president with a continued emphasis on a better future,\u201d Gingrich said.",
      "If a peace agreement \u201cactually happens,\u201d Gingrich added, it could put Trump in league with President Theodore Roosevelt, who negotiated an end to the Russo-Japanese war in the early part of the 20th century, and that \u201cwould have a substantial impact\u201d on the perception of Trump in the U.S.",
      "A senior Arab diplomat told NBC News that the Hamas response is \u201cpositive,\u201d adding: \u201cThey had no choice but to accept.\u201d",
      "But a former Western diplomat with experience in the region told NBC News that the plan could still fall apart.",
      "\u201cThis may be the beginning of the end, but there is still more work to do. Hamas has not accepted key elements of the plan nor the timeframe for hostage releases,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cTrump\u2019s call on Israel to halt strikes will call Hamas\u2019s bluff over the coming days. It\u2019s now up to Hamas. We either see hostages coming out this week or the war will restart.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s peace plan was met with cautious optimism earlier in the week by leaders elsewhere in the Middle East and around the world.",
      "Muslim powers including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey welcomed the plan in a joint statement calling Trump\u2019s efforts \u201csincere.\u201d",
      "The proposal also received support from Europe, with countries that had recently defied Washington by formally recognizing Palestinian statehood welcoming the initiative.",
      "But hours after Trump announced the plan, Netanyahu reiterated his past vows to oppose Palestinian statehood.",
      "\u201cInstead of Hamas isolating us, we turned the tables and isolated Hamas,\u201d he said in Hebrew in a video discussing his U.S. trip.",
      "The developments come on the eve of the second anniversary of the fighting, which began with the Hamas-led terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage.",
      "According to health officials in the enclave, Israeli forces have killed more than 65,000 Palestinians in the past two years."

      "The humble soybean is the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to reshape global trade.",
      "Used in everything from animal feed to fuel, soybeans regularly rank among the most valuable U.S. agricultural exports, towering over higher-profile crops like corn and cotton.",
      "More than $30 billion worth of American soybean products were exported in fiscal year 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "For American soybean farmers, their top overseas market has long been China, which bought around a third of the export crop \u2014 approximately $12 billion worth of American soybean products \u2014 in the last calendar year, USDA data shows.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war leaves U.S.-China relations somewhere between frosty and openly hostile, America\u2019s soybean farmers appear to be an early casualty.",
      "An embargo in all but name",
      "So far, China has not purchased any U.S. soybeans during this year\u2019s main harvest period, with sales falling to zero in May.",
      "This has pushed many American farmers reliant on soybeans nearly to the breaking point.",
      "It has also complicated the Trump administration\u2019s plans to provide billions in foreign economic aid to Argentina.",
      "Buenos Aires recently sold more than 2.5 million metric tons of soybeans to Beijing, after briefly suspending its export tax on the soy products.",
      "U.S. officials blame China for the looming crisis facing American soybean producers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate the Chinese leadership has decided to use the American farmers, soybean farmers in particular, as a hostage or pawn in the trade negotiations,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday on CNBC.",
      "Farmers view the situation differently, however. They want Trump to reach a trade deal with China that ends the unofficial embargo on soybeans. But instead, what they see is the White House preparing to bail out one of their chief rivals for the Chinese export market.",
      "\u201cThe frustration is overwhelming,\u201d American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland said in a recent statement.",
      "Meanwhile, China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest buyer of soybeans \u2014indicated last week that it won\u2019t resume U.S. purchases unless more Trump tariffs are lifted.",
      "\u201cAs for soybean trade, the U.S. side should take proactive steps to remove relevant unreasonable tariffs, create conditions for expanding bilateral trade, and inject more stability and certainty into global economic development,\u201d Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yadong told reporters in Beijing.",
      "Emergency relief is coming",
      "The Trump administration will announce new support for farmers, \u201cespecially the soybean farmers,\u201d on Tuesday, Bessent said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also going to be working with the Farm Credit Bureau to make sure that the farmers have what they need for the next planting season,\u201d he added.",
      "Bessent personally owns as much as $25 million worth of farmland in North Dakota that produces corn and soybeans, according to his recent financial disclosures.",
      "He said soybeans would be a topic of discussion at the upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum later this month.",
      "Trump is also aware of the impact his trade policies are having on American farmers, starting with soybean growers.",
      "\u201cThe Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for \u2018negotiating\u2019 reasons only, not buying,\u201d the president posted Wednesday on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve made so much money on Tariffs, that we are going to take a small portion of that money, and help our Farmers,\u201d Trump added.",
      "The question is whether this aid will come soon enough to save this year\u2019s massive harvest of soybeans.",
      "At the center of the firestorm is Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, who warned this week that \u201cthis moment of uncertainty in the farm economy is real.\u201d Speaking on Fox Business Network, she emphasized that Trump has long supported U.S. farmers.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and Secretary Rollins are always in touch about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the President\u2019s November victory,\u201d the White House said in a statement Thursday. \u201cHe has made clear his intention to use tariff revenue to help our agricultural sector, but no final decisions on the contours of this plan have been made.\u201d",
      "The Argentina factor",
      "The current U.S.-China stalemate over soybean exports is also complicating another American foreign policy conundrum: what to do about Argentina\u2019s faltering economy.",
      "As U.S. soybean exports to China screech to a halt, Argentina\u2019s farmers jumped at the opportunity to sell China their own soybeans.",
      "From their perspective, a potential U.S. economic aid package has nothing to do with their soybean exports, and everything to do with the personal and political alliance between Trump and libertarian President Javier Milei.",
      "Milei was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his 2024 election victory, and he has become a familiar face at U.S. political events attended by the president\u2019s MAGA supporters.",
      "At a Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C. in February, Milei gifted then-Department of Government Efficiency chief Elon Musk a red chainsaw.",
      "Musk then waved it around onstage, calling it \u201cthe chainsaw for bureaucracy.\u201d",
      "Eight months later, Milei\u2019s popularity with voters has plunged, raising doubts about the future of his market-friendly economic reforms and strict austerity measures.",
      "Local elections in early September dealt a blow to Milei\u2019s party, triggering massive turmoil in Argentina\u2019s stock and currency markets.",
      "A few weeks after the market plunge, Bessent announced on social media that the U.S. was prepared to deploy billions of dollars to support the South American country.",
      "A presidential delegation from Buenos Aires is expected to visit the White House next week to finalize the U.S. foreign aid deal.",
      "This has infuriated the soybean farmers.",
      "\u201cU.S. soybean prices are falling, harvest is underway, and farmers read headlines not about securing a trade agreement with China, but that the U.S. government is extending $20 billion in economic support to Argentina while that country drops its soybean export taxes to sell 20 shiploads of Argentine soybeans to China in just two days,\u201d Ragland said.",
      "Meanwhile, Milei has also secured a currency swap line for Argentina from China, a situation that gives pause to some in Washington.",
      "In response, Milei has said Argentina will maintain its mutually beneficial trade and economic relationship with China.",
      "Tensions inside the Trump administration over China, Argentina and the soybean farmers broke into the open last week.",
      "While attending the U.N. General Assembly, Bessent received a text message from a contact labeled \u201cBR.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe bailed out Argentina yesterday \u2026 and in return, the Argentine\u2019s removed their export tariff on grains, reducing their price, and sold a bunch of soybeans to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,\u201d read the message, widely presumed to come from Rollins.",
      "\u201cSoy prices are dropping further because of it. This gives China more leverage on us,\u201d the message concluded.",
      "Spokespeople for Bessent and Rollins did not respond to questions about the text message exchange."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/china-starting-talk-ai-superintelligence-us-are-taking-notice-rcna234675",
    "published": "Sat, 04 Oct 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Alibaba announced a new initiative aiming to reach AI superintelligence, heating up an arms race with American AI companies.",
    "story": [
      "Early last week in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, a slick, larger-than-life video screen beamed out four words that would drive tech giant Alibaba\u2019s stock to historic levels and signal a shift in China\u2019s approach to artificial intelligence: \u201cRoadmap to Artificial Superintelligence.\u201d",
      "During his 23-minute keynote address at the flagship Alibaba Cloud conference, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu charted out a future featuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial superintelligence (ASI). These terms point to a theorized era in which AI becomes roughly as smart as humans (AGI) and then much, much smarter (ASI).",
      "While these terms have been tossed around Silicon Valley for years, Wu\u2019s presentation was notable: Alibaba is now the first established Chinese tech giant to explicitly invoke AGI and ASI.",
      "\u201cAchieving AGI \u2014 an intelligent system with general human-level cognition \u2014 now appears inevitable. Yet AGI is not the end of AI\u2019s development, but its beginning,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIt will march toward ASI \u2014 intelligence beyond the human, capable of self-iteration and continuous evolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cASI will drive exponential technological leaps, carrying us into an unprecedented age of intelligence,\u201d Wu said, highlighting ASI\u2019s ability to help cure diseases, discover cleaner sources of energy and even unlock interstellar travel.",
      "The U.S. and China are the world\u2019s leading AI powers, each with immense computing capabilities and top-tier researchers developing cutting-edge systems. Yet observers have framed the countries as having different approaches to AI, with perceptions that China focuses more on real-world AI applications.",
      "For example, commentators recently argued that Beijing is currently \u201cwinning the race for AI robots\u201d against the U.S., as China is home to much of the world\u2019s most advanced robotics supply chains and a growing network of robotics, or embodied AI, labs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been some commentary in Western media recently about how the U.S. is missing the point by pushing for AGI, while China is focusing solely on applications,\u201d said Helen Toner, interim executive director of Georgetown\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. \u201cThis is wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome Chinese researchers and some parts of the Chinese government have been interested in AGI and superintelligence for a long time,\u201d Toner said, though she noted this view was primarily held by smaller startups like DeepSeek.",
      "Afra Wang, a researcher focusing on China\u2019s tech scene, said Alibaba\u2019s invocation of AGI and ASI was remarkable.",
      "\u201cThis ASI narrative is definitely something new, especially among the biggest tech companies in China,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "Alibaba\u2019s \u201croadmap to artificial superintelligence\u201d seems to scramble mainstream perceptions. Any number of California techno-optimists, like Anthropic\u2019s Dario Amodei or xAI\u2019s Elon Musk, might have delivered Wu\u2019s speech, selling a technology-enabled utopia while largely sidestepping darker questions about how humanity would co-exist with or survive an era of digital superintelligence.",
      "The concept of superintelligence has long been on the minds of \u2014 if not explicitly guiding \u2014 prominent American AI companies. For example, OpenAI released an article focused on the safe development of superintelligent AI models in May 2023. \u201cNow is a good time to start thinking about the governance of superintelligence \u2014 future AI systems dramatically more capable than even AGI,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The possibility of superintelligence is now even being acknowledged in Congress. On Monday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., announced a draft bill that would, among other actions, \u201cassist Congress in determining the potential for controlled AI systems to reach artificial superintelligence.\u201d",
      "To some, ASI might seem like an outlandish concept when today\u2019s AI systems fail to understand basic tennis rules, hallucinate or fabricate basic information, or do not seem to actually comprehend how the external world functions.",
      "At the same time, AI systems continue to approach and sometimes surpass human capabilities in many domains, from driving cars safely to winning international coding competitions, leaving many experts to say it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, humans develop digital superintelligence.",
      "As the idea of superintelligence gradually enters mainstream debates, many American politicians have announced that the U.S. is in an AI race with China. The White House\u2019s current AI manifesto is titled \u201cWinning the AI Race: America\u2019s AI Action Plan,\u201d while Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, proclaimed that \u201cas a matter of economic security, as a matter of national security, America has to beat China in the AI race.\u201d",
      "Yet charges of an AI race are muddied by a lack of an agreed end goal and swirling definitions of AGI. At worst, experts think an unfettered race toward AGI or ASI could lead to widespread catastrophe or even the end of humanity.",
      "But there\u2019s also plenty of skepticism around talk of AGI and ASI and whether it\u2019s primarily for marketing purposes.",
      "Alibaba is one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, known for providing powerful, free AI models \u2014 also called open-source models \u2014 for download. Alibaba\u2019s Qwen model series, a competitor to models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 or Anthropic\u2019s Claude, is the most popular open-source AI system in the world.",
      "Wu announced a new series of Qwen models in his speech last week, including a model that combines text, images, video and audio capabilities.",
      "Many observers point out that narratives about a U.S.-China AI race and a resulting sprint to build AI infrastructure serve AI investors by propping up company valuations and increasing their soft power. Alibaba\u2019s stock has soared since Wu\u2019s speech last week, part of a larger $250 billion comeback this year that has made it China\u2019s hottest AI company.",
      "To unlock a powerful, superintelligent future, Wu predicted that large AI models will replace existing operating systems as the link between users, software and computational power. This future network of large AI models will run on cloud computing networks like Alibaba Cloud, he said.",
      "Irene Zhang, a researcher on China\u2019s AI ecosystem and an editor of ChinaTalk, noted the business undertones of Wu\u2019s announcement.",
      "\u201cThis is a vision of AGI and ASI that\u2019s directly based on Alibaba\u2019s business model,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAlibaba Cloud dominates China\u2019s cloud computing market, and its global market share is now bigger than Oracle\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cAlibaba\u2019s commercial strategy and its publicly stated views on ASI/AGI are symbiotic.\u201d",
      "Matt Sheehan, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, agreed.",
      "\u201cASI is the ultimate frontier, as far as the discourse goes on AI,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cIt\u2019s notable that Alibaba set this grandiose goal, but in reality, they\u2019re selling cloud services.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Oct. 5, 2025, 4:55 p.m ET): An earlier version of this article misstated the state represented by Sen. Richard Blumenthal. He represents Connecticut, not Illinois."

      "Takaichi defeated Shinjiro Koizumi 185 to 156 in a second-round runoff vote to become leader of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II.",
      "The leadership race was triggered last month when Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he would step down after a year in office. Though Takaichi is likely to succeed him as prime minister of Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, when parliament votes later this month, it is not guaranteed since the LDP-led coalition lost its majority in both houses in the past year.",
      "\u201cRight now, rather than feeling happy, I truly believe this is where the real challenge begins,\u201d Takaichi said in her victory speech. \u201cThere is a mountain of work we must all tackle together.\u201d",
      "She also said it was important to make the LDP, which has been tarnished by corruption scandals, \u201ca more spirited and vibrant party, a party that transforms people\u2019s anxieties into hope.\u201d",
      "Takaichi, 64, a hard-line conservative who says her hero is former British leader Margaret Thatcher, was an ally of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader.",
      "Though many party members welcome Takaichi\u2019s ascendance as a potential return to the days of Abe, there are concerns that her nationalistic historical views could cause friction with East Asian neighbors China and South Korea.",
      "\u201cBeijing is likely to object to Takaichi\u2019s positions on revising Japan\u2019s postwar pacifist constitution, strengthening maritime security, and bolstering support for Taiwan,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "One of the top priorities for Japan\u2019s next prime minister will be implementing the trade deal reached with the Trump administration in July. The agreement, which imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese goods including its crucial auto exports, has yet to be put in writing and many of the details remain unclear.",
      "Takaichi has raised the possibility of reopening talks on the deal, which includes a pledge by Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S.",
      "She told reporters after her victory on Saturday that she did not intend to \u201coverturn\u201d anything that Japan and the United States had agreed upon.",
      "\u201cI will firmly adhere to the agreement reached between our two countries,\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cThis applies to tariffs and also investments as well.\u201d",
      "The LDP voted on five leadership candidates in the first round, with Takaichi securing 183 votes to Koizumi\u2019s 164. Yoshimasa Hayashi, 64, the top spokesperson for the current Japanese government, came in third with 134 votes after a recent surge in polls.",
      "Votes in the first round were divided evenly between 294 LDP lawmakers and almost 1 million rank-and-file party members who were represented by 295 votes. Lawmakers favored the more moderate Koizumi, while party members preferred Takaichi, who has a passionate base.",
      "In the second round, lawmakers had the same number of votes while rank-and-file party members had 47, representing the 47 prefectures of Japan.",

    "story": [
      "MANCHESTER, England \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was shocked by Thursday\u2019s terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar.",
      "But for many British Jews, this was anything but a shock, rather the culmination of a wave of antisemitism in Britain that was rising before Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel\u2019s subsequent military assault on Gaza \u2014  and has only intensified since.",
      "There has been a rise in anti-Jewish hostility in Britain that predates the attack in Israel and the Gaza war that started three years ago, according to community groups and the people suffering the first-hand effects in the United Kingdom. But the incident at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall has brought the issue of antisemitism to the fore again \u2014 leaving many Jewish people in Britain worried for the safety of their friends and family.",
      "\u201cI just keep thinking about my children,\u201d said Josh Simons, a member of Parliament who represents the Makerfield constituency near Manchester, and whose family fled persecution in Europe for the relative safety of England around a century ago. \u201cI\u2019ve got two young kids and I think everybody in this community will be holding their children tonight that little bit closer.\u201d",
      "He told NBC News on Thursday that the community was feeling \u201cfrightened, scared and hurt.\u201d",
      "Two men, Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were killed during the attack on the synagogue.",
      "Greater Manchester Police said Friday that one of them suffered a wound as armed officers attempted to shoot the attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, who drove into a group of people before stabbing a man. Al-Shamie did not have a firearm. But for many in the Jewish community the attack, which also left three people injured, was the culmination of something that had been festering for some time.",
      "\u201cThis is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come,\u201d Britain\u2019s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, also said in a statement. \u201cFor so long we have witnessed an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred on our streets, on campuses, on social media and elsewhere \u2014 this is the tragic result,\u201d he added.",
      "Since Israel launched its military offensive in the wake of the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on the country, there has been a spike in antisemitic incidents in Britain, according to the Community Security Trust, a charity that coordinates security measures at Jewish institutions and tracks this data. The group defines antisemitism as \u201chatred, bigotry, prejudice or discrimination against Jews,\u201d on its website.",
      "That year, 2023, saw 4,103 antisemitic incidents reported to the CST \u2014 the most on record \u2014 and last year\u2019s 3,528 was the second highest. Swastikas and other graffiti have been daubed on synagogues and other sites, and security has been heightened at Jewish schools.",
      "In the space of a week last month, urine and feces were smeared over seven synagogues and a children\u2019s nursery in Golders Green, a part of north London known for its large Jewish population. \u201cThese repeated attacks have left our community anxious, hurt and increasingly worried,\u201d a spokesperson for the local Shomrim community Jewish patrol group said at the time.",
      "In May, a Jewish-owned business in nearby Stamford Hill, which has a large Orthodox Jewish community, was daubed in red paint and had its windows smashed. Graffiti alleged the firm had links to an Israeli arms manufacturer, but traumatized staff there said this wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that the number of attacks has increased since the Gaza conflict,\u201d Graham Stringer, another member of Parliament serving Blackley and Middleton, another constituency close to Manchester, said  in an interview Friday. \u201cThe Jewish community has been angry and frightened and so, incidentally, has the Muslim community.\u201d",
      "There was an increase in religious hate crimes targeted against Muslims since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict, with 3,866 offenses in the year leading up to March 2024, according to the latest government data. This was up 13% from 3,432 recorded the previous year, the data showed.",
      "Perhaps this is why the 2025 Jewish Landscape Report, an annual global survey, found that 81% of respondents in Britain felt the need to conceal their Jewishness in public.",
      "In a febrile atmosphere, Starmer is now under pressure to reassure British Jews \u2014 who make up just 290,000 of Britain\u2019s 70-million population, according to the last census in 2021 \u2014 that they are safe.",

      "Other observers were dismayed to see pro-Palestinian marches going ahead Thursday evening in Manchester, London and other cities.",
      "There have been regular marches and protests in cities across the country about Israel\u2019s conduct during the war, which will enter its third year Tuesday. Among the crowds, which have on occasion contained tens of thousands, there have been displays of violent antisemitic sentiment, as well as language that conflates enmity toward Israel, Zionism and Jews themselves.",
      "On Friday, protesters said they were supporting an urgent cause, specifically the aid flotilla that was intercepted by the Israeli military en route to Gaza.",
      "But for others \u2014 both in and outside the Jewish community \u2014 it was disappointing not to have a pause in the demonstrations that have often been interpreted as hostile by British Jews.",
      "\u201cI do think that carrying on in this way does feel un-British, it feels wrong,\u201d Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC. \u201cIt is important to draw a line between what is happening in the Middle East and what is happening at home.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 A woman has been named to the post of Archbishop of Canterbury for the first time in the history of the Church of England.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Friday that King Charles had approved the nomination of Sarah Mullally, bishop of London, for the church\u2019s most senior position. She will be installed in a service at Canterbury Cathedral in March 2026.",
      "Mullally is the first female Archbishop of Canterbury to be chosen since women were allowed to become bishops in 2014.",
      "As the spiritual leader of the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury heads a global Anglican community of around 85 million people across 165 countries.",
      "In a statement following her appointment, Mullally said: \u201cAs I respond to the call of Christ to this new ministry, I do so in the same spirit of service to God and to others that has motivated me since I first came to faith as a teenager.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt every stage of that journey, through my nursing career and Christian ministry, I have learned to listen deeply \u2014 to people and to God\u2019s gentle prompting \u2014 to seek to bring people together to find hope and healing.\u201d",
      "Mullally became the first female bishop of London in 2018, having first been ordained in 2001. Before joining the church, she had been a specialist cancer nurse, rising to become the government\u2019s youngest chief nursing officer for England at the age of 37.",
      "Mullally\u2019s appointment comes 11 months after the previous archbishop, Justin Welby, resigned after a damning report into his handling of the case of a prolific child abuser associated with the church.",
      "She will become the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury since St.  Augustine was sent by Pope Gregory to convert the English people to Roman Christianity in 597.",
      "Starmer welcomed Mullally\u2019s appointment, saying she would play \u201ca key role in our national life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Church of England is of profound importance to this country. Its churches, cathedrals, schools, and charities are part of the fabric of our communities,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "In an address following her appointment, Mullally said that \u201cin the apparent chaos which surrounds us, in the midst of such profound global uncertainty, the possibility of healing lies in acts of kindness and love.\u201d",
      "She added that Thursday\u2019s terrorist attack on a synagogue in Manchester showed that Church of England members \u201chave a responsibility to be a people who stand with the Jewish community against antisemitism in all its forms. Hatred and racism of any kind cannot be allowed to tear us apart.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 Prince William has said \u201cchange is on my agenda\u201d and admitted to being overwhelmed by family stress in an unusually candid interview.",
      "William was speaking with Canadian actor and comedian Eugene Levy in Windsor for Levy\u2019s Apple TV+ travel series, \u201cThe Reluctant Traveler.\u201d",
      "Asked if the monarchy would be shifting in a different direction when he becomes king, the Prince of Wales said: \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that change is on my agenda. Change for good, and I embrace that and I enjoy that change. I don\u2019t fear it, that\u2019s the bit that excites me is the idea of being able to bring some change.\u201d",
      "William, heir to the throne currently held by King Charles, did not offer any specific changes he would be interested in making and said he did not want \u201coverly radical change,\u201d but said that \u201cif you\u2019re not careful, history can be a real weight and an anchor around you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that tradition stays, and tradition has a huge part in all of this,\u201d he said in a clip from the upcoming episode. \u201cBut there\u2019s also points where you look at tradition and go, is that still fit for purpose today? Is that still the right thing to do? Are we still doing and having the most impact we could be having?\u201d",
      "While giving Levy a private tour of Windsor Castle, where King Charles recently hosted a state banquet for President Donald Trump, William said he no longer found his royal duties overwhelming, but admitted that \u201cstuff to do with family overwhelms me quite a bit.\u201d",
      "Speaking over a pint in a local pub, William told the \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d star he was \u201cgenerally a very optimistic person\u201d even in the face of the recent cancer battles faced by his wife, Catherine, and father, King Charles.",

      "Asked how his three children \u2014 George, 12, Charlotte, 10, and Louis, 7 \u2014 have been coping with their mother\u2019s cancer, which is now in remission, William said: \u201cEveryone has their own coping mechanisms for these sorts of things, and children are constantly learning and adapting. We try to make sure we give them the security and the safety that they need. And we\u2019re a very open family, so we talk about things that bother us, and things that trouble us, but you never quite know the knock-on effects that it can have.\u201d",
      "William, who has historically been more averse to the media spotlight than his younger brother, Harry, also discussed how his experience of \u201cinsatiable\u201d media intrusion around his mother, the late Princess Diana, during his childhood has shaped the way he handles the press.",
      "\u201cThey wanted every bit of detail they could absorb, and they were in everything, literally everywhere. They would know things, they\u2019d be everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you let that creep in, the damage it can do to your family life is something that I vowed would never happen to my family.\u201d"

      "Japan could end up with its first female prime minister or its youngest leader in more than a century after a party leadership election on Saturday.",
      "The governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is voting for a new party leader after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced last month that he was stepping down.",
      "The winner is likely to become the new prime minister of Japan, a key U.S. ally and the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, when parliament votes in mid-October \u2014 though it is not guaranteed since the LDP-led coalition lost its majority in both houses in the past year.",
      "Conservative nationalist Sanae Takaichi, 64, and the more moderate Shinjiro Koizumi, 44, are the front-runners among the five candidates. Yoshimasa Hayashi, 64, who is currently the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, has also surged in public opinion polls and could end up on top.",
      "The new LDP leader will be selected by 295 lawmakers and almost 1 million rank-and-file party members, who will be represented by another 295 votes. The top two candidates are likely to then enter a runoff.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, but right now, polls suggest that Koizumi is in the pole position,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus.",
      "The LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II, is doing some \u201csoul-searching,\u201d Kingston said, after election losses spurred by a party corruption scandal as well as public dissatisfaction with the rising cost of living.",
      "Those who think the party hasn\u2019t done enough to root out corruption and needs a \u201creset\u201d are looking for a \u201cfresh face\u201d and to \u201chand the baton to a younger, more charismatic leader\u201d such as Koizumi, Kingston said.",
      "Koizumi, the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, is a former environment minister but gained more prominence recently as agriculture minister when he was able to rein in runaway prices of rice, a staple Japanese food.",
      "He would be Japan\u2019s youngest leader since Hirobumi Ito, who was just a few months younger than Koizumi when he became the country\u2019s first prime minister in 1885.",
      "Others prefer Takaichi because she was an ally of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader, whose wing of the LDP has been tarnished by corruption scandals.",
      "\u201cTheir view is that the LDP has to return to its DNA to be the right-wing conservative party, and that Takaichi is the one best positioned to sort of return to the glory of Abe,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Takaichi, who has a passionate hard-line conservative base among rank-and-file party members, says one of her role models is former British leader Margaret Thatcher.",
      "\u201cShe does project strength in the way that Margaret Thatcher projected strength, and she wants to be that kind of Iron Lady of Japan,\u201d said Jeffrey Hall, a special lecturer in Japanese studies at Kanda University of International Studies.",
      "But some LDP lawmakers consider Takaichi too far right, expressing concern that her nationalistic historical views could undermine relations with China, Japan\u2019s biggest trading partner.",
      "Moderate forces could unite behind another candidate to block Takaichi from winning, much as they did in last year\u2019s leadership race when she lost to Ishiba.",
      "One person who stands to benefit from that scenario is Hayashi, who like Koizumi is Ivy League-educated. Having served in almost every major cabinet post, including foreign minister, Hayashi \u201creally stands for experience and stability,\u201d Hall said.",
      "All of the candidates have talked tough on immigration, an increasingly sensitive issue in Japan, where tourists are coming in record numbers and foreign-born residents make up a growing proportion of the population as the government grapples with labor shortages.",
      "But Takaichi has taken the strongest stances, decrying the rudeness of foreign tourists and accusing them of abusing the famous deer in Nara.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s definitely appealing to the online conservatives who have very strong anti-foreign feelings,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Koizumi, Takaichi and Hayashi all have roughly the same policy toward the U.S., \u201cwhich is keeping the status quo,\u201d he said.",
      "At the moment, the U.S. relationship \u201cis a huge headache for Japan,\u201d and there are signs that the trade deal reached with President Donald Trump in July is \u201cunraveling,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "The impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs has been especially felt by Japan\u2019s crucial auto industry, including brands popular in the U.S. such as Nissan, Honda and Toyota.",
      "Last month the U.S. tariff on cars imported from Japan was lowered to 15% from 27.5%, the same rate the U.S. imposes on almost all Japanese goods under the deal, which has yet to be put in writing. But that is still considerably higher than the previous 2.5%.",
      "The tariffs were lowered in part because Japan pledged $550 billion in U.S. investment, though there are disagreements between Washington and Tokyo as to what form that investment will take and how each country will benefit.",
      "A major challenge for Japan\u2019s next leader will be implementing the trade agreement \u201cin a way that Trump will be satisfied,\u201d Hall said.",
      "\u201cWhoever becomes prime minister will continue Japan\u2019s foreign policy of flattering Trump and being as friendly as possible to Trump,\u201d he said, \u201cand not trying to have any kind of situation where they\u2019ll have open disagreement that could cause Trump to turn on Japan in any way.\u201d"
