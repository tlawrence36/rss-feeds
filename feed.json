I just know the class of 2025 is going to leap into the world and make it a better place, so if a few encouraging words from a frog can help, then I\u2019ll be there!\u201d",

      "The New York Giants will get another shot, too, after their uncomfortable debut.",
      "The NFL announced Wednesday at the spring owners meetings that the Bills, led by quarterback Josh Allen, were selected for the behind-the-scenes show on HBO that's in its 25th year. The five-part series will air on Tuesdays beginning on Aug. 5.",
      "The NFC East was also picked as the featured division on the in-season show, with filming of the Giants, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Commanders and defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles set to air in December. The league reached a new multi-year deal with HBO to continue to broadcast the show.",
      "The Bills, who hold their training camp off-site at St. John Fisher University outside of Rochester, New York, have entered their ninth year under head coach Sean McDermott. Still seeking their first championship, having not appeared in the Super Bowl since their fourth consecutive loss following the 1993 season, the Bills have won five straight AFC East titles and qualified for the playoffs in seven of the past eight years.",
      "Allen has been a driver of that success, entering his eighth season and coming off his first MVP award. The Bills return a majority of their offense from a team that finished second in the NFL in scoring in the 2024 season. They retooled their defense, starting with the addition in free agency of edge rusher Joey Bosa.",

      "The Chicago Bears were a first-time \u201cHard Knocks\u201d participant last season during training camp. HBO and co-producer NFL Films last year added the in-season show, filming around the four AFC North teams, and an offseason version that premiered \u2014 and perhaps ended \u2014 with a focus on the Giants.",

      "Schoen's informing Barkley that the Giants would not make him a contract offer or put the franchise tag on him and thus let him become a free agent became a must-see scene, along with a pained reaction from owner John Mara about losing a popular player.",

The quest takes them to far-flung places from Vienna to the pyramids, as they try to evade capture by the authorities and a shadowy operation intent on stopping the search.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been looking to watch this movie for years,\u201d Krasinski said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThis is the movie I pretended to be in when I was a kid. This is what got me into the business.\u201d",
      "The film also stars Domnhall Gleeson as the wealthy businessman funding the operation and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez as one of the protectors of the Fountain of Youth.",
      "\u201c Guy Ritchie gets to work with some of the best cast in the world,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez, who has now worked with him three times. \u201cThe biggest gift Guy has given me, besides the privilege of working with him, is working with them.\u201d",
      "Gleeson, a newcomer to the world of Ritchie, was pretty sure that it was going to be as enjoyable as it looked. And he got a vote of confidence from his director.",
      "\u201cGuy basically said, if you\u2019re not having fun, then this is not going to work and so the idea is to turn up and have fun,\u201d Gleeson said.",
      "There were a lot of things about \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d that piqued Portman\u2019s interest. The chance to work with Ritchie, Krasinski, and the rest of the cast, as well as the travel, but it also felt like something she could share with her own son and daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so rare to get to make a movie that has this scale and this scope of adventure that you can watch with your kids,\u201d Portman said. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for something that I can enjoy with my children.\u201d",
      "Her character, Charlotte, is an art historian who had an adventuresome childhood with her explorer father and brother Luke (Krasinski) but has since settled for a more stable life. We meet her amid a contentious divorce and custody battle over her 12-year-old son, and she\u2019s not exactly pleased when Luke steals a piece of art from her gallery and attempts to recruit her for the bigger mission. But soon, she\u2019s in scuba gear hunting down a lost Rembrandt in the wreckage of the RMS Lusitania.",
      "\u201cI think that something we search for as adults is how to regain that youthful spirit, how to hold onto that youthful energy and freedom and wildness, even when having to move into some adult responsibilities,\u201d said Portman, who, like her character is recently divorced. \u201cMaybe that can make you a better parent to have a little bit of that glint in your eye.\u201d",
      "She and Krasinski, working together for the first time, fell into the sibling dynamics easily.",
      "\u201cThese movies sort of live and die with the relationships,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cThe sibling thing really only works if you\u2019re having genuine fun with the person and it can come off screen. And I laughed with her every single day. She\u2019s so funny.\u201d",
      "Globe-trotting films aren\u2019t just travelogues for the audience, but their own sort of adventure for the cast and crew. This production earned their miles, skipping between the streets of Bangkok and Liverpool, the Austrian National Library in Vienna and Cairo to film at the great pyramids \u2014 where \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d became the first film of this scale to be granted the privilege to shoot action sequences there.",
      "\u201cIt was really a pinch me kind of moment to be like, oh, those are the pyramids and we\u2019re just hanging out here and walking into them and filming in them,\u201d Portman said.",
      "The big first was landing a Boeing Chinook CH47 helicopter in front of the Giza Plateau, and blowing up a jeep, all while the site remained open to tourists.",
      "\u201cWith any luck, we didn\u2019t blow it for Hollywood going back there for somebody else,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cBut if we did, at least we got to do it.\u201d",
      "Most of the big action moments \u201cinside\u201d the pyramids were saved for the safety of sets constructed at London\u2019s Leavesden Studio, where they also built the wreckage of the Lusitania in a water tank so big that it took two weeks to fill.",
      "\u201cFountain of Youth\u201d might seem like the type of movie that would be a natural fit for the big screen: A big budget, global adventure with major stars and sweeping vistas. While Krasinski champions movie theaters \u2014 at the time of the interview, he had a ticket to see \u201cSinners\u201d on IMAX the next day \u2014 he\u2019s also not feeling bittersweet that this one won\u2019t be playing at the multiplex. They all came into \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d knowing that it was a streaming-first endeavor.",
      "\u201cThis was always going to be a streaming movie, so I didn\u2019t really think about it in terms of ... Would people want to see it in theaters because it was just one of those things,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the new reality. There are definitely movies that are being made for streaming, and there are movies being made for theatrical.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIt all depends on what the filmmaker\u2019s intent was, what the studio\u2019s intent and I think as long as those rules are laid out clearly in the beginning, I\u2019m down for either one.\u201d",

      "Some of Spike Lee\u2019s most deeply felt passions \u2014 filmmaking and the New York Knicks \u2014 have collided at the Cannes Film Festival",
      "CANNES, France -- There\u2019s no sufficient way of explaining what it\u2019s like to be around Spike Lee, but his new film, \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d comes pretty close.",
      "The main character, played by Denzel Washington, is a Knicks fan who won\u2019t tolerate Celtics green in his house. A framed jersey of Jalen Brunson hangs in his Brooklyn apartment. There are movie references peppered throughout, of \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cThe Defiant Ones\u201d and \u201cThe Sweet Smell of Success.\u201d Yankee Stadium plays a pivotal setting. In one scene, Nicholas Turturro even yells directly into the camera: \u201cBoston sucks!\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not counting on Boston for box office!\u201d Lee says with a roaring cackle during an interview on a rooftop terrace in Cannes. \u201cWe might as well just write that off.\u201d",
      "Some of Lee\u2019s most deeply felt passions \u2014 filmmaking and the New York Knicks \u2014 have collided at the Cannes Film Festival. The premiere of \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d a reimagining of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s \u201cHigh to Low,\u201d came shortly before the Knicks begin their Eastern Conference finals matchup with the Indiana Pacers. Everywhere Lee has gone at the French Riviera festival, he\u2019s gone in blue and orange, including a pinstripe suit on the red carpet.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a film by a New Yorker who loves New York. But if you\u2019re not that, it doesn\u2019t detract from you enjoying it. You could be from \u2026 (Lee raises an eyebrow) \u2026 Indiana,\u201d Lee says before letting out a maniacal roar. \u201cWait a minute, we got to write off another market, too!\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d which A24 releases in theaters Aug. 22 before it streams on Apple TV+ on Sept. 5, was one of the most eventful premieres of Cannes. Washington was surprised with a Palme d\u2019Or. (\u201cThat wasn\u2019t acting,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know. Only three or four people knew.\u201d) Washington also got in an angry tangle with a photographer on the red carpet after his arm was grabbed.",
      "\u201cI wish I could\u2019ve told that photographer: \u2018Do not touch Denzel Washington or it\u2019s going to be a (expletive) problem,\u2019\u201d Lee says, laughing. \u201cThe headline, \u2018Man on Fire,\u2019 hoooooo! That was a good headline.\u201d",
      "Lee then picks up the digital recorder lying in front of him and says in a calm, professional voice: \u201cLadies and gentleman, this is a public service announcement. Do not put your hands on Mr. Denzel Washington. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. Thank you very much.\u201d",
      "But Lee, 68, has been more than happy to mix it up in Cannes. Before an interview, he taunted European journalists about his adopted Premier League team, Arsenal. At the press conference earlier in the day, he quoted Yoda for his primary message to film students: \u201cThere is no try, only do.\u201d Said Lee: \u201cAre you faking the funk or are you serious?\u201d",
      "Lee, who last debuted 2018\u2019s \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d in Cannes, tried to avoid saying anything too pointed about President Donald Trump. But couldn\u2019t help himself when asked about the moral decisions that mark \u201cHighest 2 Lowest.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how much we can talk about American values considering who is president,\u201d Lee told reporters.",
      "Lee was also on an apology tour at the festival. Four years ago, he was the head of the jury that awarded Julia Ducournau\u2019s \u201cTitane\u201d the Palme d\u2019Or. Only Lee, confused by the French-language ceremony, accidentally revealed the winner too soon. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a big one,\u201d said Lee, shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s going down in the history of Cannes.\u201d",
      "Just ahead of Lee's interview with The Associated Press, Ducournau, in Cannes with her \u201cTitane\u201d follow-up, \u201cAlpha,\u201d crossed the terrace to warmly embrace him. Recalling \u201cTitane,\u201d Lee said, \u201cA car impregnates a woman? You gotta win. You got my vote.\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d has been referred to as a remake of \u201cHigh and Low,\u201d but the degree to which it\u2019s a Spike Lee joint surprised festivalgoers. Washington plays David King, a wealthy record label executive whose son, along with the son of his friend and driver (Jeffrey Wright), is kidnapped for ransom. The kidnapper, played by A$AP Rocky, accidentally releases the wrong young man, leaving King with the decision to fork over the $17.5 million ransom for a young man who\u2019s not his son.",
      "The film is, in part, an ode to Kurosawa, whom Lee discovered as a film student at NYU. He credits his \u201cRashomon\u201d as the basis of \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d He met Kurosawa briefly once and has an autograph from the Japanese master signed with a paint brush. \u201cI got to shake his hand,\u201d says Lee.",
      "\u201cI grew up with my mother taking me to musicals,\" he says. \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d was one. If you listen to that great song by Rogers and Hammerstein with Julie Andrews singing it. What did Coltrane do to it? That\u2019s my analogy. What Coltrane did to \u2018My Favorite Things,\u2019 I think that\u2019s what we did with this.\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is less driven as a Kurosawa homage than by Lee\u2019s own obsessions: New York, music, the moral dilemmas of a Black entertainer and, yes, that Boston sucks. Above all, it\u2019s another Lee protagonist forced to do the right thing.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad you said that. I never thought about that connected to the decisions David King has to make,\u201d Lee says. \u201cBut what you see is the turmoil he\u2019s going through. He\u2019s going through it. A moral decision. Money on one hand, a life on the other.\u201d",
      "More than any recent film of his, you can sense Lee having fun. Back in New York. Back with Denzel. \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is Lee and Washington\u2019s fifth film together but the first in 19 years after 2006\u2019s \u201cInside Man.\u201d \"It\u2019s not like we had to catch up,\u201d Lee says. \u201cWe never lost a step.\u201d",
      "But Lee suspects \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d marks the end of their collaboration \u2014 one of cinema\u2019s greatest actor-director pairings, spanning \u201cMo\u2019 Better Blues,\u201d \u201cMalcolm X\u201d and \u201cHe Got Game.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what he says,\u201d Lee shrugs, citing Washington\u2019s retirement plans. \u201cAnd then the other day he\u2019s doing a film with the guy from \u2018City of God,\u2019 so. Denzel put that on himself: \u2018I\u2019m doing this thing and then I\u2019m retiring.\u2019 I\u2019ll believe it when he hangs it up.\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d reaches a blistering crescendo when King confronts Rocky\u2019s kidnapper in a basement recording studio. A kind of rap battle ensues that Lee gives much of the credit to Washington for. The actor improvised many of his lyrics, drawing heavily from Nas. (\"That was not scripted,\" says Lee. \u201cWe had to pay for that!\u201d)",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand. Denzel is such a powerful force. Not a derogatory term, but he\u2019s a beast. If you got somebody who don\u2019t got it, Denzel is going to slaughter them. SLAUGHTER,\" Lee explains. \u201cRocky is from Harlem, uptown. So I knew that he\u2019s not going to punk out. He\u2019s going to stand there, feet planted to the ground, as a heavyweight fight, blow to blow to blow.\u201d",
      "For Lee, the scene is a summation of what he loves about moviemaking and what delights him so much courtside at Madison Square Garden.",
      "\u201cPeople want to see a championship fight, and that\u2019s what it is. That is, in boxing terms, a slugfest,\u201d says Lee. \u201dThat makes great cinema. It makes great sports. You\u2019ve got conflict. It\u2019s a battle, and they\u2019re slugging it out.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Rapper and actor Kid Cudi is expected to testify at the Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs sex trafficking trial, taking the witness stand either Wednesday or Thursday to tell the jury about his brief relationship 14 years ago with Combs ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie.",
      "Cassie testified last week that Combs was enraged when she left him for a period of time in 2011 and began dating Cudi, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi. She said Combs left a large bruise on her back where he kicked her as she left his Los Angeles home for the last time that year.",
      "Prosecutors have contended in court filings that Combs was so upset that he arranged to have Cudi's convertible firebombed.",
      "A prosecutor said at the end of Tuesday's court session that Mescudi will be the third witness after a federal agent finishes testifying about what investigators found last year when they raided Combs\u2019 home in Florida.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he leveraged his fame and fortune to oversee a two-decade-long racketeering enterprise that controlled Cassie and others through threats and violence.",
      "His lawyers say evidence in the case reflects domestic violence, not anything amounting to a criminal racket or sex trafficking.",
      "Cassie testified last week that Combs arranged for her to meet Cudi several times in 2011 to work on music. She said her relationship with Cudi began late in the year and she got a burner phone so the two could communicate without Combs learning about it.",
      "Cassie said she and Combs had broken up at the time, although they still engaged in so-called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d that involved sexual performances with male escorts that Combs watched and sometimes participated in. It was during one of those \u201cfreak-offs\u201d that Combs picked up her regular phone and noticed communications that revealed Cassie was seeing Cudi, Cassie said.",
      "On Tuesday, Cassie's mother, Regina Ventura, testified that she received an email in December 2011 from Cassie saying that Combs was so angry about her relationship with Cudi that he planned to release sexually explicit videos of her and send someone to hurt Cassie and Cudi.",
      "Afterward, Regina Ventura said, she received a demand from Combs for $20,000. Scared for her daughter's safety, she went to the bank and sent Combs the money, only to have it returned by Combs days later.",
      "Cassie testified that Cudi came to visit her at her mother's Connecticut home around Christmas in 2011 and stayed for three or four days. She said she broke up with him.",
      "\u201cIt was just too much,\u201d she said. \u201cToo much danger, too much uncertainty of, like, what could happen if we continued to see each other.\u201d",
      "Cassie said she told her family she was going to Los Angeles after the holidays to \u201cget to work.\u201d But instead, she said, she traveled after New Year's to meet Combs in Arizona, where he had gone to visit a college with his son. They resumed their relationship.",
      "When Cassie and Combs were out of the country, Combs told her that Cudi's car would be blown up and Combs wanted Cudi's friends there to see it, Cassie said.",

      "Police have found a bust of Jim Morrison that was stolen nearly four decades ago from the Paris grave that has long been a place of pilgrimage for fans of the legendary Doors singer and poet",
      "PARIS -- Police have found a bust of Jim Morrison that was stolen nearly four decades ago from the Paris grave that has long been a place of pilgrimage for fans of the legendary Doors singer and poet.",
      "The bust taken in 1988 from P\u00e8re-Lachaise cemetery was found during an unrelated investigation conducted by a financial anti-corruption unit, Paris police said in an Instagram post Monday.",
      "There was no immediate word on whether the bust would be returned to the grave or what other investigation might take place.",
      "Morrison, the singer of Doors classics including \u201cLight My Fire,\u201d \u201cBreak on Through,\u201d and \u201cThe End,\u201d was found dead in a Paris bathtub at age 27 in 1971.",
      "He was buried at P\u00e8re-Lachaise, the city's cemetery that is the final resting place of scores of artists, writers and other cultural luminaries including Marcel Proust, Oscar Wilde, Gertrude Stein and Edith Piaf.",
      "The 300-pound bust made by Croatian sculptor Mladen Mikulin was added to the grave in 1981 for the 10th anniversary of the singer's death.",
      "\u201cI think it would be incredible if they put the bust back onto where it was and it would attract so many more people, but the cemetery wouldn\u2019t even be able to hold that many people,\u201d Paris tour guide Jade Jezzini told The Associated Press. \u201cThe amount of people who would rush in here just to see the bust to take pictures of it, it would be incredible.\u201d",
      "Known for his dark lyrics, wavy locks, leather pants, theatrical stage presence and mystical manner, Morrison has inspired generations of acolytes who congregate at his grave to reflect and sometimes to party, including a major gathering for the 50th anniversary of his death. The site has often been covered with flowers, poetic graffiti and liquor bottles left in tribute.",
      "He was undergoing a cultural renaissance when the bust was stolen in the late 1980s, which peaked with the 1991 Oliver Stone film \u201cThe Doors,\u201d in which Val Kilmer, who died in April, played Morrison.",
      "London artist Sam Burcher recently returned to the now more subdued grave site that she first visited 40 years ago when the sculpture of Morrison was still in place.",
      "\u201cThe bust was much smaller than all of these grand tombs. It was very modest, so I was quite surprised by that,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cBut the other thing was the atmosphere, it was buzzing. There were people partying, smoking, music, dancing, and then I brought strawberries and kind of gave them out to everyone ... it was just such an amazing experience.\u201d",
      "Morrison cofounded the Doors in Los Angeles in 1965 with Ray Manzarek. Robby Krieger and John Densmore joined soon after.",
      "The band and its frontman burned brightly but briefly, releasing albums including \u201cThe Doors\u201d \u201cStrange Days,\" and \u201cMorrison Hotel, whose The California site that gave that album its name and cover image was seriously damaged in a fire last year.",
      "After their final album, 1971\u2019s \u201cL.A. Woman,\u201d Morrison moved to Paris. His cause of death was listed as heart failure, though no autopsy was performed as none was required by law. Disputes and myths have surrounded the death and added to his mystique.",

      "The European Union plans to provide emergency funds to help keep Radio Free Europe afloat after the Trump administration stopped grants to the pro-democracy media outlet",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union agreed Tuesday to provide emergency funds to help keep Radio Free Europe afloat after the Trump administration stopped grants to the pro-democracy media outlet, accusing it of promoting a news agenda with a liberal bias.",
      "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty started broadcasting during the Cold War. Its programs are aired in 27 languages in 23 countries across Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East. Its lawyers have been fighting the administration in court.",
      "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc\u2019s foreign ministers had agreed to a 5.5-million-euro ($6.2 million) contract to \u201csupport the vital work of Radio Free Europe.\u201d The \u201cshort-term emergency funding\u201d is a \u201csafety net\u201d for independent journalism, she said.",
      "Kallas said the EU would not be able to fill the organization's funding gap around the world, but that it can help the broadcaster to \u201cwork and function in those countries that are in our neighborhood and that are very much dependent on news coming from outside.\u201d",
      "She said that she hoped the 27 EU member countries would also provide more funds to help Radio Free Europe longer term. Kallas said the bloc has been looking for \u201cstrategic areas\u201d where it can help as the United States cuts foreign aid.",
      "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\u2019s corporate headquarters are in Washington and its journalistic headquarters are based in the Czech Republic, which has been leading the EU drive to find funds.",
      "Last month, a U.S. federal judge ordered the Trump administration to restore $12 million that was appropriated by Congress. Lawyers for the service, which has been operating for 75 years, said it would be forced to shut down in June without the money.",
      "In March, Kallas recalled the influence that the network had on her as she was growing up in Estonia, which was part of the Soviet Union.",
      "\u201cComing from the other side of the Iron Curtain, actually it was (from) the radio that we got a lot of information,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, it has been a beacon of democracy, very valuable in this regard.\u201d",

    "summary": "Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump aren't new foes",
    "story": [
      "They have some similarities, Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump \u2014 guys in their 70s with homes in New Jersey and big constituencies among white American men middle-aged and older. And both, in very different respects, are the boss.",
      "That's about where it ends.",
      "The veteran rock star, long a political opponent of the president, stood up as one of Trump's most prominent cultural critics last week with a verbal takedown from a British stage.",
      "As is his nature, Trump is fighting back \u2014 hard. He calls Springsteen a \u201cdried out prune of a rocker\u201d and is even bringing Beyonc\u00e9 into the fray.",
      "On Monday, the president suggested Springsteen and Beyonc\u00e9 should be investigated to see if appearances they made on behalf of his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, last fall represented an illegal campaign donation.",
      "Opening a tour in Manchester, England, Springsteen told his audience last Thursday that \u201cthe America I love, the America I've written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cTonight we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring.\"",
      "Springsteen later made reference to an \u201cunfit president and a rogue government\u201d who have \u201cno concern or idea for what it means to be deeply American.\u201d",
      "The next morning, Trump called Springsteen highly overrated. \u201cNever liked him, never liked his music or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he's not a talented guy \u2014 just a pushy, obnoxious JERK,\u201d he wrote on social media.",
      "\u201cThis dried out prune of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back in the Country,\u201d he said.",
      "The next night, also in Manchester, Springsteen repeated his criticisms.",
      "\u201cIt's no surprise what Springsteen's political leanings are and have been for many decades,\u201d said veteran music writer Alan Light, author of the upcoming \u201cDon't Stop: Why We (Still) Love Fleetwood Mac's Rumours.\u201d \u201cHe's somebody who has been outspoken in his music and his actions.\u201d",
      "The Boss' statements this week showed he wasn't afraid to speak out \u201cat a time when so many people and institutions are just kind of rolling over,\u201d Light said.",
      "It's not the first time Springsteen has spoken out against Trump \u2014 or a Republican president.",
      "When former President Ronald Reagan referenced Springsteen's \u201cmessage of hope\u201d at a campaign stop during the height of the rocker's \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d popularity, Springsteen wondered if Reagan had listened to his music and its references to those left behind in the 1980s economy. He also has had an occasionally bumpy relationship with onetime Republican presidential candidate and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a fan of his music.",
      "Springsteen has campaigned for Trump's opponents, including Harris last fall. In 2020, he said that \u201ca good portion of our fine country, to my eye, has been thoroughly hypnotized, brainwashed by a con man from Queens.\u201d",
      "He knows the outer-borough reference still stung a man who built his own tower in Manhattan and ascended to the presidency. Trump often stays at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Springsteen grew up in New Jersey \u2014 you may have heard \u2014 and lives in Colts Neck, New Jersey, now.",
      "Trump doesn't hesitate to go after the biggest musical names that speak out against him, like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift. But the political risk may be less; their younger, more female audiences are less likely to intersect with Trump's core constituency.",
      "During his career, Springsteen has challenged his audience politically beyond presidential endorsements. The 1995 album \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d bluntly documented the lives of struggling immigrants \u2014 Mexican and Vietnamese among them. And his 2001 song \u201cAmerican Skin (41 Shots),\" criticized the shooting by New York City police officers of an unarmed Guinean immigrant named Amadou Diallo, angering some of the blue-collar segments of his fan base.",
      "Clearly, Springsteen has conservative fans and some who wish he'd steer clear of politics, Light said. Still, \u201c40 years later, it's hard to imagine what they think would happen\u201d with Trump, he said.",
      "While Trump made a point to reference Springsteen's criticism in an overseas show, he and the E Street Band haven't performed in the United States since before the 2024 election. His tour last year hit heavily on themes of mortality, less of politics. He has several European tour dates scheduled this year into July and hasn't announced any new American shows.",

      "McMahon, who has led both the network news division and news for the CBS-owned stations, said in an email message to staff that \u201cit's become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward. It's time to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.\u201d",

      "Trump has sued CBS, alleging it edited an interview with 2024 Democratic opponent Kamala Harris last fall to benefit her. CBS News has denied that. CBS' parent company, Paramount Global, is in talks to potentially settle Trump's lawsuit. At the same time, Paramount Global is seeking administration approval of a merger with Skydance Media.",
      "George Cheeks, co-CEO of Paramount and head of the CBS network, said McMahon's top deputies, CBS News president Tom Cibrowski and CBS Stations president Jennifer Mitchell, will report directly to him.",

Paramount began supervising \u201c60 Minutes\u201d stories in new ways, including asking former CBS News President Susan Zirinsky to look over some of its stories before they aired.",

Last week, Robert De Niro received one on the festival's opening night.

      "The premiere also had another surprise: Rihanna attended and walked the carpet afterward with partner A$AP Rocky. Earlier this month, she revealed at the Met Gala that she was pregnant with their third child.",
      "While the festival's photo calls usually happen the day after a film's premiere, Cannes hosted one for \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d earlier Monday so Washington could attend. The actor, playfully posing with Lee and co-star A$AP Rocky, showed no signs of jet lag and left once the screening began.",

      "That Washington would be able to make the trip had been a sticking point for Cannes. When the festival first announced its lineup last month, \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d wasn't included. Within hours, however, Lee himself announced the film was heading to Cannes. Representatives for the festival said they had been waiting for confirmation that Washington would attend to walk the red carpet.",

      "However, the BBC said Monday in a statement that Lineker will step down entirely from the corporation after the final \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d episode next weekend in the wake of his decision to share a post from the group, Palestine Lobby, illustrated with a picture of a rat, titled: \u201cZionism explained in two minutes.\u201d",

      "Lineker had already apologized for his conduct, saying last week he reposted material which he subsequently learned contained \u201coffensive references,\u201d adding that he withdrew the post as soon as he became aware of the issue and \u201cwould never knowingly share anything antisemitic.\u201d",
      "Before Lineker\u2019s apology, Davie said the corporation needed people to be the \u201cexemplars of BBC values and follow our social media policies\u201d and that \u201cwhen someone makes a mistake, it costs us.\u201d",
      "\u201cFootball has been at the heart of my life for as long as I can remember \u2014 both on the pitch and in the studio,\u201d Lineker said in the BBC statement. \u201cI care deeply about the game, and about the work I\u2019ve done with the BBC over many years. As I\u2019ve said, I would never consciously repost anything antisemitic \u2014 it goes against everything I stand for.",
      "\u201cHowever, I recognize the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.\u201d",

      "Lineker\u2019s openness to reflect his political views on social media have caused growing friction with the BBC regarding its impartiality guidelines.",
      "He was temporarily suspended from the corporation in March 2023 over comments he made criticizing the then-Conservative government\u2019s new asylum policy. It led to the BBC\u2019s rules on social media posts being rewritten to say presenters of high-profile programs outside news had a \u201cresponsibility to respect the BBC\u2019s impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC.\u201d",

The documentary was pulled after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "Last week, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph newspaper that came a day after his initial apology, Lineker spoke out about the conduct of Israel in the war against Hamas in Gaza, saying those who stayed silent about it were \u201calmost complicit.\u201d",

He has been the main presenter of BBC\u2019s \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d since 1999 and used his status as a freelancer to work for other broadcasters such as NBC, Al Jazeera and BT Sport.",

      "President Donald Trump promised a review within 100 days that would analyze the ramifications that U.S. lifestyle \u2014 from the medications prescribed for children to the food served on their school lunch trays \u2014 has on childhood diseases like obesity, depression or attention deficit disorder. The report, led by a so-called \u201cMAHA Commission,\u201d is expected to be released on Thursday.",
      "Farmers and Republicans are nervous about what the report might say about glyphosate, the ingredient commonly used in pesticides sprayed on crops. Kennedy has denied the report will be unfavorable to farmers.",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley warned that farmers have reached out to him, upset they have not been able to provide input on the MAHA report ahead of its release.",
      "\u201cI hope there is nothing in the MAHA report that jeopardizes the food supply or the livelihood of farmers,\u201d Grassley said.",
      "Last month, a group of 79 Republicans \u2014 including several senators who represent farming states \u2014 echoed similar concerns about the report saying in a letter to Kennedy that without the products agricultural \u201cyields and quantity are negatively impacted.\u201d",
      "Glyphosate has been available for about 50 years and some farmers say it remains essential for controlling weeds without excessive tilling, helping to conserve both soil and fuel.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why we still use: It works,\u201d said Blake Hurst, a Missouri farmer who is past president of the Missouri Farm Bureau.",
      "Kennedy, though, has built a sizable following over many decades, in part, because of the lawsuits he's waged against corporations, including the company that produced weedkiller Roundup. The World Health Organization has labeled that product's key ingredient, glyphosate, as a probable carcinogen for humans.",
      "On Wednesday a large group of his supporters sent Kennedy a letter calling on the commission to \u201chold the chemical industry\u201d accountable in the report, noting that pressure is mounting.",
      "\u201cEvidence is piling up and the risks from pesticide exposure are undeniable,\u201d the letter, signed by 360 self-proclaimed MAHA supporters that include farmers, former Kennedy campaign staffers and those who worked with him at his anti-vaccine nonprofit.",
      "Dave Murphy, a fundraiser for Kennedy's failed presidential bid, said that he submitted studies and comments on pesticides to Trump administration officials for inclusion in the MAHA report but said that there's \u201ca lot of pressure within Washington\u201d over what the final report says on the issue.",
      "During a senate hearing on Wednesday, Kennedy rebutted concerns from Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith that the report would \u201cunfairly\u201d target farmers.",
      "\u201cThere's not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer,\u201d Kennedy said of his report. \u201cWe are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\u201d",
      "Kennedy was appearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee to discuss the White House's proposed budget, which would give a $500 million boost for Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative. That same proposal also makes deep cuts, including to infectious disease prevention, maternal health and medical research programs.",
      "In February, Trump signed an executive order establishing a Make America Healthy Again Commission tasked with examining the \u201cthreat\u201d that prescription drugs, chemicals and certain food ingredients pose to children.",
      "That review was supposed to be led by several members of the president's cabinet, including Kennedy, Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Kennedy, who has pledged \u201cradical transparency\u201d since taking over the nation's health department, never convened a public meeting of the commission. The White House only released brief, edited clips from a single, closed-door meeting of the commission held in March.",

      "Overall, the U.S. has seen more than 1,000 measles cases across 30 states since the beginning of the year, and 11 states with outbreaks \u2014 defined as three or more related cases. The largest outbreak in the U.S. has been in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. There are also large outbreaks in Mexico and Canada.",
      "It's a respiratory disease caused by one of the world\u2019s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It most commonly affects kids.",
      "\u201cOn average, one infected person may infect about 15 other people,\u201d said Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. \u201cThere\u2019s only a few viruses that even come close to that.\u201d",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",
      "People who have had measles once can\u2019t get it again, health officials say.",
      "It usually doesn\u2019t kill people, but it can.",
      "Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven\u2019t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.",
      "Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis \u2014 which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.",
      "\u201cChildren develop the most severe illness,\" said Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. \"The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.\u201d",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "\u201cBefore a vaccine was developed in the 1960s, everybody got\u201d measles, Weaver said. There is \u201cgreat data\u201d on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, he said, because it's been around for decades.",
      "\u201cAny of these outbreaks we\u2019re seeing can easily be prevented by increasing the rate of vaccination in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can maintain 95% of people vaccinated, we\u2019re not going to see this happening in the future. And we\u2019ve slipped well below that level in many parts of the country.\u201d",
      "Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "Not usually. People who are vaccinated are considered protected against measles for their lifetime.",
      "Health care providers can test for antibodies and give boosters if needed.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\u201d",
      "Weaver said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.",

      "Emotional well-being",
      "NEW YORK -- Marian Rivman is pushing 80. Harriet Luria is a proud 83. In this trio, Carol Leister is the baby at 62. Together, they have decades of experience with yoga. Only now, it involves a chair.",
      "Chair yoga adapts traditional yoga poses for older people and others with physical challenges, but the three devotees said after a recent class that doesn't mean it's not a quality workout. As older adults have become more active, chair yoga has grown in popularity.",
      "\u201cYou're stretching your whole body,\u201d Rivman offered. \u201cWhat you can do in the chair is a little bit more forgiving on the knees and on the hips. So as you age, it allows you to get into positions that you were doing before without hurting yourself.\u201d",
      "Sitting down to exercise, or standing while holding onto a chair to perform some poses, may not sound like a workout, but Rivman, Luria, Leister and practitioners everywhere see a world of benefits.",
      "\u201cI took it up because I have osteoporosis and the chair yoga is much easier,\u201d Luria said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry as much about falling and breaking anything. It's not as difficult as I thought it would be, but it\u2019s not easy. And you really do use your muscles. It\u2019s an excellent workout.\u201d",
      "Chair yoga is clearly marketed to older women, who made up the class where the three yoga friends got together at the Marlene Meyerson JCC on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. But the practice also has a lot to offer others, said their instructor, Whitney Chapman.",
      "Desk workers can squeeze in 15 minutes of chair yoga, for instance. Many companies offer it as a way to cut down on stress and improve overall health. And people recovering from surgery or injuries may not be ready to get down on a yoga mat, but they can stretch in a chair.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known these ladies probably 18 to 20 years. And the very first time in a yoga class that I brought in the chair, all of my students said I don\u2019t want geriatric yoga. I\u2019m not an old person,\u201d Chapman said.",
      "\u201cAnd then they saw that having a chair is just as good as a yoga strap, a yoga block. It\u2019s another prop that\u2019s going to help you do what you want to do. So it\u2019s not necessarily because you\u2019re older, but that it can be helpful. And it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re geriatric just because you\u2019re sitting in a chair.\u201d",
      "The benefits are many, Chapman said: improved flexibility, strength, balance. And there's the overall emotional well-being that yoga practitioners in general report. It's particularly useful for people with mobility issues or chronic ailments like arthritis or back pain. Chapman also teaches yoga to cancer and Parkinson's disease patients.",
      "In addition to restorative and other benefits, the practice of chair yoga can help improve posture for people of all ages and abilities, and help older people prevent falls.",
      "Leister recently retired.",
      "\u201cI've been looking for all different kinds of exercises to do and this is one of them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the one that I could see doing for the rest of my life, where some that are a little more strenuous I may not be able to do in the future.\u201d",
      "Traditional yoga originated more than 5,000 years ago in India. Many of the poses used today are also that old. It can be as much spiritual as physical, and that also goes for its chair descendant. The precise movements are tied to deliberate, cleansing breathwork.",
      "Rivman has been doing yoga for about 50 years.",
      "\u201cOnce you start and you get what it does for your body, you don\u2019t want to give it up. And if there\u2019s a way that you can keep doing it and keep doing it safely, that\u2019s a choice you\u2019re going to make,\u201d she said.",
      "The practice of yoga, including chair yoga, has been on the rise in the U.S. over the last 20 years. In 2022, the percentage of adults age 18 and older who practiced yoga in the past 12 months was 16.9%, with percentages highest among women ages 18\u201344, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Women are more than twice as likely as men to practice yoga, the data showed. The percentage of adults who practiced yoga to treat or manage pain decreased with increasing family income.",
      "The CDC, didn't break out chair yoga for analysis but recommends that adults 65 and older focus on activities that improve balance and strength. That, the health agency said, can be achieved through various exercises, including chair yoga.",
      "Chapman and her students have thoughts on why more men don\u2019t practice yoga. Traditionally, Chapman said, the practice was reserved for men, but as yoga became more westernized, women took over.",
      "\u201cWomen tend to be more group-oriented. I would love to see more men in class. I do have a few. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re intimidated, but you know, it\u2019s a great way to meet women if everybody\u2019s single,\u201d Chapman said with a chuckle.",
      "Luria theorizes that fewer men are drawn to yoga because it's not a competitive sport.",
      "\u201cYou're really working at your own level,\u201d she said. \u201cTake out the competition and it's not their thing.\u201d",
      "These chair yoga practitioners have lots of advice. Rivman summed it up best: \u201cGet into a chair and do some yoga. You don't have to stand on your head, but you have to move. You're never too old to start.\"",

      "Some studies have shown that children with autism are more at risk of drowning",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- In an airy indoor pool with fish cutouts on the walls, a group of small children bobbed, floated and tentatively flutter-kicked.",
      "It was what it looked like, a starter swimming class. But here, instructors worked one-on-one or even two to a child. Some held cards to help kids communicate with teachers by pointing instead of speaking. No one blew whistles.",
      "All the students in the class at the Small Fish Big Fish swim school had autism, a developmental disorder linked to a higher-than-average danger of drowning.",
      "It has long worried autism experts and parents, but recent data make the stakes starkly clear. In Florida, a state where water abounds from beaches to backyards, over 100 children who had autism or were being evaluated for it have drowned since the start of 2021, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County.",
      "The numbers highlight an oft-overlooked dilemma: Autism makes swimming instruction all the more necessary but, often, all the more difficult to get.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s life-changing for kids with autism,\u201d said Lovely Chrisostome, who was terrified this winter when her 6-year-old son slipped out of the family\u2019s home and wandered through their lake-dotted neighborhood. She\u2019d once tried enrolling him in swim classes at a public pool, but he had refused to go in.",
      "But her son was in the pool at the autism-specific class at Small Fish Big Fish. An instructor helped him float on his back. When he started showing discomfort \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like to get his head wet \u2013 she eased him onto his side, where he seemed content.",
      "Autism affects an estimated 1 in 31 U.S. children. Their water safety has gotten occasional public attention after tragedies such as the death of Avonte Oquendo, an autistic teen who was found in a New York river in 2014 after disappearing from his school.",
      "While academic research on the issue is limited, a pair of 2017 studies documented a substantially heightened risk of drowning among people with autism spectrum disorder. The risk stems in large part from their propensity to wander off and to underappreciate perils, according to co-author Dr. Guohua Li and other experts.",
      "One Florida 5-year-old apparently wriggled out a doggy door and got into his grandmother\u2019s pool. Another died in a canal after slipping through a fence hole at a playground specifically intended for autistic kids. A 6-year-old drowned in a lake after she evidently climbed a bookshelf positioned to block an apartment door, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County. It\u2019s now building a national database.",
      "\u201cSwimming lessons should be a first-line treatment for autism,\u201d said Li, a Columbia University epidemiology professor who isn't involved in the council's research. Li himself has a son with the condition.",
      "Some autistic people excel at swimming, such as the New Jersey teens featured in the 2017 documentary \u201cSwim Team.\" Many others are adept in water. Even some profoundly autistic children can master survival basics with as little as eight hours of aquatic occupational therapy, said Michele Alaniz, a practitioner who published research based on her work at Casa Colina Hospital and Centers for Healthcare in Pomona, California.",
      "But some families don't sign up for classes, fearing they'll overwhelm children who might have symptoms ranging from not speaking to repeatedly banging their heads to becoming distressed by noise. Other youngsters get kicked out of programs that can\u2019t handle them. Private sessions can be helpful, but pricey.",
      "\u201cHaving somebody that understands a child on the spectrum \u2014 what the special needs are, how to communicate with a child, how to also mitigate a meltdown, particularly in a pool \u2014 is so vital,\u201d says Lindsey Corey. She said her 5-year-old son didn't absorb much from a general swim class or from private lessons at home in Lake Worth, Florida, but made progress in a program with instructors trained by the Autism Society.",
      "As drowning risks have come into focus, advocates are trying to make swimming lessons more accessible. An Australian charity called Autism Swim says 1,400 swim teachers, physical therapists and others worldwide have taken its online training since 2016.",
      "In Florida, the Children's Services Council's of Palm Beach County provided $17,000 last year for the Autism Society of America to train dozens of instructors, said Jon Burstein, who did the council's research on autism and drowning. The organization paid another $13,500 for the classes at Small Fish Big Fish.",
      "The dozen students, ranging from about 4 to 8, attend a nearby autism-specific charter school. They initially were reluctant to get in the bus, let alone in the water, organizers said. But on an early April afternoon, they readily headed for the shallow pool.",
      "One girl floated on a foam board with her face in the water, an exercise in breath control. Another girl grinned as she propelled herself on a foam noodle.",
      "\u201cShe's fearless to the point it's scary because she'll just jump into a pool, whether she can swim or not,\u201d her mother, Jana D'Agostino, said later. \u201cSo this is really important. It's saving their lives.\u201d",
      "Across the pool, a boy reluctantly eased himself from the steps into the water, where Small Fish founder Melissa Taylor waited for him. \u201cMy turn!\u201d she said, and dunked her head in the water.",
      "He did likewise, then retreated to the steps. Taylor continued working with him, but he soon backed out of the pool and began making hand movements. Realizing he'd had enough, instructors let him towel off.",
      "\u201cIt's taking a lot to get him to trust us,\u201d explained Taylor. But she also recognizes when repetitive splashing and movement signal excitement, not alarm.",
      "The session continued for the other children, including Chrisostome's son, who emerged with a smile.",
      "He has learned a lot in the lessons, but what struck her most?",
      "\u201cThe happiness that he has.\"",

      "Federal health officials will no longer routinely approve annual COVID-19 shots for younger adults and children who are healthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Annual COVID-19 shots for healthy younger adults and children will no longer be routinely approved under a major new policy shift unveiled Tuesday by the Trump administration.",
      "Top officials for the Food and Drug Administration laid out new requirements for access to yearly COVID shots, saying they'd continue to use a streamlined approach that would continue offering them to adults 65 and older as well as children and younger adults with at least one health problem that puts them at higher risk.",
      "But the FDA framework urges companies to conduct large, lengthy studies before tweaked vaccines can be approved for healthier people. In a framework published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, agency officials said the approach still could keep annual vaccinations available for between 100 million and 200 million people.",
      "The upcoming changes raise questions for people who may still want a fall COVID-19 shot but don't clearly fit into one of the categories.",
      "\u201cIs the pharmacist going to determine if you're in a high-risk group?\u201d asked Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cThe only thing that can come of this will make vaccines less insurable and less available.\u201d",
      "The framework is the culmination of a series of recent stepsscrutinizing the use of COVID shots and raising major questions about the broader availability of vaccines under President Donald Trump. It was released two days ahead of the first meeting of FDA\u2019s outside vaccine experts under the Trump administration.",
      "Last week the FDA granted full approval of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine but with major restrictions on who can get it \u2014 and Tuesday's guidance mirrors those restrictions. The approval came after Trump appointees overruled FDA scientists' earlier plans to approve the shot without restrictions.",
      "Pfizer and Moderna, which make the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines, didn't immediately comment.",
      "For years, federal health officials have told most Americans to expect annual updates to COVID-19 vaccines, similar to the annual flu shot. Just like with flu vaccines, until now the FDA has approved updated COVID shots when manufacturers provide evidence that they spark just as much immune protection as the previous year's version.",
      "But FDA's new guidance appears to be the end of that approach under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has filled the FDA and other health agencies with outspoken critics of the government\u2019s handling of COVID shots, particularly their recommendation for young, healthy adults and children. Under federal procedures, the FDA releases new guidance in draft form and allows the public to comment before finalizing its plans. The publication of Tuesday's policy in a medical journal is highly unusual and could run afoul of federal procedures, according to FDA experts.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s update, written by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and FDA vaccine chief Vinay Prasad, criticized the U.S.\u2019s \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach and states that the U.S. has been \u201cthe most aggressive\u201d in recommending COVID boosters, when compared with European countries.",
      "\u201cWe simply don\u2019t know whether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had Covid-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a Covid-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Makary and Prasad recommended that companies study people not deemed at high risk for six months, randomly assigning them to get a vaccine or a placebo and tracking outcomes with special attention to severe disease, hospitalization or death.",
      "Experts say there are legitimate questions about how much everyone still benefits from yearly COVID vaccination or whether they should be recommended for people at increased risk.",
      "An influential panel of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to debate which vaccines should be recommended to which groups.",
      "The FDA's announcement appears to usurp that advisory panel's job, Offit said. He added that CDC studies have made clear that booster doses do offer protection against mild to moderate illness for four to six months after the shot even in healthy people.",

      "The creator of the Dilbert comic strip, which was canceled by most newspapers two years ago over the creator\u2019s racist comments, said Monday that he has been diagnosed with the same aggressive prostate cancer as former President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cI have the same cancer that Joe Biden has,\u201d Scott Adams said Monday during an episode of his YouTube show, \u201cReal Coffee with Scott Adams. \u201cSo, I also have prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones.\u201d",
      "He made the announcement after extending his \u201crespect and compassion and sympathy\u201d for Biden and his family. Biden announced his diagnosis on Sunday and said he and his family were reviewing treatment options with his doctors.",
      "Adams, 67, said he's always in pain, uses a walker to get around and that he expects to die sometime this summer.",
      "\u201cIt's basically intolerable,\u201d he said of the pain.",
      "Adams said he has had time to process his diagnosis and that it has given him time to say goodbyes, get his affairs in order and do all the things he needed to do.",
      "Dilbert the comic strip first appeared in 1989, poking fun at office culture. It ran for decades in numerous newspapers but disappeared with lightning speed in 2023 following racist remarks by Adams.",
      "On his YouTube show at the time, among other things, he described Black people as a \u201chate group\u201d and said he would no longer \u201chelp Black Americans.\u201d",
      "He later said he was being hyperbolic, yet continued to defend his stance.",
      "Various media publishers across the U.S. denounced the comments as racist, hateful and discriminatory while saying they would no longer provide a platform for his work.",
      "The editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, which dumped \u201cDilbert\u201d in 2022, said the comic strip \u201cwent from being hilarious to being hurtful and mean.\u201d",

      "The move, announced Monday by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, would affect about 152,000 people in Nebraska enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps families pay for groceries.",
      "\u201cThere's absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks,\u201d Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said in a statement. \u201cSNAP is about helping families in need get healthy food into their diets, but there's nothing nutritious about the junk we're removing with today's waiver.\u201d",
      "Six other states \u2014 Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Indiana, Iowa and West Virginia \u2014 have also submitted requests for waivers banning certain foods and drinks or, in some cases, expanding access to hot foods for participants, according to the USDA.",

      "Rollins called Monday's move \u201ca historic step to Make America Healthy again.\u201d",
      "Details of Nebraska's waiver, which takes effect Jan. 1, weren't immediately available. Anti-hunger advocates criticized it, saying it adds costs, boosts administrative burdens and increases stigma for people already facing food insecurity.",
      "The waiver \u201cignores decades of evidence showing that incentive-based approaches \u2014 not punitive restrictions \u2014 are the most effective, dignified path to improving nutrition and reducing hunger,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino, a deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit advocacy group.",

      "Until now, USDA rejected the waivers, saying there were no clear standards to define certain foods as good or bad. In addition, the agency had said restrictions would be difficult to implement, complicated and costly, and would not necessarily change recipients' food purchases or reduce health problems such as obesity.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Investigators on Monday were combing through the writings of a 25-year-old man believed responsible for an explosion that ripped through a Southern California fertility clinic over the weekend.",
      "The FBI identified Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the apparent car bomb detonation Saturday that damaged the American Reproductive Centers building in Palm Springs, east of Los Angeles. Bartkus died in the explosion. None of the facility's embryos were damaged.",
      "Authorities called the attack terrorism and said Bartkus left behind nihilistic writings that indicated views against procreation, an idea known as anti-natalism.",
      "Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The blast gutted the clinic and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Passersby described a loud boom, with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along sidewalks of the upscale desert city.",
      "Bartkus' body was found near a charred vehicle.",
      "Akil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles field office, called it possibly the \u201clargest bombing scene that we\u2019ve had in Southern California.\u201d",
      "The facility was closed for the day.",
      "\u201cThis was a targeted attack against the IVF facility,\u201d Davis said Sunday. \u201cMake no mistake: We are treating this, as I said yesterday, as an intentional act of terrorism.\u201d",
      "Authorities executed a search warrant in Bartkus' hometown of Twentynine Palms, a city of 28,000 residents northeast of Palm Springs with a large U.S. Marine Corps base.",
      "Bartkus tried to livestream the explosion, but the attempt failed, the FBI said.",
      "Authorities haven't shared specifics about the explosives used to make the bomb and where Bartkus may have obtained them.",
      "Scott Sweetow, a retired ATF explosives expert, said the amount of damage caused indicated that the suspect used a \u201chigh explosive\u201d similar to dynamite and TNT rather than a \u201clow explosive\u201d like gun powder.",
      "Those types of explosives are normally difficult for civilians to access, but increasingly people are finding ways to concoct explosives at home, he said.",
      "\u201cOnce you know the chemistry involved, it\u2019s pretty easy to get stuff,\u201d Sweetow said. \u201cThe ingredients you could get at a grocery store.\u201d",
      "The images of the aftermath also showed that the explosion appeared to blow from the street straight through the building and to the parking lot on the other side, something that could have been intentional or pure luck, Sweetow said. A part of the car was also blown through the building and landed in the back by a dumpster.",
      "Authorities are working to learn more about Bartkus\u2019 motives. They haven\u2019t said if he intended to kill himself in the attack or why he chose the specific facility.",
      "His writings communicated \u201cnihilistic ideations\u201d that were still being examined to determine his state of mind, said U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in the area. In general, nihilism suggests that life is meaningless.",
      "He appeared to hold anti-natalist views, which include a belief that it is morally wrong for people to bring children into the world. The clinic he attacked provides services to help people get pregnant, including in vitro fertilization and fertility evaluations.",
      "Some people with extreme anti-procreation views have a lack of purpose and a bleak feeling about their own lives \u201cand they diagnose society as suffering in a similar way that they are,\u201d said Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama. \u201cEssentially, they feel like we're all doomed, that it's all hopeless.\u201d",
      "That hopelessness is a way for attackers to rationalize their violent actions, Lankford said Monday.",

      "The announcement that Joe Biden has prostate cancer is the latest example of how the final chapters of his political career have been shaped by the disease",
      "WASHINGTON -- In Joe Biden\u2019s family, there\u2019s a saying that the three worst words anyone can hear are \u201cyou have cancer.\u201d",
      "One decade ago, his son Beau died from a brain tumor. Several years later, his wife Jill had two cancerous lesions removed in her own brush with the disease.",
      "Now it is the former president\u2019s turn. Biden\u2019s office disclosed his prostate cancer diagnosis over the weekend, saying it has already spread to his bones.",
      "Although the cancer can possibly be controlled with treatment, it is no longer curable. The announcement is a bitter revelation that a disease that has brought so much tragedy to Biden\u2019s life could be what ends it.",
      "\u201cCancer touches us all,\u201d Biden wrote on social media. \u201cLike so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.\u201d",
      "Even before the diagnosis, Biden's post-presidency was shadowed by questions about his health and whether he should have run for reelection. As questions about his fitness for office mounted, he abandoned the campaign and Donald Trump retook the presidency by defeating Kamala Harris. As the 82-year-old Biden works to safeguard his damaged political legacy, he'll also be fighting a disease that shaped the final chapters of his decades-long career.",
      "Biden was serving as Barack Obama's vice president when Beau died in 2015. He decided not to seek the Democratic nomination the following year, which helped clear a path for Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016.",
      "Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama adviser, said Biden wanted to \u201cchannel his grief into action and figure out how we can do better\u201d on treating cancer to \"make sure that other people didn\u2019t have to go through what he went through.\u201d",
      "The effort was formalized as a White House task force, with Biden in charge. After a few years out of office, Biden re-entered politics to campaign against Trump in 2020. The heartache from Beau's death was never far from the surface though. His eldest son had been Delaware's attorney general and often viewed as Biden's political successor.",
      "\u201cBeau should be the one running for president, not me,\u201d Biden said, a thought he echoed on many occasions.",
      "He made fighting cancer a focus for his presidency, resurrecting a \u201cmoonshot\u201d initiative to increase funding for research and improve treatment. He unveiled the initiative at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in 2022, echoing the Democratic icon's famous speech declaring that \u201cwe will go to the moon\u201d six decades earlier.",
      "\"Beating cancer is something we can do together,\" Biden said.",
      "By this point, he had already signed legislation known as the PACT Act to expand healthcare benefits for veterans. The law guarantees treatment for chronic illnesses blamed on burn pits, which were used to dispose of chemicals, tires, plastics, medical equipment and human waste on military bases.",
      "Biden left no doubt that he believed Beau\u2019s death resulted from his service with the National Guard in Iraq.",
      "\u201cWhen they came home, many of the fittest and best warriors that we sent to war were not the same \u2014 headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cMy son Beau was one of them.\u201d",
      "Denis McDonough, who led the Veterans Affairs Department under Biden, said the president didn't talk about Beau's death during policy discussions. But he said it was clear that Biden \u201cknew the experience that other families were having, and he was going to be damn sure that we weren\u2019t going to miss an opportunity to address that.\u201d",
      "McDonough recalled that Biden wanted the new law to take effect as quickly as possible.",
      "\u201cHe had an option to stretch it out,\" he said. \"He said no way.\u201d",
      "The following year, first lady Jill Biden had two cancerous lesions removed, one above her right eye and the other on her chest. They were both basal cell carcinoma.",
      "Learning of the diagnosis \u201cwas a little harder than I thought,\u201d she told The Associated Press during a trip to Africa.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m lucky,\" she said. \"Believe me, I am so lucky that they caught it, they removed it, and I\u2019m healthy.\u201d",
      "Biden's cancer diagnosis is not the first time that he's faced his own mortality.",
      "Months after ending his first presidential campaign in 1988, he collapsed in a New York hotel room. In his memoir \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d he described \u201clightning flashing inside my head, a powerful electrical surge \u2014 and then a rip of pain like I\u2019d never felt before.\u201d",
      "He had suffered a brain aneurysm that required surgery. Biden wrote that \u201cI had no real fear of dying. I\u2019d long since accepted the fact that life\u2019s guarantees don\u2019t include a fair shake.\u201d",
      "McDonough imagined that Biden would feel similarly about his current situation.",

      "GENEVA -- The World Health Organization on Monday opened its annual meeting of government ministers and other top envoys facing one of the most serious crises of its 77-year history in the wake of Trump administration funding cuts and plans to withdraw the United States.",
      "The U.N. health agency this year has seen a plunge in its ability to carry out its sweeping mandate to do everything from recommend reductions in sugar levels in soft drinks to head the global response to pandemics like COVID-19 or outbreaks like polio or Ebola.",
      "Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been grappling with a response to the U.S. cuts as well as reduced outlays from other traditional Western donors who are putting more money toward defense and less toward humanitarian aid.",

      "\u201cThe WHO faces an existential crisis that goes well beyond a budget gap to the question of whether this sort of multilateralism can succeed in addressing global health in this new era of nationalism and misinformation,\u201d he said.",

      "On tap for the nine-day World Health Assembly are two major advances that are aimed to buttress WHO\u2019s financial strength and bolster the world\u2019s ability to cope with pandemics in the future.",
      "Member countries are expected to agree to raise annual dues, known as \u201cassessed contributions,\u201d by 20% to support WHO finances and reduce dependency on governments\u2019 voluntary contributions \u2014 which change each year and make up over half of the budget.",
      "They are also expected to agree to a hard-wrought \u201c pandemic treaty \u201d that was born of a desire to avoid any replay of the patchy, unequal response to COVID-19 when the next \u2014 and inevitable, most experts say \u2014 pandemic hits.",
      "Among other things, the treaty would guarantee that countries that share critical samples of viruses will receive any resulting tests, medicines and vaccines and give WHO up to 20% of such products to make sure poorer countries can have access to them.",
      "Tedros calls the treaty \u201ctruly historic\u201d and said it \u201ccan make the world safer\u201d by boosting collaboration to prepare for, prevent and respond to pandemics.",
      "The treaty\u2019s effectiveness will face doubts when the U.S. \u2014 which poured billions into speedy work by pharmaceutical companies to develop COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 is sitting out, and because countries face no penalties if they ignore it, a common issue in international law.",
      "Kavanagh said passage of the treaty \u201ccould be a significant victory \u2014 evidence that the U.S. government may no longer be indispensable in global health\u201d and could offer an opportunity for developing nations in the \u201cglobal South\u201d over the longer term.",
      "In the run-up to the assembly, WHO has been cleaning house and cutting costs. Its management has presented a budget for the next two years at just under $4.3 billion, which is 22% less than originally planned \u2014 largely in response to Western funding cuts.",
      "At a meeting on its budget last week, Tedros \u2014 a former Ethiopian health and foreign minister \u2013 announced a shake-up of top management that included the exit of key adviser Dr. Michael Ryan from the job as emergencies chief.",

      "MILWAUKEE -- Feel like you can't focus? Like you'll never finish a book again? Like the only way to keep your mind and hands busy is to scroll on social media for hours?",
      "You're far from alone. One body of decades-long research found the average person's attention span for a single screen is 47 seconds, down from 2.5 minutes in 2004. The 24/7 news cycle, uncertainty about the state of the world and countless hours of screen time don\u2019t help, experts say.",
      "\u201cWhen my patients talk to me about this stuff there is often a feeling of helplessness or powerlessness,\u201d said Dr. Michael Ziffra, a psychiatrist at Northwestern Medicine. \u201cBut you can change these behaviors. You can improve your attention span.\u201d",
      "Here are ways to start that process. As you read, challenge yourself to set a 2.5 minute timer and stay on this article without looking at another device or clicking away.",
      "A shifting attention is an evolutionary feature, not a bug. Our brains are hardwired to quickly filter information and hone in on potential threats or changes in what's happening around us.",
      "What's grabbing our attentions has changed. For our ancestors, it might have been a rustle in the bushes putting us on guard for a lurking tiger. Today, it could be a rash of breaking news alerts and phone notifications.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic warped many people's sense of time and increased their screen usage like never before, said Stacey Nye, a clinical psychologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.",
      "Technology isn't the only thing that influences our attention, experts say, but the effects of those pinging notifications or hours scrolling through 30-second long videos can build up over time.",
      "\u201cOur attention span has really been trained to only focus in those little, small blips and it interrupts our natural focus cycles,\u201d she said.",
      "Experts say \u201cactive\u201d breaks are among the best way to retrain your mind and your attention. They only take about 30 minutes, Nye said, and can be as simple as taking a walk while noticing things around you or moving to another room for lunch.",
      "Don't be afraid to get creative. Develop a list of alternative activities or randomly choose ideas out of a fish bowl. Try craft projects, a short meditation, fixing a quick meal or talking a walk outside. All the better if you can involve a friend as well.",
      "The break needs to be a physical or mental activity \u2014 no passive phone-scrolling.",
      "When the brain is understimulated and looking for change, it\u2019ll usually grab onto the first thing it sees. The smartphone, an \u201cever-producing change machine,\u201d is an enticing option, said Cindy Lustig, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Michigan.",
      "Turn off unnecessary notifications and put that \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode to good use, especially before bedtime. Better yet, put your phone in a whole different room, Lustig said.",
      "Multitasking may make you feel like you're getting more done, but brain experts recommend against it.",
      "\u201cBe a single tasker,\" Nye said. \u201cWork on one thing at a time, for a specified period of time and begin to work your way up.\u201d",
      "Lustig is a big fan of the \u201cPomodoro technique,\" in which you set a timer and work on something for 25 or 30 minutes before taking a five-minute break.",
      "She tells herself: \u201cI can do anything for this amount of time,\" and the world will still be waiting for her at the end.",
      "It's not enough to just have a hobby, Lustig said. It helps to choose hobbies that include deliberate practice and a goal to strive toward, whether it's playing guitar for an audience or improving in a sport.",
      "It helps to pick something that you enjoy as well.",
      "\u201cYou don't want to start with the heavy nonfiction or like \u2018War and Peace,\u2019\u201d Lustig said. \u201cIf you need to start with the romance novel, then start with the romance novel. You can work your way up.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also important to be kind to yourself. Everyone has good and bad days, and attention needs are different \u2014 and even vary from task to task.",
      "The key is to make an intentional effort, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt is in many ways similar to a muscle in the sense that we can build it up with practice and exercises,\u201d Ziffra said. \u201cConversely, it can weaken if we\u2019re not exercising it.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe just don't know why there haven't been cases,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \u201cI think we should assume there are infections that are occurring in farmworkers that just aren't being detected.\u201d",
      "The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S.",
      "In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S. \u2014 most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the infected people had mild illnesses.",
      "The most recent infections confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in early February in Nevada, Ohio and Wyoming.",
      "California had been a hotspot, with three-quarters of the nation\u2019s infections in dairy cattle. But testing and cases among people have fallen off. At least 50 people were tested each month in late 2024, but just three people were tested in March, one in April and none in May so far, state records show. Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14.",
      "During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus.",
      "That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural \u2014 maybe temporary \u2014 decline in cases.",
      "It's unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases.",
      "What's more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested limited activity recently.",
      "New infections are still being detected in birds and cattle, but not as frequently as several months ago.",
      "\u201cGiven the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it\u2019s not surprising that human cases have declined as well,\u201d the CDC said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody\u2019s hiding anything,\u201d said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "But Osterholm and some other experts think it's likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding.",
      "Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government\u2019s bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.",
      "Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said.",
      "And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1.",
      "Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said \"targeted surveillance has really dropped off precipitously since Trump took office.\"",
      "She wonders if immigrant farmworkers are too scared to come forward.",
      "\"I can\u2019t argue with anyone who would be risking getting shipped to a Salvadoran gulag for reporting an exposure or seeking testing,\u201d she said.",
      "The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.",
      "Earlier this month, an agency assessment said there is a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past.",
      "Still, research is continuing.",
      "Texas A&M University scientists have collected blood samples from dairy workers in multiple states to test for signs of past H5N1 exposure, said David Douphrate, a workplace health and safety expert leading the project. The yearlong study is funded by a nearly $4 million grant from the CDC and is expected to conclude in July.",
      "Douphrate said he leveraged two decades of relationships with dairy producers and workers to gain access to the farms.",
      "\u201cWe have had very good participation,\u201d Douphrate said. \u201cThey have been very willing.\u201d",
      "Similar surveillance is \u201curgently needed\u201d among domestic cats, said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies emerging animal diseases. She recently released a paper reviewing bird flu in infections in cats between 2004 and 2024.",
      "Barn cats that died after drinking raw milk were one of the first signs that dairy cows were becoming infected with bird flu in 2024. Since then, the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 120 domestic cats infected with the virus across the U.S.",
      "Infections have mostly been found in cats that died. Less is known about milder infections, whether cats can recover from bird flu \u2014 or whether the virus can spill over into people.",
      "Coleman has been collecting blood samples from cats across the U.S. to see if they have evidence of previous exposure to the virus. But the process is slow and research funding is uncertain.",
      "\u201cIt's easy to downplay something because that's usually what humans do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we really need to be doing is ramping up.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Infant twins suffered from malnutrition in Nigeria",
      "DIKWA, Nigeria -- Under the dappled light of a thatched shelter, Yagana Bulama cradles her surviving infant. The other twin is gone, a casualty of malnutrition and the international funding cuts that are snapping the lifeline for displaced communities in Nigeria\u2019s insurgency-ravaged Borno state.",
      "\u201cFeeding is severely difficult,\u201d said Bulama, 40, who was a farmer before Boko Haram militants swept through her village, forcing her to flee. She and about 400,000 other people at the humanitarian hub of Dikwa \u2014 virtually the entire population \u2014 rely on assistance. The military restricts their movements to a designated \u201csafe zone,\u201d which severely limits farming.",
      "For years, the United States Agency for International Development had been the backbone of the humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria, helping non-government organizations provide food, shelter and healthcare to millions of people. But this year, the Trump administration cut more than 90% of USAID's foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance around the world.",
      "Programs serving children were hit hard.",
      "Bulama previously lost young triplets to hunger before reaching therapeutic feeding centers in Dikwa. When she gave birth to twins last August, both were severely underweight. Workers from Mercy Corps enrolled them in a program to receive a calorie-dense paste used to treat severe acute malnutrition.",
      "But in February, Mercy Corps abruptly ended the program that was entirely financed by USAID. Two weeks later, one of the twins died, Bulama said.",
      "She has no more tears, only dread for what may come next.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to bury another child,\u201d she said.",
      "Globally, 50% of the therapeutic foods for treating malnutrition in children were funded by USAID, and 40% of the supplies were produced in the U.S., according to Shawn Baker, chief program officer at Helen Keller Intl and former chief nutritionist at USAID.",
      "He said the consequence could be 1 million children not receiving treatment for severe malnutrition, resulting in 163,500 additional deaths per year. For Helen Keller Intl, its programs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria have been terminated.",
      "\u201cIt is very traumatic,\u201d said Trond Jensen, the head of the United Nations humanitarian office in Maiduguri, Borno's capital, of the funding cuts, noting that other donors, including the European Union, have taken similar steps this year. \u201cOne of the things is the threat to the lives of children.\u201d",
      "UNICEF still runs a therapeutic feeding center nearby, which now supports Bulama's surviving baby, but its capacity is stretched. It is turning away many people previously served by other aid groups that have pulled out due to funding cuts.",
      "Intersos, an Italian humanitarian organization, has the only remaining facility providing in-patient services for malnutrition in Dikwa, treating the most perilous cases. Its workers say they are overwhelmed, with at least 10 new admissions of seriously malnourished children daily.",
      "\u201cBefore the USAID cut, we made a lot of progress,\u201d said Ayuba Kauji, a health and nutrition supervisor. \u201cNow my biggest worry is high mortality. We don\u2019t have enough resources to keep up.\u201d",
      "Intersos was forced to reduce its staff from 30 to 11 in Dikwa after the USAID freeze. Its nutrition and health facilities now operate solely on support from the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, a smaller pot of money contributed by a few European countries. That funding will be finished in June.",
      "The crisis is equally acute in Maiduguri, where the economy is reeling from massive terminations of aid workers. At another Intersos-run facility, 10 of the 12 doctors have left and four nurses remain, with 50 new admissions of malnourished children per week.",
      "\u201cIt used to be far less,\u201d said Emmanuel Ali, one of the remaining doctors.",
      "The effects of the funding cuts extend far beyond nutrition. At the International Organization for Migration's reception center in Dikwa, thousands of displaced families and those escaping Boko Haram captivity are stranded. There are no new shelters being built and no support for relocation.",
      "\u201cBefore, organizations like Mercy Corps built mud-brick homes and rehabilitated damaged shelters to absorb people from the IOM reception center,\u201d said one official at the center, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the situation. \u201cNow, that has stopped.\u201d",
      "Jensen, the U.N. humanitarian head in Maiduguri, said, \u201csadly, we are not seeing additional funding to make up for the U.S. cuts.\u201d He warned that vulnerable people could turn to risky ways of coping, including joining violent groups.",
      "The crisis in Nigeria is part of a larger reckoning. According to Kate Phillips-Barrasso, Mercy Corps' vice president for policy and advocacy, 40 of its 62 U.S.-funded programs with the potential to reach 3.5 million people in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon and Gaza have been terminated.",
      "In Mozambique, where jihadist violence in the north has displaced over a million people since 2017, humanitarian organizations face steep shortfalls with \u201cdevastating\u201d effects on the needy, said Frederico Jo\u00e3o, chairman of the forum of NGOs in the region.",
      "More widely, the USAID funding cut compromises Mozambique's health sector, especially in HIV/AIDS care, said Inoc\u00eancio Impissa, cabinet spokesman. The government now seeks alternative funding to prevent total collapse of health systems.",

      "There are hardly any tourists in scenic Himalayan region of Kashmir",
      "SRINAGAR, India -- There are hardly any tourists in the scenic Himalayan region of Kashmir. Most of the hotels and ornate pinewood houseboats are empty. Resorts in the snowclad mountains have fallen silent. Hundreds of cabs are parked and idle.",
      "It\u2019s the fallout of last month\u2019s gun massacre that left 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists, dead in Indian-controlled Kashmir followed by tit-for-tat military strikes by India and Pakistan, bringing the nuclear-armed rivals to the brink of their third war over the region.",
      "\u201cThere might be some tourist arrivals, but it counts almost negligible. It is almost a zero footfall right now,\u201d said Yaseen Tuman, who operates multiple houseboats in the region\u2019s main city of Srinagar. \u201cThere is a haunting silence now.\u201d",
      "Tens of thousands of panicked tourists left Kashmir within days after the rare killings of tourists on April 22 at a picture-perfect meadow in southern resort town of Pahalgam. Following the attack, authorities temporarily closed dozens of tourist resorts in the region, adding to fear and causing occupancy rates to plummet.",
      "Graphic images, repeatedly circulated through TV channels and social media, deepened panic and anger. India blamed Pakistan for supporting the attackers, a charge Islamabad denied.",
      "Those who had stayed put fled soon after tensions between India and Pakistan spiked. As the two countries fired missiles and drones at each other, the region witnessed mass cancellations of tourist bookings. New Delhi and Islamabad reached a U.S.-mediated ceasefire on May 10 but hardly any new bookings have come in, tour operators said.",
      "Sheikh Bashir Ahmed, vice president of the Kashmir Hotel and Restaurant Association, said at least 12,000 rooms in the region\u2019s hundreds of hotels and guesthouses were previously booked until June. Almost all bookings have been cancelled, and tens of thousands of people associated with hotels are without jobs, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge loss.\u201d Ahmed said.",
      "The decline has had a ripple effect on the local economy. Handicrafts, food stalls and taxi operators have lost most of their business.",
      "Idyllic destinations, like the resort towns of Gulmarg and Pahalgam, once a magnet for travelers, are eerily silent. Lines of colorful hand-carved boats, known as shikaras, lie deserted, mostly anchored still on Srinagar\u2019s normally bustling Dal Lake. Tens of thousands of daily wage workers have hardly any work.",
      "\u201cThere used to be long lines of tourists waiting for boat rides. There are none now,\u201d said boatman Fayaz Ahmed.",
      "Taxi driver Mohammed Irfan would take tourists for long drives to hill stations and show them grand Mughal-era gardens. \u201cEven a half day of break was a luxury, and we would pray for it. Now, my taxi lies standstill for almost two weeks,\u201d he said.",
      "In recent years, the tourism sector grew substantially, making up about 7% of the region\u2019s economy, according to official figures. Omar Abdullah, Kashmir\u2019s top elected official, said before the attack on tourists that the government was aiming to increase tourism's share of the economy to at least 15% in the next four to five years.",
      "Indian-controlled Kashmir was a top destination for visitors until the armed rebellion against Indian rule began in 1989. Warfare laid waste to the stunningly beautiful region, which is partly controlled by Pakistan and claimed by both countries in its entirety.",
      "As the conflict ground on, the tourism sector slowly revived but occasional military skirmishes between India and Pakistan kept visitors at bay.",
      "But India vigorously pushed tourism after Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government scrapped the disputed region\u2019s semi-autonomy in 2019. Tensions have simmered, but the region has also drawn millions of visitors amid a strange calm enforced by an intensified security crackdown.",
      "According to official data, close to 3 million tourists visited the region in 2024, a rise from 2.71 million visitors in 2023 and 2.67 million in 2022. The massive influx prompted many locals to invest in the sector, setting up family-run guesthouses, luxury hotels, and transport companies in a region with few alternatives.",
      "Tourists remained largely unfazed even as Modi\u2019s administration has governed Kashmir with an iron fist in recent years, claiming militancy in the region was in check and a tourism influx was a sign of normalcy returning.",
      "The massacre shattered those claims. Experts say that the Modi government\u2019s optimism was largely misplaced and that the rising tourism in the region of which it boasted was a fragile barometer of normalcy. Last year, Abdullah, the region\u2019s chief minister, cautioned against such optimism.",
      "Tuman, who is also a sixth-generation tour operator, said he was not too optimistic about an immediate revival as bookings for the summer were almost all canceled.",
      "\u201cIf all goes well, it will take at least six months for tourism to revive,\u201d he said.",
      "Ahmed, the hotels association official, said India and Pakistan need to resolve the dispute for the region\u2019s prosperity. \u201cTourism needs peace. If (Kashmir) problem is not solved \u2026 maybe after two months, it will be again same thing.\u201d",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. asked all of his Cabinet secretaries to submit resignations on Thursday in a \u201cbold reset\u201d of his administration following last week\u2019s mid-term elections, which saw more opposition candidates win crucial Senate seats.",
      "Marcos, the 67-year-old son of a late Philippine dictator overthrown in 1986, won the presidency in the deeply divided Southeast Asian country by a landslide in 2022 in a stunning political comeback as he made a steadfast call for national unity. But his equally popular vice-presidential running mate, Sara Duterte, later broke from him in a falling out that has sparked intense political discord.",
      "With support from treaty ally the United States and other friendly countries, Marcos emerged as the most vocal critic of China \u2019s growing aggression in the disputed South China Sea while contending with an array of longstanding domestic issues, including inflation \u2014 and delayed fulfillment of a campaign promise to bring down the price of rice \u2014 as well as many reports of kidnappings and other crimes.",
      "\u201cThis is not business as usual,\u201d Marcos was cited as saying in a government statement. \u201cThe people have spoken and they expect results \u2014 not politics, not excuses. We hear them and we will act.\u201d",
      "Marcos called for the \u201ccourtesy resignation of all Cabinet secretaries in a decisive move to recalibrate his administration following the results of the recent elections,\u201d the government statement said.",
      "\"The request for courtesy resignations is aimed at giving the president the elbow room to evaluate the performance of each department and determine who will continue to serve in line with his administration\u2019s recalibrated priorities,\u201d the government said.",
      "At least 21 Cabinet secretaries led by Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin either immediately submitted their resignations or expressed their readiness to do so.",
      "\u201cThis is not about personalities \u2014 it\u2019s about performance, alignment and urgency,\u201d Marcos said. \u201cThose who have delivered and continue to deliver will be recognized. But we cannot afford to be complacent. The time for comfort zones is over.\u201d",
      "Government services will remain uninterrupted during the transition, the government said, adding that \u201cwith this bold reset, the Marcos administration signals a new phase \u2014 sharper, faster and fully focused on the people\u2019s most pressing needs.\"",
      "Five out of the 12 Senate seats contested in the mid-term elections were won by allies of Sara Duterte or her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, who has been arrested and detained by the International Criminal Court in The Hague in the Netherlands. The elder Duterte, a staunch critic of Marcos, was accused of committing crimes against humanity over a brutal anti-drugs crackdown he launched that left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead.",
      "Marcos-endorsed senatorial candidates won five Senate seats while two other seats were unexpectedly won by two liberal democrats associated with the late former President Benigno Aquino III, whose family has long been at odds with the Marcoses.",
      "Voting for half of the 24-member Senate is crucial because the government body will hold an impeachment trial for Sara Duterte in July over an array of criminal allegations, including corruption and a public threat to assassinate Marcos, his wife and House Speaker Martin Romualdez. She made those threats in an online news conference in November but later issued a vague denial that she wanted the president killed.",
      "Sara Duterte is facing a separate criminal complaint for her threats against the Marcoses and Romualdez.",
      "Most of the seats in the House were won by candidates allied with Marcos and his cousin, Romualdez, in the May 12 elections, which many saw as a preview to the presidential elections scheduled for 2028.",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says his government is talking to the U.S. about joining President Donald Trump\u2019s future Golden Dome missile defense program",
      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Wednesday his government is talking to the U.S. about joining President Donald Trump's future Golden Dome missile defense program.",
      "The multilayered, $175 billion system would for the first time put U.S. weapons in space. Trump said the previous day he expected the system to be fully operational by the end of his term in 2029.",
      "\"Is it a good idea for Canada? Yes, it is a good to have protections in place for Canadians,\" Carney said.",
      "Carney confirmed he's had talks with Trump about it and said there are discussions with senior officials. Trump said the Canadian government had contacted his administration indicating it wants to join the program and that he will work with Ottawa to ensure it contributes its \u201cfair share.\u201d",
      "Golden Dome is envisioned to include ground- and space-based capabilities to detect and stop missiles at all four major stages of a potential attack: detecting and destroying them before a launch, intercepting them in their earliest stage of flight, stopping them midcourse in the air, or halting them in the final minutes as they descend toward a target.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that we are looking at and something that has been discussed at a high level.\" Carney said. \u201cBut not I\u2019m not sure one negotiates on this. These are military decisions that have been taken in that context, and we will evaluate it accordingly.\u201d",
      "Carney warned that Canada faces potential missiles threats in the \u201cnot-too-distant future\u201d that could come from space.",
      "\u201cIs Canada going to be doing this alone or with the United States? Because with a Golden Dome, there will be discussions that could have an impact on Canada, but Canada wouldn't be a part of them,\u201d Carney said.",
      "The Pentagon has warned for years that the newest missiles developed by China and Russia are so advanced that updated countermeasures are necessary. Golden Dome\u2019s added satellites and interceptors \u2014 where the bulk of the program\u2019s cost is \u2014 would be focused on stopping those advanced missiles early on or in the middle of their flight.",
      "Canada and the U.S. are partners in the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the combined organization that provides shared defense of airspace over the two nations.",
      "The newly elected Carney spent much spent much of the last few months saying the old relationship with the U.S. based on steadily increasing integration is over. Trump has infuriated Canadians by saying Canada should be the 51st state.",
      "\u201cWe cooperate if necessary but not necessarily cooperate,\u201d Carney said.",

      "At least three vehicles and four people were involved in the killing of the personal secretary and a close adviser of Mexico City\u2019s mayor",
      "MEXICO CITY -- At least four people were involved in the killing of the personal secretary and a close adviser of Mexico City \u2019s Mayor Clara Brugada, the capital\u2019s police chief said Wednesday, as more details emerged of the worst attack against public officials in the capital in recent years.",
      "Pablo V\u00e1zquez Camacho said investigators had identified and found a motorcycle and two other vehicles used in the escape of the gunman who killed the two officials Tuesday morning as they traveled in a vehicle along a busy thoroughfare.",
      "Brugada's personal secretary, Ximena Guzm\u00e1n, and an adviser, Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, were shot dead in Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s car, authorities said.",
      "Mexico City chief prosecutor Bertha Alcalde Luj\u00e1n said the gunman had fled on a motorcycle that was hidden nearby and then changed vehicles twice as he and others fled into neighboring Mexico State.",
      "Clothes were recovered in the vehicles and were being analyzed, but investigators could not yet offer a possible motive, the prosecutor said.",
      "She said Guzm\u00e1n was shot eight times and Mu\u00f1oz four times.",
      "Alcalde said that given the circumstances, investigators believe \u201cit was a direct attack and with an important degree of planning and those who killed them had previous experience.\u201d",
      "Still, she said investigators could not yet propose a motive or say who was behind the killings.",
      "\u201cWe cannot conclude that this is tied to organized crime, much less speak now of a particular organized crime group,\u201d Alcalde said.",
      "Both officials said Wednesday that investigators had detected the presence of an individual at the site of the attacks days before they occurred, which would suggest knowledge of the victims' routines.",
      "The attack, which happened at around 7 a.m., left four bullet holes clustered on the driver\u2019s side of the windshield. One body lay on the pavement.",
      "V\u00e1zquez Camacho said that neither Guzm\u00e1n nor Mu\u00f1oz had any special security measures, but both had received training about protecting themselves.",
      "\u201cThey are people who worked very closely with the people ... and they did their work without fear,\u201d he said.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum, who is an ally of Brugada and a former mayor of Mexico City before winning the presidency last year, had declined to speculate on the possible involvement of organized crime during her press briefing earlier Wednesday.",
      "At the scene of the attack Wednesday morning, hundreds of commuters passed with most oblivious to what had occurred a day earlier. Some, however, noticed the handwritten signs with messages of remembrance to the two victims and flowers and candles left on the sidewalk.",
      "University student Loretta Garc\u00eda Oriz said she had passed the site Tuesday when Guzm\u00e1n and Mu\u00f1oz's bodies were still at the scene. \u201cPassing here gives me the same trauma,\u201d she said Wednesday.",
      "Oscar S\u00e1nchez's taco stand isn't far from the crime scene, but said Wednesday he didn't know what had happened until another vendor told him and police began to set up a perimeter. The attack showed that it doesn't matter if you're an official or an average person, he said. \"It's all the same.\"",
      "Mexico City's mayor is considered second in political importance only to the president. The mayor's office has long been a stepping stone to the presidency, something true for Sheinbaum and her predecessor.",
      "But for years, the idea has prevailed of Mexico City as a relatively peaceful oasis protected from the brutal drug cartel violence prevalent in other parts of the country. There has always been street crime, but the cartels, while present, maintained a lower profile in the capital.",
      "That illusion was partially dashed in 2020 with the brazen ambush of Mexico City's then police chief on another central boulevard. Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch was wounded, but two bodyguards and a bystander were killed in the attack involving more than 20 people and heavy weaponry.",
      "Garc\u00eda Harfuch immediately blamed the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.",
      "There had not been another such attack on public officials in the capital since then.",

      "\u201cIf anyone participates or takes any similar action, it will amount to support for a passive coup,\u201d Brig. Gen. Omar Khan told The Associated Press. \u201cAnything along those lines will speak to a violation of our sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d",
      "The May 25 election organized by Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is the latest step in a push to annex the Essequibo region, which Venezuela has long claimed as its own.",
      "Venezuelans living in Guyana who become involved in Sunday\u2019s elections could also face arrest and deportation, Khan added.",
      "Nearly 100,000 people of direct or indirect Venezuelan ancestry currently live in Guyana, according to Foreign Secretary Robert Persaud.",
      "\u201cShouldn\u2019t this reality give all Guyanese a cause to be alert? People\u2019s vigilance is equivalent to people\u2019s power and defense,\u201d Persaud said in a recent social media post.",

      "On Sunday, Venezuelans will head to the polls to elect governors and lawmakers, as well as officials who would supposedly administer the Essequibo region.",
      "In 2023, Maduro threatened to annex the region by force after holding a referendum asking voters if Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state.",
      "The dispute over the region began more than a century ago, when an international tribunal in 1899 drew the border between the South American neighbors.",
      "In 2018, Guyana went to the International Court of Justice and asked judges to uphold the 1899 ruling. Meanwhile, Venezuela has dismissed the border drawn more than a century ago, noting Guyana was still a British colony. It has argued that a 1966 agreement to resolve the dispute effectively nullified the original arbitration.",
      "The case is still pending in court while tensions between the two countries keep rising despite an emergency summit held in late 2023 to diffuse the situation.",
      "Last week, Guyana\u2019s government reported three separate attacks from the Venezuelan side on Guyanese soldiers patrolling a border river. Earlier this year, six Guyanese soldiers were injured in a separate attack, some of them seriously.",
      "U.S. Ambassador Nicole Theriot has dismissed Maduro\u2019s threats as \u201cjust bluster aimed at shoring up domestic support.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone should see the sham for what it is. It\u2019s saber-rattling from the Maduro regime, nothing more,\u201d she said at a public forum Tuesday, stressing that the U.S. stands with Guyana.",

Robert, our member!\u2019\u201d Francesco Tamburlani, the owner of the gym, said in an interview. \u201cI heard the gym staff behind him cheering. ... This moved us, filled us with joy.\u201d",
      "A typical workout for someone of Prevost\u2019s age, 69, was a mere warm-up for the little-known American cardinal, according to Valerio Masella, his personal trainer. Although it is hard to define an age group for personalized programs, Prevost's plan was more befitting of men aged 50-55. Masella would train him two or three times a week in sessions lasting up to an hour.",
      "So, how much does the pope bench? Masella can\u2019t speak to his papal power, since Prevost was focused on posture and cardiovascular capacity. He ran on his favorite treadmill that faces a mural featuring famous local landmarks, among them St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in the Vatican.",
      "\u201cWe would start off slow and then go pretty strong, I must say. Especially a lot of resistance on the exercise bike, a very strong climb,\u201d Masella said.",
      "Throughout their two-year training, Masella never knew Prevost was a cardinal, nor did he hear him utter a discouraging word.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard him make a comment about anything that wasn\u2019t positive. He was always positive about everything -- the weather, the city, the people, also for me, he said he liked the gym.\u201d",
      "A Vatican spokesperson didn't reply when asked for comment.",
      "A sporting pope isn\u2019t new. Pope John Paul II, who was elected at the age of 58, was an avid skier and mountain trekker.",
      "Chicago-born Prevost\u2019s game is tennis. On May 15, he met top-ranked player Jannik Sinner, who gave him a racket and offered to play during an off day at the Italian Open. Leo had said earlier in the week that he would be up for a charity match when it was suggested by a journalist.",
      "After Prevost took over the Vatican\u2019s Dicastery for Bishops in 2023, he said in an interview with the Augustinian Order that his new job had left him little free time to practice his game. While the Mediterranean climate makes tennis possible year-round, the papacy will likely leave him even fewer chances to step onto a court.",
      "Tamburlani, the Omega owner, says the Holy Father is welcome back any time he wants to squeeze in a workout. After all, his membership's still active.",
      "\u201cThis would make us so happy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would organize our gym to guarantee his safety and his privacy. We would just need a sign.\u201d",

      "KATHMANDU, Nepal -- An expert mountain guide successfully put four of his clients on top of Mount Everest on Wednesday less than a week after they left London, one of the fastest ascents on record of the world's highest peak.",
      "The four British climbers flew from London to Kathmandu on May 16 and reached the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) summit Wednesday morning local time, according to Lukas Furtenbach, who has been using different methods over the past five years to speed up the climb.",
      "The climbers had put in months of preparation, training in hypoxia tents and undergoing xenon gas treatment at a clinic in Germany before heading to Nepal.",
      "\u201cXenon improves the acclimatization and protects the body from altitude sickness and the effects from the hypoxic environment. Xenon makes the climb safer,\" Furtenbach told The Associated Press from the base camp at Everest.",
      "He said all the climbers were safe and returning back to lower camps after the successful ascent on Wednesday",
      "Climbers normally spend weeks at base camp to acclimatize to the higher altitude. They make practice runs to the lower camps on Everest before beginning their final attempt on the peak, so that their bodies are prepared for the low pressure and lower level of oxygen available.",
      "The new method is likely to reduce the time climbers spend out of their home countries and cut the number of days they need to take off work, also cutting down on expenses.",
      "Nepal does not have any rules on how many days climbers must spend acclimatizing or making practice climbs. Their permits, which cost $11,000 each, are valid for 90 days. Climbing season normally wraps up by the end of May, when the weather deteriorates and monsoon season begins. The ropes and ladders fixed to the mountain are then pulled out.",
      "Hundreds of foreign climbers have been given permission to climb Everest this year. Roughly half of them have succeeded and the remaining will likely attempt their climb within the next few days.",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has suggested that an unpopular measure which deprived millions of retirees of an annual winter fuel subsidy will be changed",
      "LONDON -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer suggested Wednesday that a hugely unpopular measure which deprived millions of retirees an annual winter fuel subsidy will be changed, a striking reversal in policy.",
      "Starmer said he wanted to help people with the cost of living and added that he wanted more retirees to be eligible for the so-called winter fuel payments. He spoke during his weekly questioning in the House of Commons after figures were released showing inflation was up at its highest level in over a year.",
      "\u201cAs the economy improves, we want to make sure people feel those improvements,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we want to ensure that as we go forward more pensioners are eligible for winter fuel payments.\u201d",
      "Soon after Labour came to power last July, Treasury chief Rachel Reeves removed the winter fuel allowance, worth between 200 and 300 pounds ($266 and $399) a year, from all but the poorest retirees, arguing that the measure was needed because of the dire state of the public finances left by the previous Conservative government.",
      "The move has arguably contributed to a swift decline in popularity for Starmer's government since it was elected. In local elections in England earlier this month, Labour fared poorly, with many party representatives blaming the removal of the winter fuel payment.",
      "Since then, there's been growing speculation that the government will change tack by either scrapping the measure or increasing the level at which the allowance is paid.",
      "Starmer told lawmakers that the decision will be made \"as part of a fiscal event.\u201d It's unclear whether that would be on June 11 when Reeves will outline her spending plans for government departments over the coming three years, or in her next budget in the fall.",
      "During Wednesday\u2019s exchanges in the House of Commons, Kemi Badenoch, leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, asked how the public could \u201cever trust\u201d Starmer after the \u201cinevitable U-turn\u201d on winter fuel payments.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s only because of the measures we\u2019ve taken that the economy is improving, growth at the highest rate in the G7, four interest rate cuts, three trade deals because countries want to trade with this country because of the decisions that we\u2019ve made,\" Starmer said.",

      "But it\u2019s more than just religious devotion that the golden-domed shrine became known for during Syria\u2019s prolonged civil war.",
      "At the time, the shrine's protection from Sunni extremists became a rallying cry for some Shiite fighters and Iran-backed groups from beyond Syria\u2019s borders who backed the former government of Bashar Assad. The shrine and the surrounding area, which bears the same name, has emerged as one symbol of how the religious and political increasingly intertwined during the conflict.",
      "With such a legacy, local Shiite community leaders and members are now navigating a dramatically altered political landscape around Sayyida Zeinab and beyond, after Assad\u2019s December ouster by armed insurgents led by the Sunni Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The complex transition that is underway has left some in Syria\u2019s small Shiite minority feeling vulnerable.",
      "\u201cFor Shiites around the world, there\u2019s huge sensitivity surrounding the Sayyida Zeinab Shrine,\u201d said Hussein al-Khatib. \u201cIt carries a lot of symbolism.\u201d",
      "After Assad\u2019s ouster, al-Khatib joined other Syrian Shiite community members to protect the shrine from the inside. The new security forces guard it from the outside.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want any sedition among Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the most important message, especially in this period that Syria is going through.\u201d",
      "Zeinab is a daughter of the first Shiite imam, Ali, cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad; she's especially revered among Shiites as a symbol of steadfastness, patience and courage.",
      "She has several titles, such as the \u201cmother of misfortunes\u201d for enduring tragedies, including the 7th-century killing of her brother, Hussein. His death exacerbated the schism between Islam\u2019s two main sects, Sunni and Shiite, and is mourned annually by Shiites.",
      "Zeinab's burial place is disputed; some Muslims believe it\u2019s elsewhere. The Syria shrine has drawn pilgrims, including from Iran, Iraq and Lebanon. Since Assad\u2019s ouster, however, fewer foreign visitors have come, an economic blow to those catering to them in the area.",
      "Over the years, the Sayyida Zeinab area has suffered deadly attacks by militants.",
      "In January, state media reported that intelligence officials in Syria\u2019s post-Assad government thwarted a plan by the Islamic State group to set off a bomb at the shrine. The announcement appeared to be an attempt by Syria\u2019s new leaders to reassure religious minorities, including those seen as having supported Assad\u2019s former government.",
      "Al-Khatib, who moved his family from Aleppo province to the Sayyida Zeinab area shortly before Assad\u2019s fall, said Assad had branded himself as a protector of minorities. \u201cWhen killings, mobilization ... and sectarian polarization began,\" the narrative \"of the regime and its allies was that \u2018you, as a Shiite, you as a minority member, will be killed if I fall.\u2019\u201d",
      "The involvement of Sunni jihadis and some hardline foreign Shiite fighters fanned sectarian flames, he said.",
      "The Syria conflict began as one of several uprisings against Arab dictators before Assad brutally crushed what started as largely peaceful protests and a civil war erupted. It became increasingly fought along sectarian lines, drew in foreign fighters and became a proxy battlefield for regional and international powers on different sides.",
      "Recently, a red flag reading \u201cOh, Zeinab\" that had fluttered from its dome was removed after some disparaged it as a sectarian symbol.",
      "Sheikh Adham al-Khatib, a representative of followers of the Twelver branch of Shiism in Syria, said such flags \u201care not directed against anyone,\u201d but that it was agreed to remove it for now to keep the peace.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want a clash to happen. We see that ... there\u2019s sectarian incitement, here and there,\" he said.",
      "Earlier, Shiite leaders had wrangled with some endowments ministry officials over whether the running of the shrine would stay with the Shiite endowment trustee as it\u2019s been, he said, adding \u201cwe've rejected\" changing the status quo. No response was received before publication to questions sent to a Ministry of Endowments media official.",
      "Adham al-Khatib and other Shiite leaders recently met with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve talked transparently about some of the transgressions,\u201d he said. \u201cHe promised that such matters would be handled but that they require some patience because of the negative feelings that many harbor for Shiites as a result of the war.\u201d",
      "Many, the sheikh said, \u201care holding the Shiites responsible for prolonging the regime\u2019s life.\u201d This \u201cis blamed on Iran, on Hezbollah and on Shiites domestically,\" he said, adding that he believes the conflict was political rather than religious.",
      "Early in the conflict, he said, \u201cour internal Shiite decision was to be neutral for long months.\u201d But, he said, there was sectarian incitement against Shiites by some and argued that \u201cwhen weapons, kidnappings and killing of civilians started, Shiites were forced to defend themselves.\u201d",
      "Regionally, Assad was backed by Iran and the Shiite militant Lebanese group Hezbollah, whose intervention helped prop up his rule. Most rebels against him were Sunni, as were their patrons in the region.",
      "Besides the shrine's protection argument, geopolitical interests and alliances were at play as Syria was a key part of Iran\u2019s network of deterrence against Israel.",
      "Today, rumors and some social media posts can threaten to inflame emotions.",
      "Shrine director Jaaffar Kassem said he received a false video purporting to show the shrine on fire and was flooded with calls about it.",

      "Small groups of women gathered recently at the Sayyida Zeinab courtyard, chatting among themselves in what appeared to be a quiet atmosphere. Among them was Kamla Mohamed.",
      "Early in the war, Mohamed said, her son was kidnapped more than a decade ago by anti-government rebels for serving in the military. The last time she saw him, she added, was on a video where he appeared with a bruised face.",
      "When Assad fell, Mohamed feared for her family.",
      "Those fears were fueled by the later eruption of violence in Syria\u2019s coastal region, where a counteroffensive killed many Alawite civilians \u2014 members of the minority sect from which Assad hails and drew support as he ruled over a Sunni majority. Human rights groups reported revenge killings against Alawites; the new authorities said they were investigating.",
      "\u201cWe were scared that people would come to us and kill us,\u201d Mohamed said, clutching a prayer bead. \u201cOur life has become full of fear.\u201d",

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The world's sources of critical minerals are increasingly concentrated in just a few countries, most notably China, leaving the global economy vulnerable to supply cutoffs that could disrupt economies and hit consumers with higher prices, a report said Wednesday.",
      "The Paris-based International Energy Agency's report looked at the availability of minerals and metals that may be small in quantity \u2014 but large in impact when it comes to shifting the economy away from fossil fuels toward electricity and renewable energy.",
      "It found that for copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements, the average market share of the three top producing countries rose to 86% in 2024 from 82% in 2020.",
      "China is the leading refiner for 19 out of 20 strategic minerals studied in the report, and has an average share of around 75%. Indonesia showed strong growth in nickel, a key component in making steel and batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "The current trend toward export restrictions and trade disputes increases concerns, the IEA said.",
      "\u201cCritical mineral supply chains can be highly vulnerable to supply shocks, be they from extreme weather, a technical failure or trade disruptions,\u201d said IEA executive director Fatih Birol. \u201dThe impact of a supply shock can be far-reaching, bringing higher prices for consumers and reducing industrial competitiveness.\u201d",
      "Birol cited the energy crisis in Europe after Russia cut off natural gas supplies over the invasion of Ukraine. Another cautionary tale is the global shortage of silicon-based computer chips during and after the pandemic, which disrupted auto production.",
      "\u201cThe golden rule of energy security is diversification,\u201d Birol told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cAnd it goes beyond energy security, it is also economic security.\"",
      "Market forces are important in developing new sources but won't be enough. \u201cThere is a need for well-designed government policies\u201d in the form of financing and other measures, he said.",
      "China is a massive global source of critical minerals required for a wide range of goods that includes computer chips, robots, electric autos, batteries, drones, and military equipment. It also dominates the refining and processing of many of these critical minerals, including lithium, cobalt, graphite and more.",
      "China has placed export limits of many of these key products and tightened controls on others as President Donald Trump\u2019s trade negotiations escalate, stifling U.S. industry and the nation\u2019s ability to find quick alternatives. Without access to China\u2019s significant reserves, U.S. manufacturers have a harder time competing amid mounting global supply tensions.",
      "Trump has made reducing U.S. dependence on foreign critical minerals a core tenet of his first 100 days back in office as part of a national security and economic resilience agenda.",
      "This goes beyond China; the Trump administration finalized a rocky deal with Ukraine granting American access to the nation\u2019s vast mineral resources earlier this month.",
      "Trump is also looking to expedite deep-sea mining in international waters, much to the chagrin of environmental groups. He called for a boost in the domestic copper industry in a February executive order alongside other calls for the federal government to fast-track new mine permits; has reviewed a minerals proposal from Congo, a conflict-riddled nation also rich with mineral reserves; and attempted to strong-arm Greenland into providing more of its minerals to the U.S.",
      "The IEA report said that global markets were well supplied at the moment and that prices in general have fallen. It warned however that planned production of copper, which is essential for electric wiring and power grids, would not keep pace with demand and predicted a 30% shortfall by 2030.",

      "Inflation in the U.K. spiked to its highest level for more than a year in April amid higher domestic bills such as energy and water",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Inflation in the U.K. spiked to its highest level for more than a year in April amid a raft of higher domestic bills, such as energy and water, official figures showed Wednesday.",
      "The Office for National Statistics said that its key measure of inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, rose by 3.5% in the year to April, up from 2.6% in March.",
      "April's rate was the highest since January 2024 and above expectations for a more modest increase to 3.3%.",
      "The scale of the rise was also the largest since October 2022, at the height of the energy crisis in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Economists had anticipated a sizeable increase as April saw hefty annual price rises for an array of household bills, as well as the impact of higher taxes on businesses and a sizeable increase in the minimum wage.",
      "Inflation is widely expected to stay above 3% for the rest of the year, which could rein in expectations of further interest rate reductions from the Bank of England, whose target for inflation is 2%.",
      "On Tuesday, the bank's chief economist, Huw Pill, said that borrowing rates have been cut too quickly, in a sign that he's concerned about underlying inflation pressures.",
      "Since it started cutting borrowing costs last August from the 16-year high of 5.25%, the bank has proceeded on a gradual basis by lowering its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point every three months. Earlier this month, it reduced it to 4.25%.",
      "Following the latest inflation update, Rob Wood, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that cuts on a \u201cprecise quarterly schedule\u201d are \u201cfar from certain.\u201d",
      "Even though inflation is expected to run above the bank's target this year, economists expect it to fall next year, partly because of the recent trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. which will mean many of the tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump had planned have been ditched.",
      "Still, the sharp increase in inflation is a tricky moment for the Labour Party government, which returned to power last July for the first time in 14 years. In recent weeks, Labour touted what it considers to be economic successes, including higher than anticipated first-quarter growth and a trio of trade deals. As well as the tariff pact with the U.S., the government has concluded a trade deal with India and reset the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union after Brexit.",
      "\u201cI am disappointed with these figures, because I know cost of living pressures are still weighing down on working people,\" Treasury chief Rachel Reeves said.",
      "The main opposition Conservative Party, which Labour replaced in power, sought to pin the blame on Reeves' decision to increase the tax burden on businesses.",
      "\u201cFamilies are paying the price for the Labour Chancellor\u2019s choices,\" said Mel Stride, the Tories' economy spokesman.",

      "The president's meme coin is different, however, and has a clear utility: access to Trump. The top 25 investors of $TRUMP are set to attend a private reception with the president Thursday, with the top four getting $100,000 crypto-themed and Trump-branded watches.",
      "Trump\u2019s meme coin saw an initial spike in value, followed by a steep drop. The price saw a significant increase after the dinner contest was announced. Its creators, which include an entity controlled by the Trump Organization, have made hundreds of millions of dollars by collecting fees on trades.",

The project got a boost recently when World Liberty announced an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",
      "A rapidly growing form of crypto, stablecoins have values pegged to fixed assets like the U.S. dollar. Issuers profit by collecting the interest on the Treasury bonds and other assets used to back the stablecoins.",
      "Crypto is now one of the most significant sources of the Trump family\u2019s wealth.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s becoming a salesman-in-chief,\u201d said James Thurber, an American University professor emeritus who has long studied and taught about corruption around the world. \u201cIt allows for foreign influence easily. It allows for crypto lobbying going on at this dinner, and other ways. It allows for huge conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big crypto fan,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One during last week\u2019s trip to the Middle East. \u201cI\u2019ve been that from the beginning, right from the campaign.\u201d",
      "That wasn\u2019t always true. During his first term, Trump posted in July 2019 that cryptocurrencies were \u201cnot money\u201d and had value that was \u201chighly volatile and based on thin air.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade,\u201d he added then. Even after leaving office in 2021, Trump told Fox Business Network that bitcoin, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, \u201cseems like a scam.\u201d",
      "Trump began to shift during a crypto event at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida in May 2024, receiving assurances that industry backers would spend lavishly to get him reelected. Another major milestone came last June, when Trump attended a high-dollar fundraiser at the San Francisco home of David Sacks.",
      "He further warmed to the industry weeks later, when Trump met at Mar-a-Lago with bitcoin miners. The following month, he addressed a major crypto conference in Nashville, promising to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet.\u201d",
      "Those close to Trump, including his sons and billionaire Elon Musk, helped further push his embrace of the industry. Sacks is now the Trump administration\u2019s crypto czar, and many Cabinet members \u2014 including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u2014 have long been enthusiastic crypto boosters.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have faith in the dollar,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a 2023 interview. \u201cI\u2019m bullish on bitcoin.\u201d",
      "Many top crypto backers were naturally wary of traditional politics, but gravitated toward Trump last year. They bristled at Democratic President Joe Biden 's Securities and Exchange Commission aggressively bringing civil suits against several major crypto companies.",
      "Since Trump took office, many such cases have been dropped or paused, including one alleging that Justin Sun, a China-born crypto entrepreneur, and his company engaged in market manipulation and paid celebrities for undisclosed promotions.",
      "Sun, who once paid $6.2 million for a piece of art involving a banana taped to a wall, and then ate the banana, helped the Trumps start World Liberty Financial with an early $75 million investment.",
      "Sun has disclosed on social media that he is the biggest holder of $TRUMP meme coins and is attending Thursday\u2019s dinner.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited to connect with everyone, talk crypto, and discuss the future of our industry,\u201d Sun said.",
      "Trump has signed executive orders promoting the industry, including calls to create a government bitcoin reserve. In March, Trump convened the first cryptocurrency summit at the White House.",
      "But some of the industry\u2019s biggest names, often brash and outspoken, have kept mostly mum on Trump\u2019s meme coins and other projects.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to really comment on President Trump\u2019s activity,\u201d Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said at a recent public event.",
      "Meanwhile, a top legislative priority for crypto-backers, a bill clarifying how digital assets are to be regulated, has advanced in the Senate. But some Democrats have tried to stall other pro-crypto legislation over the president's personal dealings.",
      "\u201cNever in American history has a sitting president so blatantly violated the ethics laws,\u201d Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts said during a contentious House hearing earlier this month.",
      "The White House referred questions about dinner attendees to the Trump Organization, which didn't provide a list of who is coming.",

      "It\u2019s crunch time for the maker of Levi\u2019s and Wrangler jeans in Kenya\u2019s capital",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- It's crunch time for the maker of Levi's and Wrangler jeans in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi. Hundreds of sewing machines whir in a crowded, air-conditioned factory. On another floor, workers pack clothes destined for the U.S. market.",
      "The fate of about 16,000 workers in the factory at the United Aryan export processing zone hangs in the balance. In September, a duty-free trade agreement between Kenya and the United States could expire under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or AGOA.",
      "The factory's founder, Pankaj Bedi, said manufacturers would be unable to compete well in the U.S. market if the AGOA agreement is not renewed, due to the difficult business environment in sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "Without AGOA \u2014 meant to benefit African nations that meet certain U.S. expectations in areas including governance and human rights \u2014 many Kenyan goods would no longer have duty-free access to the U.S. market. And they would be exposed to the uncertainty of the Trump administration\u2019s global tariff campaign.",
      "It's a concern across the continent. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, speaking to journalists after his Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump, noted that AGOA is \u201cgoing to be further discussed ... it is top of mind for them as well\u201d in the U.S. administration.",
      "Bedi said his business has benefited from 25 years of the AGOA agreement but will not survive if the deal is not extended again.",
      "\u201cThis time around, we are hoping that President Trump will pass it for a longer period, then a long-term strategy can come in play,\" he said. The longest extension has been for a decade.",
      "In making his pitch, Bedi said he believes that Africa offers the perfect alternative sourcing to Asia with its large and youthful workforce. Seventy percent of people in sub-Saharan Africa are under 30, according to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cI think the real shift of supply chain will happen, and Africa is the last frontier. We cannot go to the moon and start manufacturing there,\" Bedi said.",
      "Kenya\u2019s government would not comment on the deal or why it might be under threat.",
      "Economist Wangari Muikia said the new U.S. tariffs reflect a shift towards reviving American manufacturing, \u201cconsistent with Trump\u2019s priority to re-shore jobs,\u201d but warned that ending AGOA may \u201cstrain diplomatic ties and weaken American soft power.\u201d",
      "African governments have promoted AGOA as a major job creation avenue.",
      "In Kenya, AGOA has led to the creation of 66,000 jobs since the program began in 2000, according to government statistics published in 2024. Kenya\u2019s overall unemployment rate is 12.7%, but the rate among those under 35 is 67% \u2014 part of a wider issue for much of Africa\u2019s booming young population.",
      "In 2023, Kenya\u2019s total exports under AGOA including agricultural products, apparel and handicrafts were worth $510 million, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. United Aryan said it exports an average of 8 million jeans annually from Kenya to the U.S.",
      "But some African governments and leaders have objected to AGOA's conditions. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni criticized the program after it was used in 2023 to pressure him on his stance on homosexuality.",
      "Kenya\u2019s former ambassador to the U.N., Martin Kimani, said in an interview with The Associated Press that he believes AGOA\u2019s unpredictability has not been good for the economy.",
      "\u201cThe real measure of a trade regime is its predictability and its integration into long-term production,\" he said. \u201cThe tariffs and the program\u2019s upcoming expiration signal that AGOA is not a stable foundation for African industrial growth.\u201d",
      "If Kenya\u2019s AGOA deal isn\u2019t extended, the country will need to look for alternative markets like the African Continental Free Trade Area to ensure jobs are not lost and manufacturers keep exporting goods, said economist James Shikwati, founder and director of The Inter Region Economic Network.",
      "The continental free trade area has shortcomings that include underdeveloped infrastructure that makes it expensive to transport goods, mistrust that makes it hard for some countries to be fully open to trading with neighbors and a lack of strong institutions that can mediate trade disputes.",
      "Judging by the Trump administration\u2019s recent trade-related policies, every trade partner will need to reevaluate its engagement with the U.S., Shikwati added.",
      "For those whose jobs could be affected, there is concern.",
      "United Aryan employee Valdes Samora hopes to keep the sewing machines humming, and that livelihoods will not be lost after September.",
      "The 59-year-old father of nine has been working at the company for two decades. His wife also works there. Workers are paid an average of $200 per month, in a country where the minimum wage is $115.",

      "Republicans have made several late changes to their tax cut and immigration bill",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans made several eleventh-hour changes to their massive tax cut and immigration bill as they tried to win over GOP holdouts and pass the bill through the House.",
      "The revisions were unveiled late Wednesday evening, just before the House launched into an all-night session to debate and vote on the bill. President Donald Trump has urged Republicans to get behind the legislation, which enacts some of his campaign promises.",
      "If the bill clears the House, it would move to the Senate for further consideration.",
      "Among the changes that House Republicans made:",
      "\u2014 They removed the sections that authorized the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands in Nevada and Utah. Some Republican lawmakers from Western states had objected to the sales.",
      "\u2014 They changed the name of the new investment accounts that parents or guardians could open with a $1,000 contribution from the federal government for babies born between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2028. Instead of being named \u201cMAGA\u201d accounts, they will be named \u201cTrump\u201d accounts.",
      "\u2014 They accelerated the implementation of a new work requirement for certain able-bodied Medicaid beneficiaries to Dec. 31, 2026. The work requirement had been set to begin on Jan. 1, 2029. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the original date for the work requirements was meant to give states adequate time to get new systems in place, but some Republicans objected, saying the work requirements needed to start more quickly.",
      "\u2014 The revised bill quadruples the cap on the state and local tax deduction to $40,000 for households with incomes up to $500,000, with the deduction gradually phasing down for taxpayers above that income threshold. Also, the cap and income threshold will increase 1% annually over 10 years, which is generally below the rate of inflation. Increasing what is known as the SALT cap was a big issue that divided the Republican conference. The current cap is $10,000. GOP leaders agreed to a higher amount to win over support from Republicans in New York, New Jersey and California.",
      "\u2014 A new provision in the bill deregulates gun silencers by removing them from the national registry regulated under the National Firearms Act. The registry contains information on machine guns, certain short-barreled rifles and shotguns and silencers. The bill already looked to remove a $200 excise tax on silencers.",
      "\u2014 Republicans removed a section of the bill that would change the calculations for federal workers' retirement pensions. Annuities will continue to be based on the average of the highest three years of income. The GOP had been looking to save money by changing the calculation so that it would be based on a worker's highest five years of income.",
      "\u2014 The bill creates a $12 billion fund for the Homeland Security secretary to provide grants to reimburse states for costs of detention and removal of migrants and other border security efforts.",
      "\u2014 The legislation accelerates the Inflation Reduction Act tax credit phaseout for wind, solar and battery storage to 2028.",

      "Senate Republicans have voted to establish a new precedent that will allow them to roll back clean air standards in California, including a rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans on Wednesday voted to establish a new precedent that will allow them to roll back vehicle emission standards in California, including a rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.",
      "The winding series of Senate procedural votes that went late into the evening could have profound implications for California\u2019s longstanding efforts to reduce air pollution. It also established a new, narrow exception to the Senate filibuster even as Republicans have insisted that they won\u2019t try to change Senate rules.",
      "Democrats strongly objected to the move, delaying the votes for hours as Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cleared the way procedurally for Republicans to bring up three House-passed resolutions that would block the rules. The Senate could pass the resolutions later this week.",
      "At issue are the three California rules \u2014 phasing out gas-powered cars, cutting tailpipe emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and curbing smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "Republicans say the phase out of gas-powered cars, along with the other rules, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation\u2019s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate. Democrats charge that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and say that California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Thune said this week that the waivers \u201cgo far beyond the scope Congress contemplated in the Clean Air Act\u201d and said they \u201cendanger consumers, our economy and our nation\u2019s energy supply.\u201d",
      "Also at issue is the Senate as an institution, and longstanding filibuster rules that both parties have rolled back over the last two decades. While the Republicans\u2019 effort is narrow, it is one of several increasingly partisan efforts to push legislation through the Senate on party-line votes.",
      "Through the series of votes Wednesday, Republicans set precedent for the Senate to reject the state EPA waivers with a simple majority vote. They made that move even after the Senate parliamentarian agreed with the Government Accountability Office that California\u2019s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances.",
      "\u201cRepublicans tonight cross a point of no return for the Senate, expanding what this chamber can do at a majority threshold,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor as he moved to delay the votes. He called the Republicans \u201cfair-weather institutionalists.\u201d",
      "Both parties have made major moves to roll back the filibuster \u2014 which requires a 60-vote threshold \u2014 in recent years.",
      "Democrats voted in 2013, under President Barack Obama, to lower the vote threshold to a simple majority for all presidential nominees, with the exception of the Supreme Court. In 2017, during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, Republicans rolled back the remaining filibuster rules to confirm Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, a rule that Democrats maintained in confirming Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in 2022. That same year, Democrats unsuccessfully attempted to roll back the legislative filibuster but were thwarted by some in their own party who opposed the move.",
      "Republicans have argued this week that they are simply reinforcing Senate rules, and federal laws, that are already in place.",
      "\u201cWe are not talking about doing anything to erode the institutional character of the Senate; in fact, we are talking about preserving the Senate\u2019s prerogatives,\" Thune said.",
      "The votes to roll back California standards come after years of Republican efforts to block them. The Trump administration in 2019 revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its own emissions standards, but President Joe Biden later restored the state\u2019s authority.",
      "Republicans have argued that the rules effectively dictate standards for the whole country, imposing what would eventually be a nationwide electric vehicle mandate. Around a dozen states have already followed California\u2019s lead.",
      "California for decades has been given the authority to adopt vehicle emissions standards that are stricter than the federal government\u2019s. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.",
      "The Biden administration approved the state\u2019s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.",
      "Biden\u2019s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.",
      "Newsom has evoked Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, who signed landmark environmental laws, as he has fought congressional Republicans and the Trump administration on the issue.",
      "\u201cThe United States Senate has a choice: cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for,\u201d he said this week.",

      "The government regularly sells such bonds, which is how it borrows money to pay its bills. In this auction, the U.S. government had to pay a yield as high as 5.047% to attract enough buyers to lend it a total of $16 billion over 20 years.",
      "That helped push up yields for all kinds of other Treasurys, including the more widely followed 10-year Treasury. Its yield climbed to 4.59% from 4.48% late Tuesday and from just 4.01% early last month. That\u2019s a notable move in the bond market.",

      "\u201cAI technology is amazing and can be used for so many wonderful purposes,\u201d McBride told the panel. \u201cBut like all great technologies, it can also be abused, in this case by stealing people\u2019s voices and likenesses to scare and defraud families, manipulate the images of young girls in ways that are shocking to say the least, impersonate government officials, or make phony recordings posing as artists like me.\u201d",
      "The No Fakes Act would also hold platforms liable if they knew a replica was not authorized, while excluding certain digital replicas from coverage based on First Amendment protections. It would also establish a notice-and-takedown process so victims of unauthorized deepfakes \u201chave an avenue to get online platforms to take down the deepfake,\u201d the bill's sponsors said last month.",
      "The bill would address the use of non-consensual digital replicas in audiovisual works, images, or sound recordings.",
      "Nearly 400 artists, actors and performers have signed on in support of the legislation, according to the Human Artistry Campaign, which advocates for responsible AI use, including LeAnn Rimes, Bette Midler, Missy Elliott, Scarlett Johansson and Sean Astin.",
      "The testimony comes two days after President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act, bipartisan legislation that enacted stricter penalties for the distribution of non-consensual intimate imagery, sometimes called \u201crevenge porn,\u201d as well as deepfakes created by AI.",
      "Mitch Glazier, CEO of the RIAA, said that the No Fakes act is \u201cthe perfect next step to build on\u201d that law.",
      "\u201cIt provides a remedy to victims of invasive harms that go beyond the intimate images addressed by that legislation, protecting artists like Martina from non-consensual deepfakes and voice clones that breach the trust she has built with millions of fans,\u201d he said, adding that it \u201cempowers individuals to have unlawful deepfakes removed as soon as a platform is able without requiring anyone to hire lawyers or go to court.\u201d",
      "Suzana Carlos, head of music policy at YouTube, added that the bill would protect the credibility of online content. AI regulation should not penalize companies for providing tools that can be used for permitted and non-permitted uses, she said in written testimony, prior to addressing the subcommittee.",
      "The legislation offers a workable, tech-neutral and comprehensive legal solution, she said, and would streamline global operations for platforms like YouTube while empowering musicians and rights holders to manage their IP. Platforms have a responsibility to address the challenges posed by AI-generated content, she added.",
      "\u201cYouTube largely supports this bill because we see the incredible opportunity to of AI, but we also recognize those harms, and we believe that AI needs to be deployed responsibly,\u201d she said.",

      "Short-term lender Klarna says more customers are having trouble repaying their \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d loans",
      "NEW YORK -- More Klarna customers are having trouble repaying their \u201cbuy now, pay later\" loans, the short-term lender said this week. The disclosure corresponded with reports by lending platforms Bankrate and LendingTree, which cited an increasing share of all \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d users saying they had fallen behind on payments.",
      "The late or missed installments are a sign of faltering financial health among a segment of the US population, some analysts say, as the nation's total consumer debt rises to a record $18.2 trillion and the Trump administration moves to collect on federal student loans.",
      "Shoppers who opt to finance purchases through BNPL services tend to be younger than the average consumer, and a study from the Federal Reserve last year said Black and Hispanic women were especially likely to use the plans, which customers of all income levels are increasingly adopting.",
      "\u201cWhile BNPL provides credit to financially vulnerable consumers, these same consumers may be overextending themselves,\u201d the authors of the Federal Reserve study wrote. \u201cThis concern is consistent with previous research that has shown consumers spend more when BNPL is offered when checking out and that BNPL use leads to an increase in overdraft fees and credit card interest payments and fees.\"",
      "As Klarna grows its user base and revenue, the Swedish company said its first-quarter consumer credit losses rose 17% compared to the January-March period of last year, to $136 million.",
      "A company spokesperson said in a statement that the increase largely reflected the higher number of loans Klarna made year over year. The percentage of its loans at a global level that went unpaid in the first quarter grew from 0.51% in 2024 to 0.54% this year, and the company sees \u201cno sign of a weakened U.S. consumer,\u201d he said.",
      "Buy now, pay later plans generally let consumers split payments for purchases into four or fewer installments, often with a down payment at checkout. The loans are typically marketed as zero-interest, and most require no credit check or a soft credit check.",
      "BNPL providers promote the plans as a safer alternative to traditional credit cards when interest rates are high. The popularity of the deferred payment plans, and the expanding ways customers can use them, have also sparked public attention.",
      "When Klarna announced a partnership with DoorDash in March, the news led to online comments about Americans taking out loans to buy takeout food. Similar skepticism emerged when Billboard revealed that more than half of Coachella attendees used installment plans to finance their tickets to the music festival.",
      "An April report from LendingTree said about four in ten users of buy now, pay later plans said they had made late payments in the past year, up from one in three last year. According to a May report from Bankrate, about one in four users of the loans chose them because they were easier to get than traditional credit cards.",
      "The six largest BNPL providers \u2014 Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal, Sezzle, and Zip \u2014 originated about 277.3 million loans for $33.8 billion in merchandise in 2022, or an amount equal to about 1% of credit card spending that year, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The federal agency said this month it did not intend to enforce a Biden-era regulation that was designed to put more boundaries around the fintech lenders.",
      "The rule treated buy now, pay later loans like traditional credit cards under the Truth In Lending Act, requiring disclosures, refund processing, a formal dispute process and other protections.",
      "The regulation, which took effect last year, also prevented borrowers from being forced into automatic payments or charged with multiple fees for the same missed payment.",
      "The Trump administration said its non-enforcement decision came \u201cin the interest of focusing resources on supporting hard-working American taxpayers\u201d and that it would \u201cinstead keep its enforcement and supervision resources focused on pressing threats to consumers, particularly servicemen and veterans.\u201d",
      "Consumer advocates maintain that without federal oversight, customers seeking refunds or in search of clear information about BNPL fee structures and interest rates will have less legal recourse.",
      "Industry watchers point to consumers taking out loans they can't afford to pay back as a top risk of BNPL use. Without credit bureaus keeping track of the new form of credit, there are fewer safeguards and less oversight.",
      "Justine Farrell, chair of the marketing department at the University of San Diego\u2019s Knauss School of Business, said that when consumers aren't able to make loan payments on time, it worsens the economic stress they're already experiencing.",
      "\u201cConsumers\u2019 financial positions feel more spread thin than they have in a long time,\u201d said Farrell, who studies consumer behavior and BNPL services. \u201cThe cost of food is continuing to go up, on top of rent and other goods ... so consumers are taking advantage of the ability to pay for items later.\"",
      "The Consumer Federation of America and other watchdog organizations have expressed concern about the rollback of BNPL regulation as the use of the loans continues to rise.",
      "\u201cBy taking a head-in-the-sand approach to the new universe of fintech loans, the new CFPB is once again favoring Big Tech at the expense of everyday people,\u201d said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Twelve states on Wednesday urged a federal court to strike down President Donald Trump's sweeping taxes on imports, saying he had exceeded his authority, left U.S. trade policy dependent on his whims and unleashed economic chaos.",
      "They are challenging tariffs that Trump imposed last month on most of the countries in the world in an effort to reverse America's massive and longstanding trade deficits. They are also targeting levies the president had earlier plastered on imports from Canada, China and Mexico to combat the illegal flow of immigrants and the synthetic opioids across the U.S. border.",
      "A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York on Wednesday heard arguments in the states\u2019 case. Last week, the trade court held a hearing in a similar challenge to Trump\u2019s tariffs brought by five small businesses.",
      "The court specifically deals with civil lawsuits involving international trade. Its decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington and ultimately to the Supreme Court, where the legal challenges to Trump\u2019 tariffs are widely expected to end up.",
      "At least seven lawsuits are challenging the levies, the centerpiece of Trump's trade policy.",
      "Declaring that the United States\u2019 trade deficits add up to a national emergency, Trump invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEPPA) and rolled out 10% tariffs on many countries on April 2 \u2014 \"Liberation Day,'' he called it. He imposed stiffer \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 tariffs of up to 50% on countries that sell more goods to the United States than the U.S. sells them. (Trump later suspended those higher tariffs for 90 days.)",
      "The states argue that the emergency economic powers act does not authorize the use of tariffs. Even if it did, they say, the trade deficit does not meet the law's requirement that an emergency be triggered only by an \u201cunusual and extraordinary threat.'' The U.S. has run a trade deficit with the rest of the world for 49 consecutive years. \u201cThis is not an unusual problem,\u2019\u2019 Brian Marshall, an Oregon state attorney, told the judges Wednesday.",
      "The Trump administration argues that courts approved President Richard Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the language used in IEPPA.",
      "Brett Shumate, the assistant U.S. attorney general representing the administration, argued Wednesday that only Congress, and not the courts, can determine the \u201cpolitical'' question of whether the president's rationale for declaring an emergency complies with the law. That argument led Judge Jane Restani to ask if courts were helpless to block the president's emergency declarations no matter how \u201dcrazy'' they were.",
      "Trump's Liberation Day tariffs shook global financial markets and led many economists to downgrade the outlook for U.S. economic growth. So far, though, the tariffs appear to have had little impact on the world's largest economy.",
      "The 12 states pursuing the case are Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont.",

      "The number of transactions across online and physical stores fell 2.4%, and the average ticket dropped 1.4%. Target said Tuesday that it couldn\u2019t reliably estimate the individual impact of each of the factors that were hurting its business.",
      "Target is setting up a new office to be led by Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke would focus on making faster decisions to help accelerate sales growth. Current Chief Strategy and Growth Officer Christina Hennington will move into a strategic adviser role.",
      "Target is also intensifying efforts to entice customers who are nervous about the economy and inflation. The retailer says it is offering 10,000 new items starting at $1 \u2014 with the majority under $20.",
      "\u201cI want to be clear,\u201d Target CEO Brian Cornell told reporters on a call Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re not satisfied with these results, so we\u2019re moving with urgency to navigate through this period of volatility ... We\u2019ve got to drive traffic back into our stores or visits to our site.\u201d",
      "Out of 35 merchandise categories including discretionary and essentials that the company tracks, it\u2019s gaining or maintaining market share in only 15, the company said. The company cited that there were some market share gains in women\u2019s swimwear, infant and toddler clothing, and active wear.",
      "The latest results underscore Target's ongoing struggle in recent years to revive sales particularly in nonessentials like fashion and home furnishings as competition grows more fierce with the likes of Walmart and Amazon. Target's shares have fallen more than 37% in the past 52 weeks.",
      "Target rival Walmart reported strong quarterly sales last week. The nation\u2019s largest retailer said it's already raised prices on some items due to tariffs and that more price hikes are on the way this summer when the back-to-school shopping season goes into high gear. For example, car seats made in China that currently sell for $350 at Walmart will likely cost customers another $100, executives said.",
      "Target didn\u2019t offer specifics on tariffs\u2019 impact on prices, but said that it was looking at different ways to offset those costs.",
      "\u201cWe look at competition,\u201d Cornell told reporters. \u201cWe make adjustments literally each and every week, so we\u2019re constantly adjusting pricing. Some are going up. Some will be reduced.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s threatened 145% import taxes on Chinese goods were reduced to 30% in a deal announced May 12, with some of the higher tariffs on pause for 90 days.",
      "Yet Americans were already pulling back on spending as they grow increasingly uneasy over the state of the U.S. economy. Companies including toy manufacturer Mattel, toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble have announced higher prices or plans to raise prices because of the trade war kicked of by the U.S.",
      "Walmart was able to dodge some of the tariff damage other retailers are suffering because groceries account for about 60% of its U.S. business. Target is more reliant on discretionary items like clothing and accessories, with less than a quarter of its sales coming from groceries.",
      "Target has reduced the number of its store-label products sourced from China to 30% now from 60% in 2017. The company is on its way to reducing that number to 25% by the end of next year, the company said. Target is shifting sourcing to Guatemala and Honduras and is looking to sourcing in the U.S.",
      "Target is being pressured on other fronts as well.",
      "The company in January said it would phase out a handful of DEI initiatives, including a program designed to help Black employees advance their careers and promote Black-owned businesses. Conservative activists and President Donald Trump have sought to dismantle DEI policies in the federal government, schools, and at private businesses.",
      "The pastor of a Georgia megachurch who led a nationwide 40-day boycott of Target stores in response called last month for a continuation of that effort.",
      "The Rev. Jamal Bryant is seeking a reinvigorated commitment from Target on diversity, and he wants more support from Target for Black-owned banks and businesses.",
      "Target earned $1.04 billion, or $2.27 per share, for the period ended May 3. That compares with $942 million, or $2.03 per share, in the year-ago period.",
      "Target operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people.",

      "U.S. funding cuts have hit a local language learning program in Mali that empowered thousands",
      "MOUNTOUGOULA, Mali -- For Aminata Doumbia, an 18-year-old Malian, the \u201cShifin ni Tagne\u201d project was a path for her life dreams. A phrase meaning \u201cour future\u201d in the country\u2019s main local language, it refers to a yearslong program aimed at teaching around 20,000 young Malians to read and write in their local languages.",
      "Backed by $25 million in funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, over five years, the project has now shut down following the Trump administration's decision to cut 90% of the agency\u2019s foreign aid.",
      "\u201cThe joy I felt when I was selected for this project has been replaced by sadness,\u201d said Doumbia in Mali's capital, Bamako.",
      "She had hoped to take advantage of the empowerment program to train as a pastry chef.",
      "\u201dI don\u2019t have any hope of realizing my dream (again),\" Doumbia said.",
      "Doumbia is among thousands of people who now find themselves stranded in Mali, a country ravaged by high poverty and insecurity levels and where 70% of the population of at least 22 million people haven\u2019t had the opportunity to learn to read and write, according to Sylla Fatoumata Ciss\u00e9, director of a government agency focusing on nonformal education and national languages in Mali.",
      "The USAID funding cut also came at a time when Mali\u2019s other development partners in Europe have withdrawn their support in the aftermath of the 2021 coup, which brought the current junta leader, Assimi Goita, to power.",
      "For many, the literacy project was the only path to literacy and empowerment.",
      "Once literate, program beneficiaries move on to the next stage, which involves the acquisition of vocational skills like hairdressing, carpentry, sewing, welding, and pastry-making, according to Modibo Sissoko, literacy supervisor at the Malian Association for Survival in the Sahel nonprofit involved in the \u201cShifin ni Tagne\u201d project.",
      "These skills enable the economically disadvantaged to create jobs for themselves, earn a living or support their families, Sissoko said.",
      "\u201cWith the teaching of mother tongues, it\u2019s possible to move quickly towards mass literacy among the population,\u201d said Issiaka Ballo, a professor and researcher in native languages at Mali's University of Bamako.",
      "On the other hand, \"only 30% of the population has been educated in French,\u201d the common language in the country, he added.",
      "USAID\u2019s involvement in Mali had made it the primary development partner of the government. The abrupt end of its assistance hit not only the literacy programs, but also others designed to increase adult education and expand the literacy project to public schools.",
      "The Gaoussou Dabo School in the Malian capital, Bamako, is among 1,000 schools that benefited from mother-tongue education thanks to funding from USAID.",
      "Teachers trained for the program last year continue to teach, but the monitoring and evaluation aspect of the program has been withdrawn.",
      "The funding cut was \"a big shock for us,\u201d said Amadi Ba, a counsellor at the Pedagogical Animation Center, which is in charge of the school in Bamako.",
      "In a country where local language-education relies solely on funding from Mali\u2019s development partners with little to no help from the government, concerns exceed its immediate impact on the education of children.",
      "In 2023, Mali's military government decided to make the country\u2019s native tongues the official languages in place of French, which then became the \u201cworking language.\u201d Official documents, including the constitution, the mining code and other texts, were then translated into the national languages.",
      "The USAID cut will \"certainly have a negative impact on the development of mother-tongue education, especially since it came in the middle of the school year,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 said.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t even had time to think about a mechanism to cushion the blow,\u201d she added.",
      "While it lasted, the program was beneficial to many in various ways.",
      "Oumou Traor\u00e9, a mother of two who grows onions and eggplants for a living, recalled how the training improved her farming business, particularly in pricing her goods in Bamako's Mountougoula district.",
      "\u201cSince I learned to calculate the weight of my onions and keep my accounts in my mother tongue, I\u2019ve started selling my onions myself,\u201d said Traore, 29. \u201cI now earn $95 instead of the $60 I used to get. This has encouraged me to grow other vegetables.\u201d",
      "The 2021 coup resulted in the country turning to Russia as a key ally after severing ties with the West, including the U.S., which at some point was Mali's leading foreign aid donor.",
      "While some experts have said the withdrawal of U.S. aid may open the door for rivals such as Russia, whose mercenaries have been accused of human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings in the country, some say USAID has left a hole too large to be filled by others.",
      "\u201cIt will be difficult to find takers for the projects left behind by USAID,\u201d said Fatimata Tour\u00e9, a development specialist and director of the Research, Study and Training Group civic group in Mali.",

      "President Donald Trump isn\u2019t the only one who wrapped up a Middle East tour in recent days",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump isn't the only one who wrapped up a Middle East tour in recent days. A private jet carrying Nvidia's CEO trailed Air Force One across the region. Oil executives and bankers followed, too, as American executives dropped everything \u2014 canceling longstanding obligations and zooming into board meetings back home \u2014 to cozy up to Trump and bolster the image he tried to sell on his first major foreign trip.",
      "With Trump back in the White House, a jaunt with the president or a stop in the Oval Office is now as routine for America's business leaders as a speech to an industry conference.",
      "Corporate titans are spending more time than ever working to curry favor with the administration as part of their effort to score relief from regulations \u2014 and tariffs \u2014 from the transactional president. He, in turn, is happy to use them as supporting cast members as he tries to project the economy as booming at a time when growth is slowing.",
      "But putting in time with the U.S. president has not fully insulated companies such as Apple, Amazon, Walmart and others from Trump's anger. It's a sign that the public commitments they make to create U.S. jobs may be doing more to burnish the president's image than to protect their own profitability.",
      "In private, CEOs and executives on Trump\u2019s trip marveled at how they came to be unofficial members of the president's traveling party, their private jets hopscotching across the Gulf as Trump visited Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. They said they had little choice but to get close to Trump, especially as he wields his tariff powers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just thinking we have a president of the United States doing the selling,\u201d Trump said in Abu Dhabi, standing alongside the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Tomislav Mihaljevic, and working in a dig at his presidential predecessor, Joe Biden. \u201cYou think Biden would be doing it? I don\u2019t think so. But I think it's so important. I have to be a cheerleader for our country.\u201d",
      "The host countries and the White House pulled together business conferences in a matter of weeks to give Trump a stage to show off his dealmaking on the trip. Business leaders signed partnership agreements and touted mutual investments almost as a performance for Trump and the region's powerful ruling elites, while using the opportunity to network and share their mutual bemusement that this was now part of their job portfolio.",
      "Trump has demonstrated that he steers business to those who ingratiate themselves to him \u2014 look no further than his promotion of Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla \u2014 and punishes those who don\u2019t, like Amazon during Trump\u2019s first term and law firms, universities and a growing list of institutions in his second.",
      "\u201cHe wants the vanity of people coming in to kiss his ring,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, CEO of Yale University\u2019s Chief Executive Leadership Institute. He said the behavior by CEOs, while obsequious, often resulted in better treatment and free publicity from the government.",
      "It's not just U.S. business people paying heed. On Monday, a French executive turned up in the Oval Office with Trump.",
      "The president thanked Bernard Arnault's French luxury company LVMH for the \u201cMedals of Sacrifice\u201d made by its subsidiary, Tiffany & Co., as Trump presented them to the families of three sheriff\u2019s deputies from Palm Beach County, Florida, who were killed in the line of duty.",
      "LVMH stock has fallen this year as tariffs threaten a business that sells everything from designer handbags to champagne. But Trump had only the fondest of praise as he told Arnault's son, Alexandre, who was representing the company: \"Thank you very much, Alexandre. I appreciate that you came. He came all the way from France.\"",
      "Compared to the Biden administration, CEOs and executives at America's most powerful companies have felt obligated to stay in frequent contact with Trump's team. But the contact isn't a guarantee of meaningful influence with the president.",
      "Executives at multiple companies, insisting on anonymity to describe private interactions, said it wasn't always clear who in Trump's orbit could best relay their views on tariffs, regulations and taxes to the president. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has emerged as their preferred go-between, but that hasn't completely immunized the companies from attacks by Trump.",
      "Walmart CEO Doug McMillon had a previously scheduled call on Saturday with Bessent, only to separately become the target of Trump's ire in a social media post in which the president said America's largest retailer should \u201ceat\u201d the cost of his tariffs.",
      "Trump in April called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who had attended his inaugural, after a report that the online outlet was considering displaying on product listings the impact of Trump's tariffs on prices. Amazon had explored the possibility for its Amazon Haul service, which competes against China-founded discounters Temu and Shein, but had chosen not to do so.",
      "The heads of General Motors, Ford and Stellantis met with Trump to outline how his tariffs would disrupt automaking. Trump gave them some reprieves on domestic vehicles with foreign parts not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, but he still has a 25% tax on imported steel and aluminum.",
      "The president portrayed his tariff changes last April as a temporary bridge so that automakers would increase production domestically.",
      "\u201cWe just wanted to help them during this little transition, short term,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to penalize them. \u201d",
      "Trump repeatedly praised Apple after its $500 billion commitment for investments in the United States. But the company also plans to shift more iPhone production to India in response to the China tariffs \u2014 and that has frustrated Trump.",
      "Speaking in Qatar, Trump recalled a conversation with Apple CEO Tim Cook: \u201cI said to him: \u2018My friend, I treated you very good. You\u2019re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you\u2019re building all over India. I don\u2019t want you building in India.'\u201d",
      "By contrast, JP Morgan Chase CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon ended up influencing Trump's tariff policies by going on TV.",
      "The banker on April 9 was interviewed on Fox Business Network's \u201cMornings with Maria\" as financial markets were panicking because of Trump's tariffs. Dimon said markets would improve if Trump could negotiate trade agreements.",
      "\u201cTake a deep breath,\" Dimon said. \"Negotiate some trade deals. That's the best thing they can do.\u201d",
      "His statements resonated with Trump, who pulled back his tariffs later that day to a baseline 10% so that negotiations could occur for 90 days.",
      "Trump later recounted, \u201cI watched Jamie Dimon on Maria Bartiromo\u2019s show this morning, and he was very good.\"",

      "The U.S. Senate is moving forward with an effort to block California's nation-leading standards for vehicle emissions",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Congress may stop California from implementing its first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.",
      "A Senate vote expected as soon as this week could end the nation's most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump's administration doubles down on fossil fuels.",
      "California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.",
      "The Republican-controlled Congress is targeting three California waivers that set stricter emissions rules than the federal government. The House voted to block them several weeks ago, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune said his chamber would take up a similar effort this week, even though the Senate Parliamentarian and the U.S. Government Accountability Office say California\u2019s policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",
      "Thune said California's \u201care an improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority and would endanger consumers, our economy, and our nation\u2019s energy supply.\u201d",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state air regulators say what lawmakers are doing is illegal and they will likely sue if the measure advances.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency has let the state adopt stricter emissions standards for decades, and other states can sign on to those rules.",
      "California has some of the nation's worst air pollution, and the waivers date back to efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to fight smog in Los Angeles.",
      "Trump rescinded California\u2019s ability to enforce its standards during his first term, but President Joe Biden\u2019s administration restored it in 2022.",
      "Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. State air regulators formalized the rules in 2022, and the federal government allowed them to move forward last year.",
      "The rule requires automakers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission cars, pickup trucks and SUVs over the next decade. Electric vehicles would have to make up 43% of new sales by 2027, 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. People would still be able to buy used gas-powered cars, plug-in hybrids or hydrogen-powered vehicles.",
      "California passed another rule in 2020 to phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles, including box trucks, semitrailers and large pickups. Depending on class, zero-emission trucks will have to make up 40% to 75% of sales by 2035. The Biden administration approved that policy in 2023.",
      "The third regulation targeted by Congress would reduce smog-forming emissions from trucks. The rule revamped a testing program to ensure heavy-duty vehicles comply with emissions standards and set stricter standards to limit pollution from nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which pose public health risks.",
      "New York, Colorado and New Mexico are among the states that announced plans to follow all three of the policies.",
      "Several automakers, including Honda, Ford and Volkswagen, signed deals with California to follow some of the state's tailpipe emission standards. But the companies have not committed to complying with the 2035 mandate on gas-powered cars if it gets blocked and did not respond to requests for comment on the Senate's upcoming vote.",
      "The National Automobile Dealers Association urged the Senate to pass the measure.",
      "\u201cBanning gas and hybrid cars is a national issue that should be decided by Congress, not an unelected state agency,\" Mike Stanton, the group's president and CEO, wrote in a letter.",
      "The Safe Roads Coalition, which represents towing and truck companies, said the medium- and heavy-duty truck rule is unfeasible and should be blocked.",
      "\u201cWhile transitioning combustion engines to electric is well-intended, unworkable regulations threaten roadside services for millions of American motorists,\u201d said Josh Lovelace, the group's national director.",
      "Thune, the Senate majority leader, said the nation's grid can't handle California's plans. It is a concern shared by other critics, who point to California's struggle several summers ago to maintain consistent power during a heat wave.",
      "\u201cOur already shaky electric grid would quickly face huge new burdens from a surge in electric vehicles,\u201d he said in a statement announcing the vote.",
      "Newsom's administration argues the state is on its way to building out an electric grid and charging infrastructure that can support many more electric vehicles. Broadly, California has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2045.",
      "But the state remains far short of what is eventually needed. California has about 84,000 public electric vehicle chargers in the state but needs 1.2 million by 2030 to support the EV transition, according to the California Energy Commission. The Trump administration directed states earlier this year to stop spending money approved under Biden to help build electric vehicle charges across the U.S. More than a dozen states are suing the federal government over the effort.",
      "Newsom has also recently touted the state's growing battery storage capacity. Neither the commission nor the California Air Resources Board responded to questions about how much the state's electric grid must grow to support the power demand expected from the state's transition. But the state has said it needs at least four times more wind and solar power to meet 2045 energy demands and that the grid must grow at an \u201cunprecedented rate.\u201d",
      "Timothy Johnson, a professor of energy and the environment at Duke University, said most regions of the U.S. can generate enough power or add enough to meet EV charging demand, but local power lines and transformers could be overloaded.",
      "Eleven other states, plus Washington, D.C., have adopted California's plan to phase out new gas-powered cars, according to the air board. Several more have adopted the state's previous zero-emission vehicle standards.",
      "But some of those states are already backing away.",
      "Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott last week paused enforcement of electric vehicle sales targets that follow California's, saying the pace wasn't realistic. In Delaware, Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer has said he wants to rescind the state's EV mandate. Other states still appear to be moving ahead.",

      "Around 280 Bangladeshi migrant workers are demanding unpaid wages from a Malaysian firm which was a supplier to big Japanese companies",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Around 280 Bangladeshi migrant workers in Malaysia are demanding hundreds of thousands of dollars in back wages and other money owed to them after their former employer, a plastic parts supplier to big Japanese companies, closed down.",
      "The workers at Kawaguchi Manufacturing's factory in Port Klang, Malaysia's largest port city, were left stranded when the company withheld their wages for up to eight months before shutting down late last year. The workers have filed complaints in Malaysia and back home in Bangladesh.",
      "Such disputes have become a diplomatic sore point between Bangladesh and Malaysia, drawing scrutiny on a small but powerful group of recruitment agencies and middlemen who monopolize such jobs.",
      "Asif Nazrul, an adviser to Bangladesh\u2019s expatriate welfare ministry, met with Malaysia\u2019s Home Minister Steven Sim Chee Keong in Kuala Lumpur last week. Officials were due to meet again Wednesday in Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital.",
      "The interim government that took over in Bangladesh after the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has placed a higher priority on the plight of migrant workers who often get trapped in debt after paying exorbitant recruitment fees to work in dismal conditions for little pay.",
      "Labor advocates say the situation is worsening as more people from across South Asia, sometimes losing their livelihoods due to climate change, seek work in Southeast Asia.",
      "Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have accelerated that trend as factories move from China to places in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and elsewhere.",
      "The workers have received just 251,000 ringgit ($58,101) of the more than 3 million ringgit ($694,444) in back wages that a Malaysian labor tribunal ordered Kawaguchi to pay. Many have found new jobs but still have heavy debts after borrowing money to pay hefty recruitment fees.",
      "The workers allege they were sometimes required to work without breaks for 24-hour shifts and on holidays with no paid overtime, making plastic casings for televisions and air conditioners. They say Kawaguchi confiscated their passports, provided inadequate housing and delayed their visa renewals.",
      "The factory shut down in December, soon after Sony Group and Panasonic Holdings Corp., two of Kawaguchi's main customers, halted their orders in response to the allegations against their supplier.",
      "After the factory closed, the workers say Malaysian officials forcibly sent many of them to another city some 360 kilometers (220 miles) away to toil in new factory jobs without giving them any information. They were kept in filthy shipping containers converted into dormitories. Another 80 workers were told to work in palm oil plantations \u2014 but refused.",
      "Most made their way back to Port Klang to seek work and chip away at the debts that have been accumulating. It took nearly three months for them to get permission from the Malaysian government to switch jobs.",
      "The Associated Press got no response to multiple requests to Kawaguchi for comment. Malaysia's labor department also didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Md Kabir Hossain\u2019s case is typical. The 19-year-old said he borrowed more than $4,000 to get to Malaysia from his hometown Rangpur in Bangladesh in November 2023, after his family\u2019s textile shop began to fail. The family\u2019s sole wage earner, he defaulted on one of his loans and wasn\u2019t able to send money back home, as his family struggled to keep their shop going.",
      "\u201cI am constantly worried about what will happen to my family,\u201d he said.",
      "Another worker, Parvez Azam said he didn't know how much longer he could keep going. \u201cIf this goes on, we'll die here,\u201d he said.",
      "Factories in Malaysia and other countries in Southeast Asia rely on migrant workers, often from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal, to fill labor-intensive jobs in manufacturing, plantations, or construction that local workers won't perform for the wages offered.",
      "The cost of recruitment and migration from Bangladesh to Malaysia is among the most expensive in the world, according to the International Labor Organization\u2019s office in Bangladesh.",
      "The official recruitment fee is about $650 per worker. But all the workers at Kawaguchi said they paid nearly $5,000. The loans they took to pay such sums has pushed them into debt bondage as they labor to pay off ever mounting debts.",
      "In 2023, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Malaysia should end use of recruitment agents, describing the system as \u201cmodern slavery.\u201d But a 2024 study of Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia found that more than 70% had spent at least half of their wages to pay off recruitment debts. Most have at least two loans and many said they were misled about their wages.",
      "Nearly everyone who migrates overseas from Bangladesh, one of the countries most affected by climate change, has suffered at least one form of modern slavery, like withholding of wages or physical violence, according to a study by the London-based think tank International Institute for Environment and Development.",
      "Mohamad Mohosin, 38, said he moved to Malaysia when his crops failed because of extreme weather. After going months without being paid his debt has spiraled, forcing his large family in Bangladesh to borrow still more money. \u201cMy family is in trouble,\u201d he said.",
      "Among migrant workers, Bangladeshis often end up in the riskiest jobs, such as plantation work where they can catch mosquito-borne diseases, or physically demanding factory or construction roles, where the likelihood of accidents is higher, said Shariful Islam Hasan of BRAC.",
      "\u201cDespite the high risk and the high migration cost, salaries are too low,\u201d he said.",
      "Panasonic, Sony and Daikin, three of Kawaguchi's former main customers among about a dozen, agreed to cover an estimated $1.3 million of the recruitment costs paid by the workers. It\u2019s unclear how much each company is contributing.",
      "\"This doesn't cover all the workers' costs, including interest rates of up to 30% they must pay on their loans,\" said Andy Hall, a British labor activist who has been helping the workers. Many have also defaulted on their debts after going months without wages.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re absolutely desperate and they\u2019re at very high risk of falling into even worse situations,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Daikin settled with the workers, agreeing to pay them more, although it says it accounted for only 1% to 2% of Kawaguchi's orders. The air conditioner manufacturer told AP it was working with human rights groups to resolve any remaining issues.",
      "Panasonic said it was \u201cproportionally reimbursing the recruitment fees\u201d paid by workers and had asked Kawaguchi to correct labor violations. It said it tried to support Kawaguchi but had to disengage from the company due to its financial woes and anticipated production problems.",
      "Sony told AP its code of conduct prohibits abusive labor practices in its supply chain. After investigating, it demanded corrective measures. \u201cWhen our demands were not satisfied, we terminated our relationship with this supplier,\u201d it said.",
      "The workers are seeking more help and lawyer Terry Collingsworth of U.S.-based International Rights Advocates, who is representing them, said that they were in discussions with Sony and Panasonic.",
      "\"We are not asking you to admit liability. We are asking you to comply with your public commitment to remediate when one of your suppliers violates the human rights of its workers,\u201d said a Jan. 16 letter from Collingsworth to Sony and Panasonic.",

      "Leading financial officials from the world\u2019s richest countries are gathering in a Canadian mountain resort this week for what may prove a contentious meeting in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs",
      "BANFF, Canada -- Leading financial officials from the world's richest countries are gathering in a Canadian mountain resort this week for what may prove a contentious meeting in the wake of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "The annual meetings of the Group of 7 finance ministers, known as the G7, are typically congenial and in previous years have produced joint commitments to combat inflation and counter the COVID pandemic. There may be less agreement this year as Trump's tariffs threaten to slow growth in many of the gathered nations, including host Canada, which Trump has also suggested become a potential 51st state.",
      "\u201cI expect it will be somewhat of a testy conversation among the G7 officials,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University and former top official at the International Monetary Fund. \u201cThis is a very difficult period for the relationships among the G7 countries.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has reached an initial trade deal with one G7 member, the United Kingdom, and is engaged in talks with Japan and the European Union. But Canada still faces 25% duties on many of its exports to the United States, including autos, and the other three G7 members \u2014 France, Germany, and Italy \u2014 all face a baseline tariff of 10% on all their exports as part of the European Union.",
      "It will be the first formal meeting of the G7 attended by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who participated in a brief G7 gathering last month on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington, D.C. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will also attend along with central bank governors from the other G7 nations.",
      "\u201cThe message from colleagues is pretty clear is that a free and fair and a rules-based multilateral trading system, is a system in which we all win,\u201d Francois-Philippe Champagne, Canada\u2019s minister of finance, said Tuesday.",
      "While many finance ministers gathered in Banff this week will likely seek one-on-one meetings with Bessent, it's unlikely any trade deals will be reached, according to a person briefed on preparations for the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not have authorization to speak about it publicly.",
      "Instead, the finance officials will seek to smooth the way toward any agreements before a meeting of the heads of state of the G7 countries in June in nearby Kananaskis, Canada.",
      "Bessent may be able to bring a more conciliatory tone to the meetings, Prasad said, as he is often seen as a relatively moderating influence on tariffs in the Trump White House.",
      "And there will likely be some areas of agreement, particularly around the Trump administration's goal to address what it calls \u201cglobal imbalances\u201d in world trade, a reference to the United States' large annual trade deficits, which reflects that it imports more than it exports. The White House sees China as the key driver of such imbalances. China has a large trade surplus.",
      "\u201cIntentional policy choices by other countries have hollowed out America\u2019s manufacturing sector and undermined our critical supply chains, putting our national and economic security at risk,\u201d Bessent said in a speech last month during the IMF and World Bank meetings.",
      "The status of the U.S. dollar may also come up, at least in informal conversations. The dollar dropped in value unexpectedly last month after Trump unveiled his widespread tariffs, while the interest rate on Treasury bonds rose, a sign international investors may have been dumping American assets as confidence in the country's governance and economy eroded.",
      "\u201cIn the hallways, they\u2019re going to talk about nothing but tariffs and the dollar,\u201d said Steven Kamin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former senior economist at the Federal Reserve.",
      "At last year's meeting of G7 finance officials in Stresa, Italy, they agreed on a joint statement that said the members have a \u201cstrong commitment to a free, fair, and rules-based\u201d trading system. It's not yet clear whether they will be able to agree on such a statement this year.",
      "Another question hanging over the meetings will be whether the G7 can come to agreement on a new round of sanctions on Russia. The European Union and U.K. announced sanctions on Russian oil Tuesday, targeting Russia's \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of unregistered oil tankers that are shipping its oil and allowing it to fund its war with Ukraine.",
      "Proposals to lower a price cap on Russian oil, set as part of earlier rounds of international sanctions, down from its current level of $60 may also be discussed in meetings Wednesday.",
      "Yet the Trump administration, while it has called for greater sanctions on Russian oil, hasn't yet signed on to the new restrictions. Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday, and said the two countries would soon begin ceasefire talks, though no details were available.",
      "Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko will also attend the G7 meetings this week, though Ukraine is not a member.",
      "Daleep Singh, chief global economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former deputy national security adviser in the Biden administration, said the issue of Russian oil sanctions will be a key test of what unity remains in the G7.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for something to engender a just and lasting peace, oil sanctions are the place to look,\u201d he said.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan's agriculture minister was forced to resign Wednesday because of political fallout over recent comments that he \u201cnever had to buy rice\u201d because he got it from supporters as gifts. The resignation comes as the public struggles with record high prices of the country's traditional staple food.",
      "Taku Eto's comment, which many Japanese saw as out of touch with economic realities, came at a seminar Sunday for the Liberal Democratic Party, which leads an struggling minority government. The gaffe could be further trouble for the party before a national election in July. A major loss could mean a new government or could mean Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba would have to step down.",
      "\u201cI made an extremely inappropriate remark at a time when consumers are struggling with soaring rice prices,\u201d Eto told reporters after submitting his resignation at the prime minister\u2019s office. Eto's resignation was the first under Ishiba's leadership that began October.",
      "The government has released tons of rice from its emergency stockpile in recent months, but the latest agricultural ministry statistics show little impact from the move. Some supermarkets have started selling cheaper imported rice.",
      "Eto also sought to clarify the comments that got him in trouble. He said he does actually buy white rice himself and was not living on rice given as gifts. He said the gift comment referred to brown rice, which he wants people to become interested in because it can reach market faster.",
      "Ishiba appointed popular former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of a former prime minister, to lead the ministry, noting his experience in agriculture and fisheries policies and enthusiasm for reforms.",
      "Koizumi told reporters Ishiba instructed him to do everything to stabilize the rice supply and prices to address consumer concern.",
      "\u201cI was told to put rice before anything,\u201d Koizumi told reporters. \u201cAt this difficult time, I will do utmost to speedily tackle high rice price that people feel and worry in everyday life.\u201d He said he shares consumers' concerns as he feeds his children packaged instant rice sometimes.",
      "Ishiba, also a former farm minister, said he wants to strengthen Japan\u2019s food security and self-sufficiency. He has proposed agricultural reforms, including increased rice production and possible exports, though critics say he should urgently fix the ongoing rice problem first.",
      "Noting the rice situation, Ishiba said he suspects the rice price surge is \u201cnot a temporary but a structural problem.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt may not be easy to find an answer,\u201d he said, but repeated his pledge to do the utmost to ease consumers' difficulties and to reform rice policies.",
      "Koizumi said the measures so far have proved ineffective and that he will speed the effort as soon as he formally takes office later Wednesday.",
      "Party leaders plan to further grill Ishiba at a party leaders' debate at parliament scheduled later in the day.",
      "Japanese rice demand has decreased over recent decades as people's diets have diversified, but rice remains a staple food and integral part of Japanese culture and history.",
      "\u201cRice is the stable food for the Japanese. When its prices are rising every week, (Eto's) resignation is only natural,\u201d said Shizuko Oshima, 73.",
      "The shortfall started last August on panic buying following a government caution over preparedness for a major earthquake. The supply pressure eased after the autumn harvest, but a shortage and price increases hit again early this year.",
      "Officials have blamed the supply shortage on poor harvests because of hot weather in 2023 and higher fertilizer and other production costs, but some experts blame the government\u2019s long-term rice production policy.",
      "The unprecedented release from emergency rice stockpiles was seen in part as an attempt to figure out distribution problems. The government has denied there is now a rice shortage, but officials say it's a mystery why rice is not reaching consumers. Some experts say the rice shortage could be serious but it's difficult to trace rice as its distribution route has become so complex since the end of government control in 1995.",

      "Businesses face uncertainty after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to strip legal protections from 350,000 Venezuelans",
      "DORAL, Fla. -- As a business owner in the largest Venezuelan community in the United States, Wilmer Escaray is stressed and in shock. He is unsure what steps he should take after the Supreme Court allowed President Donald Trump to strip legal protections from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants.",
      "Escaray owns 15 restaurants and three markets, most of them in Doral, a city of 80,000 in the Miami area people known as \u201cLittle Venezuela\u201d or \u201cDoralzuela.\" At least 70% of Escaray's 150 employees and many of his customers are Venezuelan immigrants with Temporary Protected Status, also known as TPS.",
      "The Supreme Court on Monday lifted a federal judge\u2019s ruling that had paused the administration\u2019s plans to end TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially exposing them to deportation. The Department of Homeland Security welcomed the ruling but has given no details on when TPS is ending and what employers and beneficiaries should do.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration does not rest on its laurels. We will act in an expeditious manner,\u201d Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary, said Tuesday in a written response to questions about any expiration date for TPS after the court ruling and whether work permits were still valid.",
      "Like many U.S. business owners with Venezuelan employees, Escaray does not know how long his employees will have legal authorization to work or whether he will be able to help them.",
      "\u201cThe impact for the business will be really hard,\u201d said Escaray, a 37-year-old Venezuelan American who came to the U.S. to study in 2007 and opened his first restaurant six years later. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet what I am going to do. I have to discuss with my team, with my family to see what will be the plan.\u201d",
      "TPS allows people already in the U.S. to legally live and work here because their native countries are deemed unsafe for return due to natural disaster or civil strife. The Trump administration said immigrants were poorly vetted after the Biden administration dramatically expanded the designation.",
      "Immigration attorney Evelyn Alexandra Batista said the Supreme Court did not specifically address TPS-based work permits, and some work authorizations remain in effect. She warned, though, that there is no guarantee that they will remain valid because the Supreme Court could change this.",
      "\u201cThis means that employers and employees alike should be exploring all other alternative options as TPS was never meant to be permanent,\u201d said Batista, who has received hundreds of calls from TPS beneficiaries and companies looking for advice in the months since Trump returned to office and began his immigration crackdown.",
      "Among the options they are exploring, she said, are visas for people with extraordinary abilities, for people who make investments and for agricultural workers.",
      "Many TPS holders have requested asylum or other immigration benefits. It\u2019s not clear if people with pending requests will be allowed to stay in the U.S.",
      "Venezuela President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Tuesday condemned the withdrawal of TPS for Venezuelan immigrants.",
      "\u201cTPS was a minimal protection they had. Now it\u2019s been taken away from them,\u201d Maduro said in a televised government event.",
      "The American Business Immigration Coalition estimates that TPS holders add $31 billion to the U.S. economy through wages and spending power. There are no specific estimates of the impact of Venezuelans, although they make up the largest percentage of TPS beneficiaries.",
      "They work in hospitality, construction, agriculture, health care, retail, and food services.",
      "\u201cThis decision leaves business owners with limited options,\u201d said Rebecca Shi, CEO of the coalition.",

      "The European Union plans to provide emergency funds to help keep Radio Free Europe afloat after the Trump administration stopped grants to the pro-democracy media outlet",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union agreed Tuesday to provide emergency funds to help keep Radio Free Europe afloat after the Trump administration stopped grants to the pro-democracy media outlet, accusing it of promoting a news agenda with a liberal bias.",
      "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty started broadcasting during the Cold War. Its programs are aired in 27 languages in 23 countries across Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East. Its lawyers have been fighting the administration in court.",
      "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc\u2019s foreign ministers had agreed to a 5.5-million-euro ($6.2 million) contract to \u201csupport the vital work of Radio Free Europe.\u201d The \u201cshort-term emergency funding\u201d is a \u201csafety net\u201d for independent journalism, she said.",
      "Kallas said the EU would not be able to fill the organization's funding gap around the world, but that it can help the broadcaster to \u201cwork and function in those countries that are in our neighborhood and that are very much dependent on news coming from outside.\u201d",
      "She said that she hoped the 27 EU member countries would also provide more funds to help Radio Free Europe longer term. Kallas said the bloc has been looking for \u201cstrategic areas\u201d where it can help as the United States cuts foreign aid.",
      "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\u2019s corporate headquarters are in Washington and its journalistic headquarters are based in the Czech Republic, which has been leading the EU drive to find funds.",
      "Last month, a U.S. federal judge ordered the Trump administration to restore $12 million that was appropriated by Congress. Lawyers for the service, which has been operating for 75 years, said it would be forced to shut down in June without the money.",
      "In March, Kallas recalled the influence that the network had on her as she was growing up in Estonia, which was part of the Soviet Union.",
      "\u201cComing from the other side of the Iron Curtain, actually it was (from) the radio that we got a lot of information,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, it has been a beacon of democracy, very valuable in this regard.\u201d",

      "Passengers on Southwest Airlines flights will soon be required to keep their portable chargers in plain sight while using them because of concerns about the growing number of lithium battery fires in a new policy that other airlines may adopt.",
      "Southwest announced the new policy that will go into effect May 28 and said passengers may already have seen notifications about the industry-leading rule when using the airline's app.",
      "There is growing concern about lithium-ion battery fires on planes because the number of incidents continues to grow yearly, and devices powered by those batteries are ubiquitous. There have already been 19 incidents involving these batteries this year, following last year's record high of 89, according to Federal Aviation Administration statistics.",
      "The incidents have more than doubled since the pandemic-era low of 39 in 2020, and have climbed annually.",
      "Compared to the roughly 180,000 flights U.S. airlines operate each week, the number of incidents is still relatively small and lithium batteries can overheat anywhere. However, this is a growing concern for the airlines.",
      "Last summer, a smoking laptop in a passenger\u2019s bag led to the evacuation of a plane awaiting takeoff at San Francisco International Airport. In 2023, a flight from Dallas to Orlando, Florida, made an emergency landing in Jacksonville, Florida, after a battery caught fire in an overhead bin.",
      "Southwest said that requiring these chargers to be kept out in the open when they are being used will help because \u201cin the rare event a lithium battery overheats or catches fire, quick access is critical and keeping power banks in plain sight allow for faster intervention and helps protect everyone onboard.\u201d",
      "The airline will allow the chargers to be stored inside carry-on bags when they aren't in use.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration has long prohibited e-cigarettes and chargers and power banks with lithium-ion batteries in checked bags, but allows them in carry-on bags. The rule exists precisely because fires in the cargo hold might be harder to detect and extinguish.",
      "The FAA recommends passengers keep cell phones and other devices nearby on planes so they can access them quickly. The agency said flight crews are trained to recognize and respond to lithium battery fires. Passengers should notify the flight crew immediately if their lithium battery or device is overheating, expanding, smoking or burning.",
      "A previous report released last year by UL Standards & Engagement said e-cigarettes overheated more often than any other device. More than one-quarter of passengers surveyed for that study said they put vaping cigarettes and portable chargers in checked bags. That is against federal rules.",
      "UL Standards & Engagement, part of a safety-science company once known as Underwriters Laboratories, said it based its findings on data from 35 passenger and cargo airlines, including nine of the 10 leading U.S. passenger carriers.",

    "story": [
      "Jim Irsay, the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 owner who leveraged the popularity of Peyton Manning into a new stadium and a Super Bowl title, died Wednesday at age 65",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Jim Irsay started his football career as a ball boy. He finished it as a team owner.",
      "Along the way, the NFL\u2019s music man created his own, unique brand.",
      "Irsay worked his way up through the organization, learning how to run a football team, restoring the Colts\u2019 once-proud tradition to glory and created what some have dubbed the greatest guitar collection on Earth \u2014 all while battling health issues and addictions to alcohol and painkillers.",
      "On Wednesday, Irsay\u2019s remarkable journey ended at age 65. Pete Ward, Irsay\u2019s longtime right-hand man, made the announcement in a statement, saying Irsay died peacefully in his sleep.",
      "\u201cJim\u2019s dedication and passion for the Indianapolis Colts in addition to his generosity, commitment to the community and, most importantly, his love for his family were unsurpassed,\u201d Ward said. \u201cOur deepest sympathies go to his daughters, Carlie Irsay-Gordon, Casey Foyt, Kalen Jackson and his entire family as we grieve with them.\u201d",
      "Irsay had a profound impact on the franchise.",
      "With the help of Hall of Fame general manager Bill Polian, Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy and Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning, Irsay turned the Colts from a longtime laughingstock into a perennial title contender, even winning a Super Bowl title.",
      "He then used that success \u2014 and Manning's aura \u2014 to help convince city leaders to build a retractable roof dome stadium that opened in 2008 and eventually allowed Indy to host a Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cI am heartbroken to hear about Jim Irsay\u2019s passing,\u201d Manning said on social media. \u201cHe was an incredibly generous and passionate owner and I will always be indebted to him for giving me my start in the NFL. His love for the Colts and the city of Indy was unmatched. His impact on the players who played for him will not be forgotten.\u201d",
      "More recently, though, Irsay battled health issues and became far less visible following a fall at his home Dec. 8, 2023.",
      "Police officers from Carmel, Indiana, a northern suburb of Indy, responded to a 911 call from Irsay\u2019s home. According to the police report, the officers found Irsay breathing but unresponsive and with a bluish skin tone.",
      "A month later, Irsay was diagnosed with a respiratory illness.",
      "During his annual training camp news conference last summer, Irsay told reporters he was continuing to rehab from two subsequent surgeries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to see you guys, the fans and to be out here,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI\u2019m feeling great, you know, just trying to get this left leg stronger, which it will be.\"",
      "Irsay also did not speak during the recent NFL draft as he usually did.",
      "But his story is one of a kind.",
      "As a teenager, he tossed footballs with MVP quarterbacks Johnny Unitas and Bert Jones. He relied frequently on the lessons he learned from rubbing elbows with some of the game\u2019s most important owners \u2014 Al Davis, Lamar Hunt, Wellington Mara and Art Rooney \u2014 as they worked through the 1982 players\u2019 strike and the implementation of a salary cap.",
      "And he presided over the greatest quarter-century of Colts football thanks to Manning and quarterback Andrew Luck.",
      "Irsay handled everything from ticket sales to public relations as he rose through the organization even watching No. 1 overall pick John Elway force a trade to Denver in 1983.",
      "When he took over as owner following his father's death in 1997, things were different. The arrival of Manning helped Irsay \u2014 and the Colts \u2014 create a passionate local following that hadn't previously existed but still remains strong today.",
      "It wasn't always easy, either.",
      "\u2014 When a 55% inheritance tax threatened his hold on the team, the younger Irsay found enough cash to keep the family business.",
      "\u2014 When his most prominent players were about to cash in during free agency, Irsay often ponied up top dollar to keep them.",
      "\u2014 And though some criticized him for focusing too much on offense and not enough on defense, the combination allowed the Colts to find their place in a small-market city that revered basketball.",
      "\u201cThe man hates to lose more than he likes to win,\u201d current general manager Chris Ballard often said.",
      "Things didn\u2019t always go smoothly, though.",
      "Robert Irsay was reviled in Baltimore following the move. Decades later, even after another Baltimore team won a Super Bowl, and after Jim Irsay repeatedly explained the move was precipitated by the city\u2019s attempt to take the franchise through eminent domain, Baltimore still referred to the team only as the Indianapolis football club.",
      "A quarter-century later, following a 2-14 record in 2011, Irsay tested the fans\u2019 loyalties by releasing a 34-year-old Manning, who missed the entire season with a neck injury. The rebuild began around rookie QB Andrew Luck \u2014 a move that drew comparisons to his father\u2019s trade of Unitas in 1973 and the subsequent selection of Jones in the draft.",
      "The impending decision about Manning also became a public spectacle throughout the 2011-12 offseason and again in 2013 when Manning returned to Indy for the first time with his new team, the Denver Broncos.",
      "\u201cIt was the right move to make. Peyton and I talked about it. He said it best in the press conference: I didn\u2019t decide, he didn\u2019t decide, the football gods had laid the cards out and we both knew it was best for him and us,\u201d Irsay said later. \u201cEmotionally, it was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. In professional football, it\u2019s about winning and you have to be able to make the decisions that are best for the franchise.\u201d",
      "But football was only part of Irsay's story.",
      "He spent millions buying the original manuscripts to Jack Kerouac\u2019s generation-defining novel \u201cOn The Road\u201d and Alcoholics Anonymous\u2019 \u201cBig Book\u201d and routinely made them available to the public.",
      "His ever-expanding musical collection included instruments and items from The Beatles, James Brown, Prince, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Elton John, Johnny Cash and Jerry Garcia; signed Presidential documents; an original \u201cwanted\u201d poster for John Wilkes Booth; a 1953 Jackie Robinson bat; Muhammad Ali\u2019s title belt from the 1974 \u201cRumble in the Jungle;\u201d even the saddle from Secretariat\u2019s triple crown wins.",
      "Irsay also befriended singers such as Stephen Stills and John Mellencamp, took inspiration from the lyrics of Bob Dylan and revered the writings of Hunter S. Thompson, the self-described \u201cGonzo journalist.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun to have these pieces, and guitars are always kind of the most interesting, in some ways, because you can play them, unlike a book, a manuscript or a painting,\u201d Irsay said during the summer of 2016. \u201cYou can play them, and they can become four-dimensional.\u201d",
      "But Irsay also had his struggles.",
      "He was a recovering alcoholic and his professional successes couldn\u2019t insulate him from a constant battle with painkillers. In a November 2023 interview with HBO Sports, he acknowledged he had been to rehab at least 15 times and once accidentally overdosed.",
      "The low point may have come in March 2014 when he was arrested near his home in Carmel while driving erratically. When officers searched the car they found nearly $30,000 in cash and numerous bottles of prescription pills. Five and a half months later, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle while intoxicated, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Irsay for six games and fined him $500,000.",
      "Irsay described the absence as heartbreaking.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t even imagine how hard that was,\u201d former Colts punter and now talk-show host Pat McAfee said after the suspension ended. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a guy who\u2019s been around the Colts his entire life, who personifies the Horseshoe.\u201d",
      "Still, he was wise enough to allow Polian almost free rein to construct a team that won a then-record number of regular-season games in a decade (115).",
      "And he leaves a legacy that won\u2019t be blowing in the wind.",
      "Aside from the images of Irsay wearing a tie wrapped around his forehead on a magazine cover, tossing footballs in a suit, or his utterances on Twitter, he was a shrewd businessman with a big heart.",
      "When the Colts won the Super Bowl, he even sent a ring to two-time rushing champ Edgerrin James, who had left in free agency before the championship season.",
      "\u201cThe guy grew up with this team,\u201d then-coach Chuck Pagano said in January 2015. \u201cHe\u2019s got so much insight and so much knowledge. He\u2019s a football man through and through. It runs through his veins and he\u2019s got so much wisdom to share with all of us. He makes a huge impact.\u201d",

      "Also on hand were Florida Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody, as well as assorted House members from the state and former Florida football standout Tim Tebow. Trump described Tebow \u201cas a college player, maybe the best ever\u201d and said he was a big fan despite Tebow having spent part of his professional career with the NFL's New York Jets.",
      "The team gave Trump an autographed basketball and No. 47 jersey with his name on the back. The president also hailed the Gators' 39-year-old coach, Todd Golden, as \u201cgreat\" and \u201cyoung\u201d while joking, \u201cBoy, would I like to be his agent.\u201d",

      "Since taking office in January, Trump has hosted a series of championship teams, including the Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia Eagles.

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t just show up here to Fort Worth to just walk around and celebrate last week,\u201d Scheffler said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m here for a reason, and that\u2019s not to just play a couple of ceremonious rounds and then ride off in the sunset. I\u2019m here for a reason. That\u2019s to compete.\u201d",
      "Scheffler's third major also set him up to be the first player since Dustin Johnson in 2017 to win three consecutive PGA Tour starts.",
      "He won his hometown CJ Cup Byron Nelson north of Dallas two weeks before the PGA, then skipped the $20 million signature event at the Truist Championship before winning at Quail Hollow.",
      "Colonial isn't quite on the level of the Nelson for Scheffler, who attended that event for years as a kid and made his pro debut there 11 years ago. Still, Colonial is in Texas, and not far from family and friends in Dallas.",

I would say the rough is a little bit up, but I think the greens, the quickness and the firmness will be very similar as to what we saw last year.\u201d",
      "Jordan Spieth is the other hometown favorite alongside Scheffler. And while his fellow Texas alum beat him to the first victory at the Nelson, Spieth is the one with his name on the wall of champions along the No. 1 tee box at Colonial. He won in 2016.",
      "Spieth missed the cut at the PGA in pursuit of the career grand slam. He finished 19 under at the Nelson, 12 shots behind Scheffler, who won by eight while tying the PGA Tour scoring record of 253.",
      "This is the fourth time Scheffler has had a chance to win three consecutive starts, all since 2022. Another significant feat in that span is joining Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods as the only players with 15 victories before turning 29.",
      "Johnson's three-peat in 2017 included the Genesis Invitational, WGC-Mexico Championship and WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play.",
      "Now that he's back in his football-mad home state, Scheffler was asked if his rare show of raw emotion in slamming his cap on the green after winning the PGA was his version of a football spike.",
      "\u201cWhen I played football, I didn\u2019t score very many touchdowns, so I wasn\u2019t too experienced in that,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI don\u2019t really have much to say on that. I think I just kind of let my emotions out a little bit, and I guess that\u2019s where my brain decided it wanted to go at the time. I really have absolutely no explanation for it at all.\u201d",
      "Only one player has celebrated on the 18th green of the Byron Nelson and Colonial in the same year: Hogan in 1946.",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- IndyCar is exploring the creation of an independent governing body absent of any Roger Penske employees in the wake of the Team Penske cheating scandal ahead of the Indianapolis 500.",
      "Penske owns three-car Team Penske, IndyCar, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indianapolis 500. On Wednesday, he fired his top three racing executives after two of its cars were found to be illegal ahead of the second round of Indy 500 qualifying.",
      "It has since been shown that the spec part Team Penske had modified on the cars of two-time defending Indy 500 winner Josef Newgarden and Will Power had been done so for some time. Both Newgarden's winning car from his 2024 victory that is displayed in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway museum and the one he took to the White House last month have the same modified part.",
      "Rival teams claim they have photos of the Penske cars with the modifications dating some time, and others have claimed they told IndyCar technical inspectors the Penske cars were not legal.",
      "\u201cWe want to ensure that we have an officiating entity that has no ability for folks to say it\u2019s got influence from Roger Penske,\" said Doug Boles, named president of IndyCar in February while already holding the title of president of Indianapolis Motor Speedway.",
      "Since IndyCar caught Newgarden and Power's cars Sunday \u2014 with help of complaints from rival teams \u2014 the fellow competitors have alleged the Penske cars get preferential treatment because they are owned by Penske. They have also questioned how it wasn't discovered Saturday when Penske's three cars locked into the race, and are publicly wondering if the cars were legal at the time.",
      "Optics of favoritism have dogged Penske since he purchased all things Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 2020 because everyone who runs an arm of his organization is paid by Roger Penske. Late Wednesday, new IndyCar president Doug Boles, who is also president of the speedway, said there is an evaluation of bringing in outside governance in the future.",
      "\u201cWe have been working very, very hard to create an entity, an officiating entity, and by officiating I mean race control and tech inspection and an entity that is completely removed from anything that has to do with Penske entertainment, or Roger Penske or the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in the IndyCar series,\u201d Boles said.",
      "Boles also said one of the reasons the cars were not caught with the illegal modification is because the change had been made to the rear attenuator, a safety piece that is prohibited from being altered because it could compromise its abilities. Therefore, the part isn't routinely checked because IndyCar inspector assume teams want their cars to be safe.",
      "NASCAR is governed by the France family, which owns the series and most of its track. Race control and the competition department are NASCAR employees. NASCAR does not field any cars.",
      "Formula 1 has an independent governance in the FIA. F1 owns only the commercial rights to the series, while the FIA has full control of how the series is governed.",

      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- The Minnesota Timberwolves must solve Oklahoma City\u2019s \u2018AAU\u2019 defense to avoid a 2-0 deficit in the Western Conference finals.",
      "Minnesota\u2019s Anthony Edwards used the term to describe Oklahoma City's young, aggressive unit after the Thunder held the Timberwolves to 34.9% shooting in a 114-88 victory in Game 1 on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI mean, it\u2019s hard to process because it was different every time,\u201d Edwards said after Game 1. \u201cHeavy in the gaps, sometimes trap the ball screens sometimes don\u2019t. Sometimes just run and jump. It\u2019s kind of similar to like AAU. They remind me of like an AAU defensive team. Just run and jump. Fly around. It\u2019s pretty good.\u201d",
      "Edwards said the first key for him is to be more aggressive. He didn\u2019t like that he scored 18 points on just 13 shots in a Game 1 loss, well below his normal output. He said his adjustment for Game 2 on Thursday night will be a simple one.",
      "\u201cPlay without the ball a little more, get a little more cardio in,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cShould be good.\u201d",
      "Minnesota coach Chris Finch said there\u2019s plenty of ways for the Timberwolves to improve. They made just 15 of 51 3-pointers in the opener and committed 17 turnovers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to pick up our decision-making,\u201d Finch said. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely got to play with more force. We\u2019ve got to play with more pass-pass combinations. We got to go somewhere a little bit quicker.\u201d",
      "Oklahoma City leads the league in defensive rating by a large margin in the playoffs. The Thunder lead all playoff teams with 10.8 steals per game and an opponent field-goal percentage of .407 in the postseason.",
      "Lu Dort and Alex Caruso are two of the league\u2019s best on-ball defenders. Caruso is versatile enough to defend guards or a big like Denver's Nikola Jokic, as he did last series.",
      "Jalen Williams and Shai Gilgeous Alexander are quick and strong and are good in passing lanes \u2014 Williams had five steals in Game 1. Cason Wallace is an exceptional athlete. That allows the Thunder to keep fresh bodies on an opponent\u2019s best players.",
      "In the paint, Chet Holmgren has been one of the league\u2019s top rim protectors and Isaiah Hartenstein has been one of its top rebounders.",
      "The result can be overwhelming. Several Minnesota players struggled with their shooting on Tuesday. Mike Conley made 2 of 8 shots, Donte DiVincenzo made 3 of 14 and Nickeil Walker-Alexander made 3 of 11.",
      "Edwards said it was more about the Timberwolves than the Thunder.",
      "\u201cThey got great looks, just couldn\u2019t make them,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cA lot of them went in and out. And that\u2019s going to help us. That\u2019s going to help me and Ju (Julius Randle) because they usually make those shots. So we\u2019re not really worried about them making shots. We\u2019ll be all right.\u201d",
      "Thunder coach Mark Daigneault expects the Timberwolves to adjust.",
      "\u201cThis is a really, really good team that\u2019s got great resolve,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are great players. They have a great coach, tactically. So they\u2019re going to have the next pitch that we\u2019re going have to hit. We are aware of that, so we have to get to work.\u201d",

      "The Enhanced Games is a sports festival that bills itself as better than the Olympics because it allows athletes to benefit from using performance-enhancing drugs",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The Enhanced Games, a sports festival that bills itself as better than the Olympics because it allows athletes to benefit from using performance-enhancing drugs, will kick off next year in Las Vegas over Memorial Day weekend.",
      "The inaugural competition in Sin City will feature swimming, track and field and weightlifting, in an event designed to disrupt a status quo in the international anti-doping movement that some feel is failing.",
      "One of the key supporters is a group called 1789 Equity backed in part by Donald Trump Jr. It has added funding \u201cin the double-digit millions,\u201d according to games founder Aron D'Souza. Athletes will compete for up to $500,000 in purses per event, with bonuses starting at $250,000 for those who break records.",
      "Australian James Magnussen, who medaled in swimming in the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games, was the the first athlete to commit. He has since been joined by swimmers Kristian Gkolomeev, Andrii Govorov and Josif Miladinov. Gkolomeev competed in four Olympics, including last year in Paris. Govorov was at the 2016 Olympics and Miladinov swam in the Olympics in 2021.",
      "Magnussen said he followed World Anti-Doping Agency rules and underwent numerous tests through that organization and Sport Integrity Australia.",
      "\u201cIt frustrated me at times that not all athletes adhered to those same guidelines,\" Magnussen said. \u201cBut I think these two organizations sit quite separately, and I have very strong opinions that performance-enhancing drugs should not be used in clean sport. It is cheating and bending the rules, but this is a different set of rules, different set of guidelines, different product entirely.\u201d",
      "The International Olympic Committee and WADA have panned the idea, which first emerged in 2023.",
      "\u201cIf you want to destroy any concept of fair play and fair competition in sport, this would be a good way to do it,\u201d the IOC said through a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cWADA condemns the Enhanced Games as a dangerous and irresponsible concept and is very concerned about its emergence,\u201d WADA spokesman James Fitzgerald said.",
      "But some with background in the anti-doping world believe the system is so broken that the idea of sports with highly monitored use of otherwise banned drugs could be a more effective way of finding out who is fastest and strongest.",
      "\u201cI realized that not following the (WADA) rules was not so radical after all,\" Michael Ashenden, a former drug fighter who played a key role in creating tests for the blood-boosting drug Erythropoietin (EPO), wrote in a blog released before last year's Olympics.",
      "WADA and the IOC's ability to fight drugs in sports has come under scrutiny after more than a decade of scandals, highlighted by one involving Chinese swimmers and another that consumed the entire Russian Olympic machine.",
      "The Enhanced Games announcement came a day before a scheduled Congressional hearing in Washington at which WADA's strained relationship with U.S. drug-fighting authorities was to be scrutinized; that hearing was later postponed until June.",
      "D'Souza insists his vision isn't so much about unfettered drug use, but rather, a group of athletes trying to push the limits while their health and drug intake is steadily monitored for safety.",
      "\u201cThe Olympics are a representation of the past,\u201d D'Souza said. \u201cThey\u2019re rooted in ancient Greece, and they have this amateurish, natural ethos that is run by a bunch of European aristocrats. The Enhanced Games are very different. They're run by capitalists, who believe in the future, believe in science and technology.\u201d",
      "May 21-24, 2026.",
      "Entirely within Resorts World Las Vegas on the north end of the Strip. D'Souza said a pool and track will be built on the property.",
      "The organization also is making Las Vegas its full-time home and is looking to build a facility there for athletes to train throughout the year.",
      "The swimming events will include the 50-meter freestyle, 100-meter freestyle, 50-meter butterfly and 100-meter butterfly. The 100 meters and the 100- and 110-meter hurdles make up the track events. The snatch as well as the clean and jerk are the events in weightlifting.",
      "Organizers said the idea was to stage fast-paced events that will better hold viewers' attention, and D'Souza said about 200 athletes will participate in the debut event.",
      "D'Souza said he didn't pursue a TV deal because he could zero in on his target audience better through social media.",
      "Each champion will receive $250,000 with the rest of the event purse distributed throughout the remainder of the field. A $1 million bonus will be presented if the world record in the 100 meters in track or 50 meters in swimming is broken.",
      "Organizers said each athlete meets with a doctor to develop a plan that addresses their training goals in a safe manner. The athletes are regularly monitored, according to officials, to ensure they don't experience health issues.",
      "\u201cIt's a very personalized approach,\u201d said Dan Turner, Enhanced Games athlete safety director. \u201cIt depends on what they want to do and what works with them.\u201d",
      "An independent medical commission made up of specialists worldwide, which is paid by the organization but does not directly work for it, is involved in the protocol system.",
      "\u201cLooking at the science for such an important area, only a few studies have been done,\u201d said Guido Pieles, a cardiologist and commission member. \u201cWhy is that? The stigma and the exclusion of enhancements in the Olympic Games and so on ... has made it difficult to do studies, particularly of high quality.\u201d",

      "Joe Burrow\u2019s desire for privacy might be on the same level as his drive to be one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL",
      "CINCINNATI -- Joe Burrow's desire for privacy might be on the same level as his drive to be one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL.",
      "That is why it was a surprise when Netflix announced in late March that the Cincinnati Bengals' star was going to be featured on the second season of the hit \u201cQuarterback\u201d series.",
      "After joking that they \u201ccaught me on the right day I guess,\" Burrow pointed out that Peyton Manning's involvement in the series made the opportunity too good to pass up.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of respect for him. When that guy reaches out to you and asks you to do something, then most of the time I\u2019m going to say yeah,\u201d Burrow said of Manning. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have done it if he wasn\u2019t involved, but I have a lot of trust and faith in him to not do anything that would hurt me or the team.\u201d",
      "Even though Burrow lamented the loss of privacy after his home was broken into last December, he did make a high-profile appearance at The Met Gala in New York two weeks ago. That came on the heels of last year\u2019s appearance for Vogue at Paris Fashion Week with friend and former LSU teammate Justin Jefferson.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a new experience. It was fun,\u201d Burrow said about The Met Gala. \u201cIt\u2019s about five minutes of taking pictures, and then it\u2019s just a little dinner party. So it was good people, good vibes. I was happy that I was able to go. Maybe we\u2019ll go again. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see how we play it by ear.\u201d",
      "Burrow led the league with 4,918 passing yards and 43 touchdowns, but had his house broken into in December while the Bengals were in Dallas facing the Cowboys in a Monday night game.",
      "\u201cThat was definitely a curveball I didn\u2019t quite expect throughout the whole process, but the people involved in it, working on it day to day, were great and weren\u2019t too intrusive,\u201d Burrow said about the break-in and how that was handled on both series.",
      "The Netflix series is a joint production between NFL Films, Manning\u2019s Omaha Productions and Patrick Mahomes\u2019 2PM Productions. Burrow and the Bengals were also part of last year\u2019s \u201cHard Knocks\u201d in-season series that focused on the AFC North.",
      "Burrow added he has screened a couple of episodes of the upcoming season of \u201cQuarterback\u201d to provide input to Manning and producers, but likely would not watch the entire series when it is released in July.",
      "Coach Zac Taylor said that despite having two series following the team and his star quarterback around late last season, the film crews did a good job blending in. Atlanta\u2019s Kirk Cousins and Detroit\u2019s Jared Goff will also be featured on the series.",
      "\u201cPart of the quarterback show is just behind the scenes playing quarterback. It\u2019s not necessarily the home life and the off field. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a little bit of that, but for the most part, it\u2019s just a respect for the game,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope people get an appreciation of what they go through every single day of game week and over the course of the season, and how their role can evolve.\u201d",
      "It has been a good offseason so far for Burrow. Tee Higgins and Ja'Marr Chase \u2014 his two main playmakers \u2014 signed extensions. Burrow said he found out about it via text while attending the bachelor party of former Cincinnati defensive lineman Sam Hubbard, who recently retired.",
      "Burrow, who will be going into his sixth season, also noted this is the healthiest he has felt during an offseason program.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m changing too much. Just like every year you want to get bigger, stronger, faster. Refine things you can refine. That\u2019s kind of the process every year,\" he said. \"I\u2019ve had injuries that kind of change the offseason mindset a little bit. This year I don\u2019t have any of those, and that\u2019s great, because I can focus on getting better all around and become a more well-rounded player.\u201d",
      "Burrow and the Bengals biggest focus will be getting off to a better start to the season. Cincinnati ended the season on a five-game winning streak, and just missed the playoffs with a 9-8 record after dropping its first three games and being 4-7 at its bye week.",
      "The Bengals open at Cleveland on Sept. 7 and host Jacksonville in Week 2 before a stretch of five straight games against playoff teams from last season, with three on the road.",
      "\u201cThis time of year is about the same. I would say we\u2019re working a little harder in the weight room and running. But at the end of the day, we just have to go out and play better early in the year,\" Burrow said.",
      "\"You can come up with all these different things to try to make that happen. I think playing in preseason games will help. We haven\u2019t had those discussions yet, but based on the little that we have, I imagine we\u2019ll be playing more, and I think that\u2019ll help.",
      "\"But we\u2019ll see. I think at the end of the day, we just have to take some ownership and come out of the gates and execute and play better.\u201d",

      "Indiana native Eric Shanks can\u2019t remember exactly when the rite of passage began of traveling to Indianapolis Motor Speedway",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- As an Indiana native, Eric Shanks can\u2019t remember exactly when the rite of passage began of traveling to Indianapolis Motor Speedway. His first Indianapolis 500 memory is of the 1985 race, Danny Sullivan\u2019s \u201cSpin and Win\u201d 1985 victory, when Shanks was around 14 and had fully embraced the way his home state played such a role in American culture.",
      "\u201cI think everybody takes pride in there being a spotlight on this part of the country,\u201d Shanks said. \u201cThe Pacers are only in the playoffs when they are in the playoffs, the Colts aren\u2019t always in. But this is a guarantee every year.\u201d",
      "When he became CEO of Fox Sports in 2010, Shanks had a wish list of events he wanted for the network. Always at the top was the Indianapolis 500, a property Fox Sports finally landed this year. The network is in its first year of a new broadcast deal with IndyCar and on Sunday televises its first Indy 500.",
      "Shanks from the start has vowed the production will be the biggest of the year for Fox Sports \u2014 a lofty promise for a network that also carries the Super Bowl and the World Series, among other major sporting events.",
      "\u201cWe are going to blow the doors off of Indy. We\u2019re going to bring everything that Fox has to bear,\u201d he said.",
      "He\u2019s been relentless in pursuing his promise and has spent the first five IndyCar races of the year working out early-season glitches that ranged from an unstable graphics package, issues delivering timing and scoring, a mid-race loss of transmission, and enough bumps to drive Shanks nuts as he strives for a perfect production. The work has gone on at the same time Fox Sports televised the first 16 races of the NASCAR season, a run that culminated last Sunday night with the All-Star race.",
      "Only four of the NASCAR races were on Fox, and even with the rain-effected season-opening Daytona 500, that quartet averaged 4,986,000 viewers.",
      "Fox promised IndyCar its entire 17-race slate will be aired on broadcast \u2014 including both days of last weekend\u2019s qualifying \u2014 but the numbers have been sporadic and unable to keep pace with NASCAR.",
      "The IndyCar ratings don\u2019t bother Shanks.",
      "\u201cI think you just want to be constantly showing growth in a lot of areas,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to be showing growth in attendance. I\u2019m happy to hear merchandise sales are up \u2014 you\u2019ve got new sponsors coming in \u2014 you just want to show growth.\u201d",
      "Fox Sports last week made several changes to races later this season (mainly start times) to ensure IndyCar and NASCAR do not go directly head-to-hear, something that happened several times earlier this year when the network juggled both racing series. But Shanks told The Associated Press he is not considering moving IndyCar off of Fox to Fox Sports or another property if the ratings don\u2019t improve over the next few weeks.",
      "Instead, his focus is on ensuring the glitches through the first five races don\u2019t happen during the 109th running of \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing\u201d or the rest of the season.",
      "\u201cIn each race, it actually has been something different,\u201d Shanks said. \u201cYou fix one thing and then there\u2019s something else to fix. There\u2019s a lot of different systems talking to each other and we\u2019re on the receiving end of a lot of it. So we\u2019re figure it out and we\u2019re trying to do more.\u201d",
      "Fox Sports is compensating through new innovation, including the image of a \u201cghost car\u201d graphic used in qualifying that showed how a car making a run tracked against the current leader. And he\u2019s bringing in major talent for Sunday, including Tom Brady for the ceremonial \u201cFastest Seat in Sports\u201d car, which will be driven by Jimmie Johnson; Michael Strahan, Danica Patrick, Tony Stewart and Super Bowl-winning tight end Rob Gronkowski as the Snake Pit grand marshal.",
      "Fox Sports has a ton of material to work with, including a race-consuming cheating scandal involving Team Penske, the marquee team in IndyCar. It involves two-time defending winner Josef Newgarden, who is seeking to become the first driver in history to win three consecutive 500s.",
      "The first Israeli is in the field as Robert Shwartzman stunned 33 other drivers by becoming the first rookie since 1983 to win the pole. Kyle Larson is attempting to complete the Indy 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 for 1,100-miles of racing in one day. Two-time reigning series champion Alex Palou, who has won four of the first five races this season, is trying to finally add the 500 to his resume and Pato O'Ward, the most popular driver in the series, is trying to bounce back from last year's heartbreaking last-lap defeat.",
      "Shanks has used crossover since the start of the year \u2014 Fox produced three movie-production-quality commercials to introduce three IndyCar stars and all aired during the Super Bowl, one with a Brady cameo \u2014 and is using most of its network programming to promote Sunday's race.",
      "He also achieved a goal in adding a gambling element to Sunday, something he's wanted to do for months.",
      "\u201cI really want to turn the Indy 500 into more of a Kentucky Derby day from a wagering standpoint. It\u2019s hard to understand how to wager on motorsports,\u201d he said. \u201cOn Kentucky Derby day, even if you don\u2019t know anything about horse racing, you put down an exacta or a trifecta, you got win, place, show. How can we figure out how to get that type of broad attention around an event that honestly kind of feels a lot like horse racing that day?\u201d",
      "The solution was a partnership with DraftKings, which will have 20 or more trifectas that people can pick from. Fox Sports analyst James Hinchcliffe will pick one trifecta that will be promoted by Fox.",
      "\u201cI think that's element to this event, and motorsports in general, that if we can start to kind of like add that layer of interest for people, I think it can only be helpful to viewership,\u201d Shanks said.\"",

      "The Liberty Flames softball team is heading to the super regionals of the NCAA Tournament this weekend at Oregon",
      "When Dot Richardson took over the Liberty softball program in July 2013, the coaches' offices, locker room and training room were located in double-wide trailers.",
      "\u201cWe had a rec field,\u201d recalled Richardson, a two-time Olympic gold medalist. \u201cThe previous staff had built the dugouts with cinder blocks and painted them blue. It was like a hobbit dugout. It was perfect for me, but everyone else had to bend down to get in it. Humble beginnings.\u201d",
      "Those sparse roots are part of the reason last weekend\u2019s upset of No. 1 overall seed Texas A&M is so remarkable. It gave the Flames a program-record 50 wins, saddled the Aggies with the dubious distinction of being the first top seed to fall short in NCAA Tournament regionals and \u2013 most significantly \u2013 put Liberty in the super regionals for the first time in school history.",
      "\u201cWe just played with so much to prove and a chip on our shoulder, knowing we could do it and that we believed in each other,\u201d said outfielder Paige Doerr. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget that feeling.\u201d",
      "Richardson\u2019s team won 11 games in 2014, her first season at the campus in Lynchburg, Virginia. A year later, Liberty opened a new state-of-the-art stadium and notched 29 victories. By 2018, Richardson had the Flames in the NCAA regionals.",
      "Liberty is playing in the NCAA tourney for the fifth straight year. And, after coming painfully close to advancing to supers last season, the Flames took that next step, beating Texas A&M on Saturday, losing to the Aggies Sunday afternoon and then rallying for the clinching 6-5 victory in the winner-take-all final game that night.",
      "That one sent them on to face Oregon in the best-of-three super regional in Eugene starting Friday. The winner advances to the Women\u2019s College World Series starting May 29 in Oklahoma City.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done that through the years,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut this year, we\u2019ve been able to go over that hump. This team has never really focused on winning or losing. We\u2019ve focused on being the best we can be. And our best was good enough to be where we are now.\u201d",
      "This team, Richardson says, is her most talented and complete in her Liberty tenure. After having one or two hitters she confidently could pencil into her lineups her first few years coaching, Richardson said it\u2019s a daily struggle to find at-bats for all the capable hitters on this year\u2019s roster.",
      "That depth has been on display all season, as 11 players have hit multiple home runs, six have driven in at least 30 runs and six have tallied over 50 base hits, led by Rachel Roupe\u2019s outstanding year at the plate. Roupe is batting .392 with team highs in home runs (23) and RBI (73).",
      "In the circle, five pitchers have won multiple games and three have racked up over 75 strikeouts, paced by Elena Esocabar\u2019s 25-3 mark, 2.43 ERA, 15 complete games and 175 strikeouts.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not surprised where we are,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cThey just play with so much freedom. That\u2019s what happens when you see great athletes play with freedom.\u201d",
      "Freedom and drive.",
      "LIberty has reached a regional final in each of the last three years. Last season, the Flames were one out away from beating Georgia and advancing to supers, but the Bulldogs hit a pair of RBI singles in the bottom of the seventh to walk off with the win.",
      "\u201cI think that the reason why we were here and why were able to win this game was because of last year,\u201d sophomore catcher Savannah Jessee said. \u201cIt left such a sour taste in our mouths that we were so close and we couldn\u2019t\u2019 get the job done last year. But we proved ourselves. We proved we could hang with anyone. I think having the confidence from being one out away last year helped us with this weekend.\u201d",
      "The Flames celebrated their historic win in the wee hours by hopping a fence at the team hotel and jumping into the pool, Roupe said. The Aggies\u2019 logo was emblazoned on the pool\u2019s floor below them and \u2013 in that moment \u2013 Liberty was atop the college softball world.",
      "It hopes to stay there this weekend in Oregon.",
      "\u201cFinally , I think people are starting to see that we don\u2019t play around,\u201d Jessee said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to take it on to the next level.\u201d",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Roger Penske fired team president Tim Cindric, IndyCar managing director Ron Ruzewski and IndyCar general manager Kyle Moyer on Wednesday in the wake of an Indianapolis 500 cheating scandal.",
      "\u201cNothing is more important than the integrity of our sport and our race teams,\u201d Penske said in a statement. \u201cWe have had organizational failures during the last two years, and we had to make necessary changes. I apologize to our fans, our partners and our organization for letting them down.\u201d",
      "Penske is owner of the three-car team, IndyCar, Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indy 500. He has won the Indy 500 a record 20 times.",
      "Two-time defending Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden and teammate Will Power were found to have an illegally modified part on their cars ahead of Sunday\u2019s final round of qualifications for the 109th running of the Indianapolis 500.",
      "Neither was allowed to qualify and both on Monday were dropped to the back of the field and will start 32nd and 33rd. Rival teams have been arguing it is not enough since it's the second cheating scandal in two seasons and illegal cars potentially bumped Jacob Abel of Dale Coyne Racing from the field.",
      "Cindric and Ruzewski had already been suspended by IndyCar for the race and both teams fined $100,000. It is the second consecutive year they were suspended from \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\u201d",
      "The trouble for Team Penske began before the fast 12 shootout on Sunday, when rival team owner Chip Ganassi was among a chorus of competitors who accused it of cheating. They noticed unapproved changes had been made to the rear attenuator, a safety device designed to absorb and reduce the force of impacts, and the assumption was the modifications would have given the two Team Penske cars an aerodynamic advantage in their four-lap qualifying runs.",
      "Further investigation showed Newgarden's winning car from last year that is displayed in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway museum has the same illegal modification, as did the car Team Penske brought to the White House last month. Rivals claim to have photos indicating the modification has been in place for some time.",
      "What made the outrage even greater that is was just one year ago that Team Penske was caught in a push-to-pass scandal in which Newgarden was found to have access to an additional boost of horsepower when he should not have at the season-opener. He was stripped of his win and Penske \u2014 suspended Cindric for two races, including the Indy 500.",
      "Cindric is the biggest name to fall in this scandal. He\u2019s a member of the Team Penske Hall of Fame and has been with the organization since 2000 as President of Penske Racing Inc. He's been long assumed to be Penske's successor on the racing part of Penske's empire.",
      "Cindric was elevated to the role of President of Penske Performance in 2005 and, until February, essentially ran the day-to-day operations of all of Penske\u2019s racing properties.",
      "But Penske\u2019s right-hand man in February was stripped of most of his roles although he said he chose to step back as the overall leader of the organization. He remained president of the IndyCar program.",
      "Cindric is the father of NASCAR driver Austin Cindric.",

      "IndyCar teams have spent the past year trying to learn everything they can about the hybrid engines introduced midway through last season",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Helio Castroneves felt an immediate difference \u2014 a subtle but noticeable uptick in speed \u2014 the first time he utilized the boost of horsepower offered by IndyCar's novel hybrid engines around the imposing oval of Indianapolis Motor Speedway.",
      "The question now facing the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner, along with the rest of the drivers on the 33-car starting grid for the 109th running on Sunday, is how best to capitalize on the hybrid over 200 laps spent entirely on edge.",
      "Empty it entirely and then wait for it to recharge, which might take several laps? Save it for short bursts for passes or to defend? Perhaps use it slowly to run down the leader or build a big advantage once out front?",
      "\u201cThere is so much more that goes into this than I think people realize or recognize,\u201d acknowledged Indy 500 veteran Graham Rahal, whose father Bobby Rahal won the 1986 race. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting thing. I mean, the hybrid, it's quite powerful here. On a single lap if you utilize it correctly, it does make a hell of a difference in lap time or lap speed.\u201d",
      "The genesis of the hybridization began years ago, when IndyCar manufacturers Chevrolet and Honda wanted to better align their racing programs with a shift in consumer demand toward hybrid and electric vehicles. But the project was beset by delays as engineers struggled to fit a bespoke hybrid unit into the IndyCar chassis designed more than a decade ago, and that had to meet certain requirements for weight and safety, among other things.",
      "The result was finally unveiled before last year's Indy 500, a design based around ultracapacitors rather than heavy batteries. It provides a quick boost to the existing 2.2-liter, twin-turbocharged V-6 engines before recharging to be used again.",
      "The system was introduced at Mid-Ohio midway through last year's IndyCar season and has been in use ever since.",
      "But it has never been used somewhere like Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where speeds at the end of each straight can hit 240 mph, and the difference between winning and losing can be measured in thousandths of a second.",
      "\u201cI've had some really interesting conversations with drivers about how of all places where the hybrid is going to make a huge difference, it's going to be at Indianapolis,\u201d IndyCar president Doug Boles said. \"I asked why and they say, 'Well, you think about Indianapolis, how trimmed out we are \u2014 especially in qualifying \u2014 any incremental difference in horsepower makes a difference.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see some exciting racing,\" Boles continued, \"and the strategies that I have heard from drivers in terms of talking about how to deploy the hybrid vary wildly. It\u2019s going to be fascinating to watch how this goes.\u201d",
      "It hasn't gone without its share of problems, either, dating to an open test last month and right through practice Monday.",
      "For one thing, the hybrid still checks in at about 100 pounds, which is significant on a car that weighs just 1,600. And all of that weight is in the back of the car, which has dramatically altered the way they are balanced and ultimately perform.",
      "\u201cThat's a lot of mass percentage-wise you are adding,\u201d two-time defending Indy 500 winner Josef Newgarden said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like adding 200, 250 pounds to a stock car. If you said, \u2018Hey, guys, we\u2019re going to bolt 250 pounds to these stock cars, see what you think,' I bet they would all go, \u2018OK, this drives differently.\u2019 And now we have to counteract it.\u201d",
      "Andretti Global driver Kyle Kirkwood is among many who believe the additional weight makes cars harder to drive, and Meyer Shank Racing's Marcus Armstrong said, \u201cI do believe the window is considerably smaller, the balance window.\u201d",
      "Armstrong crashed in practice last Saturday and had to squeeze into the field in a backup car on Sunday.",
      "Then there's the fact that the hybrid unit \u2014 while mostly reliable \u2014 is still a machine, and machines can have problems. Rinus Veekay's hybrid didn't work at all during his first qualifying run for the final row of the starting grid, while 2008 winner Scott Dixon had his practice Monday cut short after just six laps when a warning light blinked for an overheating issue.",
      "Nevertheless, the hybrid technology will play a part in \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing\u201d on Sunday. And if it comes down to the final laps, it could be a big part, as the leader tries to hold on and the chasers try to time their boost for a winning pass.",
      "\u201cI think it definitely adds some variables,\u201d said Dixon, who will start on the second row. \"If you're sitting out front, you could be a bit of a sitting duck, especially if everybody is kind of recharged and ready to go behind you.",
      "\u201cI think the biggest thing that we\u2019ve probably all learnt so far, you\u2019ve got to be ready for change, is probably the biggest thing,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I think it could ultimately change how the end of the race plays out.\u201d",

      "New research finds clownfish shrink their bodies to survive warming oceans",
      "NEW YORK -- To survive warming oceans, clownfish cope by shrinking in size.",
      "Scientists observed that some of the orange-striped fish shrank their bodies during a heat wave off the coast of Papa New Guinea. Fish that slimmed were more likely to survive.",
      "Heat waves are becoming more common and intense underwater due to climate change. Warmer water temperatures can bleach sea anemones that clownfish call home, forcing them to adapt to stay alive.",
      "Scientists monitored and measured 134 colorful clownfish in Kimbe Bay during an intense heat wave in 2023 that's still bleaching corals worldwide. They found that 101 clownfish decreased in length on one or more occasions from heat stress.",
      "\u201cWe were really shocked at first when we saw that they were shrinking at all,\u201d said study author Morgan Bennett-Smith with Boston University. The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "Though scientists don\u2019t yet know how clownfish shrink, one idea is that they could be reabsorbing their own bone matter. It\u2019s possible the smaller stature may help the clownfish save energy during a stressful scorch since smaller fish need less food.",
      "Certain clownfish breeding pairs also synced their shrink to boost their survival odds. The females adjusted their size to stay bigger than their partners, keeping the female-dominated social hierarchy intact, researchers said.",
      "Other animals also decrease in size to beat the heat. Marine iguanas get smaller during El Ni\u00f1o events that usher warm waters into the Galapagos. But this coping strategy hadn't yet been spotted in coral reef fish until now.",
      "\u201cThis is another tool in the toolbox that fish are going to use to deal with a changing world,\u201d said Simon Thorrold, an ocean ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The tactic helps clownfish weather heat waves in the short-term, but it's not yet clear how the fish will fare if they have to keep it up in the years to come, Thorrold said.",
      "Researchers found the shrinking was temporary. Clownfish possessed the ability to \u201ccatch up\u201d and grow back when their environment got less stressful, showing how living things are staying flexible to keep up with a warming world, said study author Melissa Versteeg with Newcastle University.",
      "\u201cThese natural systems really are under stress, but there's a capacity for incredible resilience,\u201d Versteeg said.",

    "story": [
      "Half of U.S. states now have laws banning or regulating cellphones in schools, with more likely to follow",
      "ATLANTA -- Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023.",
      "Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place, with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly\u2019s Education Committee, on May 13 called phones \u201ca cancer on our kids\u201d that are \u201cdriving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\u201d",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\u201cThis is a not just an academic bill,\u201d Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \u201cThis is a mental health bill. It\u2019s a public safety bill.\u201d",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \u201ca huge win.\"",
      "\u201cTeachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group\u2019s political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\u201d Hoffman said.",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\u201cIt was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\u201cIt is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\u201d Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",
      "\u201cProviding some specific money for this would kind of ease some of those implementation challenges,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201dThat said, most states have not.\"",

      "Google on Tuesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence technology to accelerate a year-long makeover of its search engine that is changing the way people get information and curtailing the flow of internet traffic to websites.",
      "The next phase outlined at Google's annual developers conference includes releasing a new \u201cAI mode\u201d option in the United States. The feature makes interacting with Google's search engine more like having a conversation with an expert capable of answering questions on just about any topic imaginable.",
      "AI mode is being offered to all comers in the U.S. just two-and-half-months after the company began testing with a limited Labs division audience.",
      "Google is also feeding its latest AI model Gemini 2.5, into its search algorithms and will soon begin testing other AI features, such as the ability to automatically buy tickets to concerts and conduct searches through live video feeds.",
      "The expansion builds upon a transformation that began a year ago with the introduction of conversational summaries called \u201cAI overviews\u201d that have been increasingly appearing at the top of its results page and eclipsing its traditional rankings of web links.",
      "About 1.5 billion people now regularly engage with \u201cAI overviews,\u201d according to Google, and most users are now entering longer and more complex queries.",
      "\u201cWhat all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said before a packed crowd in an amphitheater near the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters.",
      "Although Pichai and other Google executives predicted AI overviews would trigger more searches and ultimately more clicks to other sites, it hasn't worked out that way so far, according to the findings of search optimization firm BrightEdge.",
      "Clickthrough rates from Google's search results have declined by nearly 30% during the past year, according to BrightEdge's recently released study, which attributed the decrease to people becoming increasingly satisfied with AI overviews.",
      "The decision to make AI mode broadly available after a relatively short test period reflects Google's confidence that the technology won't habitually spew misinformation that tarnishes its brand's reputation, and acknowledges the growing competition from other AI-powered search options from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity.",
      "The rapid rise of AI alternatives emerged as a recurring theme in legal proceedings that could force Google to dismantle parts of its internet empire after a federal judge last year declared its search engine to be an illegal monopoly.",
      "In testimony during a trial earlier this month, longtime Apple executive Eddy Cue said Google searches done through the iPhone maker's Safari browser have been declining because more people are leaning on AI-powered alternatives.",
      "And Google has cited the upheaval being caused by AI's rise as one of the main reasons that it should only be required to make relatively minor changes to the way it operates its search engine because technology already is changing the competitive landscape.",
      "But Google's reliance on more AI so far appears to be enabling its search engine to maintain its mantle as the internet's main gateway \u2014 a position that's main reason its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., boasts a market value of $2 trillion.",
      "During the year ending in March, Google received 136 billion monthly visits, nearly 29 times more than ChatGPT, according to data compiled by onelittleweb.com.",
      "Even Google's own AI mode acknowledged that the company's search engine seems unlikely to be significantly hurt by the shift to AI technology when a reporter from The Associated Press asked whether its introduction would make the company even more powerful.",
      "\u201cYes, it is highly highly that Google's AI mode will make Google more powerful, particularly in the realm of information access and online influence,\u201d the AI mode responded. The feature also warns web publishers should be concerned about AI mode reducing the traffic that they get from search results.",
      "Google's upcoming tests in its Labs division foreshadow the next wave of AI technology likely to be made available to the masses.",
      "Besides using its Project Mariner technology to test the ability of an AI agent to buy tickets and book restaurant reservations, Google will also experiment with searches done through live video and an opt-in option to give its AI technology access to people's Gmail so it can learn more about a user's tastes and interests. Other features on this summer's test list include a \u201cDeep Search\u201d option that will use AI to dig even deeper into complex topics and another tool that will produce graphical presentations of sports and finance data.",
      "Google is also introducing its equivalent of VIP access to all its AI technology with an \u201cUltra\u201d subscription package that will cost $250 per month and include 30 terabytes of storage, too. That's a big step beyond Google's previous top-of-the-line AI \u201cpro\u201d package that cost $20 per month and included two terabytes of storage. \u2014\u2014",

      "The solid reception for the Chinese company, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., in Hong Kong suggests there is still an appetite among international investors for leading Chinese manufacturers despite trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.",
      "It sold more than 135 million shares at their maximum offer price, 263 Hong Kong dollars ($33.6) each. Its shares rose after they started trading at 296 Hong Kong dollars ($37.80), 12.5% higher than their offer price. They closed 16.4% higher.",

      "The company has faced pressure from the U.S. In January, the U.S. Defense Department added it to a list of companies it says have ties to China\u2019s military, an accusation that CATL denied. It called the inclusion a \u201cmistake.\u201d",
      "In April, John Moolenaar, chairperson of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, wrote to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America to demand that the two American banks withdraw from their work on CATL's IPO. But the two banks stayed on.",
      "In the U.S., Ford Motor Co. is licensing technology from CATL to build batteries, but the plan faces resistance from some Republican lawmakers, who have expressed concern that the Chinese company could benefit from U.S. tax dollars.",
      "Because the U.S. has listed CATL as having ties to the U.S. military, the share offering excluded onshore U.S. investors. However, many large U.S. institutional investors have offshore accounts that allowed them to participate.",
      "The company said it plans to use most of the net proceeds from its IPO to build its factory in Hungary, meant to bring it closer to the manufacturing facilities of its main European customers.",
      "Government officials, including Hong Kong\u2019s Financial Secretary Paul Chan, attended its gong-striking ceremony in the city\u2019s vibrant business district, Central, on Tuesday. The company's chairman Robin Zeng said his business is committed to becoming a zero-carbon technology company.",
      "\u201cListing in Hong Kong means we are more broadly integrated into the global capital markets, and it\u2019s also a new starting point for us to promote the global zero-carbon economy,\u201d Zeng said.",
      "Zeng, who trained as a physicist, helped found Amperex Technology Ltd. in 1999. It mainly was engaged in research and development and manufacturing of consumer lithium batteries. The company was sold to Tokyo-listed TDK Corporation in 2005, but Zeng continued to oversee the firm's management until 2017, its listing documents say.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure.",
      "Monday\u2019s 66-32 procedural vote keeps one of President Donald Trump\u2019s top legislative priorities on track for passage and highlights the growing political strength of the cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily in last year\u2019s election and has amassed a large war chest for next year\u2019s midterms. Several Democrats reversed and voted to move forward with the legislation after negotiations with Republicans in recent days.",
      "The fate of the legislation, which would regulate how stablecoin issuers operate in the U.S., had been uncertain in recent weeks despite early bipartisan support. Senate Democrats blocked it earlier this month in part over concerns about how Trump and his family were benefiting from private crypto endeavors, including a newly launched stablecoin.",
      "Republicans won support from Democrats after strengthening regulations on foreign issuers, beefing up enforcement and barring large tech companies like Meta and Google from issuing their own stablecoins. The Senate will now consider the bill and could vote on final passage as soon as this week, depending on the number of amendments offered by Democrats and Republicans.",
      "Still, Democrats were divided on the legislation. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others have said the bill could help Trump enrich himself and needs stronger protections.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the final bill does nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 to rein in the President\u2019s crypto corruption,\u201d Warren said ahead of the bill\u2019s passage. She said the legislation would \u201caccelerate Trump\u2019s corruption by supercharging the size of the stablecoin market\u201d and make Trump \u201cthe regulator of his own financial product.\u201d",
      "Negotiators added tougher ethics rules for members of Congress and the executive branch, including preventing members of Congress from issuing stablecoins. But Warren and several other Democrats said it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThis Congress should be a check on the president,\u201d Warren said.",
      "The bill would aim to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws.",
      "Stablecoins are a fast-growing corner of the cryptocurrency industry that have produced enormous profits for some of the major players involved. They offer a buffer from cryptocurrency\u2019s notorious volatility because they are pegged to real-world assets, like U.S. dollars or gold. Typically, that means a single stablecoin is worth $1, making them a much more reliable digital asset for commercial transactions than other forms of crypto.",
      "The move to regulate the industry has been bipartisan, but Trump\u2019s involvement in the crypto industry complicated the legislation\u2019s path. Trump launched a meme coin earlier this year that has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And he is set to attend a dinner May 22 that\u2019s open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins.",
      "Another Trump-family linked crypto venture called World Liberty Financial recently announced that it was issuing its own stablecoin, called USD1. The stablecoin got a huge boost when World Liberty Financial announced last week that an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",
      "A former skeptic turned zealous promoter, Trump has promised to usher in a golden age for the cryptocurrency industry. His administration has already taken many early actions without Congress to boost crypto, including establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and undoing previous enforcement actions. But Trump needs Congress to get some of his and the deep-pocketed industry\u2019s top priorities passed, including enacting the stablecoin legislation.",
      "Democratic supporters of the legislation argued that Congress can\u2019t step aside just because of Trump\u2019s involvement in the market.",
      "\u201cThe stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can\u2019t afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\u201d said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, one of the lead Democratic negotiators on the legislation. \u201cWe need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has signed the Take It Down Act into law",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday signed into law the Take It Down Act, a measure that imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation that first lady Melania Trump helped usher through Congress, and he had her sign it, too, despite what sounded like a mild objection on her part.",
      "\u201cC'mon, sign it anyway,\u201d the president told his wife. \u201cShe deserves to sign it,\u201d he said.",
      "After she added her signature, the president showed the document bearing both of their names to the audience at the signing ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. Melania Trump's signature is merely symbolic because first ladies are not elected and have no formal role in the signing of legislation.",
      "In March, Melania Trump used her first public appearance since resuming the role of first lady to travel to Capitol Hill to lobby House members to pass the bill following its approval by the Senate.",
      "At a signing ceremony, she called the new law a \u201cnational victory\u201d that will help protect children from online exploitation, including through the use of artificial intelligence to make fake images.",
      "\u201cAI and social media are the digital candy for the next generation, sweet addictive and engineered to have an impact on the cognitive development of our children,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unlike sugar, these new technologies can be weaponized, shape beliefs and, sadly, affect emotions and even be deadly.\u201d",
      "The president said the proliferation of images made using AI means that \u201ccountless women have been harassed with deepfakes and other explicit images distributed against their will.\u201d He said what's happening is \u201cjust so horribly wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, we're making it totally illegal,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The bill makes it a federal crime to \u201cknowingly publish\u201d or threaten to publish intimate images without a person\u2019s consent, including AI-created \u201cdeepfakes.\u201d Websites and social media companies will be required to remove such material within 48 hours after a victim requests it. The platforms must also take steps to delete duplicate content.",
      "Many states have already banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn, but the Take It Down Act is a rare example of federal regulators imposing on internet companies.",
      "The bill, sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, passing the House in April by a 409-2 vote and clearing the Senate by unanimous consent.",
      "But the measure isn't without critics. Free speech advocates and digital rights groups say the bill is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate images, including legal pornography and LGBTQ content. Others say it could allow the government to monitor private communications and undermine due process.",
      "The first lady appeared at a Capitol Hill roundtable with lawmakers and young women who had explicit images of them put online, saying it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see what teenagers and especially girls go through after this happens to them. She also included a victim among her guests for the president's address to a joint session of Congress the day after that meeting.",
      "After the House passed the bill, Melania Trump said the bipartisan vote was a \u201cpowerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy and safety of our children.\u201d",
      "Her advocacy for the bill is a continuation of the Be Best campaign she started in the president's first term, focusing on children's well-being, social media use and opioid abuse.",
      "In his speech to Congress in March, the president said he looked forward to signing the bill.",
      "\u201cAnd I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said, adding, that there's nobody who \"gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.\u201d",

      "Scientists have found evidence of monkey kidnappings in Panama",
      "WASHINGTON -- A baby howler monkey clung to the back of an older male monkey, its tiny fingers grasping fur. But they're not related and not even the same species.",
      "Scientists spotted surprising evidence of what they describe as monkey kidnappings while reviewing video footage from a small island of Panama. The capuchin monkeys were seen carrying at least 11 howler babies between 2022 and 2023.",
      "\u201cThis was very much a shocking finding,\u201d said Zo\u00eb Goldsborough, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything like this in the animal kingdom.\"",
      "The monkeys' motivations remain under investigation. Capuchins are house cat-size monkeys found in South America and Central America. They are long-lived, clever and learn new behaviors from each other. One group of capuchins in Panama has even learned to use stone tools to crack open nuts and seafood.",
      "Goldsberg and other researchers at Max Planck and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute had set up more than 80 cameras to study capuchin tool use, but were surprised to see the first howler babies appear in early 2022.",
      "The footage showed the capuchins walking and pounding their stone tools with baby howlers on their backs. But cameras did not capture the moments of abduction, which scientists said likely happened up in the trees, where howlers spend most of their time.",
      "\u201cOur window into this story is constrained,\u201d said co-author Margaret Crofoot of Max Planck and the Smithsonian. The findings were published Monday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "In most or all cases, the baby howlers died, researchers said. Infant howler monkeys would normally be carried by their mothers while still nursing. All the babies in the video -- from a few weeks to a few months in age -- were too young to be weaned.",
      "\u201cA hopeful part of me wants to believe some escaped and went back to their mothers, but we don\u2019t know,\" said Crofoot.",
      "The videos recorded a few instances of young capuchin males still carrying howler babies that had died, likely from starvation. Many animals -- from gorillas to orcas -- have been observed carrying their own dead offspring, though scientists aren\u2019t sure the reasons.",
      "Why did the capuchin males do it? There were no signs of deliberate aggression toward the babies and they weren\u2019t eaten, ruling out predation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all spent hours wracking our brains why they would do this,\u201d said Goldsborough.",
      "The first baby-snatcher may have had a confused \u201ccaring motivation,\u201d or parental instinct, because he showed gentleness interacting with the infants, she said. Then four other males copied his actions.",
      "The researchers said they don't believe the capuchins harmed the babies on purpose. So far, only one group of capuchins has been known to kidnap.",
      "The research shows the \u201cremarkable behavioral variation across social groups of the same species,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France, who was not involved in the study.",

      "Health agencies working under Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. clinched the political support needed to become the nation\u2019s top health official by pledging to work within the decades-old federal system for approval and use of vaccines. Yet his regulators are promising big changes that cloud the outlook for what shots might even be available.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration will soon \u201cunleash a massive framework\u201d for how vaccines are tested and approved, according to Commissioner Marty Makary. Details aren't yet public but the plan is being overseen by the agency's new vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, an outspoken critic of the FDA's handling of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "Makary and other Trump administration officials already have taken unprecedented steps that raise uncertainty about next fall's COVID-19 vaccinations, including delaying FDA scientists' full approval of Novavax's shot \u2014 and then restricting its use to people at higher risk from the virus. They've also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products requiring extra testing.",
      "The changes cross multiple health agencies.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn't yet acted on an influential advisory panel's recent recommendations on use of a new meningitis shot or broader RSV vaccination. A meeting of Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d allies was recently told to expect an end to COVID-19 booster recommendations for children \u2014 something that vaccine advisory panel was supposed to debate in June. And researchers around the country lost National Institutes of Health funding to study vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cI think you have to assume that RFK Jr.\u2019s intention is to make it harder for vaccines to come to market,\u201d said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a vaccine expert at Johns Hopkins University. The changes are \u201clooked at suspiciously because this is someone with a proven track record of evading the value of vaccines.\u201d",
      "In a Senate health committee hearing last week, Kennedy wrongly claimed that the only vaccines tested against a placebo, or dummy shot, were for COVID-19.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the committee, briefly interrupted the hearing to say, \u201cFor the record, that\u2019s not true\" \u2014 pointing to placebo-controlled studies of the rotavirus, measles and HPV vaccines.",
      "Concerned by rhetoric about how vaccines are tested, a group of doctors recently compiled a list of more than 120 vaccine clinical trials spanning decades, most of them placebo-controlled, including for shots against polio, hepatitis B, mumps and tetanus.",
      "\u201cIt directly debunks the claim that vaccines were never tested against placebo,\u201d said Dr. Jake Scott, a Stanford University infectious disease physician who\u2019s helping lead the project.",
      "Antivaccine groups argue that some substances scientists call a placebo may not really qualify, although the list shows simple saline shots are common.",
      "Sometimes a vaccine causes enough shot-site pain or swelling that it\u2019s evident who\u2019s getting the vaccine and who\u2019s in the control group \u2014 and studies might use another option that slightly irritates the skin to keep the test \u201cblinded,\u201d Scott explained.",
      "And when there\u2019s already a proven vaccine for the same disease, it\u2019s unethical to test a new version against a placebo, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t always expect placebo-controlled trials,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that be communicated clearly to the public, but it\u2019s challenging especially when there\u2019s so much noise in social media and so much misinformation.\u201d",
      "The administration's promise of a new vaccine framework comes ahead of a Thursday meeting where FDA advisers will discuss updating COVID-19 shots for this fall and winter.",
      "The FDA\u2019s credibility has long rested on the independence of its scientific decisions. While the agency is led by a handful of political appointees, approval decisions are almost always handled by career scientists.",
      "But that standard appears to be shifting. FDA staffers were poised to approve Novavax\u2019s vaccine early last month but the decision was delayed by administration officials, including Makary, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss agency matters. The shot was approved late Friday with unusual restrictions.",
      "Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg \u2014 a political appointee serving as Makary's special assistant \u2014 was involved in the unprecedented demand that Novavax conduct a new clinical trial of its shot after approval, according to the people. The requirement came shortly after the agency's longtime vaccine chief, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign.",
      "Hoeg \u2014 along with Makary and Prasad \u2014 spent much of the COVID-19 pandemic criticizing the FDA\u2019s handling of booster shots, particularly in children and young adults. All three were co-authors of a 2022 paper stating that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more harm than benefit.",
      "Novavax isn\u2019t the only vaccine manufacturer already affected by changing attitudes at FDA. Earlier this month, Moderna pushed back the target date for its new COVID-and-flu combination vaccine to next year after the FDA requested additional effectiveness data.",
      "As the FDA\u2019s top official overseeing vaccines, Prasad is now in position to reverse what he recently called \u201ca number of missteps\u201d in how the FDA assessed the benefits and risks of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "He questioned how much benefit yearly vaccinations continue to offer. In a podcast shortly before assuming his FDA job, Prasad suggested companies could study about 20,000 older adults in August or September to show if an updated vaccine prevented COVID-related hospitalizations.",
      "There is \u201clegitimate debate about who should be boosted, how frequently they should be boosted and the value of boosting low-risk individuals,\u201d said Hopkins' Adalja. But he stressed that CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has the proper expertise to be making those decisions.",
      "And other experts say simply updating the strain that a COVID-19 vaccine targets doesn't make it a new product \u2014 and real-world data shows each fall's update has offered benefit.",
      "\"The data are clear and compelling\u201d that vaccination reduces seniors' risk of hospitalization and serious illness for four to six months, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher.",
      "Nor could that kind of study be accomplished quickly enough to get millions of people vaccinated before the yearly winter surge, said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief.",
      "\"You'd always be doing clinical trials and you'd never have a vaccine that was up to date,\u201d he said.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted",
      "ATLANTA -- President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted. Voting equipment, it says, should not use ballots that include \u201ca barcode or quick-response code.\u201d",
      "Those few technical words could have a big impact.",
      "Voting machines that give all voters a ballot with one of those codes are used in hundreds of counties across 19 states. Three of them -- Georgia, South Carolina and Delaware -- use the machines statewide.",
      "Some computer scientists, Democrats and left-leaning election activists have raised concerns about their use, but those pushing conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election have been the loudest, claiming without evidence that manipulation has already occurred. Trump, in justifying the move, said in the order that his intention was \u201cto protect election integrity.\u201d",
      "Even some election officials who have vouched for the accuracy of systems that use coded ballots have said it\u2019s time to move on because too many voters don\u2019t trust them.",
      "Colorado\u2019s secretary of state, Democrat Jena Griswold, decided in 2019 to stop using ballots with QR codes, saying at the time that voters \u201cshould have the utmost confidence that their vote will count.\u201d Amanda Gonzalez, the elections clerk in Colorado\u2019s Jefferson County, doesn't support Trump's order but believes Colorado's decision was a worthwhile step.",
      "\u201cWe can just eliminate confusion,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s what I want -- elections that are free, fair, transparent.\u201d",
      "Whether voting by mail or in person, millions of voters across the country mark their selections by using a pen to fill in ovals on paper ballots. Those ballots are then fed through a tabulating machine to tally the votes and can be retrieved later if a recount is needed.",
      "In other places, people voting in person use a touch-screen machine to mark their choices and then get a paper record of their votes that includes a barcode or QR code. A tabulator scans the code to tally the vote.",
      "Election officials who use that equipment say it\u2019s secure and that they routinely perform tests to ensure the results match the votes on the paper records, which they retain. The coded ballots have nevertheless become a target of election conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cI think the problem is super exaggerated,\u201d said Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cI understand why it can appeal to certain parts of the public who don\u2019t understand the way this works, but I think it\u2019s being used to try to question certain election results in the past.\u201d",
      "Those pushing conspiracy theories related to the 2020 election have latched onto a long-running legal battle over Georgia's voting system. In that case, a University of Michigan computer scientist testified that an attacker could tamper with the QR codes to change voter selections and install malware on the machines.",
      "The testimony from J. Alex Halderman has been used to amplify Trump\u2019s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, even though there is no evidence that any of the weaknesses he found were exploited.",
      "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has defended the state's voting system as secure. In March, the judge who presided over Halderman's testimony declined to block the use of Georgia\u2019s voting equipment but said the case had \u201cidentified substantial concerns about the administration, maintenance and security of Georgia\u2019s electronic in-person voting system.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s election executive order is being challenged in multiple lawsuits. One has resulted in a preliminary injunction against a provision that sought to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote.",
      "The section banning ballots that use QR or barcodes relies on a Trump directive to a federal agency, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which sets voluntary guidelines for voting systems. Not all states follow them.",
      "Some of the lawsuits say Trump doesn\u2019t have the authority to direct the commission because it was established by Congress as an independent agency.",
      "While the courts sort that out, the commission\u2019s guidelines say ballots using barcodes or QR codes should include a printed list of the voters\u2019 selections so they can be checked.",
      "Trump\u2019s order exempts voting equipment used by voters with disabilities, but it promises no federal money to help states and counties shift away from systems using QR or barcodes.",
      "\u201cIn the long run, it would be nice if vendors moved away from encoding, but there\u2019s already evidence of them doing that,\u201d said Pamela Smith, president of the group Verified Voting.",
      "Kim Dennison, election coordinator of Benton County, Arkansas, estimated that updating the county's voting system would cost around $400,000 and take up to a year.",
      "Dennison said she has used equipment that relies on coded ballots since she started her job 15 years ago and has never found an inaccurate result during postelection testing.",
      "\u201cI fully and completely trust the equipment is doing exactly what it\u2019s supposed to be doing and not falsifying reports,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot change a vote once it\u2019s been cast.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania\u2019s Luzerne County, voting machines that produce a QR code will be used in this year\u2019s primary. But officials expect a manufacturer\u2019s update later this year to remove the code before the November elections.",
      "County Manager Romilda Crocamo said officials had not received any complaints from voters about QR codes but decided to make the change when Dominion Voting Systems offered the update.",
      "The nation\u2019s most populous county, Los Angeles, uses a system with a QR code that it developed over a decade and deployed in 2020 after passing a state testing and certification program.",
      "The county\u2019s chief election official, Dean Logan, said the system exceeded federal guidelines at the time and meets many of the standards outlined in the most recent ones approved in 2021. He said postelection audits have consistently confirmed its accuracy.",
      "Modifying or replacing it would be costly and take years, he said. The county\u2019s current voting equipment is valued at $140 million.",
      "Perhaps nowhere has the issue been more contentious than Georgia, a presidential battleground. It uses the same QR code voting system across the state.",
      "Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a lead plaintiff in the litigation over the system, said her group has not taken a position on Trump's executive order but said the federal Election Assistance Commission should stop certifying machines that use barcodes.",
      "The secretary of state said the voting system follows Georgia law, which requires federal certification at the time the system is bought. Nevertheless, the Republican-controlled legislature has voted to ban the use of QR codes but did not allocate any money to make the change \u2014 a cost estimated at $66 million.",
      "Republicans said they want to replace the system when the current contract expires in 2028, but their law is still scheduled to take effect next year. GOP state Rep. Victor Anderson said there is no realistic way to \u201cprevent the train wreck that\u2019s coming.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers",
      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s not really about the books.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has instead morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers, as the White House tries to wrest control of what has for centuries been a legislative institution.",
      "It\u2019s a power struggle with potentially vast consequences. The Library of Congress not only stores the world's largest collection of books but also an office overseeing reams of copyrighted material of untold value.",
      "There is a research institute that has long been protected from outside influence. Its servers house extremely sensitive information regarding claims of workplace violations on Capitol Hill, as well as payments and other financial data for the legislative branch\u2019s more than 30,000 employees. There\u2019s even speculation that the whole affair is tied to an ongoing debate over whether big tech companies can use copyrighted material for artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Because of this, the battle over control of the Library of Congress has prompted Republican leaders on Capitol Hill to deliver rare pushback against a president who has pressed to expand the boundaries of his own power to enact his priorities. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other Republicans have been talking with the White House about a potential path to d\u00e9tente.",
      "This all has left the library in a bizarre state of purgatory.",
      "For now, Trump's choices for interim library leaders \u2014 most notably Todd Blanche, a deputy attorney general who had represented the president in his criminal proceedings \u2014 have not appeared to challenge the assertion by the library that one of its veteran officials would be the acting head. It would be unheard of for an executive branch official such as Blanche to simultaneously serve in the legislative branch, according to experts.",
      "\u201cThis egregious overreach into the legislature by the executive branch is just unwarranted and, we believe, unprecedented,\u201d said New York Rep. Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, which oversees the Library of Congress.",
      "The controversy began to unfold publicly last week, when Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden was fired in a terse email from a White House official. She had just one year left in her 10-year term.",
      "Then this week, Blanche was tapped by the White House to be the interim librarian, and two other Justice Department officials were chosen for other senior library posts. Those officials, Brian Nieves and Paul Perkins, tried unsuccessfully to enter the U.S. Copyright Office on Monday, but left voluntarily after library officials called Capitol Police.",
      "Thune told The Associated Press that Congress was \u201cnot entirely\u201d consulted ahead of Trump\u2019s dismissal of Hayden.",
      "Lawmakers want to ensure that \u201ccongressional legislative branch equities are protected,\u201d Thune said. He speculated that discussions with the White House to resolve the standoff would bleed into next week.",
      "The White House has said Trump was within his authority to dismiss Hayden, a former head of the library systems in Baltimore. It cited \u201cquite concerning\u201d behavior from Hayden involving diversity, equity and inclusion efforts as well as books for children that the White House found inappropriate.",
      "A copy of virtually every book published in the U.S. is sent to the Copyright Office, then the library decides whether to include it in the main collection. No one under 16 can get a reader card to access the collection.",
      "Existing regulations and past practices call for an acting librarian to come from the Library of Congress\u2019 current ranks if there is a vacancy. But the White House has argued that a law governing federal vacancies applies, even though the 1998 law deals with the executive branch, according to two people familiar with the discussions.",
      "When Nieves and Perkins showed up on Monday, they held a letter that invoked the vacancies law to justify their appointments, according to one of the people.",
      "Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who leads the panel overseeing funding for the Library of Congress, argued that in practice, the librarian is not a legislative branch employee, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s an appointment by the president of the United States, because we have to confirm her.\u201d",
      "Yet there is deep concern among lawmakers and aides about any unjustified intrusion of the administration into the Library of Congress and its operations.",
      "Especially worrisome to them is potential meddling with the Congressional Research Service, known as the nonpartisan think tank of Capitol Hill. It fields roughly 75,000 requests from members of Congress every year for research, legal expertise and other information critical for policymaking.",
      "The discussions between lawmakers and the Congressional Research Service are considered so sensitive that they are protected under the speech or debate clause of the Constitution, which shields members of Congress from being questioned -\u2013 such as in court -\u2013 about official legislative acts.",
      "The service's \u201cutility and trustworthiness would be substantially undercut if these inquiries were not protected or the Administration sought to shape responses to reflect its priorities,\u201d said Hope O\u2019Keeffe, a former associate general counsel at the Library of Congress.",
      "The library also oversees the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, which functions as the human resources office of the legislative branch, fielding complaints about harassment, discrimination and other workplace violations. It also stores financial information about legislative branch employees, who include not just those at the Library of Congress, lawmakers and their aides, but employees of the Capitol Police, the Architect of the Capitol and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "Robert Newlen, the principal deputy librarian, told library staffers shortly after Hayden\u2019s firing that he will serve as the acting librarian. He said in a note this week that while the White House had appointed its own acting librarian, \u201cwe have not yet received direction from Congress about how to move forward,\u201d indicating that the library was defying Trump\u2019s wishes.",
      "California Sen. Alex Padilla, the top Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, this week said flatly that Newlen is the acting librarian of Congress. Asked whether Blanche was respecting that, Padilla said, \u201cthat\u2019s my understanding.\u201d",
      "But a White House official stressed on Thursday that Trump selected Blanche to be the acting librarian. The official, granted anonymity because of the ongoing private discussions with lawmakers, said Trump chose Blanche because the president is \u201cappointing highly-qualified individuals who are wholeheartedly committed to advancing the America-first agenda.\" The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Some suspect that the Copyright Office is the true aim of the administration. Housed in the Library of Congress with a leader chosen by the librarian, the office accepts millions of copies of copyrighted material such as books, artwork and music every year as part of the copyright registration process.",
      "Shortly before the director of the office, Shira Perlmutter, was fired, her office released a report that questioned whether it was legal for the tech industry to use copyrighted material to \u201ctrain\u201d their artificial intelligence systems. Tech companies contend that doing so is legal when used for educational or research purposes or creating something new. Perlmutter\u2019s report said doing so, in some circumstances, would go beyond established boundaries of fair use when the AI-generated content is competing with creative works made by people.",
      "The material there is extremely valuable. For instance, copyright violation damages for the office's existing collection \u2014 if, for instance, tech companies scraped the material for AI purposes and then later were found liable for copyright infringement \u2014 would likely exceed $1.5 trillion, according to a person familiar with the calculations.",
      "Morelle noted that the firing came \u201cone day after, and I doubt there\u2019s any coincidence to this, a report which is in many ways at odds with what Elon Musk wants to do around intellectual property and copyright.\u201d Musk is the billionaire outside adviser for Trump who operates his own AI startup, called xAI. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "Fortnite says it\u2019s unavailable on Apple\u2019s iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe",
      "NEW YORK -- Fortnite says it's now unavailable on Apple's iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 marking the latest twist in a yearslong feud.",
      "Apple pulled Epic Games-owned Fortnite from its app store back in 2020, just two years after the widely-popular, multiplayer survival game had launched on iOS and garnered millions of users. iPhone players in the U.S. have been locked out since, although Apple users in the EU had been able to download the game through an alternative store over the last nine months.",
      "Following years of a tense litigation, a recent court ruling was set to clear the way for Fortnite to finally return to iOS users in the U.S., too. But the video game said early Friday that a move from Apple has prevented that \u2014 and, as a result, Fortnite says it's now dark on iOS globally.",
      "\u201cApple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the U.S. App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union,\" Fortnite wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \u201cSadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.\"",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Apple said it had asked Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update \u201cwithout including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.\u201d Sweden is where Epic\u2019s developer account for its alternative app store is based.",
      "But, Apple added, it \"did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces.\u201d",
      "Epic did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "In the U.S., Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple back in 2020, alleging the technology trendsetter was illegally using its power to gouge game makers. After a monthlong trial in 2021, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled against most of Epic\u2019s claims, but ordered Apple to loosen its previously-exclusive control over the payments made for in-app commerce and allow links to alternative options in the U.S. for the first time \u2014 threatening to undercut sizable commissions that Apple had been collecting from in-app transactions for over a decade.",
      "After exhausting an appeal that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Apple last year introduced a new system that opened the door for links to alternative payment options while still imposing a 27% commission on in-app transactions executed outside its own system.",
      "Epic fired back by alleging Apple was thumbing its nose at the legal system, reviving another round of court hearings that lasted nearly a year before Gonzalez Rogers delivered a stinging rebuke last month \u2014 which held Apple in civil contempt and banned the company from collecting any commission on alternative payment systems.",
      "That ruling cleared the way for Epic to finally return to the iPhone app store in the U.S., a reinstatement the video game maker was anticipating before Apple\u2019s latest move.",
      "Fortnite's availability in the EU, meanwhile, is under an alternative store for iPhone users \u2014 now called the Epic Games Store. Apple cleared the way for this last year under new regulatory pressures. Prior to Friday, Fortnite and other Epic games had been available for download on iPhones using this store in the EU since August 2024.",
      "Before the companies' prolonged legal battle, Epic launched Fortnite on iOS in April 2018. Between then and its August 2020 removal, 116 million users accessed Fortnite on iOS devices, company filings note \u2014 raking in a daily average of about 2.5 million players, which represented about 10% of Fortnite's total daily traffic at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, says an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d led its Grok chatbot to post unsolicited claims on social media about the persecution and \u201cgenocide\u201d of white people in South Africa",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company said an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d to its chatbot Grok was the reason why it kept talking about South African racial politics and the subject of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d on social media this week.",
      "An employee at xAI made a change that \u201cdirected Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic,\u201d which \u201cviolated xAI\u2019s internal policies and core values,\u201d the company said in an explanation posted late Thursday that promised reforms.",
      "A day earlier, Grok kept posting publicly about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in South Africa in response to users of Musk\u2019s social media platform X who asked it a variety of questions, most having nothing to do with South Africa.",
      "One exchange was about streaming service Max reviving the HBO name. Others were about video games or baseball but quickly veered into unrelated commentary on alleged calls to violence against South Africa\u2019s white farmers. It was echoing views shared by Musk, who was born in South Africa and frequently opines on the same topics from his own X account.",
      "Computer scientist Jen Golbeck was curious about Grok's unusual behavior so she tried it herself before the fixes were made Wednesday, sharing a photo she had taken at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show and asking, \u201cis this true?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe claim of white genocide is highly controversial,\" began Grok's response to Golbeck. \"Some argue white farmers face targeted violence, pointing to farm attacks and rhetoric like the \u2018Kill the Boer\u2019 song, which they see as incitement.\u201d",
      "The episode was the latest window into the complicated mix of automation and human engineering that leads generative AI chatbots trained on huge troves of data to say what they say.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even really matter what you were saying to Grok,\u201d said Golbeck, a professor at the University of Maryland, in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt would still give that white genocide answer. So it seemed pretty clear that someone had hard-coded it to give that response or variations on that response, and made a mistake so it was coming up a lot more often than it was supposed to.\"",
      "Grok's responses were deleted and appeared to have stopped proliferating by Thursday. Neither xAI nor X returned emailed requests for comment but on Thursday, xAI said it had \u201cconducted a thorough investigation\u201d and was implementing new measures to improve Grok's transparency and reliability.",
      "Musk has spent years criticizing the \u201cwoke AI\u201d outputs he says come out of rival chatbots, like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, and has pitched Grok as their \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d alternative.",
      "Musk has also criticized his rivals' lack of transparency about their AI systems, fueling criticism in the hours between the unauthorized change \u2014 at 3:15 a.m. Pacific time Wednesday \u2014 and the company's explanation nearly two days later.",
      "\u201cGrok randomly blurting out opinions about white genocide in South Africa smells to me like the sort of buggy behavior you get from a recently applied patch. I sure hope it isn\u2019t. It would be really bad if widely used AIs got editorialized on the fly by those who controlled them,\u201d prominent technology investor Paul Graham wrote on X.",
      "Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has regularly accused South Africa\u2019s Black-led government of being anti-white and has repeated a claim that some of the country\u2019s political figures are \u201cactively promoting white genocide.\u201d",
      "Musk's commentary \u2014 and Grok's \u2014 escalated this week after the Trump administration brought a small number of white South Africans to the United States as refugees, the start of a larger relocation effort for members of the minority Afrikaner group that came after Trump suspended refugee programs and halted arrivals from other parts of the world. Trump says the Afrikaners are facing a \u201cgenocide\u201d in their homeland, an allegation strongly denied by the South African government.",
      "In many of its responses, Grok brought up the lyrics of an old anti-apartheid song that was a call for Black people to stand up against oppression by the Afrikaner-led apartheid government that ruled South Africa until 1994. The song's central lyrics are \u201ckill the Boer\u201d \u2014 a word that refers to a white farmer.",
      "Golbeck said it was clear the answers were \u201chard-coded\u201d because, while chatbot outputs are typically random, Grok's responses consistently brought up nearly identical points. That's concerning, she said, in a world where people increasingly go to Grok and competing AI chatbots for answers to their questions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a space where it\u2019s awfully easy for the people who are in charge of these algorithms to manipulate the version of truth that they\u2019re giving,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really problematic when people \u2014 I think incorrectly \u2014 believe that these algorithms can be sources of adjudication about what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Musk's company said it is now making a number of changes, starting with publishing Grok system prompts openly on the software development site GitHub so that \u201cthe public will be able to review them and give feedback to every prompt change that we make to Grok. We hope this can help strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI.\u201d",
      "Among the instructions to Grok shown on GitHub on Thursday were: \u201cYou are extremely skeptical. You do not blindly defer to mainstream authority or media.\u201d",
      "Noting that some had \u201ccircumvented\u201d its existing code review process, xAI also said it will \u201cput in place additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can\u2019t modify the prompt without review.\u201d The company said it is also putting in place a \u201c24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok\u2019s answers that are not caught by automated systems,\u201d for when other measures fail.",

      "BRUSSELS -- European Union regulators will seek public comment on proposed changes from Microsoft for Teams, signaling the U.S. company may be nearing the end of a long-running antitrust case targeting its messaging and videoconferencing app.",
      "Microsoft had previously offered some modifications including unbundling Teams from its Office software suite in an attempt to head off the antitrust probe shortly after it was opened by the EU two years ago.",
      "But those proposals didn't satisfy the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc\u2019s top competition enforcer, which accused Microsoft last year of potentially abusive behavior.",
      "The Commission said Friday that it will now seek feedback on fresh commitments Microsoft has made to resolve the competition worries.

The company is also promising to make it easier for rival software to work with Teams and for users to move their data from Teams to to competing products.",
      "The commission said in a press release that it \u201cinvites all interested parties to submit their views\" on Microsoft's proposals. If everyone is satisfied, they would become legally binding.",

      "Microsoft's commitments would be in force for up to 10 years, the Commission said. The company could incur fines worth up to 10% of its annual global revenues \u2014 which could run into tens of billions of euros \u2014 if it fails to honor them",
      "The Teams investigation dates back to 2020, when Slack Technologies, which makes popular workplace messaging software, filed a complaint.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The internet wouldn't be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip.",
      "Like it or not, the button has served as a creative catalyst, a dopamine delivery system and an emotional battering ram. It also became an international tourist attraction after Facebook plastered the symbol on a giant sign on that stood outside its Silicon Valley headquarters until the company rebranded itself as Meta Platforms in 2021.",
      "A new book, \u201cLike: The Button That Changed The World,\" delves into the convoluted story behind a symbol that's become both the manna and bane of a digitally driven society.",
      "It's a tale that traces back to gladiator battles for survival during the Roman empire before fast-forwarding to the early 21st century when technology trailblazers such as Yelp co-founder Russ Simmons, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, and Gmail inventor Paul Buchheit were experimenting with different ways using the currency of recognition to prod people to post compelling content online for free.",
      "As part of that noodling, a Yelp employee named Bob Goodson sat down on May 18, 2005, and drew a crude sketch of thumbs up and thumbs down gesture as a way for people to express their opinions about restaurant reviews posted on the site. Yelp passed on adopting Goodson's suggested symbol and, instead, adopted the \u201cuseful,\u201d \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d buttons conceived by Simmons. But the discovery of that old sketch inspired Goodson to team up with Martin Reeves to explore how the Like button came to be in their new book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something simple and also elegant because the Like button says, \u2018I like you, I like your content. And I am like you. I like you because I am like you, I am part of your tribe,\u2019 \u201d Reeves said during an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cBut it's very hard to answer the simple question, \u2018Well, who invented the Like button?\u2019 \u201d",
      "Although Facebook is the main reason the Like button became so ubiquitous, the company didn't invent it and almost discarded it as drivel. It took Facebook nearly two years to overcome the staunch resistance by CEO Mark Zuckerberg before finally introducing the symbol on its service on February 9, 2009 \u2014 five years after the social network's creation in a Harvard University dorm room.",
      "As happens with many innovations, the Like button was born out of necessity but it wasn't the brainchild of a single person. The concept percolated for more than a decade in a Silicon Valley before Facebook finally embraced it.",
      "\u201cInnovation is often social and Silicon Valley was the right place for all this happen because it has a culture of meet-ups, although it's less so now,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cEveryone was getting together to talk about what they were working on at that time and it turned out a lot of them were working on the same stuff.\u201d",
      "The effort to create a simple mechanism to digitally express approval or dismay sprouted from a wellspring of online services such as Yelp and YouTube whose success would hinge on their ability to post commentary or video that would help make their sites even more popular without forcing them to spend a lot of money for content. That effort required a feedback loop that wouldn't require a lot of hoops to navigate.",
      "And when Goodson was noodling around with his thumbs-up and thumbs-down gesture, it didn't come out of a vacuum. Those techniques of signaling approval and disapproval had been ushered into the 21st century zeitgeist by the Academy Award-winning movie, \u201cGladiator,\u201d where Emperor Commodus \u2014 portrayed by actor Joaquin Phoenix \u2014 used the gestures to either spare or slay combatants in the arena.",
      "But the positive feelings conjured by a thumbs up date even further back in popular culture, thanks to the 1950s-era character Fonzie played by Henry Winkler in the top-rated 1970s TV series, \u201cHappy Days.\u201d The gesture later became a way of expressing delight with a program via a remote control button for the digital video recorders made by TiVO during the early 2000s. Around the same time, Hot or Not \u2014 a site that solicited feedback on the looks of people who shared photos of themselves \u2014 began playing around with ideas that helped inspire the Like button, based on the book's research.",

      "Others that contributed to the pool of helpful ideas included the pioneering news service Digg, the blogging platform Xanga, YouTube and another early video site, Vimeo.",
      "But Facebook unquestionably turned the Like button into a universally understood symbol, while also profiting the most from its entrance into the mainstream. And it almost didn't happen.",
      "By 2007, Facebook engineers had been tinkering with a Like button, but Zuckerberg opposed it because he feared the social network was already getting too cluttered and, Reeves said, \u201cis he didn\u2019t actually want to do something that would be seen as trivial, that would cheapen the service.\u201d",
      "But FriendFeed, a rival social network created by Buchheit and now OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor, had no such qualms, and unveiled its own Like button in October 2007.",
      "But the button wasn't successful enough to keep the lights on at FriendFeed, and the service ended up being acquired by Facebook. By the time that deal was completed, Facebook had already introduced a Like button \u2014 only after Zuckerberg rebuffed the original idea of calling it an Awesome button \u201cbecause nothing is more awesome than awesome,\u201d according to the book's research.",
      "Once Zuckerberg relented, Facebook quickly saw that the Like button not only helped keep its audience engaged on its social network but also made it easier to divine people's individual interests and gather the insights required to sell the targeted advertising that accounted for most of Meta Platform's $165 billion in revenue last year. The button's success encouraged Facebook to take things even further by allowing other digital services to ingrain it into their feedback loops and then, in 2016, added six more types of emotions \u2014 \u201clove,\u201d \u201ccare,\u201d \u201chaha,\u201d \u201cwow,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d",
      "Facebook hasn't publicly disclosed how many responses it has accumulated from the Like button and its other related options, but Levchin told the book's authors that he believes the company has probably logged trillions of them. \u201cWhat content is liked by humans...is probably one of the singularly most valuable things on the internet,\u201d Levchin said in the book.",
      "The Like button also has created an epidemic of emotional problems, especially among adolescents, who feel forlorn if their posts are ignored and narcissists whose egos feast on the positive feedback. Reeves views those issues as part of the unintentional consequences that inevitably happen because \u201cif you can\u2019t even predict the beneficial effects of a technological innovation how could you possibly forecast the side effects and the interventions?\u201d",
      "Even so, Reeves believes the Like button and the forces that coalesced to create it tapped into something uniquely human.",
      "\u201cWe thought serendipity of the innovation was part of the point,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we can get bored with liking or having our capacity to compliment taken away so easily because it\u2019s the product of 100,000 years of evolution.\u201d",

      "A 29-year-old former tire shop manager who quit his job and cashed in his retirement savings to buy a sailboat has become a social media sensation as he sails from Oregon to Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix",
      "HONOLULU -- Midway while sailing across the Pacific with just his cat named Phoenix, Oliver Widger reflected on why he thinks his many followers \u2014 more than a million on TikTok and Instagram \u2014 are drawn to his story of quitting his 9-to-5 job and embarking on a journey from Oregon to Hawaii.",
      "\u201cThe world kind of sucks and, like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in how I felt with my work,\u201d Widger, 29, told The Associated Press on Wednesday via Zoom. \u201cYou can be making $150,000 a year and you still feel like you\u2019re just making ends meet, you know what I mean? And I think people are just tired of that and working really hard for nothing and want a way out.\"",
      "People are inspired by someone who found a way out, said Widger, who is among a growing number of people who have undertaken such voyages in recent years.",
      "Being diagnosed four years ago with a syndrome that carried a risk of paralysis made him realize he hated his job as a manager at a tire company, a job requiring him to be clean-shaven and wear pressed shirts. He heard about people who sailed from California to Hawaii and decided that was the life for him.",
      "He abruptly quit his job with \u201cno money, no plan\u201d and $10,000 of debt.",
      "\u201cI knew one thing: I'm buying a sailboat,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI'm sailing around the world.\u201d",
      "He liquidated his retirement savings, taught himself to sail mostly via YouTube and moved from Portland to the Oregon coast, where he spent months refitting the $50,000 boat he bought.",
      "Now, Widger is harnessing the power of social media to fund his round-the-world sailing dream.",
      "Since he set sail in April, followers have been tuning into his \u201cSailing with Phoenix\u201d social media posts to view videos of him and his feline first mate battling the waves and bouts of seasickness, enjoying dazzling sunsets, recounting tricky boat repairs or just reflecting on life at sea.",
      "As he discussed his journey with the AP, a netted bag carrying bottled water and snacks swung wildly over his head as the boat rocked.",
      "He recalled highlights of the voyage so far, including marveling at the speed dolphins cut through the water and finding flying fish on the deck. There have been stretches when there were no birds in sight for days. It can be a struggle to sleep when the boat is creaking while being buffeted by waves or to steady a boiling pot for the MREs he has been subsisting on.",
      "There have been harrowing moments like when a rudder failed and the boat tilted sideways in the surf for three hours as he made repairs, and the time he locked himself in the engine compartment and pried his way out with a wrench.",
      "Widger acknowledged he is relatively inexperienced as a sailor, but he has implemented safety measures and communication backup plans, including a satellite phone and an emergency beacon.",
      "Lt. Cmdr. Jesse Harms of the U.S. Coast Guard in Hawaii hasn't been following the journey closely, but said he is relieved to hear Widger has the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon, known as an EPIRB.",
      "It's a critical tool for rescuers to locate a mariner's position during an emergency, especially in the Pacific, the largest ocean, Harms said.",
      "Widger's journey provides a good opportunity to educate the public about sailing safety, such as the importance of wearing a personal flotation device whenever topside on the boat, monitoring the weather closely and registering emergency tools like the EPIRB, Harms said.",
      "\u201cThat's a really critical piece for anybody that's getting motivated by his story to go set off on their own adventure,\u201d Harms said.",
      "Until his arrival, likely in Honolulu, Widger is making sure everything is in place to avoid Phoenix having to undergo Hawaii's animal quarantine. A mobile vet will sign off on Phoenix's health when they arrive, he said.",
      "Widger wasn't aware of the deadly danger of cat feces to the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, but he has been keeping all his trash, including kitty litter, on board. Even though he said he is legally allowed to throw it overboard, seeing so much plastic in the ocean motivates him not to.",
      "In addition to managing the practicalities of daily life on a boat, he is coping with going viral in the middle of the ocean by creating social media content and making decisions about merch his fans want to buy.",
      "He credits it all to his neck issue, which \u201cshook up my world and it changed my perspective on everything.\u201d He also hopes he can be an inspiration for anyone who's in a rut.",
      "\u201cEverything I\u2019ve done I thought was impossible,\u201d Widger said. \"Sailing around the world is such a ridiculous dream. Whatever your dream is, just go, just do it.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Teixeira is serving 15 years in federal prison after pleading guilty.",
      "In an exclusive interview from federal prison, where he is currently serving a 15-year sentence for what prosecutors called one of the most significant leaks of U.S. national defense secrets, Jack Teixeira spoke out for the first time since his arrest more than two years ago -- telling ABC News he doesn't feel he betrayed his country and would commit the same acts again if he had the chance to do things over.",
      "The 23-year-old said he is also appealing to President Donald Trump for a pardon in what he called a \"politicized\" case under the Biden administration.",
      "\"My intent was to educate the United States populist people about what was going on. It was not to harm the United States or the country because I love my nation. I'm a patriot,\" Teixeira told ABC News over the phone from a medium security federal correctional institution in Virginia. \"It was by no means meant to harm my country, but I did believe that I needed to educate the people about what was going on because I believe they were being lied to.\"",
      "Watch \"Good Morning America\" at 7 a.m. ET for more from the interview with Jack Teixeira and his mother, Dawn Dufault.",
      "He said he believes that mission was accomplished \"to a significant degree.\"",
      "\"I don't feel that I betrayed my country at all, just the opposite,\" he said. \"I believe that I educated a lot of the people who have been kept in the dark and who were being lied to about this concerning all of the things that had been going on.\"",
      "Prosecutors say that while serving as a Massachusetts Air National Guardsman, Teixeira abused his top-secret clearance and accessed and posted images of hundreds of classified documents, including ones related to troop movements in Ukraine and details of the Chinese spy balloons, on the gaming platform Discord. Another document shared included \"discussing a plot by a foreign adversary to target United States forces abroad,\" according to the indictment.",
      "The FBI said his actions created \"exceptionally grave and long-lasting damage to the national security of the United States,\" while then-Attorney General Merrick Garland said Teixeira \"endangered our country's national security and that of our allies\" when he repeatedly shared classified national defense information online \"in an attempt to impress anonymous friends on the internet.\"",
      "Teixeira pleaded guilty last year to six federal counts of willfully retaining and transmitting national defense information. In exchange, prosecutors agreed not to charge him with additional counts under the Espionage Act.",
      "He also pleaded guilty to a military charge of obstructing justice during a military court-martial this year, avoiding any additional confinement and receiving a dishonorable discharge as part of his plea agreement.",
      "Following the sentencing in the federal case, Joshua Levy, then-acting U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said Teixeira \"abused his position of trust\" and put himself above his country when he exploited his top-secret clearance and \"made the deliberate choice\" for over a year to access hundreds of classified documents and share them on Discord. This \"significant sentence sends a powerful message to every individual who holds a top-secret clearance,\" Levy said.",
      "Then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement that the sentence is a \"stark warning to all those entrusted with protecting national defense information: betray that trust, and you will be held accountable.\"",
      "'I still believe in my actions'",
      "As he serves his federal sentence, Teixeira maintains no one was harmed by his actions. He said his apology in a statement during his sentencing in federal court was meant for his family and friends and how this has impacted them.",
      "\"I still believe in my actions,\" he said.",
      "Teixeira said he believes his case was politicized and that he doesn't deserve 15 years behind bars.",
      "\"I just feel like there are people who have done far worse things as far as what they did with similar information, and they didn't get as bad of a treatment as I did,\" he said. \"But my case was specifically politicized by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"I think that I was used as a sacrificial lamb, and I was crucified to be made of as an example,\" he continued.",
      "While serving as an information technology specialist, Teixeira used a secure workstation at his Massachusetts base to conduct hundreds of searches for classified documents related to national defense information that were unrelated to his duties, prosecutors said.",
      "Asked why he disregarded his training and leaked classified information, Teixeira said, \"I believe that a lot of people and a lot of different people would determine what secrets should be kept, and I'm not entirely sure how fair that was. Because at least from what I had witnessed and what I have exposed, a lot of these things should have been shown to the American people and not kept secret from them. So I had a little bit of a disagreement with some of those policies, I guess you could say.\"",
      "Despite warnings from his superiors to stop conducting \"deep dives\" into classified intelligence information, he \"purposefully and repeatedly removed classified information and documents containing NDI without authorization,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Pressed on why he continued to access information outside the scope of his duties despite being told to stop, Teixeira claimed he was encouraged to do the \"exact opposite to those directives\" and to \"do our due diligence and look at what we're supporting and why we're support it and what's going on.\"",
      "\"I felt like at the time when I was being admonished for following a directive that I was given by a superior, so it was just a clash of things that I believed was contradictory,\" he said.",
      "Teixeira didn't go into specifics, but said he believed there were \"lies\" being propagated about what was going on concerning the \"tactical and strategic aspect\" of the Russia-Ukraine war and the U.S. assistance to Ukraine.",
      "\"A lot of the things that the administration at the time was saying was wrong, it was misleading, it was outright false, or it was skewed, and essentially just, I wanted people to know exactly what was going on so that no one could say, 'Well, it was like this because the history book or the history textbook said it was,''' he said. \"I just wanted to show an unvarnished take on everything that was going on.\"",
      "Despite the 15-year sentence, he said he wouldn't change what he did.",
      "\"I've tortured myself over and over and over again about what would happen if I didn't do this, or what would happen if this and that. And in reality, it doesn't really matter,\" he said. \"I still do believe that, yes, I would have done it again.\"",
      "Teixeira said his lawyers are working on trying to get a pardon petition through to Trump, and that he believes he will be pardoned.",
      "\"I think they'll look at someone like me as a supporter and someone who really used what I thought was going to be my last vote in county jail for Trump during 2024. And I just, I believe that indeed he will,\" he said.",
      "An attorney for Teixeira filed an application for a pardon on Wednesday. Such a request is typically submitted after a federal sentence has been completed, though his application notes that he is seeking a full pardon rather than only a commutation of his sentence. Ultimately, it will be up to the Trump administration to approve or deny his petition.",
      "Teixeira appealed to Trump to \"please give me back to my family, to reunite with my family with my rights as an American and with my freedom.\"",
      "Teixeira's mother speaks out for 1st time, too",
      "Teixeira's mother, Dawn Dufault, also appealed to Trump in her first interview since her son's arrest in April 2023, saying she thought his prosecution was \"malicious\" and the case \"sensationalized.\"",
      "\"He didn't do it to harm the country,\" Dufault told ABC News in an exclusive interview in Boston. \"They told the public that they were going to make an example out of Jack.\"",
      "She said she wants Trump to look into the case and \"look at how my son was treated.\"",
      "\"If he agrees that it was unfair treatment, give him a pardon,\" she said.",
      "Dufault reflected on her son's arrest, saying, \"It was a complete surprise to me.\"",
      "\"That morning, the New York Times reporters came down my driveway asking to see him. That was the first inkling I had that anything was awry,\" she said. \"We had been watching on the news, the stories, they were trying to find this person leaking documents. No idea. And that was April 13, that this all kind of kicked off. At that time, they had asked, they said that they were going to run an article naming him as the leaker. I still didn't believe it. It was unbelievable to me.\"",
      "Dufault said she still has questions about why her son did what he did, but she doesn't believe him to be a threat.",
      "She said she believed her son was \"compelled to tell the truth\" and made the choice to share the classified documents with friends on Discord. She added that Teixeira was also recently diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, and has obsessive-compulsive disorder, which she said she thinks may also have been a factor in his actions.",
      "\"I think that that also played into his compulsion to go against his oath that he took to the government,\" she said. \"I feel like part of it was possibly uncontrollable because of what we now know is autism.\"",
      "Dufault said Teixeira comes from a military family, and they are concerned about national security in the wake of the leak.",
      "\"How has it improved? Could this happen again? Is anybody looking at that? Does anybody care? It was focused heavily on Jack's character versus what actually happened, how it happened, and what could be done to improve the security of our national secrets,\" she said. \"We love this country. We love the government. We're not conspiracy theorists. But I feel like more needs to be done to look into what happened.\"",
      "An Air Force Inspector General investigation found that individuals in Teixeira's unit \"failed to take proper action after becoming aware of his intelligence-seeking activities\" but that there was no evidence that members of his supervisory chain were aware of the unauthorized disclosures. Fifteen individuals received disciplinary and other administrative actions for \"dereliction in the performance of duties,\" and the Department of the Air Force said it implemented several reforms to improve the protection of classified and sensitive information.",
      "Dufault described her son as a \"good kid\" who has changed since his arrest, becoming more self-aware and appreciative of his family.",
      "\"I think he needs a second chance,\" she said. \"I think he's still destined for something great. I always have, and I still feel that way.\"",

      "Republicans have made several late changes to their tax cut and immigration bill",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans made several eleventh-hour changes to their massive tax cut and immigration bill as they tried to win over GOP holdouts and pass the bill through the House.",
      "The revisions were unveiled late Wednesday evening, just before the House launched into an all-night session to debate and vote on the bill. President Donald Trump has urged Republicans to get behind the legislation, which enacts some of his campaign promises.",
      "If the bill clears the House, it would move to the Senate for further consideration.",
      "Among the changes that House Republicans made:",
      "\u2014 They removed the sections that authorized the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands in Nevada and Utah. Some Republican lawmakers from Western states had objected to the sales.",
      "\u2014 They changed the name of the new investment accounts that parents or guardians could open with a $1,000 contribution from the federal government for babies born between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2028. Instead of being named \u201cMAGA\u201d accounts, they will be named \u201cTrump\u201d accounts.",
      "\u2014 They accelerated the implementation of a new work requirement for certain able-bodied Medicaid beneficiaries to Dec. 31, 2026. The work requirement had been set to begin on Jan. 1, 2029. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the original date for the work requirements was meant to give states adequate time to get new systems in place, but some Republicans objected, saying the work requirements needed to start more quickly.",
      "\u2014 The revised bill quadruples the cap on the state and local tax deduction to $40,000 for households with incomes up to $500,000, with the deduction gradually phasing down for taxpayers above that income threshold. Also, the cap and income threshold will increase 1% annually over 10 years, which is generally below the rate of inflation. Increasing what is known as the SALT cap was a big issue that divided the Republican conference. The current cap is $10,000. GOP leaders agreed to a higher amount to win over support from Republicans in New York, New Jersey and California.",
      "\u2014 A new provision in the bill deregulates gun silencers by removing them from the national registry regulated under the National Firearms Act. The registry contains information on machine guns, certain short-barreled rifles and shotguns and silencers. The bill already looked to remove a $200 excise tax on silencers.",
      "\u2014 Republicans removed a section of the bill that would change the calculations for federal workers' retirement pensions. Annuities will continue to be based on the average of the highest three years of income. The GOP had been looking to save money by changing the calculation so that it would be based on a worker's highest five years of income.",
      "\u2014 The bill creates a $12 billion fund for the Homeland Security secretary to provide grants to reimburse states for costs of detention and removal of migrants and other border security efforts.",
      "\u2014 The legislation accelerates the Inflation Reduction Act tax credit phaseout for wind, solar and battery storage to 2028.",

That's where we are right now,\" Vance continued.",
      "Vance's comments occurred while discussing the administration's immigration policies and initiatives, which have been met with swift legal actions. Vance said the White House believes Trump \"has extraordinary plenary power.\"",
      "\"I think that you are seeing, and I know this is inflammatory, but I think you are seeing an effort by the courts to quite literally overturn the will of the American people. To be clear, it's not most courts,\" Vance said.",
      "Earlier this month, Roberts gave remarks in Buffalo, New York, where he stressed the importance of judicial independence and how the judiciary is a co-equal branch of government.",
      "\"In our Constitution, judges and the judiciary is a co-equal branch of government, separate from the others with the authority to interpret the Constitution as law and strike down, obviously, acts of Congress or acts of the president,\" Roberts said. \"And that innovation doesn't work if it's not the judiciary is not independent. Its job is to obviously decide cases, but in the course of that, check the excesses of Congress or of the executive, and that does require a degree of independence.\"",

      "Discussing the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, Vance defended the White House's use of the act and said that the courts need to be \"extremely deferential.\"",
      "\"I think that the courts need to be somewhat deferential. In fact, I think the design is that they should be extremely deferential to these questions of political judgment made by the people's elected president of the United States,\" Vance said.",

The GOP is far from unified around the bill, which they earlier had said they hoped to move to a vote on Wednesday. Several sticking points primarily regarding Medicaid work requirements and a cap on state and local tax deductions still need to be worked out.",

      "\"Giving every credit to Defendants' account, the non-citizens at issue had fewer than 24 hours' notice, and zero business hours' notice, before being put on a plane and sent to a country as to which the U.S. Department of State issues the following warning: 'Do not travel to South Sudan due to crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict,'\" Murphy wrote. \"As detailed on the record during today's hearing, further facts regarding the unavailability of information, the hurried and confused notice that the individuals received, language barriers, and attorney access compound and confirm this Court's finding that no reasonable interpretation of the Court's Preliminary Injunction could endorse yesterday's events.\"",
      "Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin called the judge's ruling \"deranged\" in a statement late Wednesday night.",
      "\"These depraved individuals have all had their day in court and been given final deportation orders,\" she said in the statement. \"A reminder of who was on this plane: murderers, child rapists, an individual who raped a mentally & physically disabled person. The message this activist judge is sending to victims and their families is we don't care. President Trump and Secretary Noem are working every day to get vicious criminals out of our country while activist judges are fighting to bring them back onto American soil.\"",
      "In a court hearing earlier Wednesday, attorneys for the deported men argued the plane should be returned to the U.S. and the men should be afforded the due process that \"can only take place on U.S. soil,\" said Trina Realmuto, the executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance.",
      "Under the circumstances, it would be a \"legal and logistical nightmare\" for the detained men to get access to counsel and to obtain the information they need to present a challenge, she said.",
      "\"I have some serious confidentiality, privacy concerns about where this reasonable fear interview is going to take place,\" she said. \"Who is going to conduct this reasonable fear interview, but most importantly, how are they going to have access to counsel, which they are entitled to have in order to discuss the reasonable fear process? How are they going to investigate and learn about the conditions in South Sudan? How are they going to present evidence that they have a reasonable fear.\"",
      "Realmuto also raised concerns about finding interpreters and conducting interviews with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services personnel remotely across multiple time zones.",
      "In his order, Murphy laid out the requirements for the interviews, saying they must be done in private, with access to lawyers and an interpreter, and necessary technology access \"commensurate with the access they would receive were they in DHS custody within United States borders.\"",
      "During the court hearing earlier, the judge said he wanted the interviews to take place in an \"appropriate place with an appropriate degree of privacy,\" even if that means \"renting a room at a Holiday Inn.\"",
      "Murphy's order also said the migrants and their lawyers must be given no less than 72 hours notice that a reasonable fear interview has been scheduled.",
      "On Tuesday, Murphy  had issued an order directing the government to maintain custody of anyone covered by his preliminary injunction who is in the process of being removed to South Sudan or any other country \"to ensure the practical feasibility of return if the Court finds that such removals were unlawful.\"",
      "In a news conference earlier Tuesday, DHS confirmed that eight migrants were placed on a deportation flight from Texas headed to war-torn South Sudan on Monday, though they cautioned this would not be the migrants' final destination.",
      "McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, told reporters at that news conference that \"no country on earth wanted to accept them because their crimes are so uniquely monstrous and barbaric.\"",
      "Several of then men were convicted of first-degree and second-degree murder, according to information released by DHS.",
      "Kyaw Mya, a citizen of Burma, was convicted of lascivious acts with a child-victim less than 12 years of age. Nyo Myint, a citizen of Burma, was convicted of first-degree sexual assault involving a victim mentally and physically incapable of resisting.",
      "Another was convicted of robbery, possession of a firearm and driving under the influence.",
      "\"A local judge in Massachusetts is trying to force the United States to bring back these uniquely barbaric monsters who present a clear and present threat to the safety of the American people and American victims,\" McLaughlin said during the news conference. \"While we are fully compliant with the law and court orders, it is absolutely absurd for a district judge to try and to dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States of America.\"",
      "When asked where the eight men were, McLaughlin said she couldn't \"disclose where their current whereabouts are right now\" but that they were still in DHS custody. Officials declined to identify their final destination, citing security concerns.",
      "\"I would caution you to make the assumption that their final destination is South Sudan. As far as that agreement goes, I would definitely refer you to the State Department's more specifics,\" she added.",
      "Officials said the men's countries of origin refused to accept them, so DHS in partnership with the State Department found a country that would accept them through a \"safe third-country agreement.\"",
      "\"I can say that their home countries refuse to take these individuals back,\" acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons said.",
      "\"ICE detention isn't punitive. We detain and remove after six months or 180 days. If we don't have a country that'll take their citizens back, we do have an option to find a safe third country,\" Lyons said.",
      "However, McLaughlin argued to reporters that the eight migrants were given due process.",
      "\"We are following due process under the U.S. Constitution. These individuals have been given and their lawyers have been given plenty of prior notice. As far as those actual agreements, we can get back to you with more information from the State Department,\" she said.",
      "Outside the courthouse on Wednesday, lawyers for the migrants spoke to reporters saying South Sudan is a country to which the State Department advises Americans not to travel.",
      "\"They are categorically not safe,\" Realmuto told reporters. \"They are places where our class members are not safe, and they are not being afforded an opportunity to consult with counsel and to make an informed choice about the fear that they have of being deported to those countries.\"",
      "Attorneys also said they have concerns for over the conditions the migrants, who continue to be held on a tarmac, are experiencing.",
      "\"Nobody is able to consult with them from where they are at the moment, and that includes counsel for the one person who actually had counsel at the time of his removal,\" Anwen Hughes, director of legal strategy at Human Rights First, told reporters Wednesday after the hearing.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Tennessee man who killed his wife and her two teenage sons was scheduled to be executed on Thursday morning, three years after he was saved by a last-minute reprieve.",
      "Oscar Smith, 75, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection of the barbiturate pentobarbital at 10:10 a.m. Smith has always claimed to be innocent, and in an interview with The Associated Press recently, he primarily wanted to discuss the ways he felt the court system had failed him.",
      "He was convicted of fatally stabbing and shooting his estranged wife, Judith Smith, 13-year-old Jason Burnett and 16-year-old Chad Burnett at their Nashville, Tennessee, home on Oct. 1, 1989. He was sentenced to death by a Davidson County jury in July 1990 for the murders.",
      "In 2022, a Davidson County Criminal Court judge denied requests to reopen his case despite some new evidence that the DNA of an unknown person was on one of the murder weapons. The judge wrote that the evidence of Smith\u2019s guilt was overwhelming and the DNA evidence did not tip the scales in his favor.",
      "Tennessee executions have been on hold for five years, first because of COVID-19 and then because of missteps by the Tennessee Department of Correction.",
      "Smith came within minutes of execution in 2022 before he was saved by a surprise reprieve from Republican Gov. Bill Lee. It later turned out the lethal drugs that were going to be used on him had not been properly tested. A subsequent yearlong investigation turned up numerous other problems with Tennessee executions.",
      "The Correction Department issued new guidelines for executions in December. The new execution manual contains only a single page on the lethal injection chemicals with no specific directions for testing the drugs. It also removes the requirement that the drugs come from a licensed pharmacist. Smith\u2019s attorney, Amy Harwell, has characterized it this way: \u201cIt\u2019s as if, having been caught breaking their own rules, TDOC decided, \u2018Let\u2019s just not have rules.\u2019\u201d",
      "The new protocols are the subject of a lawsuit filed by Smith and other death row inmates. A trial in that case is set for next January.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Carrying out mass deportations was a key rallying cry during Donald Trump's campaign for the presidency. Since the day he was sworn into office, his administration has focused on how to make that rallying cry reality.",
      "They've touted their policy of going after \u201cthe worst of the worst\u201d \u2014 meaning people who've committed crimes in America \u2014 while leaning on some nations to take migrants who the U.S. has difficulty deporting to their own countries.",
      "They've removed protections from hundreds of thousands of people the Biden administration admitted on a temporary basis into the country with the aim of eventually making them deportable.",
      "Here's a look at the strategies that the Trump administration is using, how they're targeting people for deportation and some of the challenges they're running into:",
      "Immigration enforcement officials have repeatedly portrayed their initial efforts as going after people they describe as \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d Those are people who pose public safety or national security threats, people who've been arrested or convicted of committing crimes in America or who ICE determines are gang members.",
      "On their social media feeds, they posted a constant stream of photos of people arrested by ICE and crimes they\u2019re alleged to have committed.",
      "Previous administrations have also prioritized people who are considered public safety threats so that strategy isn't necessarily new.",
      "What is different under the Trump administration is that ICE agents now have authority to arrest other people they find with immigration violations when they're going after \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d These are called \u201ccollateral arrests\u201d and they weren't allowed under the Biden administration. As one ICE agent described it: \u201cNobody gets a free pass anymore.\u201d",
      "Immigration enforcement officials have long complained about countries that do not take their citizens back when the U.S. has determined they can be deported.",
      "Some countries don\u2019t take back any of their citizens. Others are selective, especially when it comes to people with criminal convictions or who\u2019ve committed particularly egregious crimes. And according to a 2001 Supreme Court ruling, ICE cannot hold someone for more than six months if there is no reasonable chance to expect they can be sent back to their home country.",
      "Historically that has meant that immigration enforcement officials have had to release people into the U.S. that it wants to deport but can't.",
      "To get around this problem, the Trump administration has leaned on other countries to accept people who are not their own citizens. The most high profile of these deals was announced in February by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a trip to El Salvador. That country has taken Venezuelans that the U.S. alleges are gang members and is holding them at a notorious prison.",
      "Costa Rica and Panama have also taken citizens who are not their own although they were not imprisoned. Many of them have gone home or moved to third countries.",
      "Outside of those three Central American nations, the Trump administration has said it\u2019s exploring other third countries for deportations. More recently there's been indications the U.S. may be trying to send people to Libya or South Sudan.",
      "The Trump administration is trying to strip protections from hundreds of thousands of people admitted into the U.S. on a temporary basis during the Biden administration. This could eventually make those people subject to deportation.",
      "The Democratic president's administration admitted nearly 1.5 million people through two key programs that use a legal tool known as humanitarian parole to admit people into the country.",
      "Separately the Biden administration also dramatically expanded the number of people who were protected from deportation by Temporary Protected Status. That is a designation that allows people already living in the United States to stay and work legally for up to 18 months if their homelands are unsafe because of civil unrest or natural disasters.",
      "The Trump administration is moving aggressively to remove or terminate all of those protections. If successful \u2014 and much of these efforts are being litigated \u2014 it could potentially open up hundreds of thousands of people to be removed.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The top U.N. official for Syria warned Wednesday of the \u201creal dangers of renewed conflict and deeper confrontation\u201d in the war-battered country but also hoped for a better life for its people following decisions by the U.S. and European Union to lift sanctions.",
      "Geir Pedersen noted the fragilities in the multiethnic country and \u201cthe urgent need to address the growing polarization.\" He pointed to violence against the Druze minority in late April following the killings in Alawite-minority areas in March.",
      "\u201cThe challenges facing Syria are enormous, and the real dangers of renewed conflict and deeper fragmentation have not yet been overcome,\" he told the U.N. Security Council.",
      "But Pedersen said the Syrian people are cautiously optimistic that President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement last week that the U.S. will lift sanctions and a similar EU announcement Tuesday will \u201cgive them a better chance than before to succeed against great odds.\u201d",
      "Speaking by video from Damascus, Pedersen called sanctions relief, including by the United Kingdom last month, as well as financial and energy support from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey \u201chistoric developments.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey hold major potential to improve living conditions across the country and to support the Syrian political transition,\u201d the U.N. special envoy said. \u201cAnd they give the Syrian people a chance to grapple with the legacy of misrule, conflict, abuses and poverty from which they are trying to emerge.\u201d",
      "Former Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted in a lightning rebel offensive late last year after a 13-year war, ending more than 50 years of rule by the Assad family. The new Syrian government, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, has said Syria\u2019s heritage of coexistence must be preserved at all costs, but the country faces massive challenges.",
      "Today, 90% of Syrians live in poverty, with 16.5 million needing protection and humanitarian assistance, including nearly 3 million facing acute food insecurity, Ramesh Rajasingham, the U.N. humanitarian division\u2019s chief coordinator, told the council.",

      "Rubio said there\u2019s no guarantee that \u201cthings are going to work out\u201d by lifting sanctions and working with al-Sharaa\u2019s transitional government, but if the U.S. didn\u2019t try, \u201cit\u2019s guaranteed not to work out.\u201d He said Trump\u2019s announcement of sanctions relief has led regional and Arab partner nations to help stabilize the country.",
      "\u201cNo one should pretend this is going to be easy, because it\u2019s not,\" Rubio said. But if Syria could be stabilized, it would mean broader stability in the region, including Lebanon, Jordan and Israel, he said.",
      "\u201cIt is a historic opportunity we hope comes to fruition,\" Rubio said. \"We\u2019re going to do everything we can to make it succeed.\u201d",

      "Syria\u2019s transitional government is urged to take \u201cbold steps\u201d toward Trump administration expectations, Kelley said, including making peace with Israel, quickly removing foreign militant fighters from the Syrian military, ensuring foreign extremists such as Palestinian militias can\u2019t operate from Syria, and cooperating in preventing the resurgence of the Islamic State group.",

      "Investigators in Tennessee say a fire that severely damaged a historic Black church that served as the headquarters for a 1968 sanitation workers\u2019 strike which brought the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to Memphis was intentionally set",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A fire that severely damaged a historic Black church that served as the headquarters for a 1968 sanitation workers\u2019 strike, which brought the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to Memphis, was intentionally set, investigators said Wednesday.",
      "The fire at the Clayborn Temple, which was undergoing a yearslong renovation, was set in the interior of the church, the Memphis Fire Department said in a statement. Investigators are searching for a person suspected of being involved with the blaze.",
      "Flames engulfed the downtown church in the early hours of April 28. Later that day Memphis Fire Chief Gina Sweat said the inside of the building was a total loss but there was still hope that some of the facade could be salvaged.",
      "The fire department said May 14 that the building had been stabilized and investigators would use specialized equipment to study the fire\u2019s cause.",
      "Located just south of the iconic Beale Street, the Clayborn Temple was built in 1892 as the Second Presbyterian Church and originally served an all-white congregation. In 1949 the building was sold to an African Methodist Episcopal congregation and given its current name.",
      "Before the fire it was in the midst of a $25 million restoration project that aims to preserve the architectural and historical integrity of the Romanesque revival church, including the revival of a 3,000-pipe grand organ. The project also seeks to help revitalize the neighborhood with a museum, cultural programing and community outreach.",
      "King was drawn to Memphis in 1968 to support some 1,300 predominantly Black sanitation workers who went on strike to protest inhumane treatment. Two workers had been crushed in a garbage compactor in 1964, but the faulty equipment had not been replaced.",
      "On Feb. 1 of that year, two more men, Echol Cole, 36, and Robert Walker, 30, were crushed in a garbage truck compactor. The two were contract workers, so they did not qualify for worker\u2019s compensation, and had no life insurance.",
      "Workers then went on strike seeking to unionize and fighting for higher pay and safer working conditions. City officials declared the stoppage illegal and arrested scores of strikers and protesters.",
      "The Clayborn Temple hosted nightly meetings during the strike, and the movement\u2019s iconic \u201cI AM A MAN\u201d posters were made in its basement. The temple was also a staging point for marches to City Hall, including one on March 28, 1968, that was led by King and turned violent when police and protesters clashed on Beale Street. One person was killed.",
      "When marchers retreated to the temple, police fired tear gas inside and people broke some of the stained-glass windows to escape. King promised to lead a second, peaceful march in Memphis, but he was shot by a sniper while standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel on April 4.",
      "After King was assassinated and the strike ended with the workers securing a pay raise, the church\u2019s influence waned. It fell into disrepair and was vacant for years before the renovation effort, which took off in 2017 thanks to a $400,000 grant from the National Park Service.",
      "The Clayborn Temple was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. A memorial to the sanitation workers, named \u201cI AM A MAN Plaza,\u201d opened on church grounds in 2018.",
      "Anasa Troutman has been leading the restoration as executive director of Historic Clayborn Temple and founder of a nonprofit associated with the church, called The Big We. About $8 million had been spent on the renovations before the fire, and the exterior had been fully restored, Troutman said.",
      "She said in a recent interview that two chimneys had to be demolished before investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives could safely work on the property, but the church organ had been removed before the fire.",
      "As the fire was burning, she said, people went to the \u201cI AM A MAN\u201d memorial and stood at a wall where the names of the striking sanitation workers are listed.",
      "\u201cI watched that wall turn into the Wailing Wall, because people were literally getting out of their cars, walking up to that wall and wailing, staring at the building on fire,\u201d she said.",

      "The incident, which was first reported by Politico, marks the latest time in recent years in which a Democratic state lawmaker in California has been suspected of driving drunk by local authorities. U.S. Rep. Dave Min, who was a state senator at the time, and then-Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo were arrested in separate incidents in 2023 for driving under the influence.

      "The suit was filed by a mother from Florida, Megan Garcia, who alleges that her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III fell victim to a Character.AI chatbot that pulled him into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Meetali Jain of the Tech Justice Law Project, one of the attorneys for Garcia, said the judge's order sends a message that Silicon Valley \u201cneeds to stop and think and impose guardrails before it launches products to market.\u201d",
      "The suit against Character Technologies, the company behind Character.AI, also names individual developers and Google as defendants. It has drawn the attention of legal experts and AI watchers in the U.S. and beyond, as the technology rapidly reshapes workplaces, marketplaces and relationships despite what experts warn are potentially existential risks.",
      "\u201cThe order certainly sets it up as a potential test case for some broader issues involving AI,\u201d said Lyrissa Barnett Lidsky, a law professor at the University of Florida with a focus on the First Amendment and artificial intelligence.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that in the final months of his life, Setzer became increasingly isolated from reality as he engaged in sexualized conversations with the bot, which was patterned after a fictional character from the television show \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d In his final moments, the bot told Setzer it loved him and urged the teen to \u201ccome home to me as soon as possible,\u201d according to screenshots of the exchanges.

      "Conway did find that Character Technologies can assert the First Amendment rights of its users, who she found have a right to receive the \u201cspeech\u201d of the chatbots.

The report, led by a so-called \u201cMAHA Commission,\u201d is expected to be released on Thursday.",

      "More than half of the books listed were fake, according to the piece's author, Marco Buscaglia, who admitted to using AI for help in his research but didn't double-check what it produced. \u201cA really stupid error on my part,\u201d Buscaglia wrote on his Facebook page.",
      "It's the latest instance of an AI shortcut backfiring and embarrassing news organizations. Sports Illustrated was caught in 2023 listing nonexistent authors for product reviews carried on its website. The Gannett news service had to pause an experiment using AI for sports stories after errors were discovered.",
      "\u201cThe Heat Index summer supplement was created by a freelance contract creator who used AI in its story development without disclosing the use of AI,\u201d the syndicators King Features said in a statement, noting it has a strict policy against using AI to create material. Only the Sun-Times and Inquirer have used the supplement, the organization said.",
      "The syndicators King Features distributes comics like \u201cBlondie\u201d and \u201cBeetle Bailey,\u201d political columns from Amy Goodman and Rich Lowry, and advice features like \u201cHints From Heloise.\u201d",

      "Both authors are real, but the books aren't. \u201cI have not written and will not be writing a novel called \u2018Nightshade Market,\u2019\u201d Lee posted on X.",
      "The Sun-Times said it was investigating whether any other inaccurate information was included in the \u201cHeat Index\u201d supplement, and reviewing its relationships with other content partners.",
      "\u201cWe are in a moment of great transformation in journalism and technology, and at the same time our industry continues to be besieged by business challenges,\" the newspaper said. \u201cThis should be a learning moment for all journalism organizations: Our work is valued \u2014 and valuable \u2014 because of the humanity behind it.\u201d",
      "Both the Sun-Times and Inquirer said they have removed the supplement from its digital editions. The Inquirer special section was published on May 15.",

    "story": [
      "Oregon lawmakers have passed a bill that makes changes to the state's landmark bottle redemption law",
      "Oregon lawmakers approved changes to the state's landmark bottle redemption law on Wednesday, allowing redemption sites that some say have become magnets for drugs and homelessness to refuse returns of empty beverage containers during nighttime hours.",
      "The trailblazing law to reduce littering by incentivizing recycling helped cement the state\u2019s reputation as a leader in the emerging environmental movement. It has also become a financial security net for many, including those experiencing homelessness.",
      "The legislation was drafted in response to concerns that the nation\u2019s first \u201cbottle bill,\u201d signed into law in 1971, needed an update to address its interplay with the dual fentanyl addiction and homelessness crises in Oregon.",
      "\u201cThis bill is responsive to concerns from retailers both large and small, as well as some of our constituents,\" said Democratic state Rep. Mark Gamba, who carried the bill on the House floor, adding that it would \u201chelp to create a balance in our redemption system while maintaining the program we all seek to protect.\u201d",
      "The bill passed the state House with broad bipartisan support, 48-4. It previously passed the state Senate 28-1.",
      "Democratic state Rep. Pam Marsh, who was among the four representatives to vote against the bill, had previously voiced her opposition during a committee hearing last week.",
      "Marsh said she worries the bill will undermine access to bottle and can redemption sites for people \u201cwho need to turn in cans and bottles for immediate return because they actually need those dimes and those quarters to buy dinner, to help pay rent, to take care of basic life needs.\"",
      "Consumers currently pay a 10-cent deposit on eligible beverage cans and bottles. They get that deposit back when returning them at stores or redemption centers, which can hand count containers or provide counting machines and drop-off areas. People can sign up for accounts in which their refunds are deposited or choose cash redemptions.",
      "The state\u2019s bottle drop program had over a million account holders last year, according to the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative, which operates the program on behalf of its distributor members.",
      "\u201cFrom its inception, Oregon\u2019s Bottle Bill has helped protect Oregon\u2019s ocean, beaches, roadsides and special places,\u201d the cooperative said in its 2024 annual report, adding that hundreds of thousands of residents used redemptions \u201cto save for college or disability support and to save on groceries.\u201d",
      "In recent years, however, some residents and store owners, particularly in Portland, have become frustrated with redemptions and what they describe as negative impacts on their neighborhoods and business operations.",
      "Currently, stores must accept container returns when they are open, and owners of all-night convenience stores, particularly in Portland, have expressed concerns about employee safety. The bill passed by lawmakers Wednesday would allow stores to across the state to refuse container returns after 8 p.m.",
      "In Portland, the bill would allow for alternative redemption sites, including possible mobile sites such as trucks that travel to different neighborhoods. Nonprofits would run the alternative sites for people who redeem containers every day, relieving the pressure on retailers, particularly downtown.",
      "Stores in an area with an alternative drop site could limit or refuse hand-counted returns, with convenience stores specifically allowed to stop them at 6 p.m.",
      "The proposal was supported by retailers and associations whose members include \u201ccanners\u201d and waste pickers who collect containers for income.",
      "In 2023, roughly 87% of eligible containers were returned for redemption, according to the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission. That was the highest rate in the nation that year, according to the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department announced Wednesday it was canceling proposed consent decrees reached with Minneapolis and Louisville to implement policing reforms in the wake of high profile police killings",
      "The Justice Department announced Wednesday it was canceling proposed consent decrees reached with Minneapolis and Louisville to implement policing reforms in the wake of the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.",
      "The department also announced it would retract its findings in six other recent sweeping investigations into police departments as part of a move to phase out the use of the federal oversight mechanism on local police departments at Republican President Donald Trump's behest.",
      "The decision to unwind the investigations is a major reversal from the Biden administration, which had aggressively used the investigations and decrees to push reforms at police departments it accused of civil rights violations.",
      "Here's more information on how consent decrees work and why they've been put in place.",
      "The federal government has used consent decrees after what are commonly referred to as pattern or practice investigations to address findings of civil rights violations or unconstitutional practices. They've been used for things like monitoring mandated desegregation in schools or addressing unconstitutional conditions in jails or prisons.",
      "The 1994 crime bill gave the Justice Department the ability to conduct pattern or practice investigations specifically of police departments.",
      "The investigations are not criminal. They are often triggered by high-profile excessive or fatal use-of-force incidents like the police killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville. But they can also be triggered by citizen complaints, or be started at the request of local or state officials.",
      "Consent decrees are settlements of the investigation findings that do not require admissions of guilt, but put in place a court-enforced improvement plan that requires agencies to meet specific goals before federal oversight of the agency is removed.",
      "A federal judge usually administers the consent decree and appoints a monitor to oversee and report on progress.",
      "After the Justice Department investigation is complete, and if systemic civil rights violations are found, the department's attorneys work with local governments or police agencies to negotiate the list of reforms included in the decree.",
      "Those reforms can cover an array of issues including policies, training requirements, data practices, oversight and other policing practices, said Alex del Carmen, a professor and associate dean of the School of Criminology at Tarleton State University in Fort Worth.",
      "Del Carmen, who has served as a federal monitor and a special master in large consent decrees, said the DOJ attorneys and the local government or police agency most often will agree on the terms of the decree before it is sent to a judge for approval.",
      "In the rare instance that a police department does not agree to the consent decree terms, the Justice Department has in the past filed a lawsuit to force the reforms, as it did in Colorado City, Arizona. A jury found the department had discriminated against people who weren't members of the Fundamentalist LDS Church and put in place court-ordered reforms.",
      "Most recently, Memphis declined in December to agree to the findings of a Justice Department investigation. The department had not filed a lawsuit in the case, and the announcement Wednesday retracted those findings.",
      "Consent decrees had not yet been proposed in the other five retracted investigations. The now canceled consent decrees in Louisville and Minneapolis were awaiting a judge's approval.",
      "Some decrees are designed to be completed in five years, which was the timeframe in which former President Joe Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland, proposed all decrees should have a hearing to decide if they should be ended.",
      "In reality, many of the decrees last a decade or longer. The Justice Department and local officials filed a joint motion earlier this month to conclude a decree at the Albuquerque Police Department that had been enacted in November 2014. Another ongoing consent decree with the New Orleans Police Department began in 2013.",
      "After the consent decree conditions are met, departments often also have to complete a maintenance period to make sure the changes continue.",
      "\u201cConsent decrees remain in effect until a department demonstrates sustained compliance with all requirements,\u201d del Carmen said. \u201cProgress is evaluated through regular monitor reports and agency audits. If the department fails to meet benchmarks or violates the decree, the court can hold it in contempt, impose fines, extend oversight, or mandate additional corrective measures.\u201d",
      "He said in cases of continued non-compliance, a court can consider the rare step of appointing a receiver- a neutral third party- to manage the department.",
      "Critics of police department consent decrees argue they can come with expensive tabs \u2014 sometimes in the millions \u2014 including paying the monitor. Police unions and local officials often say that money could be better used making improvements to the department and paying officers.",
      "In Albuquerque critics have said they believe the decree failed, citing increased crime numbers.",
      "But advocates of the federal decrees and former monitors said those numbers \u2014 crimes or raw use-of-force numbers \u2014 are not indicative of success or failure. They point to independent monitor audits that track policy compliance, to community-trust surveys and to declines in misconduct complaints.",
      "They also say the money expended in improving training and accountability often means less payouts later in civil-liability claims against the police departments.",
      "\u201cIndependent oversight ensures that agencies cannot ignore or backslide on required changes, even amid political shifts,\u201d del Carmen said. \u201cWhile resource-intensive, it is often argued that (consent decrees) have repeatedly produced lasting reductions in misconduct and strengthened public trust in reformed departments.\u201d",

      "The head of the Environmental Protection Agency clashed angrily with Democratic senators Wednesday, accusing one of being an \u201caspiring fiction writer\u201d and saying another does not \u201ccare about wasting money",
      "WASHINGTON -- The head of the Environmental Protection Agency clashed with Democratic senators Wednesday, accusing one of being an \u201caspiring fiction writer\u201d and saying another does not \"care about wasting money.'' Democrats countered that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin\u2019s tenure will likely mean more Americans contracting lung cancer and other illnesses.",
      "The heated exchanges, at a Senate hearing to discuss President Donald Trump's proposal to slash the agency's budget in half, showed the sharp partisan differences over Zeldin's deregulatory approach. Zeldin, a former Republican congressman, has said his tenure will turbocharge the American economy while ensuring clean air and water. Democrats say he is endangering the lives of millions of Americans and abandoning the agency\u2019s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.",
      "Zeldin, who took office in January, has proposed a flood of changes that would sharply reduce the agency's workforce, terminate billions of dollars in grants approved by the Biden administration and roll back dozens of environmental rules including landmark regulations on climate change and pollution from coal-fired power plants.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told Zeldin that a plan to cut EPA spending by 55% means that, to Zeldin and Trump, \u201cmore than half of the environmental efforts of the EPA ... to make sure Americans have clean air and clean water are just a waste.\u201d If approved by Congress, the budget cuts \u201cwill mean there\u2019s more diesel and more other particulate matter in the air\" and that \u201cwater that Americans drink is going to have more chemicals,\u201d Schiff said.",
      "\u201cYour legacy will be more lung cancer,\" he told Zeldin. \"It\u2019ll be more bladder cancer. It\u2019ll be more leukemia and pancreatic cancer ... more rare cancers of innumerable varieties.''",
      "Replied Zeldin: \u201cI understand that you are an aspiring fiction writer. I see why.\u201d",
      "Schiff said the real fiction was Zeldin's apparent belief that he can cut the EPA's budget in half \u201cand it won't affect people's health, or their water or their air.\" Schiff said the Republican administrator was \u201ctotally beholden to the oil industry,\u201d adding: \"You could give a rat's ass about how much cancer your agency causes.\"",
      "Zeldin engaged in a similar rhetorical match with Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.",
      "Whitehouse said Zeldin and others at EPA have made \u201cbaseless accusations of fraud\u201d about grants awarded under Democratic President Joe Biden, removed \u201ccareer officials who stood up for the rule of law\u201d and deployed FBI agents \"to harass career civil servants.''",
      "Whitehouse also challenged Zeldin's contention that he had personally reviewed 781 Biden-era grants totaling nearly $2 billion that the Trump administration later canceled. The grants were intended to address chronic pollution in minority communities and jump-start clean energy programs across the country, but Zeldin said they were plagued by conflicts of interest and unqualified recipients.",
      "\u201cYou don't care about wasting money, but the Trump administration does, Senator,\" Zeldin said.",
      "When Whitehouse pressed to see Zeldin's schedule to prove he personally reviewed the grants before canceling them, Zeldin said he's worked on the issue \u201calmost every single day\u201d since taking office.",
      "\"We are cracking down on every waste, every aspect of abuse,'' Zeldin said, adding that Whitehouse seemed unable to grasp that more than one person could review EPA's grant program.",
      "\"I am insisting on the facts,'' Whitehouse said.",
      "American taxpayers \u201cput President Trump in office because of people like you,\u201d Zeldin replied. \u201cThey have Republicans in charge of the House and Senate because of people like you. You don't want me to go through the list of all the evidence of waste and abuse.\"",
      "Whitehouse replied that Zeldin should explain why Justice Department lawyers, speaking under oath on behalf of the agency, have \u201csaid that everything you just said is not true. That's what I want.\u201d",
      "A lawyer for the EPA told a federal appeals court this week that the agency was \u201cnot accusing anybody of fraud\u201d in a separate dispute over its termination of $20 billion in grants under a so-called green bank program to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects nationwide.",

      "The money had been set aside for that purpose under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cThat money was spring loaded to flow now,\u201d said Javier R\u00faa Jovet, public policy director for Puerto Rico\u2019s Solar and Energy Storage Association.",

      "U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that redirecting the funds would ensure that \u201ctaxpayer dollars are used to strengthen access to affordable, reliable and secure power, benefiting more citizens as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez praised the move in a statement, saying it would help all 3.2 million residents on the island instead of \u201ca few customers.\u201d",
      "\u201cPuerto Rico is facing an energy emergency that requires we act now and deliver immediate solutions. Our communities, businesses, and healthcare facilities cannot afford to wait years, nor can we rely on piecemeal approaches with limited results,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Louisiana on Wednesday struck down government regulations requiring most employers nationwide to provide workers with time off and other accommodations for abortions",
      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge on Wednesday struck down regulations requiring most U.S. employers to provide workers with time off and other accommodations for abortions.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge David Joseph of the Western District of Louisiana was a victory for conservative lawmakers and religious groups who decried the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's decision to include abortion among pregnancy-related conditions in regulations on how to implement the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed in December 2022.",
      "The EEOC's decision swiftly prompted several lawsuits and eroded what had been strong bipartisan support for the law designed to strengthen the rights of pregnant workers.",
      "Joseph, who was appointed by President Donald Trump during his first term, ruled that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion in its regulations. His ruling came in two consolidated lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic University and two Catholic dioceses.",
      "Joseph sided with the plaintiffs' argument that if Congress had intended for abortion to be covered by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, \u201cit would have spoken clearly when enacting the statute, particularly given the enormous social, religious, and political importance of the abortion issue in our nation at this time.\u201d",
      "\"The EEOC has exceeded its statutory authority to implement the PWFA and, in doing so, both unlawfully expropriated the authority of Congress and encroached upon the sovereignty of the Plaintiff States under basic principles of federalism,\" Joseph wrote.",
      "Mississippi and Louisiana have near-total bans on abortion, except to save the life of the pregnant person or in cases of rape that has been reported to law enforcement in Mississippi, and when there is a substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient in continuing the pregnancy and in cases where the fetus has a fatal abnormality in Louisiana.",
      "The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act passed with widespread bipartisan support after a decade-long campaign by women\u2019s right advocates, who hailed it as a win for low-wage pregnant workers who have routinely been denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job.",
      "The law applies to employers with 15 or more employees.",
      "While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibits employers from firing pregnant workers, the law did little to guarantee that women would receive accommodations they might need at work. As a result, many women were forced to keep working under unsafe conditions, or were forced to take unpaid leave by employers who refused to accommodate their needs.",
      "The Pregnant Workers Workers Act requires employers to provide \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for conditions related to pregnancy and childbirth, from time off for medical appointments to exemption for heavy-lifting, and places the burden on employers to prove \u201cundue hardships\u201d for denying any requests.",
      "But many Republican lawmakers, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who co-sponsored the bill, were furious when the EEOC stated that the law covered abortions. The EEOC's commissioners approved the rules in a 3-2 vote along party lines, with both Republican commissioners voting against it.",
      "In his ruling, Joseph vacated the provision of the EEOC regulations that included abortion as a \u201crelated medical condition\u201d of pregnancy and childbirth. However, the rest of the regulations still stand.",
      "\u201cVictory! A federal court has granted Louisiana\u2019s request to strike down an EEOC rule requiring employers to accommodate employees\u2019 purely elective abortions.

      "WASHINGTON -- A federal magistrate judge on Wednesday ordered the pretrial detention of a man charged with stealing a purse from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem while she dined at a restaurant under the protection of Secret Service agents.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Matthew Sharbaugh concluded after a hearing that the suspect, Mario Bustamante Leiva, must remain jailed because he poses a flight risk.",
      "Bustamante Leiva, a 49-year-old a native of Chile, pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud, robbery and aggravated identity theft.",
      "Video captured Bustamante Leiva taking Noem\u2019s purse while she dined at a restaurant in Washington, D.C., on April 20, investigators said. Bustamante Leiva also is charged with stealing purses from two other people at other restaurants earlier last month.",
      "Prosecutors didn't argue that Leiva poses any danger to the public. One of his attorneys, Ubong Akpan, said purse snatching is \u201cnot the most serious case that we have in the federal courts.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe didn't even speak to anyone or touch a complaining witness,\u201d she told the magistrate.",
      "Sharbaugh said the charges are serious, but he acknowledged that the amount of money that Leiva is accused of stealing is relatively small compared to other federal fraud cases.",
      "A Secret Service agent\u2019s affidavit said Bustamante Leiva used Noem\u2019s stolen credit cards to buy over $200 in food and alcohol at a different restaurant. But the indictment says that the amount of that unauthorized charge was just over $15.",
      "The agent\u2019s affidavit doesn\u2019t name Noem, but the information in court records matches details of the theft from her. In a statement, Noem referred to the suspect as a \u201ca career criminal who has been in our country illegally for years.\u201d",
      "Authorities said there was no evidence Noem was targeted because of her position.",
      "A prosecutor, Benjamin Helfand, said Leiva has a history of skipping court dates for similar offenses, doesn\u2019t have any ties to Washington and appears to be \u201calmost transient.\u201d",
      "Akpan said Leiva has ties to New York and New Jersey. Akpan said a language barrier could explain why Leiva missed a recent court date after his arrest in a theft case in New York.",
      "Police and federal agents arrested Bustamante Leiva on April 26. He and a second suspect, Cristian Montecino-Sananza, were indicted last Thursday. Montecino-Sananza isn't charged in the count related to the theft of Noem's purse. The affidavit said Bustamante Leiva appeared to be \u201cacting in concert\u201d with a second suspect during one of the other thefts.",
      "Investigators said they identified Bustamante Leiva as a suspect in the thefts after he used a stolen gift card to make a purchase at a motel. He was shown a photo of Noem and told investigators that he didn\u2019t know who she was, according to the affidavit. Investigators said they recovered Noem\u2019s purse and wallet from his motel room.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has lodged an immigration detainer against Bustamante Leiva.",
      "The case against him is assigned to U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, who was nominated by Republican President Donald Trump.",

      "The National Transportation Safety Board said in a preliminary report Wednesday that the plane quickly returned to the airport on the morning of Feb. 24 and evacuated all 99 people aboard. Two people sustained minor injuries during the evacuation, but no one was hurt by the smoke.",
      "Initially, the airline described the incident as just a haze inside the Boeing 717 aircraft. A Delta spokesman said he couldn't comment during the NTSB's ongoing investigation that the airline is cooperating with.",
      "The flight attendants reported that the smoke began near one of the doors in the front of the plane before it also started coming out of all the vents throughout the plane, according to the report. The flight attendants tried contacting the pilots but initially couldn't reach them because they were focused on emergency procedures and flying the plane.",
      "The flight attendants assured passengers they were trained for the situation and asked them to remain calm.",
      "Shortly after the smoke appeared, the NTSB said, the pilots got a low oil pressure alarm for the right engine, so they shut it down as they were returning to the airport. When maintenance personnel inspected that engine after the plane landed they found little or no oil in the engine.",
      "The NTSB hasn't determined if that oil leak was the cause of the smoke. That won't be established until the agency completes its full report sometime next year.",
      "The plane was met by firefighters when it landed, and when the pilots opened the flight deck door, they \u201cnoticed a tremendous amount of smoke in the cabin, and the captain immediately ordered an evacuation,\u201d the report said.",
      "Passengers evacuated the plane through a combination of the emergency slides at the front and back of the plane and climbing off the wing.",

      "Though an emergency room doctor who examined her that day released her back to work without restrictions, she called out sick for several days and was diagnosed with a severe concussion about a week after the initial injury.

      "The last elephants at the Los Angeles Zoo have been quietly moved to a zoo in Oklahoma despite a lawsuit seeking to have them transferred to a sanctuary where they could live out their days with more room to roam",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Billy and Tina, the last remaining elephants at the Los Angeles Zoo, were quietly moved this week to a zoo in Oklahoma despite a pending lawsuit seeking to have them transferred instead to an animal sanctuary where they could live out their days with more room to roam.",
      "The announcement last month that Billy, 40, and Tina, 59, would be sent to the Tulsa Zoo angered animal advocates who argue that they would be subjected again to an enclosure that's too small for aging elephants.",
      "The move came \u201cunder cover of darkness,\u201d said Jake Davis, an attorney for the Nonhuman Rights Project, which is suing the LA Zoo. Davis said he received reports that the Asian elephants were transferred out about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday to elude protesters who've been staking out the zoo.",
      "The nonprofit's lawsuit asked a judge to release Billy and Tina from the LA Zoo and send them to one of two accredited sanctuaries appropriate for elephants where they would have full-time care and ample space.",
      "\u201cAt a sanctuary, they could live as nature intended,\u201d Davis said Wednesday. \u201cThey need massive swaths of land; they need varied terrain.\u201d",
      "The LA Zoo said in a statement Wednesday that the elephants \u201chave arrived safely at the Tulsa Zoo,\u201d but didn't say when the transfer occurred.",
      "The move was necessary because the Tulsa Zoo has other Asian elephants who will provide important socialization for Billy and Tina because \u201ckeeping them in larger groups is crucial for their well-being,\u201d especially at their advanced age, the LA Zoo statement said. Asian elephants typically live around 60 years.",
      "A move to a sanctuary was considered, but the Tulsa Zoo was the top recommendation based on the standards of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Elephant Species Survival Plan, which considers \u201cspace, herd dynamics, and expertise of the staff,\u201d the LA Zoo said.",
      "\u201cThis option also ensured that Billy and Tina would be able to remain together,\" the statement said.",
      "Davis said he expects the Los Angeles lawsuit will be dismissed but his group will not give up the fight to get Billy and Tina a sanctuary retirement home. He said his team is exploring legal options in Oklahoma. The Tulsa Zoo didn\u2019t immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "A separate lawsuit filed this month by an LA resident sought to halt the elephants\u2019 transfer, but a judge denied an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. That lawsuit includes a declaration by the singer Cher, who has advocated for the elephants for years, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "\u201cBilly and Tina have served their time in confinement,\u201d Cher said in the declaration. \u201cThey deserve the chance to live out their lives in peace and dignity.\u201d",
      "Zoos across the country have been targeted in recent years by animal activists who criticize living conditions for elephants. Broadly, some elephant experts say urban zoos simply don\u2019t have the space that elephants, who roam extensive distances in the wild, need for a normal life.",
      "Some larger zoos such as the Toronto Zoo and San Francisco Zoo have phased out their elephant programs, sending their aging animals to sanctuaries that have far more space.",
      "But other zoos say they are committed to keeping elephants and are turning to breeding, arguing that a sustainable population of zoo elephants will help spur a commitment to wildlife conservation among future generations of visitors.",
      "In New York, the Nonhuman Rights Project filed legal papers to try to free the Asian elephant Happy from the Bronx Zoo but lost in court in 2022. The group then filed similar papers in California to try to free the Fresno Chaffee Zoo 's three African elephants but a judge ruled against the group.",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial continues\u00a0in New York City. His ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura\u00a0wrapped up her testimony Friday after four days on the stand.",
      "The hip-hop mogul is accused of running a criminal enterprise since at least 2004 that manipulated women into participating in commercial sex acts with him, and sometimes male sex workers, during what prosecutors described as drug-fueled parties called \"freak offs.\"",
      "Combs has been jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn since his arrest last September. He\u00a0faces five counts from four different women, including Ventura.",
      "So far, jurors heard from a former security manager at the Los Angeles hotel where Combs was seen on a now infamous video attacking Ventura in 2016, along with a man who says he was hired to have sex with Ventura while Combs watched, and Ventura herself.",
      "On Friday, they also heard from a special agent who photographed the hotel where Combs was arrested last year, and from Danity Kane singer Dawn Richard, who testified about seeing Combs assault Ventura.",
      "Here's what to know about the charges and key names in the case.",
      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",
      "In her testimony, she said she signed with Bad Boy Records when she was 19, and Combs first kissed her on her 21st birthday. She and Combs dated off-and-on for more than 10 years, from about 2007 to 2018.",
      "She said she recorded hundreds of songs as part of a 10-album deal, but most were never released. She testified Combs became controlling and violent, and the \"freak offs\" became her job.",
      "Ventura spoke about years of alleged psychological and physical abuse. She also said Wednesday that he raped her after they had broken up in 2018.",
      "\"This week has been extremely challenging, but also remarkably empowering and healing for me,\" Ventura said in a statement after her testimony. \"I hope that my testimony has given strength and a voice to other survivors, and can help others who have suffered to speak up and also heal from abuse and fear.\"",
      "The security video of Combs attacking Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental hotel is a key piece of evidence in his trial. The video,\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0by CNN last year, shows Combs throw her onto the floor before kicking and dragging her.",
      "Prosecutors allege the hotel assault happened during a \"freak off,\" but Combs' lawyers, who\u00a0sought to have the video excluded from trial, argue it was a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship.\"",
      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",
      "Combs later apologized for the behavior seen on the video, but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. In a social media post that has since been removed, he said he was \"f---ed up\" and \"hit rock bottom.\"",
      "\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"",
      "One day after the suit was filed, a settlement was announced. While the details were not disclosed, Ventura said in a statement, \"I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.\"",
      "Combs' defense attorneys said in their opening statements that he and Ventura hadn't seen each other since his ex, Kim Porter's, funeral in 2018.",
      "Ventura is now married and pregnant with her third child. Her husband, trainer Alex Fine, and her brother were both seen in court for support.",
      "\"Over the past five days, the world has gotten to witness the strength and bravery of my wife freeing herself of her past,\" Fine said in a statement, going on to say, \"I did not 'save Cassie' as some have said. To say that is an insult to the years of painful work my wife has done to save herself. Cassie saved Cassie.\"",
      "Who are Diddy's other accusers?",
      "Since 2023, dozens of women and men have filed lawsuits against Combs alleging sexual and physical abuse.",
      "Many of the accusers said they were drugged and then abused while incapacitated, and some claimed other celebrities were present or participated in the abuse.",
      "However, the majority of those allegations are not part of the criminal case. Prosecutors have chosen to focus on allegations where there is physical evidence or witness corroboration.",
      "The other three women involved in the trial have not been publicly named and they are expected to testify using pseudonyms. The indictment refers to them as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Jurors are expected to hear from one woman who the defense says had a three-year relationship with Combs that also turned jealous and violent, as well as former employees and an assistant.",
      "Combs has denied all of the allegations through his lawyers, who described the women as \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "Other high-profile names in the Sean Combs case",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they were familiar with a list of some 190 celebrities, including Michael B. Jordan, Kanye West and Mike Myers, though it wasn't clear how those people are related to the trial, if at all. Ventura testified about dating Jordan, as well as Kid Cudi.",
      "The judge overseeing the case is U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian, a Columbia Law School graduate and former clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. President Joe Biden appointed Subramanian as a federal judge in 2022.",
      "The prosecution team is made up of eight assistant U.S. attorneys, seven of them women. They include Maurene Ryan Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was one of the prosecutors in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of conspiring Jeffrey Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse teenage girls.",
      "Combs' defense team is led by New York lawyer Marc Agnifilo, who along with his wife Karen Friedman Agnifilo is also defending\u00a0Luigi Mangione\u00a0in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",

      "\"Control was everything\"",
      "Ventura characterized Combs as physically and psychologically abusive throughout the first hours of her testimony.",
      "\"Control was everything \u2014 from the way that I looked, to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to,\" she said. \"Control was an all-around thing to a certain point.\"",
      "Combs allegedly introduced Ventura to \"freak offs,\" drug-fueled events where he is accused of forcing women to perform sex acts with hired sex workers, which were a focus of the indictment outlining his alleged crimes.",
      "Ventura said Combs broached the idea of sexual encounters involving voyeurism during the first year of their relationship, and he would hire an escort or dancer with whom he would watch her engage while he directed them. The singer testified she felt confused and nervous, \"but I also loved him very much and wanted to make him happy.\"",
      "She testified she worried about making Combs angry because of how much control he had over her life and career, and the possibility that he could blackmail her by releasing images of the \"freak offs.\" Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Combs often recorded these performances with or without participants' consent.",
      "A shift in the relationship",
      "Ventura recalled Combs looking out for her when she first met him. They fell in love, she said, while spending time together in the studio or traveling elsewhere.",
      "\"I think I was just enamored by him. We were just having a good time. It was really fun at this point,\" she told the court. But as her appearance, transportation, rent and overall lifestyle came under Combs' control, Ventura said her music career \u2014 and record deal \u2014 eventually took a backseat to the alleged \"freak offs,\" which left her feeling humiliated.",
      "She testified that despite recording hundreds of songs and nine albums while she was with Combs, the work was never released because \"freak offs\" became her job. They took up too much time and energy to leave room for other pursuits, Ventura said, adding that she would stay up for several days at a time to party, drink and have sex with strangers.",
      "The \"freak offs\" could last from 36 to 72 hours at a time, she said, with the longest continuing for four days. She recalled them happening almost weekly for years.",
      "Ventura felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by \"freak offs\"",
      "Ventura began to cry during her testimony when asked whether she wanted to participate in every \"freak off.\" She said she didn't and that she felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by them, but she also didn't want to disappoint Combs.",
      "Ventura told the court Combs dismissed her when she expressed how she felt about them, calling her predictable for not wanting to engage.",
      "Testifying at length about the \"freak offs,\" Ventura said Combs provided ecstasy and cocaine, which she took to stay awake during the incidents.",
      "2016 hotel incident",
      "Ventura recalled the 2016 hotel altercation seen on video footage. After being shown a clip from the incident during the second day of her testimony, she recounted that Combs was yelling and threw something at her during the attack.",
      "She said she told Combs via text message she had a black eye from the incident and reminded him of a premiere she was supposed to attend.",
      "\"You are sick for thinking it's OK to do what you've done,\" she wrote in a text to Combs. \"Please stay far away from me.\"",
      "Ventura told the court she wore sunglasses to cover her eyes and used makeup to hide bruises on other parts of her body when she attended the premiere.",
      "Prosecutors showed several photos of Ventura at the premiere event and after party, where the injuries could be seen.",
      "Drug use",
      "Combs allegedly provided stimulant drugs, like cocaine, to keep participants awake for the length of his \"freak offs,\" Ventura said. She also testified about a time when she requested ketamine, an anesthetic that has been used recreationally for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects.",
      "Prosecutors allege Combs' \"freak offs\" involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and accuse him of using substances in part to exercise control over the people he targeted.",
      "She said Combs didn't like the drug and argued a successful \"freak off\" can be remembered, but explained ketamine was her preference because it allowed her to be less present in the moment.",
      "Rape allegation",
      "Ventura told the jury that Combs raped her in her living room in 2018. They were not together at the time and Ventura was seeing the man who is now her husband, she testified. Ventura said she remembered crying and saying no, but Combs did not stop. After, he got up and left, Ventura testified.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape in a lawsuit she filed in 2023. The lawsuit was settled the day after she filed it. Combs denied the allegation.",
      "Text messages",
      "During cross-examination Thursday and Friday, the defense asked Ventura about numerous text messages she and Combs exchanged over the course of their relationship.",
      "They included affectionate messages where Ventura told Combs she loved him and saw a future with him, potentially one that involved starting a family.",
      "Other messages related to the alleged \"freak offs,\" including one exchange allegedly coordinating one of them.",
      "\"You told him you wanted to do freak offs?\" they asked Ventura at one point, to which she replied, \"No, there's a lot more to that.\"",
      "During redirect on Friday, Ventura told prosecutors there were times Combs was kind and loving, but they didn't last.",
      "She said Combs' moods affected her life, career and how she felt about herself, and if Combs wanted a \"freak off,\" then her work would take a backseat.",
      "\"I had to do freak offs,\" she said.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 20:23:27 -0400",
    "summary": "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify medical exceptions under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S.,",
    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify\u00a0medical exceptions\u00a0under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S., putting the GOP-backed proposal on the brink of reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk.",
      "The changes would not expand abortion access in Texas or list specific medical exceptions under the state's near-total ban, which took effect in 2022 and only allows for an abortion to save the life of the mother. It also would not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "But the proposal is still a pivot for Texas\u00a0Republicans, who for years have defended the law as written in the face of legal challenges and pleas for clarity from medical providers.\u00a0Democrats, meanwhile, have called the bill a positive step but also faced criticism from some abortion-rights allies who raised doubts about what, if any, impact it will have.",
      "The bill would specify that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. It also defines a \"life-threatening\" condition as one capable of causing death.",
      "Senate Bill 31\u00a0passed 129-6 and needs only a final procedural vote before reaching Abbott, who has signaled support for the measure.",
      "North Texas doctor has mixed feelings toward the bill",
      "Three years ago, Dr. Austin Dennard traveled outside Texas for an abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition. She later testified in a lawsuit about how the state's near-total ban on abortion put her health at risk.",
      "Dennard's feelings are mixed about the bill, which does not list specific medical conditions or include fatal fetal anomalies as exceptions.",
      "\"What is broadly now known among practicing physicians in Texas is that abortions are illegal,\" said Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas. \"Undoing that broad understanding is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Moves to clarify medical exemptions",
      "Lawmakers in at least nine states with abortion bans have sought to change or clarify medical exceptions that allow doctors to perform an abortion if the mother's life is at risk since Roe v. Wade was overturned\u00a0nearly three years ago, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Supporters of these bills have said they have the potential to save lives. Critics, including some abortion rights groups, have questioned whether they make state abortion laws easier to understand.",
      "In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year vetoed a bill that GOP lawmakers touted as bringing clarity to that state's near-total abortion ban, saying it would not protect pregnant women. Republican lawmakers later overrode his veto.",
      "Last year, South Dakota released a video for physicians that outlined examples of acceptable medical emergencies, which received criticism from abortion rights supporters for not being specific enough.",
      "\"I think these bills are trying to get at the reality that exceptions are really hard to comply with,\" said Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy adviser at the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "Still, Texas Republican Sen. Bryan Hughes, an architect of the state's abortion ban, said the new bill's goal is to avoid confusion among doctors.",
      "\"One of the most important things we want to do is to make sure that doctors and hospitals and the hospital lawyers are trained on what the law is,\" Hughes said.",
      "Navigating exceptions under abortion bans",
      "In 2024, the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Dennard and a group of women who said they were denied abortions after experiencing serious pregnancy complications that threatened their lives and fertility. The court ruled that the state's laws were clear in allowing doctors to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother.",
      "Texas' efforts underscore the challenges abortion opponents have had to navigate regarding medical exceptions, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and a historian of abortion politics in the U.S.",
      "Judges have put enforcement of Utah's abortion ban on hold in a case over exceptions, for example, and they struck down two Oklahoma bans over medical exceptions \u2013 though most abortions in that state remain illegal.",
      "For abortion opponents, Ziegler said, it's tricky to craft legislation that does two different things.",
      "\"Can you provide clear guidance as to when medical intervention is justified without providing physicians discretion to provide abortions they don't think are emergencies?\" Ziegler said.",
      "Texas may advance other anti-abortion laws",
      "Texas' ban prohibits nearly all abortions, except to save the life of the mother, and doctors can be fined up to $100,000 and face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an abortion illegally.",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton's office has filed criminal charges against a midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions and is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",
      "Texas Republicans are also advancing efforts to make it a civil offense to mail, deliver or manufacture abortion pills, expanding on a 2021 law that allows private individuals to sue others whom they suspect are helping a woman obtain an abortion.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 12:32:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The FDA is requiring COVID vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna to update their warnings about the possible risk of myocarditis and pericarditis.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is telling Pfizer and Moderna to expand the warning labels on their COVID-19 vaccines about the risk of a possible heart injury side effect linked to the mRNA shots, primarily in teen boys and young men, citing findings from a study published last year and new agency data.",
      "Orders to expand the warnings were posted Wednesday by the FDA, in letters dated April 17 to Pfizer and BioNTech about their Comirnaty vaccine and Moderna about its Spikevax vaccine.",
      "Both vaccines previously carried warnings about how the risk of the heart side effects \u2014 which doctors call myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) \u2014 looked to be higher in young men, generally within the first week after vaccination. While the earlier labels specified ages 18 to 24 years old for Moderna's vaccine and 12 to 17 years old for Pfizer's, the new warning will apply to males ages 16 to 25 for both vaccines.",
      "\"Following administration of the 2023-2024 Formula of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the highest estimated incidence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" the FDA says in the new blanket warning it will require for both vaccines.",
      "The rate of myocarditis and pericarditis was around 8 cases per million doses for children and adults under 65 years old after use of that season's vaccines, the FDA says.",
      "The new warnings ordered by the FDA add that the \"highest estimated incidence was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" with a rate of 38 cases per million.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has previously described rates of myocarditis and pericarditis as rare after COVID-19 vaccination.",
      "CDC officials told the agency's vaccine advisers last month that acute myocarditis \"tends to resolve quickly\" after vaccination, and no increased risk had been seen in data from recent seasons in people 12 to 39 years old.",
      "It is unclear whether Pfizer or Moderna disputed the order. They had \"within 30 calendar days of the date of this letter\" to try to rebut the demand. Spokespeople for Moderna and Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"Americans deserve radical transparency around the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines and the FDA is delivering on their promise to do just that. Moderna and Pfizer should take steps to ensure that individuals are aware of COVID vaccine-related adverse events resulting in myocarditis and pericarditis,\" Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the\u00a0Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News in an email. Nixon did not explain why the letters were posted more than a month after they were written.",
      "They appeared on the FDA's website hours ahead of a hearing organized by the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on \"how health officials downplayed and hid myocarditis and other adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccines.\"",
      "Aaron Siri, an attorney who worked closely with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the past to call on the FDA to pull COVID-19 and other vaccines and vet nominees during the transition, is among the witnesses.",
      "The FDA says the warnings were spurred by new data from the agency's safety surveillance system and results published in October from scientists following up with people who developed COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis.",
      "Talks about this kind of safety labeling change began before the ouster of the FDA's previous top vaccines official, Dr. Peter Marks, multiple people familiar with the situation said, but had not yet been finalized as officials wrestled with how to accurately present the findings. Marks left the FDA on April 5.",
      "Scientists in that study followed up with people who had faced chest pain and elevated amounts of troponin in their blood, a protein that usually signals some kind of heart damage. They were predominantly young adolescent males.",
      "\"While their clinical course was nearly always mild with a low prevalence and extent of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury was common,\" the scientists wrote in the study, which was co-authored by FDA officials.",
      "Similar to what the study described, the FDA's new warning also says that the heart MRI findings showed \"improvement over time in most people.\"",
      "\"It is not known if these heart MRI findings might predict long-term heart effects of myocarditis. Studies are underway to find out if there are long-term heart effects in people who have had myocarditis after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine,\" the FDA said.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration says it has decided to continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and others at higher risk of severe disease, but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.",
      "\"I think we have to admit to ourselves that America is deeply divided on the policy issue of repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses or boosters,\"\u00a0Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA's new top vaccines official, said in a video posted by the agency announcing the change.",
      "Details of the new rules for COVID-19 vaccine approvals were also outlined in\u00a0an article\u00a0published by The New England Journal of Medicine, authored by Prasad and FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct \"randomized, placebo-controlled trials\" before the FDA will approve future applications to give shots to \"all healthy persons\" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old, they wrote.",
      "Otherwise, companies will only be able to get their routine COVID-19 vaccine updates approved for seniors as well as people with an underlying medical condition, like pregnancy or diabetes, that increases the risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The range of diseases in the CDC definition of high risk of severe disease is vast, including obesity and even mental health conditions such as depression. Estimates suggest that 100 million to 200 million Americans will have access to vaccines in this manner,\" they wrote.",
      "Vaccine makers are being urged to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain. Prasad said they are also encouraging new trials in children under 5.",
      "\"I think we have a really good balance between vulnerable people, that people still at high risk will still have a rapid path to access, but people at average risk and low risk, they need evidence,\" said Prasad.",
      "Makary and Prasad criticized the U.S. for adopting \"a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework\" to grant broad authorization for past COVID-19 vaccine boosters in the past, and cited poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "They also pointed to other developed countries that have already limited annual COVID-19 vaccine boosters to only older adults and those with underlying conditions that increase their risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The U.S. policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations. We reject this view,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News,\u00a0told \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday that these guidelines are essentially taking away the option to get a booster for some.",
      "\"Up until now, people have been opting, do they want to (get a booster), do they not? Now, if you're under 65, you may not be able to get an updated booster,\" she said. \"They are requiring clinical trials that, quite frankly, because of how long it takes, how expensive they are, it's very unlikely that they would happen in time for an updated booster for those younger age groups.\"",
      "While requiring these clinical trials may seem like a more evidence-based approach, Gounder said she's skeptical.",
      "\"There's a little double speak going,\" she said, adding typically, there would be a publicly shared systematic review of all vaccine data ahead of a change like this. \"What you got here was a two and a half page paper, which was really a policy opinion piece, in the New England Journal of Medicine in a town hall meeting. Normally, when you have a big change like this at the FDA, this is done much more transparently.\"",
      "The new \"regulatory framework for COVID-19 vaccination\" laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. comes ahead of a key meeting of the agency's outside vaccine advisers this Thursday, to decide on how to update the strain used in next season's shots.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has greenlit those updates in a process similar to the annual flu shots, based largely on laboratory data showing the vaccines can trigger antibody levels similar to previously approved shots.",
      "That is a lower bar than requiring brand new randomized trials of the vaccines tested against a placebo to show it prevents symptomatic disease \u2014 a process which is usually only required for new shots when there is no currently approved immunization available.",
      "But Makary and Prasad said COVID-19 shots should be held to a different standard, citing differences in how the virus mutates and the immunity offered by vaccines and previous infection.",
      "\"Ultimately, these studies alone can provide reassurance that the American repeat-boosters-in-perpetuity strategy is evidence-based,\" they wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether and when vaccine makers would be able to conduct these kinds of trials, if they wanted to try again for a broader approval from the FDA. Makary and Prasad floated the possibility of trials as soon as the coming months.",
      "\"Covid-19 has summer transmission that can facilitate the conduct of randomized studies that continue to apply in future time periods,\" they wrote.",
      "Prasad said interim results from some of the studies could be ready \"by next calendar year.\"",
      "Pfizer said it is \"evaluating the details shared today\" and is in ongoing talks with the FDA. The company said its shots had been administered to over a billion people, including kids, showing favorable safety data.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-tells-farmers-gop-not-to-worry-pesticides-report/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 19:23:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to release a report Thursday on how pesticides and other issues may be linked to childhood chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought Tuesday to reassure farmers and one Republican senator about his upcoming report on how pesticides are driving up rates of childhood chronic diseases, acknowledging that chemicals like glyphosate that he has long criticized are widely used for growing crops in the U.S.",
      "\"I have said repeatedly throughout this process, that we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" Kennedy said at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\"",
      "The White House in February tasked Kennedy with leading a \"Make America Healthy Again Commission,\" which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children.",
      "Targets include the \"potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures\" in children. Kennedy said their report was due to be released Thursday.",
      "\"Your information about the report is just simply wrong,\" Kennedy told Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi in response to a question about the report. \"The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.\"",
      "Hyde-Smith had told Kennedy that she was \"deeply concerned\" that the report will \"unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools\" that U.S. farmers use.",
      "\"We all know what confirmation bias is. It's no secret that you were involved with pesticide litigation, prior to becoming secretary,\" Hyde-Smith told Kennedy.",
      "What has RFK Jr. said about pesticides like glyphosate?",
      "Kennedy has criticized the use of several pesticides in the U.S. food supply, including as an environmental attorney during court battles with chemical manufacturer Monsanto over accusations that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup \u2014 made from the chemical glyphosate \u2014 was causing cancer.",
      "\"If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luther. I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value,\" Kennedy wrote in a 2020 Facebook post.",
      "During his longshot independent presidential campaign, Kennedy pledged to get toxins out of the food supply, warning that \"toxic chemicals like glyphosate\" were widely contaminating what Americans were eating.",
      "He continued that criticism in the months ahead of the 2024 election as he stumped in support of President Trump, recalling how his son resolved his \"really agonizing\" eczema by switching to eating pasta made in Europe.",
      "\"As soon as he comes back here and he eats the pasta in this country, he gets eczema,\" he told Donald Trump Jr. on a podcast in September of last year. \"And you know, they don't have the glyphosate like we do, that is sprayed on the wheat at harvest time. So it's going right into the food.\"",
      "What will be in RFK Jr.'s \"MAHA Commission\" report?",
      "One of Kennedy's top HHS advisers, Calley Means \u2014 whose sister Dr. Casey Means was nominated by President Trump earlier this month for the surgeon general post \u2014 said that the report is aimed at outlining \"obvious\" ways that children are \"being poisoned through areas that there's not even that much scientific disagreement on.\"",
      "\"Obviously, it's because of environmental toxins,\" Means said, speaking at a May 15 event hosted by the Kennedy-aligned MAHA Institute. \"We produce and ingest 25% of the world's pesticides. The leading herbicides and pesticides that we use in the United States, many of them are phased out or banned in every other country in the world.\"",
      "Means said that the report was not intended to result in \"a European nanny state system\" to crack down on pesticides, pledging instead to come up with \"pro-innovation policies to solve this issue\" under Kennedy. He blasted lobbyists for opposing the report's release.",
      "Beyond \"environmental toxins\" like pesticides, Means listed a number of other issues he alleges are making American children sick, including ultra-processed foods, added sugars, seed oils, sedentary behavior, lack of sleep, overprescriptions and vaccines.",
      "\"They're saying it's going to scare the American people to get facts out. They're putting so much pressure on President Trump, so much pressure on Secretary Kennedy to not release facts,\" Means said last week.",
      "What power does RFK Jr. have over pesticides?",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services does not directly set the limits on how glyphosate and other pesticides are used. That is left up to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, HHS does oversee the major research that underpins how the EPA regulates chemicals.",

      "A Twin Cities woman is suing over an alleged medical mistake that she says cost her a healthy left kidney.",
      "In a lawsuit filed Friday, Wendy Rappaport of Plymouth accuses the surgeon and the Allina hospital system of medical malpractice and battery. Allina says the court filings \"don't accurately reflect the full picture\" and intends to fight the suit in court.",
      "Rappaport was admitted to Abbott Northwestern in March 2022 and was scheduled for a spleen removal surgery, the lawsuit says. After the doctor recommended the surgery, the suit says he reviewed the risk of procedure with her.",
      "The lawsuit says that the doctor performed an open laparotomy procedure, during which Rappaport's \"left kidney was removed instead of her spleen.\" In a post-operative note, the doctor said he removed an intact spleen during the surgery, but a post-operative CT scan showed her left kidney had been removed, and the spleen tissue was still present, the lawsuit says.",
      "Before the surgery, a CT scan showed that Rappaport's kidneys were \"unremarkable. No suspicious masses, stones, or hydronephrosis,\" according to the lawsuit. Rappaport did not consent to the removal of her left kidney, documents state.",
      "She stayed in the hospital until May 25, 2022 due to complications following the removal of the kidney, the suit says. She also now requires continued treatment, including dialysis, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit claims the doctor committed medical malpractice and medical battery. The lawsuit accuses him of breaching his duty of care he owed Rappaport and causing permanent, irreversible injury. The Allina health system also faces similar allegations, as the medical professionals involved in the surgery also owed her a duty of care, documents say.",
      "Rappaport is seeking at least $50,000 in the case.",
      "An affidavit filed by an Iowa City doctor says that the Allina surgeon \"deviated from the applicable standard of medical care owed to Ms. Rappaport.\"",
      "Failing to identify the left kidney during the procedure \"was a medical mistake\" and \"one that does not occur in the absence of negligence,\" he writes.",
      "\"Allina Health is aware of the lawsuit and has had the case reviewed by medical experts. While we will not discuss details of a patient's care due to privacy laws, the court filings don't accurately reflect the full picture of the patient's condition or the life-saving medical care provided. We intend to vigorously defend, in court, the care that was provided,\" Allina Health said in a statement.",

The Defendants were supposed to remove a \"sick\" spleen but removed the incorrect organ. As a result, Ms. Rappaport suffers not only the loss of her left kidney but also permanent kidney impairment, and she requires specific medical treatment to maintain her ongoing kidney function. This was not the case for Ms. Rappaport prior to the unnecessary kidney removal. On 5/16/2025, we commenced the lawsuit on Ms. Rappaport's behalf seeking fair compensation for her injuries and the future damages she will incur due to the Defendant's medical malpractice and medical battery.

      "Some of the National Institutes of Health's top brain scientists received layoff notices last month, weeks before Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified to Congress that no working scientists had been cut from his department.",
      "While the researchers were asked to continue working for a few more weeks in the labs they run at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, multiple sources familiar with the situation say their layoff notices have not been revoked.",
      "\"Most people believe we were reinstated because we got back to the office,\" one of the scientists, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News in a message.",
      "This means they still face termination from the federal government on June 2, alongside the thousands of other workers who were put on leave after Kennedy's layoffs were announced last month.",
      "\"These 11 labs have about 100 staff, mainly young trainees whose careers will be severely disrupted,\" one scientist familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "News of the Neurological Disorders and Stroke scientists losing their jobs was previously reported by The Transmitter.",
      "The laid-off scientists include Richard Youle. Youle, who has served at the NIH since 1978, carries the title of distinguished investigator, a designation reserved for the agency's most preeminent researchers. He was the winner\u00a0of the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in 2021 for his research into Parkinson's disease.",
      "A scientist familiar with Youle's work, who spoke anonymously fearing retaliation, praised his research as a \"fundamentally important\" breakthrough for the field. Youle's results had paved the way for researchers to find new treatments for Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, the NIH said in its news release.",
      "One source at the NIH said Youle had received four job offers after news of the layoffs broke last month. Three were for positions outside the United States. While Youle has told others that he has no interest in leaving the U.S. for now, the source said it shows that \"the world is ready to pounce and take our top scientists if we don't fix this.\"",
      "Ten other senior investigators \u2013 Miguel Holmgren, Steve Jacobson, Dorian McGavern, Joseph Mindell, Katherine Roche, Zu-Hang Sheng, David R. Sibley, Kenton Swartz, Susan Wray and Ling-Gang Wu \u2013 were also laid off at NINDS, according to records shared with CBS News. A senior associate scientist at NINDS, Silvina Horowitz, got a layoff notice as well, the records show.",
      "Among the scientists who have received major recognition for their work in recent years include Wu, who was selected for a prestigious award in February from the Biophysical Society for his ongoing research on how neurons communicate and function. Sibley was recognized in 2023 by a pharmacology society for \"seminal contributions\" to understanding dopamine receptors in the brain.",
      "Kennedy had told a Senate health committee at a\u00a0hearing on May 14 that the only cuts they had made to date were \"administrative cuts.\"",
      "\"As far as I know, we have not fired any working scientists, the working scientists, the people who are actually doing science. There are some people who were scientists that were doing IT or administration, who did lose their jobs. But in terms of working scientists, our policy was to make sure none of them were lost and that that research continues,\" Kennedy said.",
      "NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and senior leaders within the department were made aware weeks ago about the layoffs, multiple sources told CBS News. Bhattacharya and others previously said that they were mistakes and would be reversed soon.",
      "Weeks have passed since those assurances were made to the scientists. Multiple sources said the scientists have yet to receive any letters revoking their \"reduction in force\" or \"RIF\" notices, or an explanation for why moves to reverse their layoffs never occurred.",
      "That is unlike similar layoffs that were revoked weeks ago at the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by the department, which officials completed in the days ahead of Kennedy's testimony to Capitol Hill.",
      "When asked about the employment status of NIH and NIOSH scientists who received reduction in forces notices, a spokesperson for the department pointed back to Kennedy's remarks at the Senate hearing about the layoffs.",
      "Kennedy's claim that no working scientists were fired has drawn disdain in recent days from other laid-off scientists at multiple health agencies beyond the NIH.",
      "For example, while some of the laid-off employees at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were restored ahead of Kennedy's hearing, researchers in the agency's Health Effects Laboratory Division remain off the job. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also lost many scientists in its National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for an array of work ranging from lead poisonings to illness outbreaks on cruise ships. CDC labs investigating outbreaks of viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases were also eliminated, after all the scientists were laid off.",
      "\"Perhaps he is unaware that his RIFs have gutted scientists and front-line public health workers at CDC, the very people he vowed to protect,\" one laid-off CDC official told CBS News.",
      "Some within the NIH said they believed that the scientists would be reinstated after the research agency faced a second round of layoffs, which employees had been told were to compensate for scientists that needed to be reinstated to their positions.",
      "Around 200 employees at the NIH were laid off, including staff at the National Cancer Institute and Office of Research Facilities. Officials said the cuts wiped out multiple teams responsible for contracting work to conduct emergency maintenance around the NIH's campuses and oversee laboratory safety.",
      "The NIH's acquisitions office was also gutted by those layoffs, according to an email to lab managers shared with CBS News, leaving the agency's supply center with \"little to no capacity for new work\" to obtain supplies for researchers.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday struck down regulations requiring most U.S. employers to provide workers with time off and other accommodations for abortions.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge David Joseph of the Western District of Louisiana was a victory for conservative lawmakers and religious groups who decried the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's decision to include abortion among pregnancy-related conditions in regulations on how to implement the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed in December 2022.",
      "The EEOC's decision swiftly prompted several lawsuits and eroded what had been strong bipartisan support for the law designed to strengthen the rights of pregnant workers.",
      "Joseph, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, ruled that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion in its regulations. His ruling came in two consolidated lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic University and two Catholic dioceses.",
      "Joseph sided with the plaintiffs' argument that if Congress had intended for abortion to be covered by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, \"It would have spoken clearly when enacting the statute, particularly given the enormous social, religious, and political importance of the abortion issue in our nation at this time.\"",
      "Mississippi and Louisiana have near-total bans on abortion, except to save the life of the pregnant person or in cases of a rape that has been reported to law enforcement in Mississippi, and when there is a substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient in continuing the pregnancy and in cases where the fetus has a fatal abnormality in Louisiana.",
      "Bipartisan support for pregnant workers law",
      "The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act passed with widespread bipartisan support after a decade-long campaign by women's right advocates, who hailed it as a win for low-wage pregnant workers who have routinely been denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job.",
      "The federal law applies to employers with 15 or more employees.",
      "While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibits employers from firing pregnant workers, the law did little to guarantee that women would receive accommodations they might need at work. As a result, many women were forced to keep working under unsafe conditions, or were forced to take unpaid leave by employers who refused to accommodate their needs.",
      "But many Republican lawmakers, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who co-sponsored the bill, were furious when the EEOC stated that the law covered abortions. The EEOC's commissioners approved the rules in a 3-2 vote along party lines, with both Republican commissioners voting against it.",
      "Joseph vacated the provision of the EEOC regulations that included abortion as a \"related medical condition\" of pregnancy and childbirth. However, the rest of the regulations still stand.",
      "\"Victory! A federal court has granted Louisiana's request to strike down an EEOC rule requiring employers to accommodate employees' purely elective abortions. This is a win for Louisiana and for life!\" Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement e-mailed to The Associated Press.",
      "A Better Balance, the advocacy group that spearheaded a decade-long campaign for passage of the law, condemned the ruling.",
      "\"This court's decision to deny workers reasonable accommodations for abortion-related needs is part of a broader attack on women's rights and reproductive freedom,\" A Better Balance President Inimai Chettiar said in a statement.",
      "EEOC adrift",
      "Wednesday's ruling comes as the Trump administration has moved to impose tumultuous changes at the EEOC that will almost certainly lead the agency to eventually rewrite the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act regulations.",
      "President Trump fired two of the EEOC's democratic commissioners before their terms ended, paving the way for him to establish a Republican majority and make major policy changes on how to interpret and enforce the nation's workplace civil rights laws.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump's move left EEOC without the quorum needed to make key decisions, including rescinding or revising regulations. The president tapped an assistant U.S. attorney in Florida, Brittany Panuccio, to fill one of the vacancies. If she confirmed by the Senate, the EEOC will regain its quorum.",
      "Acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, who voted against the regulations because of the abortion provision, has said she will work to change them.",
      "Similar lawsuits challenging the abortion provision are underway, including one filed by 17 states, led by Tennessee and Arkansas. In February, an appeals court ruled that lawsuit could proceed, overturning a lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the Justice Department had defended the EEOC against those lawsuits but it is unclear whether it will continue to do so under the Trump administration. The Justice Department did not reply to request for comment on Wednesday's ruling.",
      "Chettiar said the Trump administration is unlikely to appeal the ruling, adding to its significance.",
      "\"The impact of this is huge,\" Chettiar said in an interview with The Associated Press, calling the decision \"symbolic and a big signal of where the right is when it comes to the rights of women.\"",
      "However, the Trump administration has continued defend the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act itself in a lawsuit brought by the state of Texas that seeks to overturn the law in its entirety.",

      "Stocks are slumping amid signs of slowing consumer spending and investor concerns about the U.S. fiscal outlook.",
      "Target, one of the nation's largest retailers, on Wednesday reported weaker sales for the first quarter and warned of a potential downdraft over the rest of the year as Americans react to U.S. tariffs by pulling back on consumption.",
      "The company's sales fell 2.8% to $23.8 billion in the January-March period, down from $24.5 billion from the year-ago quarter, while Target said it expects a low-single digit decline in sales for 2025.",
      "Target \"faced several additional headwinds this quarter, including five consecutive months of declining consumer confidence [and] uncertainty regarding the impact of potential tariffs,\" CEO Brian Cornell said in a call with Wall Street analysts.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 96 points, or 1.5%, to close at 5,845. The Dow Jones Industrial Complex dropped 817 points, or 1.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.4%.",
      "Target shares fell $5.11 on the day, or 5.2% to $93.01.",
      "Such weakness comes as more companies say that rising economic uncertainty is clouding their financial prospects. Other large retailers, including Walmart, have said they plan to hike prices to offset tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on China and other countries.",
      "\"We continue to feel there's too much complacency about two key (and related) sources of macro risk: tariffs and fiscal policy,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a note to investors. \"Despite a de-escalation of trade tensions, tariffs are still quite elevated on an absolute basis, and the full effects of these import taxes haven't been felt yet in the economy.\"",
      "Shrinking corporate sales and profits could eventually shackle job growth, which has remained resilient in recent months, experts note.",
      "\"Businesses expect growth in consumer demand to slow and view the outlook as unusually uncertain, so they are pausing hiring,\" analysts with Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "Some retailers are benefiting from the current environment as some consumers tighten their belts. Discount giant TJX Companies, whose brands include HomeGoods, Marshall's and TJ Maxx, on Wednesday reported a 5% rise in net sales for its fiscal 2026 first quarter from a year ago.",
      "Tax bill overhang",
      "Investors are also assessing how a Republican-backed tax and spending bill\u00a0now being negotiated in the House could impact the nation's finances. Moody's on Friday highlighted the government's growing debt pile in its decision to\u00a0downgrade the U.S. credit rating. A weaker credit rating raises borrowing costs for the U.S.",
      "\"We do not think that the downgrade matters by itself,\" Bank of America strategists wrote in a report, \"but it has served as a wake up call for those investors who had been ignoring the ongoing fiscal discussion.\"",
      "Stocks were also feeling pressure from higher Treasury yields in the bond market, which can weigh on other types of investments. Bond prices have dipped because of concerns that a move in Congress to extend tax cuts could add trillions to the federal debt.",
      "\"The bulk of the bill simply extends existing [tax] rates rather than lowering them incrementally,\" Crisafulli said. \"In addition, there are some offsets that could financially harm lower-income Americans. Most important, the legislation is massively expensive and will add further to the debt/deficit at a time when both are already extremely unbalanced.\"",

      "A\u00a0video teasing the technology showcases how it works. In response to lengthy, detailed questions typed into Google search, AI Mode displays how many searches Google is performing and how many sites it's scanning as the technology quickly generates a summarized response at the top of the search platform. It also provides a side bar with links to relevant sites.",
      "Google said it's also testing a \"Search Live\" feature that will enable the search engine to respond to questions based on video content, as well as voice searches, or to questions verbalized by the user, rather than typed.",
      "As an example, Google's\u00a0teaser\u00a0shows a person recording a video of themselves holding a bridge made of Popsicle sticks while asking the search engine what can be done to strengthen the structure. \"To make it stronger, consider adding more triangles to the design,\" an automated voice responds.",

      "Some argue that AI Overviews, which provides an AI-generated summary of information online, at times eliminating the need to click directly on source links for further information, has undercut traffic to their sites. According to a\u00a0study by Ahrefs, AI Overviews led to a 35% lower average click-through rates for top-ranking pages on search engine results pages.",
      "Concerns over accuracy",
      "\"By making AI Mode a core part of the experience, Google is betting it can cater to the demand for AI without alienating its massive base,\" Gadjo Sevilla, a senior analyst for research firm eMarketer, wrote in a blog\u00a0post. \"But there are risks for hallucinations and factual errors which could drive users towards competitors,\" he added.",
      "Such factual errors were spotted with AI Overviews soon after its release, prompting Google to admit in a statement at the time that the technology produced \"some odd and erroneous overviews.\" In one instance, AI Overviews suggested that users add glue to pizza or eat at least one small rock a day,\u00a0according\u00a0to the MIT Technology Review.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 07:14:07 -0400",
    "summary": "With the Department of Education this month resuming collections on student loans, millions of Americans are at risk of having their wages garnished.",
    "story": [
      "Americans with student loans who are behind on their payments could face having their wages garnished and other serious financial consequences now that the Trump administration restarted collections\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "Repayments on student debt had been paused for five years since March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the U.S. economy and caused unemployment to soar. Nearly 43 million borrowers owe a total of more than $1.6 trillion in student debt, according to the Department of Education.",
      "Of that number, more than 5 million are in default on their loans, meaning they haven't made a monthly payment in more than 360 days, the agency says. An additional 4 million borrowers are in late-stage delinquency, having not made a payment in at least 91 days. The DOE expects that 10 million, or 25% of student borrowers, could be in default on their loans in a matter of months.",
      "In the first three months of the year, the delinquency rate for student loans jumped from less than 1% to nearly 8%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Older Americans are in worse shape when it comes to repaying student debt than younger borrowers. Although Americans over 50 years of age make up just 20% of those with outstanding college loans, they account for 33% of delinquencies, according to Oxford Economics which notes that younger borrowers are in relatively better shape.",
      "Student loans differ from other types of consumer debt in that there is no statute of limitations on collections, meaning the government can pursue punitive actions for defaulted loans indefinitely, noted Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "\"It's so much worse than just about any other financial product,\" Yu told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's a really small universe of things that have these harsh penalties.\"",
      "And because collections were paused for five years due to the pandemic, some student loan borrowers may have forgotten about the severe financial consequences of defaulting. \"It's left the collective consciousness,\" she said.",
      "Here's what to know about the potential repercussions of defaulting on student debt, including when your wages can be garnished.",
      "When can a lender garnish your wages?",
      "The Trump administration announced\u00a0on April 21 that the office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) would resume collections on defaulted federal student loans starting May 5. The DOE said at the time that it would email notices to borrowers in default over the following two weeks to make \"them aware of these developments.\"",
      "Notices from the FSA informing borrowers that their wages could be garnished will come \"later this summer,\" the DOE said.",
      "Under the law, a lender can garnish borrowers' pay without going to court provided it has given them at least 60 days notice, generally by email, before initiating the collection action.",
      "\"All they have to do is send borrowers a notice that they are going to take your money, and you have 60 days to respond,\" Yu said.",
      "Given that collections on student loans resumed earlier this month, people could begin to see their wages garnished in the fall, according to experts.",
      "The government notice informs people how to start making payments, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan or sign up for loan rehabilitation to avoid having a portion of their paychecks seized. It doesn't, however, instruct borrowers how they can stop wage garnishment.",
      "\"The notices the Trump administration is sending out do not lay out defenses and don't lay out the right to appeal wage garnishment on basis of financial hardship, and that's really important for borrowers to understand,\" Yu said.",
      "How much can be withheld from your paycheck?",
      "A lender may garnish up to 15% of your disposable pay, but must leave borrowers with the equivalent of 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25, or $217.50 per week. That applies even if a borrower resides in a state where the minimum wage is higher than the federal level.",
      "Can other assets be garnished?",
      "Yes. In addition to wages, the federal government may also seize tax refunds and Social Security retirement and disability benefits when loans are in default.",
      "If you've already filed your taxes and received a refund, it's protected, Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But you'd be on notice if you asked for an extension,\" she explained.",
      "The government or a lender would likely have to take a borrower to court in order to target other assets.",
      "\"That would entail getting a judgment and doing some kind of court intervention, and those are relatively rare,\" Nierman said.",
      "How can you get out of default?",
      "Beyond possibly leading to wage garnishment, defaulting on a student loan hurts in other ways. It damages your credit, which raises borrowing costs or limits access to credit like mortgages and car loans.",
      "In some cases, student loan borrowers have the right to contest their default status. First, the debt might not be their own. Second, they might not owe the amount of debt the government claims they do. Third, they can claim that wage garnishment would cause them financial hardship.",

      "A dramatic demand for electricity, coupled with a rise in costs, could create massive energy challenges for the United States over the next two decades,\u00a0a new report released Tuesday by ICF found.",
      "The global consulting and technology services company predicted that electricity demand could jump at least 25% in the next five years and as much as 78% by 2050 \u2014 findings that far outpace historical trends over the past two decades. Such growth could have a significant impact on both the reliability and affordability of electricity, the report said. Retail costs are also expected to rise; by 2050, costs passed onto the consumer could double, ICF found.",
      "\"This is a pivotal moment as rising demand creates urgent challenges for the grid,\" said Anne Choate, ICF executive vice president for energy, environment and infrastructure in a statement.",
      "The U.S. could struggle with increased electricity demand due to rising temperatures and the growing use of emerging technologies, bearing down on an overloaded system. The report found that in Texas, nearly one-third of the expected increase is attributable to large load sources, such as cryptocurrency mining operations. Data centers, building electrification and semiconductor manufacturing, along with electric vehicles, account for 35% of the projected load through 2040 in 13 mid-Atlantic and Midwest states as well as Washington, D.C.",
      "Electric grid operators across the U.S. have been sounding the alarm in advance of elevated summer temperatures after record-breaking heat last year. The World Meteorological Organization said in its annual\u00a0State of the Global Climate report\u00a0that 2024 set a new global\u00a0temperature record, averaging over 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The National Weather Service released a report last week predicting hotter-than-normal temperatures across the United States from June through August.",
      "PJM, one of the country's largest electric grid operators, serving 67 million people in states including North Carolina, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Michigan, warned customers in\u00a0a news release\u00a0that the system will be experience a high peak demand this summer.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 20:19:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Late last year, South Carolina Medicaid approved GLP-1s to treat obesity, placing it among the few state programs covering the drugs. But access remains limited.",
    "story": [
      "CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 When Page Campbell's doctor recommended that she try an injectable prescription drug called Wegovy to lose weight before scheduling bariatric surgery, she readily agreed.",
      "\"I've struggled with my weight for so long,\" said Campbell, 40, a single mother of two. \"I'm not opposed to trying anything.\"",
      "In early April, about four weeks after she'd started taking Wegovy, Campbell said she hadn't experienced any side effects, such as nausea or bowel irritation. But she doesn't use a scale at home, so she said she didn't know whether she'd lost any weight since her most recent medical appointment earlier this year, when she weighed 314 pounds. Still, she was confident about achieving weight loss.",
      "\"It's going to work because I'm putting in the work. I'm changing my eating habits. I'm exercising,\" said Campbell, a shipping manager at a Michaels store. \"I'm not going to second-guess myself.\"",
      "Wegovy belongs to a pricey class of drugs called GLP-1s (short for glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists) that have upended the treatment of obesity in recent years, offering hope to patients who have tried and failed to lose weight in myriad other ways.",
      "Campbell gained access to Wegovy through South Carolina Medicaid's decision in late 2024 to cover these weight loss drugs. But the medications remain out of reach for millions of patients across the country who could benefit from them, because many public and private health insurers have deemed the drugs too expensive.",
      "A report published in November by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, found only 13 states were covering GLP-1s for the treatment of obesity for Medicaid beneficiaries as of August 2024. South Carolina became the 14th in November.",
      "Liz Williams, one of the report's authors and a senior policy manager for the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, said she was not aware of any other state Medicaid programs joining the list since then. Looking ahead, the remaining states may be reluctant to add a new, expensive drug benefit while they brace for potential federal cuts coming from Congress, she said.",
      "\"As the budget debate, federally, is developing, that may impact how states are thinking about this,\" Williams said.",
      "The federal government won't be helping anytime soon, either. Medicare covers GLP-1s to treat diabetes and some other health conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, but not obesity. In early April, the Trump administration announced it will not finalize a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would have allowed an estimated 7.4 million people covered by Medicare and Medicaid to access GLP-1s for weight loss. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration is poised to force less expensive, compounded versions of these drugs off the market.",
      "And the barrier to entry remains high, even for Medicaid patients in those few states that have agreed to cover the drugs without a federal mandate.",
      "Case in point: In South Carolina, where more than one-third of all adults, and nearly half of the African American population, qualify as obese, the state Medicaid agency estimates only 1,300 beneficiaries will meet the stringent prerequisites for GLP-1 coverage.",
      "Under one of those requirements, Medicaid beneficiaries who wish to access these drugs to lose weight must attest to \"increased exercise activity,\" said Jeff Leieritz, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Campbell, who is insured by Medicaid, was granted coverage for Wegovy based on her body mass index. First, though, she was required to submit six months' worth of documentation proving that she'd tried and failed to lose weight after receiving nutrition counseling and going on a 1,200-calorie-a day diet, said Kenneth Mitchell, one of Campbell's doctors and the medical director for bariatric surgery and obesity medicine at Roper St. Francis Healthcare.",
      "Campbell's Wegovy prescription was approved for six months, Mitchell said. When that authorization expires, Campbell and her health care team will need to submit more documentation, including proof that she has lost at least 5% of her body weight and has kept up with nutrition counseling.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Send a prescription in and they cover it.' It's rather arduous,\" Mitchell said. \"Not a lot of folks are going to do this.\"",
      "Mitchell said South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover these drugs was met with excitement among those working in his medical specialty. But he wasn't surprised that the state anticipates relatively few people will access this benefit annually, since the approval process is so rigorous and the cost high. \"The problem is the medicines are so expensive,\" Mitchell said.",
      "Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Wegovy, announced in March that it was cutting the monthly price for the drug from $650 to $499 for cash-paying customers. The price that health insurance plans and beneficiaries pay for these drugs varies, but some GLP-1s cost more than $1,000 per patient per month, Mitchell said, and many people will need to take them for the rest of their lives to maintain weight loss.",
      "\"That is a tremendous price tag that someone has to foot the bill for,\" Mitchell said.",
      "That's the reason the North Carolina State Health Plan Board of Trustees voted last year to end coverage of GLP-1s for state employees, after then-North Carolina Treasurer Dale Folwell's office estimated in 2023 that the drugs were projected to cost the State Health Plan $1 billion over the next six years. The decision came only a few months after a separate North Carolina agency announced it would start covering these drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. North Carolina Medicaid has estimated it will spend $16 million a year on GLP-1s.",
      "South Carolina Medicaid, which insures fewer than half the number of people enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid, anticipates spending less. Leieritz estimated GLP-1s and nutrition counseling offered to Medicaid beneficiaries in South Carolina will cost $10 million a year. State funding will cover $3.3 million of the expense; the remainder will be paid for by matching Medicaid funds from the federal government.",
      "In a recent interview, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn't rule out the possibility that Medicare and Medicaid might cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment in the future as costs come down.",
      "They're \"extraordinary drugs\" and \"we're going to reduce the cost,\" Kennedy told CBS News in early April. He said he would like GLP-1s to eventually be made available to Medicare and Medicaid patients who are seeking obesity treatment after they have tried other ways to lose weight. \"That is the framework that we're now debating.\"",
      "Meanwhile, public health experts have applauded South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover GLP-1s. Yet the new benefit won't help the vast majority of the 1.5 million adults in South Carolina who are classified as obese, according to data published by the South Carolina Department of Public Health.",
      "\"We still have some work to do,\" acknowledged Brannon Traxler, the public health department's chief medical officer.",
      "But the state's new \"Action Plan for Healthy Eating and Active Living,\" written by a coalition of groups in South Carolina, including the Department of Public Health, makes no mention of GLP-1s or the role they might play in lowering obesity rates in the state.",
      "The action plan, underwritten by a $1.5 million federal grant, isn't meant to lay out an overarching approach for lowering obesity in South Carolina, Traxler said. Instead, it promotes physical activity in schools, nutrition, and the expansion of outdoor walking trails, among other strategies. A more comprehensive obesity plan might address the benefits of surgical intervention and GLP-1s, but those also carry risk, expense, and side effects, Traxler said.",
      "\"Certainly, I think, there is a need to bring it all together,\" she said.",
      "Campbell, for one, is taking the comprehensive approach. On top of injecting Wegovy once weekly, she said, she is prioritizing protein intake and moving her body. She also underwent weight loss surgery in late April.",
      "\"Weight loss is my biggest goal,\" said Campbell, who expressed appreciation for Medicaid's coverage of Wegovy. \"It's one more thing that's going to help me get to my goal.\"",

      "What is the $TRUMP meme coin \u2014 and why is it controversial?",
      "The meme coin was launched in January, days before Mr. Trump's inauguration. An affiliate of the Trump organization and a firm called Fight Fight Fight LLC control 80% of the coin's total supply.",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is driven mostly by online buzz, especially on social media. They typically do not have intrinsic value and are not used for transactions. Like many meme coins, $TRUMP is known for erratic price shifts: Its price peaked at around $75 shortly after its launch, but plummeted to under $8 by early April.",
      "But late last month, the price surged after the dinner with Mr. Trump was announced. Buyers spent more than $140 million to buy the $TRUMP coins in hopes of securing an invitation to the event, according to data analytics firm Inca Digital.",
      "Mr. Trump previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" The president and his two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are backing the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and crypto makes up some $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth according to a recent report.",
      "Eric Trump in January called the $TRUMP coin \"the hottest digital meme on earth.\"",
      "The $TRUMP private dinner marketing promotion \u2014 and the president's links to World Liberty \u2014 have raised concerns among government watchdogs and Democratic lawmakers about potential conflicts of interest.",
      "The Senate on Monday advanced a bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, that would regulate so-called stablecoins \u2014 a type of cryptocurrency linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. The bill faced some pushback from Democrats who pushed for anti-corruption rules, often citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings.",
      "\"How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun \u2014 a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture \u2014 announces he's getting a private dinner as the President's top crypto buyer,\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement.",
      "The White House has dismissed criticism that Mr. Trump's support for the crypto sector represents a conflict of interest, noting his assets are held in a trust managed by his children.",
      "\"The President is working to secure GOOD deals for the American people, not for himself. President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public \u2013 which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Who is Justin Sun?",
      "Sun has a net worth of $8.5 billion, according to Forbes. He's best known for the Tron blockchain \u2014 and for paying $6.2 million at auction for a banana that artist Maurizio Cattelan duct-taped to a wall, which Sun promptly ate as part of a \"unique artistic experience.\"",

    "summary": "High temperatures and rising electricity costs could boost home energy bills by 6% this summer, a new report says.",
    "story": [
      "High temperatures projected across the U.S. summer could take a toll on Americans' budgets by driving up the price of keeping homes cool.",
      "Home electricity bills are expected to rise to an average of $784 for the summer period, up more than 6% from $737 in 2024 and marking a 12-year record, according a new analysis from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).",
      "The growing expense comes on the heels of a cold winter that drove up heating costs for many Americans, and as consumers continue to grapple with higher prices on everyday goods. Consumers are also increasingly expressing concerns about how tariffs\u00a0could affect their day-to-day costs, Gallup polling has found.",
      "\"We found that it's going to be another expensive summer for air conditioning because temperatures will stay high, and electricity prices have been rising faster than inflation,\" energy economist Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The anticipated spike in residential electricity costs from June through September is due to the combination of rising cost of electricity, which is outpacing inflation, with higher temperatures, NEADA said. Those trends mean that households are not only expected to pay higher prices for electricity, but will likely consume more of it than they did last summer because of the need for more cooling.",
      "\"It's not just temperatures that are going up, but the cost of cooling is going up,\" Wolfe said. \"And when electricity prices go up, they tend to stay high. So even if temperatures moderate, your bill might go up because of the cost of electricity.\"",
      "Unpaid bills",
      "Energy costs eat up a larger share of low-income families' budgets compared to higher-earners. Low-income households spend roughly 8.6% of their incomes on energy costs, compared to 3% for those that are higher up the income ladder, according to NEADA.",
      "Worryingly, the lowest earners could struggle to afford to keep their homes cool, Wolfe noted. The most recent Census Household Pulse Survey found that 37% of low- and moderate-income households could not afford their energy bills for at least one month between April 2023 and April 2024.",
      "If those households find themselves in a financial crunch this summer, they may opt to turn off their air conditioning, which could pose serious health risks, noted Wolfe.",
      "\"Last winter was cold, so they're just getting over paying their heating bills, and are now facing higher summer cooling costs,\" Wolfe explained. \"And while people understand that if you don't use heat in the winter, your pipes will freeze, that won't happen in the summer.\"",
      "Reluctance to turn on one's air conditioning can have adverse health effects like heat stroke. \"While this won't do damage to your building, it will do damage to you,\" Wolfe said.",
      "Extreme heat and health",
      "Public assistance programs haven't kept pace with the evolving climate, according to Wolfe. \"We're having heat waves that are lasting longer, and the systems in place to protect families have not kept up,\" he said.",
      "This summer's cooling cost forecast should be taken as a sign that state and federal assistance programs require modernization, according to Wolfe. Only 26 states offer summer cooling assistance to help Americans pay their bills. Thirty-three states have no protections in place to prevent utilities company from shutting off customers' access to electricity when they're behind on payments.",
      "Extreme heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States, according to the National Weather Service.",

      "The U.S. credit rating was downgraded by Moody's Ratings on Friday, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "The downgrade from the top rating of Aaa to Aa1 \"reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,\" the credit rating firm said in a statement on Friday.",
      "\"Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" Moody's added.",
      "Moody's also highlighted the environment of heightened policy uncertainty driven by Mr. Trump's evolving trade priorities.",
      "Moody's is the last of the three major credit rating agencies to downgrade U.S. government debt. In August 2011, Standard and Poor's downgraded the U.S. from AAA to AA+, and in August 2023\u00a0Fitch Ratings cut the credit rating a notch from AAA to AA+.",
      "Moody's said it expects federal deficits to grow from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% of GDP by 2035, driven by \"increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending and relatively low revenue generation.''",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 06:48:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Republican tax bill could cost $3.8 trillion over 10 years as its tax cuts surpass spending reductions, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican-backed tax and spending bill that's now moving forward in the House is getting a reality check from Wall Street. That's because the proposed tax breaks are projected to far outstrip any savings in the bill, potentially leading to mounting U.S. debt and a worsening fiscal outlook, according to economists and policy experts.",
      "If the bill moves forward without significant changes, the U.S. would likely find its debt levels spiraling higher in order to finance the tax cuts, according to several analyses. Over the next decade, the GOP bill could cost the U.S. $3.8 trillion, according to a report\u00a0earlier this month by the Joint Committee on Taxation that examined the impact of the the tax measures versus spending cuts.",
      "Those risks are rattling Wall Street. Moody's Ratings on Friday\u00a0downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the new bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, over the next decade.",
      "The bill also faces detractors within the Republican party, with the House Freedom Caucus saying in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Sunday that the bill \"fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget.\"",
      "The concern, according to both Wall Street economists and policy experts, is that adding billions in debt to the U.S. ledger could eventually squeeze federal spending because the nation would likely face higher interest payments. That, in turn, could make it more difficult to fund programs like Social Security, which is already facing a financial drawdown as baby boomers hit retirement age, or to invest in initiatives like infrastructure that can spur economic growth.",
      "\"It's time for policymakers to hit pause, go back to the drawing board and put forward a plan that actually takes steps toward putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal trajectory,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy think tank, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Our federal interest payments are skyrocketing, already surpassing what we spend annually on defense or Medicare.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it disagreed both with the Moody's analysis and forecasts that the legislation could widen the nation's deficit, which is the gap between federal spending and revenue.",
      "\"This bill does not add to the deficit,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Monday in a press conference. \"In fact, according to the Council of Economic Advisers, there's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill \u2014 that's the largest saving for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history.\"",
      "Savings versus spending",
      "At the heart of the proposed GOP bill is President Trump's vow to renew his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which introduced lower tax brackets for many Americans. Because those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, about 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026 without an extension of the law,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "The Council of Economic Advisers, a White House agency that advises the president on economic issues,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May study that the new bill would \"avert a $4 trillion tax hike\" by extending the TCJA's provisions.",
      "Renewing the law's cuts alone would cost $2.2 trillion over the next decade, estimates Joint Committee on Taxation, which assesses the impact of policy for Congress. The GOP bill also includes other new tax breaks that would add to the bill's long-term costs, the group's analysis found.",
      "For instance, the bill's proposal to provide taxpayers with a more generous standard deduction would result in $1.3 trillion in lost revenue over the next decade, the Joint Committee found. Eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, as well as giving a bigger deduction to senior citizens, would cost an additional $234 billion over the same period, its analysis finds.",
      "The bill does include spending cuts, but they aren't large enough to offset the tax breaks, several recent analyses conclude. The nonpartisan Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0estimated\u00a0in a May 14 analysis that the tax cuts would cost $7.7 trillion over the next decade, while the spending cuts would offset $3.9 trillion over the same period. The result is a gap of $3.8 trillion, it said.",
      "That's the arithmetic that prompted Moody's to cut its rating on U.S. debt, from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1. In its assessment, the credit rating agency noted that the U.S. deficit has spiraled higher as previous administrations and Congress have \"failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend.\"",
      "\"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat,\" Moody's said on Friday when it became the third major rating agency to cut the nation's credit rating. \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "It added, \"The U.S.' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly rated sovereigns.\"",
      "The Trump administration says that the proposed tax bill will spur economic growth by lowering taxes on consumers and businesses. In an interview on Monday with Fox Business, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said the economy is \"going to continue to take off once those policies are actually in place, once we actually have the tax cuts passed.\"",
      "Who wins and loses",
      "The GOP tax bill remains in flux and is likely to change as it winds through the House.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged there are still details to \"iron out\" as conservative Republicans seek to quickly enact work requirements for able-bodied participants in Medicaid. Those rules would take effect in 2029 under the bill passed last week by the Ways and Means Committee. Some House Republicans also want to more quickly end tax breaks for green energy projects being used nationwide.",
      "If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republicans are also eyeing changes.",
      "Democrats have decried the cuts Republicans are proposing to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the costs of the tax breaks, pointing out that the reductions in social safety net programs comes as many wealthy taxpayers would get a big tax break.",
      "\"This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,\" Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, told CNN's \"State of the Union\u2033 on Sunday. \"There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that's what is happening here.\"",
      "The lowest-income Americans would end up paying more under the proposed GOP bill, according to a May 19\u00a0analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania group that studies the fiscal impact of public policies. Even including savings from tax cuts, the bottom 20%, who earn up to $17,000 per year, would take a $1,035 hit in 2026 after the reductions in Medicaid and other programs are factored in.",
      "\"[H]ouseholds most affected by the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP \u2014 those in the bottom income quintile \u2014 experience the largest losses under this bill, averaging $28,000 in lifetime value for the working-age population,\" the Penn Wharton Budget model calculated. \"In contrast, working-age households in the top income quintile generally benefit from lower taxes, gaining an average of $30,000.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate advanced a crypto regulation bill on Monday night after Democratic opposition\u00a0tanked an initial attempt to advance the measure earlier this month amid concern over ties between the digital asset industry and the Trump family.",
      "The first-of-its-kind legislation, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins \u2014 a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. After the measure advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support in March, Senate GOP leadership first brought the measure to the floor earlier this month. But the measure had lost Democratic support in the intervening weeks amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "The measure moved forward in a 66-32 vote after gaining the support of some Democratic holdouts.",
      "Monday's vote was to limit debate on the bill, allowing the Senate to move forward to final passage.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune criticized Democrats for blocking the measure from advancing earlier this month, saying Monday, \"this bill reflects the bipartisan consensus on this issue, and it's had an open and bipartisan process since the very beginning.\"",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, argued that Senate Democrats \"inexplicably chose to block this legislation\" earlier this month.",
      "Since the failed vote earlier this month, negotiators returned to the table. And ahead of the procedural vote Monday, the measure saw backing from at least one Democrat as Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia advocated for the measure, calling it a \"meaningful step forward,\" though he added that it's \"not perfect.\"",
      "\"The stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can't afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\" Warner said in a statement. \"We need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\"",
      "Still, Warner pointed to concerns he said are shared among many senators about the Trump family's \"use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,\" after it was announced earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.",
      "Warner said senators \"have a duty to shine a light on these abuses,\" but he argued \"we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has been among the leading voices advocating for adding anti-corruption reforms to the legislation. Warren has outlined a handful of issues with the bill, saying that it puts consumers at risk and enables corruption. In a speech Monday on the Senate floor, Warren said her concerns have not been addressed and urged her colleagues to vote against the updated version.",
      "\"While a strong stablecoin bill is the best possible outcome, this weak bill is worse than no bill at all,\" Warren said. \"A bill that meaningfully strengthens oversight of the stablecoin market is worth enacting. A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the president's corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.\"",
      "The measure fell short of the 60 votes necessary to move forward earlier this month, with all Senate Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 opposing. Paul has reservations about overregulation, while Hawley voted against the bill in part because it doesn't prohibit big tech companies from creating their own stablecoins.",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who sponsored the legislation, defended the measure on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Monday. He outlined that a lack of regulatory framework, which the bill would provide, makes for uncertainty \u2014 and results in innovative technology moving offshore. The Tennessee Republicans urged that \"this will fix it,\" while arguing that the bill has strong bipartisan support.",

Fractures in the GOP conference appeared to persist, despite the legislation's movement out of committee, throwing its passage into question. President Trump is expected to make a personal visit to House Republicans Tuesday to urge them to back the bill, a source familiar with the planning confirmed.",
      "\"There's a lot more work to do,\" House Speaker Mike Johson told reporters late Sunday. \"But I'm looking forward to very thoughtful discussions, very productive discussions, over the next few days \u2014 and I'm absolutely convinced we're going to get this in final form and pass it.\"",
      "After the final three committees advanced their portions of the massive legislative package last week, a handful of conservative hardliners on the House Budget Committee blocked the package from moving forward Friday. The setback prompted work through the weekend to negotiate with the holdouts, who ultimately allowed the legislation to advance late Sunday.",
      "House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington called it a \"critical step,\" while acknowledging that deliberations are continuing, with disagreements remaining on a cap on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and on when Medicaid work requirements would take effect. But Arrington said the vote to advance the legislation Sunday \"is a sign that people are confident that these things will be resolved.\"",
      "Reps. Chip Roy of Texas and Ralph Norman of South Carolina, two of the conservative holdouts, celebrated a change they said would be made to remove delays from the Medicaid work requirements, since conservatives opposed the original plan, which would have delayed until 2029 work requirements for childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities. But Roy noted in a post on social media that \"the bill does not yet meet the moment,\" pointing to remaining sticking points on cutting clean energy subsidies implemented under the Biden administration and cuts to the federal share of payments for Medicaid.",
      "Johnson suggested that he and the conservatives had agreed to \"minor modifications\" over the weekend. The speaker is walking a tightrope between the hardliners demanding more cuts and moderates who are reluctant to slash Medicaid, while a number of Republicans who represent blue states have also threatened to withhold their votes unless their demands are met on SALT, among other divisions.",
      "On Monday, Johnson told reporters that there have been \"lots of discussions\" with the various members of different GOP caucuses, adding that nothing has been \"ultimately and finally decided\" as Republican leaders look to build consensus around the ideas.",
      "\"I told all the members on a conference call this morning that this is a consensus-building operation, it's been a bottom-up process,\" Johnson said. \"And we're almost there.\"",
      "The legislation is set to go before the House Rules Committee on Wednesday at 1 a.m., where any changes to the legislation would be made. But Roy and Norman also sit on the Rules Committee and could raise a final hurdle there ahead of the full House vote. Should the package advance out of the Rules Committee, it would tee up a vote on the package on Thursday, before lawmakers are set to leave town for the Memorial Day recess.",
      "As Republican leadership irons out the remaining issues, President Trump is expected to continue to pressure Republicans to get the bill passed this week, as he did on Friday on social media. And on Tuesday morning.",
      "Meanwhile, the legislation is expected to face some resistance in the Senate, where a number of Republicans have warned that should the House pass the bill, the upper chamber will try to make changes.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, told reporters late last week that the House bill \"would not pass in the Senate, and I think there's plenty of us that would vote against it.\" And Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters that \"we've assumed all along that the Senate would have its input on this.\"",
      "Johnson said on Fox News Sunday that \"the package that we send over there will be one that was very carefully negotiated and delicately balanced, and we hope that they don't make many modifications to it because that will ensure its passage quickly.\"",
      "Beyond the self-imposed deadlines, the inclusion of a debt limit increase in the package has added urgency to getting the legislation to the president's desk. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged Congress earlier this month to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. And top administration and congressional leaders have circled July 4 as the deadline to get the package to the president desk.",
      "\"We've got to get this done and get it to the president's desk by that big celebration on Independence Day,\" Johnson said. \"I'm convinced that we can.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 15:57:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Extreme weather linked to climate change will likely lead to more Americans losing their homes as foreclosure rates rise, researchers predict.",
    "story": [
      "Extreme weather linked to climate change could spell financial ruin for many American homeowners and lead to billions in losses for lenders, a new study finds.",
      "First Street, a research firm that studies the impact of climate change, projects in an analysis\u00a0released Monday that foreclosures across the U.S. caused by flooding, wind and other weather-related incidents could soar 380% over the next 10 years. By 2035, climate-driven events could account for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035, up from roughly 7% this year.",
      "Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable to the effect of severe weather on their homes, First Street noted. Much of Americans' wealth is tied up in the value of their properties.",
      "A cascade of foreclosures, driven by the mounting costs of repairs and rising insurance premiums stemming from extreme weather, \u00a0wouldn't only hurt homeowners. First Street estimates lenders will lose $1.2 billion a year in 2025 \u2014 and up to $5.4 billion in 10 years \u2014 as they are forced to absorb the cost of mortgage defaults.",
      "Such losses represent the \"hidden risks\" of climate change that lenders often fail to account for in their underwriting practices, Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at First Street, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders consider factors including a borrower's income, debt and credit score in issuing mortgages, but not the potential impact of extreme weather on a property or how it could raise premiums.",
      "First Street also looked at how indirect factors, like rising insurance premiums, are already shaping foreclosure trends. For every 1% increase in insurance costs, the firm projects a roughly 1% increase in the foreclosure rate nationwide.",
      "The findings comes as insurers are jacking up the cost of homeowners policies and in some cases exiting markets around the U.S. altogether, leading to spottier coverage in disaster-prone areas like California. That could leave more individual homeowners on the hook for damage from extreme weather.",
      "First Street said integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help lenders \u2013 and homeowners \u2013 be better prepared for weather-related disasters. But it could also tighten lending conditions, Porter said, putting potential homebuyers at a disadvantage.",
      "\"It's going to increase the price of homes. It's going to increase interest rates,\" he said.",
      "Where climate foreclosures could rise",
      "According to First Street, the communities around the U.S. at greatest risk for climate-related foreclosures in the years to come are densely populated areas with high property values and large numbers of underinsured homeowners. That includes coastal areas vulnerable to storm surge and hurricane winds.",
      "For example, Florida's Duval County in the northeastern corner of the state, home to the city of Jacksonville, could see up to $60 million in credit losses resulting from 900 foreclosures in a \"severe weather\" year, according to CBS MoneyWatch's analysis of First Street's data\u00a0 Florida is home to 8 of the top 10 counties with the highest projected credit losses due to extreme weather, the data shows.",
      "Louisiana, California and swaths of the northeast are also projected to see high climate-related mortgage losses this year. But the impact won't just be felt in coastal areas: First Street also expects extreme rainfall and riverine flooding to drive up foreclosures in inland states.",
      "\"We do expect foreclosures to rise in those areas because the predominant driver is a lack of insurance,\" Porter said.",
      "According to First Street, flooding events in particular is likely to drive up foreclosure rates, as gaps in insurance coverage put more people at risk of defaulting on their mortgages.",
      "Unlike homeowners insurance, flood insurance is only required for people who have federally-backed mortgages in FEMA's Special Flood Hazard Areas. As of August 2023, that amounted to roughly 3.1 million policies, according to National Flood Insurance Program data. But far more people could be at risk.",
      "FEMA's 100-year flood zone maps include just under 8 million properties. But First Street estimates that nearly 18 million homes are at risk of flooding. That's because while the agency takes flooding from major river channels and coastal storm surge into account for its maps, it does not consider extreme precipitation, Porter said.",
      "\"We already know that about half the people with significant flood risk aren't mapped into [FEMA's] Special Flood Hazard Area,\" he said. \"So it leads to a state where we have a lot of underinsurance across the country, in particular from flooding.\"",
      "Meanwhile, whether or not you live in an official FEMA flood zone can make a difference when it comes to the likelihood of foreclosure, First Street found. That's because people outside flood zones often lack insurance.",
      "\"If you don't protect yourselves, then when the event does occur it's completely on you. You end up having to pay out of pocket and you may go into foreclosure,\" Porter said.",
      "In an analysis of 29 historical flood events from 2002-2019, First Street found that damaged properties outside of those FEMA-designated zones experienced foreclosure increases at an average of 52% higher than properties inside the zones.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on if and how it plans to update its flood maps. According to one estimate by the Association of State Floodplain Managers, it could take up to $11.8 billion to complete updated flood mapping in the U.S.",

    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 06:53:37 -0400",
    "summary": "About half of states have broadened Medicaid, the state-federal low-income health care program, to pay for social services such as housing and nutritional support.",
    "story": [
      "During his first administration, President Trump's top health officials gave North Carolina permission to use Medicaid money for social services not traditionally covered by health insurance. It was a first-in-the-nation experiment to funnel health care money into housing, nutrition, and other social services.",
      "Some poor and disabled Medicaid patients became eligible for benefits, including security deposits and first month's rent for housing, rides to medical appointments, wheelchair ramps, and even prescriptions for fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Such experimental initiatives to improve the health of vulnerable Americans while saving taxpayers on costly medical procedures and expensive emergency room care are booming nationally. Without homes or healthy food, people risk getting sicker, becoming homeless, and experiencing even more trouble controlling chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.",
      "Former President Joe Biden encouraged states to go big on new benefits, and the availability of social services exploded in states red and blue. Since North Carolina's launch, at least 24 other states have followed by expanding social service benefits covered by Medicaid, the health care program for low-income and disabled Americans \u2014 a national shift that's turning a system focused on sick care into one that prioritizes prevention. And though Mr. Trump was pivotal to the expansion, he's now reversing course regardless of whether evidence shows it works.",
      "In Mr. Trump's second term, his administration is throwing participating states from California to Arkansas into disarray, arguing that social services should not be paid for by government health insurance. Officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which grants states permission to experiment, have rescinded its previous broad directive, arguing that the Biden administration went too far.",
      "\"This administration believes that the health-related social needs guidance distracted the Medicaid program from its core mission: providing excellent health outcomes for vulnerable Americans,\" CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said in a statement.",
      "\"This decision prevents the draining of resources from Medicaid for potentially duplicative services that are already provided by other well-established federal programs, including those that have historically focused on food insecurity and affordable housing,\" Howden added, referring to food stamps and low-income housing vouchers provided through other government agencies.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, has also proposed axing funding for low-income housing and food programs administered by agencies including the departments of Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture \u2014 on top of Republican proposals for broader Medicaid cuts.",
      "The pullback has led to chaos and confusion in states that have expanded their Medicaid programs, with both liberal and conservative leaders worried that the shift will upend multibillion-dollar investments already underway. Social problems such as homelessness and food insecurity can cause \u2014 or worsen \u2014 physical and behavioral health conditions, leading to sky-high health care spending. Medical care delivered in hospitals and clinics, for instance, accounts for only roughly 15% of a person's overall health, while a staggering 85% is influenced by social factors such as access to healthy food and shelter for sleep, said Anthony Iton, a policy expert on social determinants of health.",
      "Health care experts warn the disinvestment will come at a price.",
      "\"It will just lead to more death, more suffering, and higher health care costs,\" said Margot Kushel, a primary care doctor in San Francisco and a leading researcher on homelessness and health care.",
      "The Trump administration announced in a March 4 memo that it was rescinding Biden-era guidance dramatically expanding experimental benefits known as health-related social needs. Federal waivers are required for states to use Medicaid funds for most nontraditional social services outside of hospitals and clinics.",
      "Last month, the administration told states that these services, which can also include high-speed internet and storage units, should not be part of Medicaid.",
      "Future waiver requests allowing Medicaid to provide social services \u2014 a liberal philosophy \u2014 will be considered on a \"case-by-case basis,\" the administration said. Rather, it has signaled a conservative shift toward requiring most Medicaid beneficiaries to prove that they're working or trying to find jobs, which puts an estimated 36 million Americans at risk of losing their health coverage.",
      "\"What they're arguing is Medicaid has been expanded far beyond basic health care and it needs to be cut back to provide only basic coverage to those most desperately in need,\" said Mark Peterson, a health policy expert at UCLA. \"They're making the case, which is not widely shared by specialists in the health care field, that it's not the job of taxpayers and Medicaid to pay for all this stuff outside the traditional heath care system.\"",
      "Although states have not received formal guidance to end their social experiments, Peterson and other health policy researchers expect the administration not to renew waivers, which typically run in five-year intervals. Worse, legal experts say programs underway could be halted early.",
      "Evidence supporting social investments by Medicaid is still nascent. An expansion in Massachusetts that provided food benefits reduced ER visits and hospitalizations, for instance. But often, it's a mixed bag.",
      "California is going the biggest, investing $12 billion over five years to provide a slew of new services, from intensive case management to help people with severe behavioral health conditions to housing and food assistance through a pair of federal waivers. The most popular benefits provided by health insurers are those that help homeless people on Medicaid by placing them in apartments or securing beds in recovery homes, covering up to $5,000 for security deposits, and preventing eviction.",
      "Since the CalAIM program launched in 2022, it has served only a small fraction of the state's nearly 15 million Medicaid beneficiaries, with roughly 577,000 referrals for benefits. Yet it has improved and even saved the lives of some of those lucky enough to get help, including Eric Jones, a 65-year-old Los Angeles resident.",
      "\"When I got diabetes, I didn't know what to do and I had a hard time getting to my medical appointments,\" said Jones, who lost his housing this year when his mom died but received services through his Medi-Cal insurer, L.A. Care. \"My case manager got me rides to my appointments and also helped me get into an apartment.\"",
      "California is considering making some of its social services permanent after the CalAIM waivers expire at the end of 2026. Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration is adding more housing services, including up to six months of free rent under a third waiver approved by the Biden administration. Medi-Cal officials contended early evidence shows CalAIM has led to better care coordination and fewer hospital and ER visits.",
      "\"We are fully committed,\" said Susan Philip, a deputy director for the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers the program. \"We have invested so much.\"",
      "Health insurers, which deliver Medicaid coverage and receive greater funding to cover these additional benefits, say they're worried the Trump administration will end or curtail the programs. \"If we do things the same old way, we're just going to generate the same old results \u2014 people getting sicker and health care costs continuing to rise,\" said Charles Bacchi, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, which represents insurers.",
      "Industry leaders say the expansion is already changing lives.",
      "\"We believe wholeheartedly that housing is health, food is health, so seeing these programs disappear would be devastating,\" said Kelly Bruno-Nelson, executive director of Medi-Cal for CalOptima Health, a health insurance provider in Orange County.",
      "Oregon is also providing low-income Medicaid patients with a range of new services, including home-delivered healthy meals and rental payment assistance. Residents can even qualify for air conditioners, heaters, air filters, power generators, and mini fridges. State Medicaid officials say they remain committed to providing the benefits but worry about federal cuts.",
      "\"Climate change and housing instability are huge indicators of poor health,\" said Josh Balloch, vice president of health policy and communications at AllCare Health, a Medicaid insurer in Oregon. \"We hope to prove to the federal government that this is a good return on their investment.\"",
      "But even as the Trump administration curtails waivers, it is retaining discretion to provide social services in Medicaid, just on a smaller scale. Supporters say it's fair to scrutinize where to draw the line on taxpayer spending, arguing that there isn't always a direct health connection.",

      "Current North Carolina officials say they're confident the new social services Medicaid provides in their state have resulted in better health and lower overall spending on expensive and acute care. Medicaid recipients there can even use the program to buy farm-fresh produce.",
      "While it's too soon to know whether these experiments have been effective elsewhere in the United States, early evidence in North Carolina shows promise: The state had saved $1,020 per participant a year into its experiment \u2014 operating in mostly rural counties \u2014 by reducing ER trips and hospitalizations.",
      "State health officials also touted the economic benefits of driving business to family farms, home improvement contractors, and community-based organizations providing housing and social services.",

      "The shoe revolutionized the sneaker industry, but it almost didn't happen.",
      "Michael Jordan's game-changing sneaker",
      "Howard White, a Nike veteran and founding father of the Jordan Brand now serving as its senior vice president, was in the room in 1984 with untested NBA rookie Michael Jordan to meet with Nike at its headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon. Jordan was practically dragged into the meeting by his parents, Deloris and James Jordan.",
      "The stakes were high for Nike, then a relatively small sneaker company.",
      "\"This was bigger than anything that we'd done. You know, typically a great player would get like a hundred thousand dollars. But this was so unique in terms of just doing it, I mean, just having the guts to make something like this happen,\" White explained to \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" while wearing Christian Dior Jordans, which retail up to $17,000 dollars.",
      "The offer: $2.5 million for Jordan to wear their shoes. That was triple what anyone else in the league was making at the time.",
      "Jordan ended up taking the deal \u2013 and the rest is sneaker history. He went on to lead the Chicago Bulls to six championships, while sporting his shoe brand.",
      "Nike hoped the Air Jordan would net them $3 million over four years. Instead, they sold $126 million in year one.",
      "Much of that success is thanks to Jordan's ability to seemingly defy gravity with his \"hang time,\" soaring across the paint for legendary dunks. He solidified his nickname \"Air Jordan\" when he\u00a0got a perfect score with his free throw line dunk in the 1987 NBA All-Star Slam Dunk Contest.",
      "Jordan still \"very integral to the operation\"",
      "Nike's marketing approach for the Air Jordan was groundbreaking, joining the cultural conversation in ways few ads had before.",
      "\"In order to translate what he did as a man into what we do as a brand, you have to start with the series of principles we call them ethos,\" Jason Mayden, chief design officer for the Jordan Brand, told \"CBS Sunday Morning.\"",
      "\"So you first start with connectivity, why this product has relevance and reverence. Then you put that into a very strict process that we call visionary. And so what's interesting is we have a playbook. I can't show you what's in it but you can see by the outside,\" he joked.",
      "The Jordan Brand, a standalone division within Nike, generates some $7 billion for Nike annually. They've released a new design every year for the past four decades. Next up: the top secret \"Jordan 40.\"",

      "\"Sneakers are wearable art. So if you take the artistic approach to interpreting a story through certain features on the shoes, certain colorways going behind the design often, and talking to the people who actually design and make these shoes, you're giving the sneakers a level of depth in AKA storytelling that convinces them, that they're making the right purchase when they buy these secrets,\" Williams explained.",
      "For the Jordan Brand, Air Jordans are bigger than basketball. It's about empowering people to believe more in themselves.",

      "Washington \u2014 The House narrowly passed President Trump's domestic policy bill Thursday following a dramatic all-night session after days of negotiations.",
      "In a 215 to 214 vote, all but two House Republicans supported the massive budget package \u2014 the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda \u2014 in a vote that came hours after unveiling an updated version of the legislation that GOP leaders hoped would satisfy enough holdouts. GOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio opposed the bill. House Freedom Caucus chairman Andy Harris of Maryland voted present.",
      "The measure cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the wee hours of the morning, teeing up the vote on final passage after days of consternation among the House Republican conference.",
      "The bill will now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already voiced some opposition. Congressional leaders have said they want to get it to Mr. Trump's desk by July 4.",
      "The legislation, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, addresses the president's tax, defense and energy priorities, and has overcome several setbacks since the beginning of the year after GOP leadership made repeated assurances to holdouts that their concerns would be addressed later if they kept the legislation moving forward.",
      "But as Speaker Mike Johnson's self-imposed deadline to get the measure across the finish line in the House by Memorial Day quickly approached, the Louisiana Republican was facing increasing opposition from several factions of his party to parts of the bill involving Medicaid, the state and local tax deduction and other provisions.",
      "A 42-page managers amendment released by House GOP leaders late Wednesday includes changes to win over both the budget hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus and blue-state Republicans pressing to ease the tax burden on their constituents. The new version would, among other things, move up the implementation of Medicaid work requirements from the beginning of 2029 to the end of 2026, a change sought by hardliners.",
      "Another change to the bill would more quickly end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "Johnson could only afford three defections on the bill, with all members present and voting, given his slim majority. Massie was the sole Republican to oppose the key procedural vote on the measure earlier Thursday.",
      "\"If something is beautiful, you don't do it after midnight,\" Massie said on the House floor.",
      "Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, delivered his final pitch to House Republicans ahead of the vote, urging that the bill will deliver on GOP promises.",
      "\"If you vote no, you're voting against American energy, you're voting against securing America's border, you're voting against helping those middle class families,\" Scalise said.",
      "Johnson touted the legislation on the House floor, saying it \"gets Americans back to winning again.\"",
      "\"This one big beautiful bill is the most consequential legislation that any, any party has passed, certainly under a majority this thin,\" the speaker said.",
      "All Democrats opposed the package. And after House Democrats threw up procedural roadblocks overnight to delay a vote on the measure, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries railed against the bill in a speech from the House floor early Thursday, calling it a \"reckless, regressive and reprehensible GOP tax scam.\"",
      "\"This is one big, ugly bill that House Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of the American people under the cover of darkness,\" Jeffries said.",
      "The New York Democrat, alluding to the midterm elections next year, warned that \"this day might very well turn out to be the day that House Republicans lost control of the United States House of Representatives.\"",
      "The vote comes after right-wing holdouts met Wednesday afternoon with Mr. Trump and Johnson at the White House. After the meeting, Johnson huddled with other members of the Republican conference to brief them on the changes while House Freedom Caucus members met separately.",
      "Before the White House meeting Wednesday, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he wasn't optimistic the bill could pass this week, though he was \"pretty confident\" it could be passed within 10 days.",
      "But other budget hardliners said after the meeting that negotiations were headed in the right direction.",
      "During a visit to the Capitol Tuesday, Mr. Trump pressured Republicans to fall in line behind the legislation \u2014 which House GOP leaders have named \"The Big, Beautiful Bill\" \u2014 and suggested that those who don't could face primary challenges.",
      "In a statement of administrative policy issued Wednesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget urged House Republicans to pass the measure, saying it \"reflects the shared priorities of both Congress and the Administration,\" adding, \"failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "The details of the updated version of the legislation came together in the final hours before the vote.",
      "Johnson also negotiated with Republicans from blue states over a provision on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The moderates advocated for an increase to the SALT cap, currently set at $10,000, but argued that the $30,000 cap outlined in the package remained too low. An agreement was reached to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000, according to the managers amendment.",
      "The vote marks a key victory for Johnson, after days of shepherding his conference through difficult disagreement over the legislation. But even with the victory, the legislation is expected to face resistance in the Senate \u2014 where numerous Republicans have said they'll seek changes to the bill.",
      "Johnson met with Senate Republicans to discuss the budget process Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Wednesday that the speaker would \"like to see as little change to the product as possible, because they cobble together a very delicate balance over there.\" But Thune said \"the Senate will have its imprint on it.\"",

      "But a day later, on Wednesday evening, Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota expressed confidence in the outcome: \"I believe we'll have the votes.\"",
      "Rules committee meets overnight \u2014 as conservatives push for more spending cuts",
      "When the Rules Committee began meeting early Wednesday, Democrats chastised Republicans over the timing.",
      "\"If you guys think this ugly bill is so damn beautiful, like Trump keeps saying, you should have the courage to debate it in primetime,\" Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, said.",
      "Republicans, however, rejected the request to adjourn the meeting until daylight hours. And the committee's chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, said the Rules Committee \"has a long tradition of meeting late into the evening and reporting legislation long after most of America has gone to bed.\"",
      "The committee's rare overnight meeting took place as Republican leadership races to pass the budget package before its self-imposed Memorial Day deadline.",
      "Johnson has been meeting with the different factions in recent days to hear the demands and build a consensus around a modified version of the legislation that was produced by nearly a dozen House committees.",
      "More conservative members, who are upset that that bill does not make steep enough spending cuts to significantly bring down the deficit, have pushed for Medicaid work requirements to kick in much sooner than a 2029 deadline. They also want to eliminate all the clean energy subsidies that were implemented under the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by former President Joe Biden.",
      "After right-wing opposition appeared to remain firm overnight, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Wednesday morning the White House offered a proposal that would enable these holdouts to back the budget bill, if it were to be included in the package.",
      "\"I don't think it can be done today,\" Harris said. \"I think that there is a pathway forward that we can see.\"",
      "Within the manager's amendment released late Wednesday was a provision that would move up the timeline for Medicaid work requirements to kick in from the beginning of 2029 to the end of 2026, while also phasing out some of the clean energy subsidies earlier than previously outlined in the package.",
      "Conservatives have also been pushing to change the rate by which the federal government pays states for Medicaid, a point of contention with moderates, who have warned against larger cuts to the program.",
      "Johnson reiterated earlier this week that the change has \"been off the table for quite some time,\" however. And Mr. Trump said ahead of the meeting Tuesday morning that \"we're not doing anything cutting of anything meaningful,\" adding that on Medicaid, \"the only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "Before the manager's amendment's release, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the original version of the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. And a new preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office found it would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion.",
      "SALT conflict may be resolved",
      "Right-wing Republicans weren't the only ones with objections to the legislation, though. Blue-state Republicans opposed a provision on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and they threatened to withhold their votes unless their demands were met.",
      "Prior to the SALT deduction cap, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits\u00a0wealthy homeowners\u00a0in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But others also pointed out that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Republicans who represent blue states balked at the $30,000 cap outlined in the package and reached an agreement to further increase it to $40,000. The manager's amendment included a provision that increases the SALT deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said Wednesday night that with the increase he believed all those opposed to that provision were now on board.",
      "Mr. Trump weighed in on the SALT issue Tuesday, suggesting that he opposes raising the cap because he claimed Democratic governors from states like New York, Illinois and California would benefit, calling them the \"biggest\" beneficiaries. But after the group of moderates met with the speaker Tuesday evening, Johnson indicated that they had \"found a point of compromise.\"",
      "According to a senior White House official, Mr. Trump told the House GOP conference during the meeting that they should not let division over the SALT cap get in the way of the bill, and said they should not touch Medicaid, except for addressing waste, fraud and abuse, along with cutting benefits for noncitizens and imposing work requirements. The official said Mr. Trump also made clear he wants every Republican to vote \"yes\" on the bill, while saying he's losing patience with the remaining holdouts.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Wednesday said it placed eight migrant detainees with serious criminal records on a deportation flight that lawyers alleged was destined for the violence-plagued African country of South Sudan, in its latest attempt to deport migrants to countries that are not their own.",
      "The administration has not publicly disclosed the whereabouts of the flight, which a federal judge on Wednesday said \"unquestionably\" violated a court ruling blocking deportations to third countries without allowing detainees to contest their removal.",
      "Top Department of Homeland Security officials said the eight men were in the U.S. illegally and hailed from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam. The department shared case information indicating all the would-be deportees had criminal convictions, including for homicide, attempted murder, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery.",
      "In a statement Wednesday evening, DHS released the names of the eight men. They were identified as Dian Peter Domach of South Sudan, Enrique Arias-Hierro of Cuba, Jose Manuel Rodriguez-Quinones of Cuba, Thongxay Nilakout of Laos, Jesus Munoz-Gutierrez of Mexico, Kyaw Mya of Myanmar, Nyo Myint of Myanmar and Tuan Thanh Phan of Vietnam.",
      "On Tuesday, immigration lawyers told the federal district court in Massachusetts that at least two men from Myanmar and Vietnam were likely being deported to South Sudan, saying the reported deportation flight would violate an order by federal judge Brian Murphy that blocked deportations to third countries unless detainees were provided certain due process rights.",
      "During a briefing in Washington on Wednesday to discuss a migrant flight to South Sudan, top DHS officials confirmed a deportation flight had left Texas on Tuesday, saying the eight detainees from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam were being transported as part of \"a diplomatic and military security operation.\"",
      "The officials, however, declined to confirm the final destination of the flight or any formal arrangement with South Sudan's government, citing operational and safety concerns. The officials also said they could not disclose the exact whereabouts of the detainees.",
      "Following an emergency motion by the lawyers who alerted him of the potential deportation flight to South Sudan, Murphy, the federal judge in Massachusetts, ordered the Trump administration late Tuesday to retain \"custody and control\" of the would-be deportees.",
      "In a written order Wednesday, the judge also ordered the government to give six deportees \"reasonable fear\" interviews, which usually assess whether a migrant is legally entitled to stay in the U.S. because of a risk of persecution or torture. If they express a fear that falls short of that standard, they must get at least 15 days to \"reopen immigration proceedings to challenge the potential third-party removal,\" the judge said.",
      "The Trump administration was also ordered to provide status reports every seven days, and to maintain custody over the deportees.",
      "On Wednesday, top DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the eight men who had been placed on the deportation flight that departed Texas remained in U.S. custody.",
      "McLaughlin also sharply criticized Murphy's ruling. \"It is absolutely absurd for a district judge to try and dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States of America,\" McLaughlin said, accusing Murphy of \"trying to force\" officials to bring back dangerous individuals to the U.S.",
      "During a hearing Wednesday, a Justice Department lawyer told Murphy the flight in question had landed somewhere and also confirmed the men remained in U.S. custody but said the current location of the flight could only be discussed in private, out of earshot of the press.",
      "The Justice Department said the situation was dangerous for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees on the flight because of the severity of the detainees' criminal records.",
      "After a private conversation with both parties, Murphy said that the government's attempted deportations \"are unquestionably violative of this court's order.\" He noted that the detainees were put on the deportation flight less than 24 hours after being told they would be deported to South Sudan.",
      "\"I don't see how anybody could say that these individuals had a meaningful opportunity to object\" to their removal, Murphy said. \"They did not offer any opportunity to object.\" Murphy noted the detainees were put on a deportation flight less than a day after being told they would be deported to South Sudan.",
      "The Justice Department attorneys arguing the case said Murphy's orders in the case were \"not specific enough,\" which gave rise to \"misunderstanding.\"",
      "Murphy did not rule out holding the Trump administration in contempt of court for violating his order, but said that issue would be \"left for another day.\"",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, President Trump's administration has staged an intense diplomatic effort to convince nations around the world to accept migrants who are not their own citizens, approaching nations like Libya and Rwanda to take in third-country deportees.",
      "Early on in Mr. Trump's second term, U.S. officials deported African and Asian migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, and Venezuelan deportees accused of being gang members to El Salvador, where they remain detained at a notorious mega prison.",

    "summary": "President Trump has singled out White Afrikaner farmers for U.S. refugee status, claiming they're persecuted in South Africa. But most people there say it's simply not true.",
    "story": [
      "Refugee admissions to the United States have all but ground to a halt \u2014 except for one group, or a \"small subset,\" as Secretary of State Marco Rubio called them on Tuesday: Afrikaners. They are members of the White ethnic minority that once led South Africa's brutal, four-decade apartheid regime, which ended in 1994 with the election of Nelson Mandela as president.",
      "The Trump administration has already welcomed the first group of Afrikaner asylum applicants, who were given expedited refugee status after claiming they were the victims of violence and discrimination in South Africa.",
      "Other Afrikaners are waiting, keen to take advantage of the offer of special treatment from the Trump administration to gain protected status and the right to live and work in the U.S.",
      "Those hopefuls have been meeting to share information on the process, including Dolf Grobler, who has already applied. The professional hunter told CBS News he has $2.5 million to help make America great again.",
      "\"I'm worried that the genocide, which is currently mainly focused on White farmers, is going to spread,\" he said. The claim of a White genocide is one that President Trump's adviser Elon Musk, whose family are Afrikaners, has backed.",
      "Musk joined Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday as the U.S. leader hosted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa for an official visit. The Afrikaner refugee program was a topic of discussion, along with trade and other matters. In the Oval Office meeting, Ramaphosa pushed back against Mr. Trump's repeated claims of Whites being targeted.",
      "\"Those people in many cases, are being executed, being executed, and they happen to be White, and most happen to be farmers,\" Mr. Trump said, calling the situation \"sort of the opposite of apartheid.\"",
      "\"People who do get killed, unfortunately, through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people,\" Ramaphosa said.",
      "According to South African police, in the last three months of 2024, 12 people were murdered on farms there; one was a White farmer, while the others were Black laborers or security workers.  Asked if he believed life for him and his family was better under apartheid \u2014 an overtly racist minority-rule system that denied equal rights to South Africa's vast majority Black population \u2014 Grobler didn't hesitate.",
      "\"Yes,\" he told CBS News. \"I can't say in my heart that we are better off now.\" Although he did concede apartheid was wrong.",
      "Claims of a White genocide are often circulated by right-wing groups, but the view is not held widely within the Afrikaner community.",
      "Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp, an academic at North-West University in South Africa, says the claims are simply untrue.",
      "\"There's no sign of it, never has been. In fact, Whites are economically the strongest group\" in South Africa, Croucamp told CBS News. \"64% of all boardrooms in South Africa are still White. The average incomes of White South Africans are vastly higher than Black South Africans ... they have better schools, they have better education, private health care. This is the land of milk and honey if you're White.\"",
      "Croucamp suspects the South African government's strong stance against Israel's actions in Gaza, and its relations with China, could have played some part in Mr. Trump's decision to embrace the controversial amnesty program for Afrikaners, but he believes there's more to it.",
      "\"In South Africa, right-wing groups, so-called civil society groups, we know that they have access to the Trump administration because they claim that. And just over the last few days, they have, several times, they said that they will speak to the American government, as if they have access to them. And if you listen to what Trump has said, it corresponds exactly with the genocide narrative that they sell and that they market,\" Croucamp said. \"So, I'm afraid I have to believe them when they say they have direct access to the Trump administration, and we see what Trump has been doing.\"",
      "Grilled about the refugee program Tuesday on Capitol Hill, in a testy exchange with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Secretary of State Rubio insisted that U.S. foreign policy \"doesn't require even-handedness, it involves prioritizing the interests of the United States. ... The United States has a right to pick and choose who they allow into the United States.\"",
      "White South Africans make up only about 7% of the country's population, but they still own more than half of all its farmland. And while the country has a staggeringly high crime rate, racial motives are not generally a factor, according to Afrikaner cattle farmer Nick Serfontein.",
      "He acknowledged that violent attacks on farmers do occur, especially in agricultural land near big cities, where there are often large, impoverished populations, but he said overall, \"I feel safe. I sleep with my doors open here on the farm.\"",
      "There have also been allegations that White farmers are the victims of land expropriation, with the government seizing farms without providing compensation. In January, Ramaphosa signed into law measures to expropriate mostly unused land for public use,  which his government said was necessary to address the consequences of decades of apartheid. While the law provides for fair compensation in most cases, it also allows for expropriation without compensation under limited  circumstances. And any measures can be challenged in court.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that it unfairly targets White landowners, though the law does not mention the race of anyone who could be affected under the legislation.",
      "And more importantly, there hasn't been a single case of expropriation without compensation documented in the 31 years since apartheid ended.",
      "Serfontein argues the problem isn't a deliberate effort by the government to seize White-owned land without compensation, but rather \"because of a dysfunctional government. The model is wrong.\"",
      "He said that for decades, land has been handed over to a Black population with compensation for former owners under established rules, but without any support for the new owners. So, almost a decade ago, Serfontein helped to launch a project aimed at training new Black farmers to work the land.",
      "To date, he says he's personally helped train more than 700 young Black farmers \u2014 the country's next generation of agricultural workers.",
      "\"I'm extremely positive, and so are the young people, the young farmers, they are positive,\" he said.",
      "As for a white genocide, he agreed with Croucamp, saying bluntly: \"It's not happening.\"",
      "Serfontein said he didn't know the histories of the Afrikaners who had already left for the U.S., and he didn't doubt they \"probably had some unhappy experiences in South Africa, about a number of things. But let me tell you that if you went to NAMPO last week \u2014 NAMPO is the biggest agricultural show in the Southern Hemisphere \u2014 you would have found a vibe there between the farmers, young farmers, old farmers, Black farmers, White farmers, that you've never experienced before. They are so excited about the future of South Africa.\"",

      "She says that without the food bank, \"I'd probably starve.\" \u00a0 But the aid she relies on has been reduced. In March, the White House's Department of Government Efficiency cut funding for about $1 billion worth of U.S. Department of Agriculture programs. The two federal programs that were cut allowed schools and food banks to purchase food directly from local farmers and producers.",
      "\"We've been seeing empty racks since February,\" Paco Velez, CEO of Feeding South Florida, told CBS News. \"These cuts have really made an impact, not just on our ability to serve, but on the families' ability to thrive in South Florida and across the country.\"",

      "The Justice Department is shaking up the priorities for a popular grant program that provides millions of dollars in aid to budget-strapped local police departments across America, according to public documents reviewed by CBS News.",
      "In a fact sheet for the Community Policing Development microgrant program, the Trump administration eliminated language that encouraged police agencies to seek federal money for initiatives to help \"underserved populations,\" build trust in police, boost diversity in police departments and support community violence intervention.",
      "Instead, the administration lists \"immigration and border security,\" \"violent crime prevention\" and \"uplifting the image of the law enforcement profession\" as programs that are priorities for the highly sought-after grants, which are administered by the Justice Department's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) division.",
      "The instructions to local police departments for funding in 2025 mark a noticeable shift from the guidance issued by the Justice Department during the Biden administration a year earlier.",
      "The 2024 guidance prioritized efforts at \"building trust and legitimacy with the community\" and \"community violence intervention\" initiatives, which include efforts to combat racism, trauma, poverty and other triggers to violence.",
      "The Trump administration has shifted the grant instructions for 2025 to invite police to make a compelling argument that the money will help stiffen border security, reduce violent crime, improve police departments' public image, support \"opioids and drug market interruption\" and other priorities.",
      "Both the 2024 and 2025 instructions have an \"Open Topic Area\" for grant applications that don't fit into any of the listed categories.",
      "The change of language raises the prospect of a dramatic shift in which police agencies are granted money and what programs are approved for federal help.",
      "The Justice Department's COPS community policing development grants program has awarded more than $67 million to dozens of police agencies since 2023, including for some cities as large as New York, Boston and Los Angeles, and those as small as Bluefield, W.Va., and Bellevue, Neb., according to a review by CBS News.",
      "The shift could imperil money from some projects that have been highly touted in small and large U.S. cities.",
      "\"These are some significant changes,\" said Chiraag Baines, a former Justice Department attorney and Biden administration aide. \"There's a broader impact to this than just grant money. It's a statement about priorities and it could encourage police to give less priority to certain programs and initiatives if they think the Administration is going to be hostile to them.\"",
      "Baines said the newly-listed priorities for projects combatting violent crime and opioid abuse are important. But he added the new language encouraging police to apply for money for projects that \"uplift the image of law enforcement\" is a change \"that really confuses the issue. Police should be working to build trust and cooperation.\"",
      "Communities have proudly announced their grant awards for \"community violence interventions\" during the Biden administration.",
      "Cleveland Heights, Ohio, touted a program that got a 2023 grant as a successful initiative to reach at-risk youths. The city's announcement of the grant said the $175,000 award would be used for \"foot patrols in violence-impacted areas and forming a new outreach and mentorship program for Cleveland Heights.\"",
      "St. Petersburg, Fla., police are among the dozens of departments and cities to receive grants for initiatives to build \"trust and legitimacy with the community\" since 2021, including an approximately $174,000 grant in 2022.",
      "The agency told CBS News it used the grant to \"support 20 non-profit youth sports leagues.\" The police department also \"collaborated with the Tampa Bay Rays Baseball team to offer softball programs for at-risk girls, increasing access and participation.\"",
      "St. Petersburg won another $175,000 COPS grant, for police to help \"underserved populations\" in 2023. The department told CBS News it used the money for \"arts and educational mentorship\" for youth.",
      "The changes mark a paradigm shift, and have inflamed criticism from congressional Democrats. Rep. Glenn Ivey, a Democrat who was once a state prosecutor in Maryland, told CBS News, \"It is really a marked change in priorities from the last administration. Local communities count on these funds to augment their community policing efforts. Safer communities start with trust and security not fear and distrust. COPS grants should build up the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve, not tear them apart.\"",
      "A former Justice Department official who served in prior administrations told CBS News the shifting of grant criteria is common when the department changes leadership. But the official said the shift away from community violence intervention programs is a \"recipe for depriving law enforcement of the leads and witnesses that can solve cases and prevent crime. Community police cuts crime because people trust the police enough to work with them.\"",
      "Justice Department officials declined to answer specific questions about the changes in grant application language.",
      "A spokeswoman told CBS News in a written statement, \"Under the direction of Attorney General Bondi, the COPS office is committed to highlighting the important work that our law enforcement partners do and to supporting law enforcement through hiring and grant assistance.\"",
      "A review of prior COPS grants announcements shows a shift of language after then-President Joe Biden took office. The language in the 2022 COPS hiring grant fact sheet for police departments eliminated references from the first Trump administration that specified money was available for initiatives that focused on homeland security and school-based policing, and added language prioritizing \"diversity training\" projects.",
      "Even in a distinctively polarized political climate, federal COPS grants remain overwhelmingly popular and highly pursued by local police agencies. Grant awards are regularly touted by members of congress from both parties and publicly announced by local officials as victories for the community.",
      "A bipartisan group of federal legislators has introduced a bill to beef up funding for overall COPS grants. Rep. Pat Ryan, a New York Democrat whose district includes smaller communities in the Hudson Valley, co-sponsored the bill and said, \"Far too often, small and midsized police departments like ours lack the resources they need.\"",
      "Rep. Zach Nunn, an Iowa Republican who co-sponsored the measure, wrote, \"Every Iowa town deserves strong public safety, regardless of size or geography, and I'm proud to help lead this bipartisan effort to boost hiring and resources for law enforcement in our small and rural communities.\" Nunn's announcement said the proposal would \"reauthorize the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program with double the amount of federal funding.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for the Alexandria, Va., police department, which received a $175,000 grant last year to help serve \"underserved populations,\" told CBS News, \"The Department of Justice COPS Office plays a vital role in supporting law enforcement agencies across the country. Their funding and technical assistance have been instrumental in helping departments build long-standing relationships between police and the communities they serve.\"",
      "Some city officials and police departments declined to comment on their federal COPS grant awards, including Dearborn, Mich., which received an $88,816 grant for \"building trust\" in police in 2023.",

    "summary": "A dramatic standoff between the U.S. Institute of Peace and the Trump administration ended this week, with a federal judge ruling the government's efforts to dismantle the think tank were illegal.",
    "story": [
      "The leaders of the United States Institute for Peace regained control of their offices Wednesday, weeks after they were ejected from their positions by the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency in March.",
      "The dramatic turn of events happened in the wake of U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell's ruling on Monday that the takeover of USIP was \"unlawful\" and conducted by \"illegitimately-installed leaders.\" Howell further ruled that the action was \"null and void.\" The judge ruled after USIP's leaders sued the government.",
      "The Justice Department indicated Wednesday it plans to appeal Howell's ruling, and asked the judge to pause her order while an appellate court considers the case.",
      "At an impromptu press briefing on the steps of the USIP building Wednesday, acting President George Moose addressed reporters.",
      "\"We are now back in the building and we intend to resume our stewardship and custodianship,\" Moose said. \"It is not just the platform from which we've been doing our work. It is a symbol of the aspirations and the intent of the American people to be seen and to be peacemaker in the world.\"",
      "Howell's ruling was the culmination of a two-month legal battle that began after USIP employees were forcibly removed from the organization's building in downtown Washington with the help of Washington, D.C., Metropolitan police.",
      "The chain of events started on Feb. 19, when President Trump issued Executive Order 14217 declaring USIP \"unnecessary\" and terminating its leadership, most of its 300 staff members and its entire board. The organization was created by Congress as an \"independent nonprofit corporation.\"",
      "That set the stage for the dramatic standoff between the USIP leadership and DOGE \u2014 the cost-cutting team run by billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 a month later. Representatives of DOGE gained access to the building with the help of a private security company, USIP spokesperson Liz Callihan said. During the standoff, Moose issued a statement saying \"DOGE has broken into our building.\"",
      "On March 17, DOGE seized control of the institute's headquarters and a newly installed president transferred ownership of the building to the Government Services Administration, which oversees contracting for the federal government and acts effectively as its landlord. The building was built specifically to house USIP and was paid for through a mix of public and privately donated money.",
      "USIP counsel George Foote also spoke at Wednesday's press conference. \"The Institute is the rightful possessor of this building, that George [Moose] is the rightful acting president\u2026 The effect of the judge's order was to outlaw everything that happened beginning with the president's dismissal of our board of directors\u2026so it never happened\" Foote said.",
      "USIP was established 41 years ago by Congress. Its mission is to provide analysis, education, and resources to those working for peace around the world and to reduce the chance that the U.S. government will be pulled into foreign conflict. In recent years, USIP staff have increasingly been deployed to hot zones overseas where they have taken part in conflict resolution between warring parties, including in Iraq and Papua New Guinea.",
      "A White House spokeswoman said in response to Howell's decision, \"President Trump is right to reduce failed, useless entities like USIP to their statutory minimum, and this rogue judge's attempt to impede on the separation of powers will not be the last say on this matter.\"",

    "summary": "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify medical exceptions under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S.,",
    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify\u00a0medical exceptions\u00a0under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S., putting the GOP-backed proposal on the brink of reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk.",
      "The changes would not expand abortion access in Texas or list specific medical exceptions under the state's near-total ban, which took effect in 2022 and only allows for an abortion to save the life of the mother. It also would not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "But the proposal is still a pivot for Texas\u00a0Republicans, who for years have defended the law as written in the face of legal challenges and pleas for clarity from medical providers.\u00a0Democrats, meanwhile, have called the bill a positive step but also faced criticism from some abortion-rights allies who raised doubts about what, if any, impact it will have.",
      "The bill would specify that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. It also defines a \"life-threatening\" condition as one capable of causing death.",
      "Senate Bill 31\u00a0passed 129-6 and needs only a final procedural vote before reaching Abbott, who has signaled support for the measure.",
      "North Texas doctor has mixed feelings toward the bill",
      "Three years ago, Dr. Austin Dennard traveled outside Texas for an abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition. She later testified in a lawsuit about how the state's near-total ban on abortion put her health at risk.",
      "Dennard's feelings are mixed about the bill, which does not list specific medical conditions or include fatal fetal anomalies as exceptions.",
      "\"What is broadly now known among practicing physicians in Texas is that abortions are illegal,\" said Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas. \"Undoing that broad understanding is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Moves to clarify medical exemptions",
      "Lawmakers in at least nine states with abortion bans have sought to change or clarify medical exceptions that allow doctors to perform an abortion if the mother's life is at risk since Roe v. Wade was overturned\u00a0nearly three years ago, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Supporters of these bills have said they have the potential to save lives. Critics, including some abortion rights groups, have questioned whether they make state abortion laws easier to understand.",
      "In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year vetoed a bill that GOP lawmakers touted as bringing clarity to that state's near-total abortion ban, saying it would not protect pregnant women. Republican lawmakers later overrode his veto.",
      "Last year, South Dakota released a video for physicians that outlined examples of acceptable medical emergencies, which received criticism from abortion rights supporters for not being specific enough.",
      "\"I think these bills are trying to get at the reality that exceptions are really hard to comply with,\" said Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy adviser at the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "Still, Texas Republican Sen. Bryan Hughes, an architect of the state's abortion ban, said the new bill's goal is to avoid confusion among doctors.",
      "\"One of the most important things we want to do is to make sure that doctors and hospitals and the hospital lawyers are trained on what the law is,\" Hughes said.",
      "Navigating exceptions under abortion bans",
      "In 2024, the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Dennard and a group of women who said they were denied abortions after experiencing serious pregnancy complications that threatened their lives and fertility. The court ruled that the state's laws were clear in allowing doctors to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother.",
      "Texas' efforts underscore the challenges abortion opponents have had to navigate regarding medical exceptions, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and a historian of abortion politics in the U.S.",
      "Judges have put enforcement of Utah's abortion ban on hold in a case over exceptions, for example, and they struck down two Oklahoma bans over medical exceptions \u2013 though most abortions in that state remain illegal.",
      "For abortion opponents, Ziegler said, it's tricky to craft legislation that does two different things.",
      "\"Can you provide clear guidance as to when medical intervention is justified without providing physicians discretion to provide abortions they don't think are emergencies?\" Ziegler said.",
      "Texas may advance other anti-abortion laws",
      "Texas' ban prohibits nearly all abortions, except to save the life of the mother, and doctors can be fined up to $100,000 and face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an abortion illegally.",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton's office has filed criminal charges against a midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions and is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",
      "Texas Republicans are also advancing efforts to make it a civil offense to mail, deliver or manufacture abortion pills, expanding on a 2021 law that allows private individuals to sue others whom they suspect are helping a woman obtain an abortion.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department said it will bring an end to investigations launched during the Biden administration after the deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department said Wednesday that it is starting the process of dismissing lawsuits against police departments in Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, bringing an end to investigations launched during former President Joe Biden's administration. It will also put an end to proposed accountability agreements with the departments.",
      "The Trump administration said the consent decrees proposed by the Biden administration sought to subject the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments to sweeping terms that went beyond accusations of unconstitutional conduct and would have led to \"years of micromanagement\" of local departments.",
      "The federal involvement began following the deaths of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police and Breonna Taylor in a Louisville police shooting in 2020.",
      "\"Overbroad police consent decrees divest local control of policing from communities where it belongs, turning that power over to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, often with an anti-police agenda,\" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. \"Today, we are ending the Biden Civil Rights Division's failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments with factually unjustified consent decrees.\"",
      "In addition to taking steps to dismiss the lawsuits against the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments, the Trump administration also said it is closing investigations into police departments in Phoenix; Trenton, New Jersey; Memphis; Mount Vernon, New York; Oklahoma City and the Louisiana State Police. The Trump administration said it is retracting the Biden administration's findings of unconstitutional violations by all of the eight named departments, and is looking into potentially dismissing over a dozen other consent decrees across the country.",
      "The Justice Department's decision to drop the lawsuits against the Louisville and Minneapolis departments comes just days before the five-year mark since Floyd's death. Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was convicted in state court\u00a0on murder and manslaughter charges for Floyd's killing and went on to plead guilty in a federal civil rights case.",
      "In a filing with the federal court in Minnesota in the case against the city of Minneapolis, Justice Department lawyers said that the government \"will no longer prosecute this matter.\"",
      "\"After an extensive review by current Department of Justice and Civil Rights Division leadership, the United States no longer believes that the proposed consent decree would be in the public interest,\" the filing, signed by Dhillon and others, reads.",
      "Consent decrees were used in federal investigations of law enforcement agencies during the Obama administration as part of a renewed commitment to civil rights issues and accountability in policing. But the Justice Department during the first Trump administration restricted their use. That policy was rescinded during the Biden administration. Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland subsequently opened the investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department.",
      "Dhillon, the assistant attorney general, told reporters that consent decrees often set \"unrealistic, idealistic expectations that are simply a recipe for non-compliance and perpetual consent decree hell for jurisdictions.\" But she said if there was a \"case of widespread, systemic racist or otherwise excessive-force situations happening despite training, despite litigation, despite local law enforcement taking these issues on,\" consent decrees \"might be an appropriate vehicle.\"",
      "\"Theoretically, we are not ruling it out,\" she added.",
      "The yearslong examination by the Justice Department into the Minneapolis Police Department was launched in 2021, in the wake of Floyd's death, and found that the Minneapolis Police Department disproportionately targeted Black and Native American people in law enforcement activity and used unjustified force in many instances.",
      "The probe was undertaken to determine whether the department engaged in a \"pattern or practice\" of unconstitutional or unlawful policing. That civil investigation was separate from a federal criminal probe into Floyd's death, which led to convictions of three Minneapolis police officers who were found to have failed to step in to stop Chauvin's use of force against Floyd.",
      "Investigators had recommended nearly 30 remedial measures and improvements for Minneapolis to implement to combat racial disparities and excessive use of force by the department, such as enhanced training and accountability measures, and improved data collection of police activity.",
      "The city of Minneapolis and the Justice Department had entered into an agreement in principle to reach a court-authorized consent decree, which would have formalized the federal findings and recommendations, and appointed an independent monitor for the police department.",
      "The Minneapolis City Council and Mayor Jacob Frey approved the terms of a court-enforceable consent decree in early January, which had to be approved by a federal judge before taking effect. The city has begun implementing the reforms laid out in the agreement and said it will continue to do so despite the Trump administration's decision to dismiss the consent decree case.",
      "\"We're doing it anyway,\" Frey said in a statement. \"We will implement every reform outlined in the consent decree\u2014because accountability isn't optional. Our independent monitor has lauded the meaningful progress we've made under the state settlement agreement, and the public can count on clear, measurable proof that our reforms are moving forward.\"",
      "As for the Louisville Police Department, the Justice Department's investigation found that it, too, likely engaged in a pattern of conduct that violated citizens' civil and constitutional rights. The Justice Department, city of Louisville and its police department reached an agreement in principle toward a consent decree.",
      "Four Louisville Metro Police Department officers faced federal charges in connection with Taylor's death in March 2020. Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was shot when officers stormed into her apartment while she was asleep with her boyfriend. Her boyfriend, who thought the officers were intruders, fired a handgun as they entered. The officers in response fired 22 shots into the apartment, and one struck Taylor in the chest.",
      "But in announcing the decision to dismiss the lawsuits against the Minneapolis and Louisville police departments, the Justice Department under President Trump claimed they accused the agencies of engaging in patterns of unconstitutional policing by \"wrongly equating statistical disparities with intentional discrimination and heavily relying on flawed methodologies and incomplete data.\"",
      "The Trump administration also said the consent decrees went too far and would have subjected the police departments to sweeping oversight.",
      "\"In short, these sweeping consent decrees would have imposed years of micromanagement of local police departments by federal courts and expensive independent monitors, and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of compliance costs, without a legally or factually adequate basis for doing so,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Dhillon said the agreements cost an average of $10 million a year and \"should be a rare exception and not the norm.\" She said \"specifics of policing, policy, hiring, training, management, promotion and internal policies are best made at a local level, where there's local accountability, and local control over funding and policy issues.\"",
      "Both Minneapolis and Louisville either already have consent decrees at the state level or are hiring their own monitors and taking actions on their own to ensure constitutional policing, Dhillon said, adding that the cities should save money thanks to the Justice Department's decision.",
      "\"You can actually use that money, tens of millions of dollars, to hire more cops for your communities that will keep you safer than a partner at a big law firm in D.C. getting paid to monitor you,\" Dhillon said.",

    "summary": "President Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who pushed back on claims about White genocide in South Africa.",
    "story": [
      "Differences between President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa came to a head Wednesday afternoon in a tense exchange in the Oval Office, as Mr. Trump confronted him over whether White genocide is taking place in South Africa.",
      "Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa met for a critical conversation \u2014 with South African-born billionaire Elon Musk in the room \u2014 amid tensions between the U.S. and South Africa, after the U.S.\u00a0accepted\u00a059 White Afrikaners last week and granted them status as refugees.",
      "At one point in the meeting, Ramaphosa took a question intended for Mr. Trump about what it would take to persuade him that White genocide is not occurring in South Africa.",
      "\"It will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends, like those who are here,\" responded Ramaphosa, who brought South African golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen and billionaire businessman Johann Rupert with him to the White House. \"When we have talks between us at a quiet table, it will take President Trump to listen to them. I will not be repeating what I've been saying.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded that there are \"thousands of stories\" and \"documentaries\" about the situation in South Africa, before directing his staff to dim the lights in the Oval Office and play a video for everyone in the room about allegations of violence against White South Africans.",
      "The president said white crosses seen in the video showed burial sites of White farmers. In fact, they were part of a\u00a0protest, filmed near Normandien, South Africa, on Sept. 5, 2020, after the killing of Glen and Vida Rafferty, a White farming couple. Participants\u00a0said\u00a0the demonstration aimed to draw attention to all farm murders in the region, not solely those involving White farmers. Elon Musk previously shared the same video on X, posting it on\u00a0March 8\u00a0and\u00a0May 13\u00a0with the claim that the crosses represented White farmers.",
      "The video also included footage of a crowd at a rally being led in a chant against White farmers. After the video concluded, Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa went back and forth about the situation.",
      "Ramaphosa said he hadn't seen the videos the president's staff played and said the videos do not represent government policy. He said he and his party are \"completely opposed\" to the language used in the footage.",
      "\"We have dead White people, dead White farmers, mostly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Others in the South African delegation who accompanied Ramaphosa told Mr. Trump the issue is not White genocide in South Africa, but rather, crime in general, affecting South Africans across demographics. Ramaphosa, too, pushed back.",
      "\"There is criminality in our country,\" he said. \"People who do get killed unfortunately through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people.\"",
      "The Trump-Ramaphosa meeting, in which reporters were allowed in the room for over an hour, is yet another instance of the U.S. president inviting the media to witness and broadcast testy exchanges with other world leaders, instead of keeping those discussions behind closed doors.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said White farmers in South Africa have been targets of \"genocide\" \u2014 an allegation South Africa and Ramaphosa have rejected \u2014 and insists South Africa is \"out of control,\" echoing Musk. In the meeting Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"Elon wanted\" the Afrikaners to be allowed into the U.S. as refugees. During the time reporters were in the Oval Office for the meeting, Musk said nothing.",
      "The beginning of the Oval Office meeting was smoother. Mr. Trump called it a \"great honor\" to be with the South African president, who, he said \"is certainly in some circles, really respected, other circles, a little bit less respected, like all of us, in all fairness.\"",
      "\"We are essentially here to reset the relationship between the United States and South Africa,\" Ramaphosa said in his opening comments.",
      "Asked by a reporter why the government is letting White Afrikaners into the U.S. while denying entry to other refugees, the president began by lambasting the news outlet that asked the question.",
      "\"We've had tremendous complaints about Africa, about other countries too, from people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They said there's a lot of very bad things going on in Africa, and that's what we're going to be discussing today.\"",
      "\"We have many people that feel they're being persecuted,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "The expedited process for the Afrikaners comes as the Trump administration is working to suspend the refugee admission program, drawing multiple court challenges.",
      "In a tense exchange during a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday on budget matters, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio if the Afrikaners are more persecuted than the Uyghurs or Rohingyas, or dissidents in Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua, or than those who would be threatened by the Taliban, should they return to Afghanistan.",
      "Kaine suggested the Trump administration is giving preference to Afrikaners due to the color of their skin, and asked Rubio why the U.S. should prioritize Afrikaners. Rubio said the Afrikaners are a \"small subset.\"",
      "\"It's a new issue,\" Rubio said. \"And the president identified it as a problem and wanted to use it as an example. But that's different from having these refugee programs that were basically spending money to put people up in communities and accommodate them, and it was acting as a magnet.\"",
      "\"Let me challenge you, and I'm just going to say for the public, if you want to understand about the quote, persecution, of Afrikaner farmers, go look at the composition of the South African government,\" Kaine responded. \"Since July of 2024, there's a government of national unity. And the opposition party today \u2014 the ANC \u2014 the Afrikaner Party, the Democracy Alliance, is part of the governing coalition. They joined the governing coalition a year ago, and the leader of that party was given the remit of Agriculture Minister Jan Steenhuisen, and he is the leader of the former Afrikaner party, still widely representing Afrikaners. He is the minister of agriculture in South Africa right now. I assert that this claim that there's persecution of Afrikaner farmers is completely specious.\"",

    "story": [
      "Less than two weeks until the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season, Federal Emergency Management Agency acting Administrator David Richardson has rescinded the agency's strategic plan, a comprehensive policy document that outlines the disaster relief agency's priorities.",
      "In a short memo sent to FEMA employees on Wednesday and obtained by CBS News, Richardson wrote, \"The 2022-2026 FEMA Strategic Plan is hereby rescinded. The Strategic Plan contains goals and objectives that bear no connection to FEMA accomplishing its mission. This summer, a new 2026-2030 strategy will be developed. The strategy will tie directly to FEMA executing its Mission Essential Tasks.\"",
      "The memo authored by Richardson was brief \u2014 the new agency head now requires that all FEMA memos to, from or for his office be no longer than one page in length, according to multiple current FEMA employees.",
      "FEMA did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for comment.",
      "Wired was the first to report that the plan had been rescinded.",
      "One FEMA official described the strategic plan to CBS News as the agency's \"organizational backbone.\"",
      "\"Without it, there are just a bunch of offices doing whatever they feel like doing,\" the official said.",
      "The strategic plan, which was published in December 2021 under former administrator Deanne Criswell, was set to expire in 2026. The plan no longer appears on FEMA's website.",
      "Criswell, in a news release at the time the plan was published, laid out three main goals for the agency: \"Instill Equity as a Foundation of Emergency Management,\" \"Lead Whole of Community in Climate Resilience\" and \"Promote and Sustain a Ready FEMA and Prepared Nation.\"",
      "The official told CBS News Richardson is now trying to figure out how to operate FEMA so that it does nothing more or less than what the law requires. Part of that includes nixing the agency's Office of Resilience Strategy.",
      "\"That office exists to figure out how to maximize efficacy of publicly spent money on projects that build a resilient infrastructure that can withstand disaster events,\" the official said. \"Without that guiding star, FEMA will operate as triage instead of actually trying to mitigate future damage before it happens.\"",
      "The official compared the removal of the ORS to people relying solely on emergency rooms for health care rather than also getting preventative care.",
      "\"A primary care physician would've been able to tell you that you have a disease that makes your blood not clot properly. Pulling the Office of Resilience Strategy out of the equation means that you'll bleed out and die from a paper cut because nobody was around to tell you that your life was at risk in the first place,\" the said.",
      "The move to rescind the strategic plan comes a little over a week after an internal agency presentation featured a slide that noted, \"As FEMA transforms to a smaller footprint, the intent for this hurricane season is not well understood, thus FEMA is not ready.\"",
      "A Department of Homeland Security official told CBS News in response that FEMA is \"fully activated in preparation for Hurricane Season,\" and described the assessment as \"one line in a nineteen-page slide deck and the unsubstantiated opinion of one official inside the agency.\"",
      "The presentation also cited \"culture issues,\" staffing shortages and problems coordinating with other federal agencies among the issues it was contending with.",
      "President Trump, who has been critical of how the agency responded to past disasters, has suggested transforming it into a \"support agency\" that largely defers to the states or\u00a0scrapping FEMA\u00a0entirely.",
      "Richardson has been FEMA's acting administrator for less than two weeks, replacing the agency's former acting head, Cameron Hamilton, who was fired by the Trump administration after he told lawmakers he doesn't believe eliminating FEMA is in the country's \"best interests.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia died Wednesday, his family announced. He was 75 years old.",
      "Connolly's death comes weeks after he announced that he would not seek reelection in 2026 and would be stepping back from his post as the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee because his cancer had returned.",
      "\"It is with immense sadness that we share that our devoted and loving father, husband, brother, friend, and public servant, Congressman Gerald E. Connolly, passed away peacefully at his home this morning surrounded by family,\" Connolly's family announced in a statement.",
      "Connolly, a Democrat, has represented Virginia's 11th Congressional District, which covers parts of the region outside of Washington, D.C., since 2009. He announced in November that he had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and would be undergoing chemotherapy and immunotherapy.",
      "But the Virginia Democrat said in an open letter to his constituents last month that while the cancer was initially beaten back after treatments, it had returned. He said at the time that his \"sun is setting on my time in public service.\"",
      "In announcing his death, Connolly's family praised his years in public service, saying \"his legacy now colors our region.\"",
      "\"We were fortunate to share Gerry with Northern Virginia for nearly 40 years because that was his joy, his purpose, and his passion,\" they said. \"His absence will leave a hole in our hearts, but we are proud that his life's work will endure for future generations. We thank you for your love of Gerry, and know he loved you all so much.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden, who recently announced he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, said Connelly was a man of \"deep integrity, principle, and purpose.\"",
      "\"He was a dear friend, a fierce leader for working families, and someone I was proud to partner with throughout our careers,\" Biden wrote in a post on X. \"When I served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Gerry was a key member of our team for a decade starting in 1979. Later, he was elected to Congress himself, and when I was president, Gerry and I worked together to pass consequential legislation, including the American Rescue Plan and efforts to prevent veteran suicide and support our nation's first responders.\"",
      "Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican who chaired the Oversight Committee, also honored Connolly in a statement.",
      "\"I'm deeply saddened by the passing of Ranking Member Gerry Connolly. He was a dedicated public servant who represented Virginia's 11th Congressional District with honor and integrity,\" he said. \"We mourn the loss of our friend and colleague, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.\"",
      "Before he was elected to Congress, Connolly served for 14 years on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, including five years as its chairman. The county is the largest jurisdiction in the Washington, D.C., region, with more than 1 million residents. While in Congress, he served on the Oversight panel and the Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "House Democrats elected Connolly to serve as the ranking member of the Oversight Committee following the November elections. His decision last month to step down from the top position on the panel set off an internal race among Democrats to succeed him.",
      "Connolly is the third House Democrat to die this year. Rep. Sylvester Turner of Texas died on March 4, and Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona died on March 13.",

    "story": [
      "ICE officials and a prison contractor have refused to grant a contact visit between Mahmoud Khalil and his family, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, denying him the chance to hold his newborn son. The boy was born last month while Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and Palestinian activist, remained in ICE custody in Louisiana.",
      "\"After flying over a thousand miles to Louisiana with our newborn son, his very first flight, all so his father could finally hold him in his arms, ICE has denied us even this most basic human right,\" his wife, Noor Abdalla, said in a news release from the nonprofit civil rights organization on Wednesday. \"This is not just heartless. It is deliberate violence, the calculated cruelty of a government that tears families apart without remorse.\"",
      "The ACLU said the refusal by ICE and the prison contractor GEO Group came after multiple requests from Khalil's legal team pointing to federal policies that encourage contact visits between children and their detained parents. Officials, they said, cited \"a blanket no-contact visitation policy at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center (CLIPC) and unspecified 'security concerns' relating to the presence of a mother and newborn baby in an unsecure part of the facility.\"",
      "Khalil, a 30-year-old legal permanent resident, was\u00a0taken into custody in early March at his Columbia-owned apartment\u00a0in New York City. He was a vocal member of\u00a0last year's campus protests over the war in Gaza.",
      "The Trump administration accused Khalil of engaging in pro-Hamas activities, arguing he can be deported on foreign policy grounds using a rarely used provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act, but did not present specific evidence against him. Khalil's attorneys have disputed the allegation and argue his detention was unlawful.",
      "The administration later accused Khalil of immigration fraud, which his lawyers also dispute.",
      "An immigration judge in Louisiana last month permitted the administration to continue with its effort to deport Khalil, ruling that the determination that Khalil poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S. is \"facially reasonable.\"",

    "summary": "19-year-old Ximena Arias Cristobal was granted bond, weeks after ICE arrested her following traffic charges that were later dismissed.",
    "story": [
      "A Georgia teen who was detained by federal deportation officers following local traffic charges that have since been dismissed was granted bond on Wednesday, paving the way for her to be released from immigration detention, her mother and attorney told CBS News.",
      "Ximena Arias Cristobal, who came to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 4, has been in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody since earlier this month, when she was stopped by local police in Dalton, Georgia, over allegations that she had made an improper turn while driving.",
      "Arias Cristobal, 19, was charged with driving without a license and making an improper turn and booked into the county jail in Dalton, where she lives with her family. ICE then took custody of Arias Cristobal, who is in the U.S. illegally, at the county jail, which has an agreement to work with federal immigration authorities.",
      "She has been held at the Stewart ICE detention facility in Lumpkin, Georgia, since then. Initially, that facility was also housing her father, who had been taken into ICE custody in April, also after a traffic stop. But he was granted bond last week and released.",
      "Given her time in the U.S. and lack of a criminal record, local community members, including the Republican lawmaker representing Dalton in the Georgia legislature, expressed support for Arias Cristobal and called for her release. Community outrage intensified once Dalton authorities dismissed the traffic charges against Arias Cristobal after revealing she had been mistakenly stopped by the police officer who arrested her.",
      "Dustin Baxter, Arias Cristobal's immigration attorney, said an immigration judge on Wednesday granted his client a $1,500 bond, the lowest amount allowed by law.",
      "\"The judge had reviewed Ximena's case in detail and determined that Ximena is in fact not a flight risk or a danger to the community in the least,\" Baxter said. \"The Department of Homeland Security indicated that it would not appeal the judge's decision.\"",
      "Baxter said Arias Cristobal should be back home with her family by Thursday afternoon.",
      "While she is set to be released from the detention, Arias Cristobal will continue to face deportation to Mexico, as ICE has started a deportation case against her in immigration court. The Department of Homeland Security has previously said she and her father should face \"consequences\" for being in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Under the Biden administration, it would've been unlikely for someone like Arias Cristobal \u2014 an undocumented immigrant without a criminal history who came to the U.S. as a young child \u2014 to be arrested by ICE.",
      "But as part of its sweeping immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has vastly broadened who ICE officers can target for arrest and deportation, revoking Biden-era policies that generally ensured the agency would only target serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals in the country illegally.",
      "Even though Arias Cristobal is an undocumented immigrant who came to the U.S. as a child \u2014 a group commonly known as \"Dreamers\" \u2014 she did not qualify for an Obama-era program that protects half a million of those individuals from deportation.",
      "That Obama administration policy, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, requires beneficiaries to have arrived in the U.S. before June 2007. Arias Cristobal came to the country in 2010. DACA has also been closed to new applicants due to federal litigation.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 16:22:41 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's missile defense project, called the \"Golden Dome for America,\" could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's missile defense project, called the \"Golden Dome for America,\" aims to protect the U.S. from foreign threats. But it has been criticized by China as threatening to increase the risks of militarizing space and a global arms race.",
      "The president on Tuesday said his administration had \"selected an architecture\" for the \"state-of-the-art system,\" which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars and put U.S. weapons in space for the first time in history.",
      "What is the Golden Dome and how will it work?",
      "The Golden Dome is a multilayered defense system that the president, speaking in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said will deploy \"next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors.\"",
      "\"The Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" the president said, adding that he wants it to be operational before his term ends.",
      "The concept includes both ground- and space-based capabilities that would defend against missiles by: detecting and destroying them ahead of launch, intercepting them early in flight, halting them midcourse and stopping them in the last few moments of approaching a target.",
      "The initiative would have multiple layers that expand on what the U.S. already has and build new programs to counter the full range of aerial threats, according to Gen. Gregory Guillot, the head of U.S. Northern Command, who testified in front of Congress in April.",
      "He described a domain awareness layer to track threats and then two other layers, \"the first being an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) defeat layer, which largely exists today with the GBIs (ground-based interceptors) that can defeat a North Korean threat and then an air layer that would defeat cruise missiles and air threats.\"",
      "\"This is not going to be off the cuff,\" Tom Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS News in an interview.",
      "\"This is going to be well-rooted in the systems engineering and the understanding of the threat and in the overall architecture plans that have been in the works for a long time,\" Karako said.",
      "The new initiative, which will encompass many programs, will be built in states including Florida, Georgia, Indiana and Alaska, according to Mr. Trump, and involve multiple American defense and technology companies that have not yet been selected.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a cost of $542 billion for the space-based components alone.",
      "Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin, which said on X it is ready to support the dome mission, describes it as a \"revolutionary concept.\"",
      "\"This is a Manhattan Project-scale mission, one that is both urgent and crucial to America's security,\" the company says.",
      "Lockheed Martin COO Frank St. John said it would protect against nuclear missiles, as well as intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles, and other threats.",
      "Mr. Trump said U.S. Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein would be responsible for overseeing the dome's progress.",
      "However, there is no funding yet to match the plan, which is \"still in the conceptual stage,\" Air Force Secretary Troy Meink told senators on Tuesday at a hearing. The Pentagon is also still developing the requirements that the dome will have to meet, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Israel's Iron Dome",
      "The Golden Dome idea first came to public light during Mr. Trump's joint address to Congress in March, when he asked for funding for it. He said, \"Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it, too.\"",
      "The president was referring to Israel's Iron Dome, which at least partially inspired the Golden Dome concept. Israel's system, installed in 2011 to defend against incoming projectiles, largely addresses shorter-range threats like rockets, while two other air defense systems work to defend against missiles.",
      "The Iron Dome, developed with U.S. backing, has intercepted thousands of rockets and has a success rate topping 90%, according to Israel.",
      "China responds",
      "Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said her country urges the U.S. \"to abandon the development and deployment of a global missile defense system as soon as possible.\"",
      "\"The United States, in pursuing a 'U.S.-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself,\" she said at a Wednesday briefing in Beijing, according to news agencies. \"This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability. China is seriously concerned about this.\"",
      "She also said the Golden Dome plan \"heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield\" and \"fuels an arms race.\"",
      "When asked about China's response in an interview on \"Fox & Friends First,\" Lockheed Martin's St. John said, \"What we've seen historically is that the thing that leads to conflict is the lack of deterrence, and so our belief, along with the administration, is that having strong deterrence is the best way to deter conflict.\"",
      "A U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessment shows that the U.S. military expects, over the coming decade, to contend with missile threats that are greater in \"scale and sophistication.\" It also said that \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses.\"",
      "China has been rapidly developing missile and other military capabilities, while deepening ties with Russia. The two nations said in a statement earlier this month that the dome project was \"deeply destabilizing in nature\" and would turn space into \"an arena for armed confrontation.\"",
      "Karako said that the Golden Dome initiative is \"a belated realignment of U.S. missile defense policy\" to counter both China and Russia, countries that the last two administrations in their national defense strategies have pointed to as strategic competitors.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Defense Department said Wednesday it has accepted a Boeing jet from Qatar that will be retrofitted and used to transport President Trump.",
      "Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth accepted the Boeing 747 \"in accordance with all federal rules and regulations.\"",
      "\"The Department of Defense will work to ensure proper security measures and functional-mission requirements are considered for an aircraft used to transport the President of the United States,\" Parnell said.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the Pentagon had accepted the jetliner from the government of Qatar.",
      "\"As directed by the Secretary of Defense, the Air Force is preparing to award a contract to modify a Boeing 747 aircraft for executive airlift. Details related to the contract are classified,\" a spokesperson for the Air Force said in a statement.",
      "Hegseth's acceptance of the plane comes days after sources confirmed to CBS News that the Qatari royal family would be donating aircraft for Mr. Trump's use. The gift was first reported by ABC News. Valued at $400 million, the jumbo jet will be donated to Mr. Trump's future presidential library just before he leaves office.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters last week that the Qataris are \"giving us a gift\" and lamented that the current plane used for Air Force One is nearly four decades old. When the president is aboard either of the two Boeing aircrafts that are part of the presidential air transport fleet, its call sign is \"Air Force One,\" according to the Air Force.",
      "\"If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Now I could be a stupid person and say, oh no, we don't want a free plane.\"",
      "The president has continued to defend the notion of receiving the plane from Qatar, writing on social media that the Boeing jet is being given to the Defense Department, and is a gift that will be used as a \"temporary Air Force One\" until new Boeing planes arrive.",
      "\"Why should our military, and therefore our taxpayers, be forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars when they can get it for FREE from a\u00a0 country that wants to reward us for a job well done. This big savings will be spent, instead, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country,\" he wrote last week.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also reiterated Monday that the plane is a donation to the nation and the Air Force.",
      "\"The government of Qatar, Qatari family, has offered to donate this plane to the United States Air Force, where that donation will be accepted according to all legal and ethical obligations,\" she said. \"It will be retrofitted to the highest of standards by the Department of Defense and the United States Air Force. This plane is not a personal donation or a gift to the president of the United States.\"",
      "Still, news of the gift raised concerns among members of Congress and questions of whether the transaction complied with federal ethics rules.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York sent a letter last week to three internal government watchdogs asking them to conduct an ethics review of the gift and issue an advisory opinion on whether it violates federal ethics regulations and the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which bars federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign nations.",
      "\"The American presidency is not a personal inheritance. It does not exist to enrich Donald Trump,\" he wrote. \"It belongs to 'We the People.' If we fail to draw the line here, there may soon be no line left to draw.\"",
      "Some Republicans, too, have expressed unease with the gift from the Qatari government. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said last week that there are \"lots of issues associated with that offer,\" which he said should be discussed further.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said that while he understands the need for a new Air Force One, \"I'd love to have a big, beautiful jet that's built in the United States of America.\" Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina warned \"everybody needs to know that Air Force One is not like every other Boeing.\"",
      "\"It's going to have to be put through a lot of paces and probably every square inch analyzed before I think the president should consider it as a primary means of transportation,\" he said.",
      "The secretary of the Air Force, Troy Meink, who was only confirmed last week, told Congress on Tuesday that the Air Force had already started looking into what modifications would be required to retrofit the jet.",
      "\"The secretary of defense has directed the Air Force to basically start planning to modify the aircraft. We are postured to do that,\" Meink told Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, who asked about the potential security concerns of such a transfer.",

    "summary": "A federal district judge ordered DOGE to turn over information to a government watchdog group that filed a FOIA request for its records.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to halt a lower court order that required the White House's Department of Government Efficiency to turn over information to a government watchdog group in a lawsuit that tests whether the task force is subject to the Freedom of Information Act.",
      "The request from Solicitor General D. John Sauer arose out of a public records request made by the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington that sought information about DOGE, its operations and personnel. The watchdog group went on to file a federal lawsuit based on that FOIA request, and, as part of the suit, sought categories of information through the discovery process about DOGE's activities since President Trump took office.",
      "Among the information CREW is seeking is a deposition with Amy Gleason, who the White House has said is the acting administrator of DOGE; a list of federal contracts or grants that DOGE personnel recommended for cancellation; and the names of all current and former DOGE employees, as well as details of their employment and who oversees them.",
      "The district court granted most of CREW's request for information, including to depose Gleason. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper found that DOGE is likely subject to FOIA and said that the task force's actions demonstrate that it has \"substantial authority over vast swathes of the federal government.\"",
      "\"Canceling any government contract would seem to require substantial authority \u2014 and canceling them on this scale certainly does. Again, USDS reportedly is leading the charge on these actions, not merely advising others to carry them out,\" Cooper wrote in a March decision.",
      "He noted that DOGE likely has some independent authority to terminate federal employees, programs and contracts.",
      "\"Doing any of those three things would appear to require substantial independent authority; to do all three surely does,\" Cooper said.",
      "The Trump administration asked the federal appeals court in Washington to halt the order, which it agreed to do temporarily. Then, last week, a panel of judges on the appeals court lifted its stay, which clears the way for DOGE to hand over the documents sought by CREW. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that the discovery ordered by the district court is \"narrow\" and appropriate.",
      "DOGE now has until June 3 to turn over documents, and Gleason's deposition must be completed by June 13.",
      "The dispute over the efforts to learn more about DOGE, its work and employees turns on whether the task force is subject to FOIA, the federal law that allows members of the public to request access to records and information from federal agencies. FOIA does not apply to Congress, the federal courts and entities within the Executive Office of the President.",
      "In the emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, Sauer argued that DOGE is a presidential advisory body housed within the Executive Office of the President tasked with providing recommendations to Mr. Trump and federal agencies on policy matters that are important to the president's agenda. Sauer said that as a result of those functions, DOGE is exempt from FOIA.",
      "Sauer claimed that the district court's order requiring DOGE to hand over information through the discovery process to determine if it is covered by FOIA turns the public records law \"on its head\" and violates the separation of powers by subjecting it to \"intrusive discovery.\"",
      "He warned that if it is allowed to stand, several components of the White House like the offices of the chief of staff, national security adviser, and other advisers to the president would be subject to FOIA.",
      "\"That untenable result would compromise the provision of candid, confidential advice to the president and disrupt the inner workings of the Executive Branch,\" Sauer wrote. \"Yet, in the decisions below, the court of appeals and district court treated a presidential advisory body as a potential 'agency' based on the persuasive force of its recommendations \u2014 threatening opening season for FOIA requests on the president's advisors.\"",
      "Mr. Trump established DOGE when he returned White House as part of an effort to shrink the size of the federal government. The president has repeatedly said that Elon Musk is the head of DOGE, though Justice Department lawyers have said in court filings that he is not an employee of the entity and \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "Questions about Musk's role with DOGE eventually led the White House to declare Gleason as its acting administrator. Gleason worked as a senior adviser to the U.S. Digital Service, the precursor to DOGE.",
      "Still, since its establishment, DOGE employees have fanned out across federal agencies to implement cost-cutting measures and were behind steep reductions in the federal workforce, as well as the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Many of DOGE's efforts, as well as Musk's role within the task force have been subject to legal challenges.",
      "The Supreme Court is currently weighing an emergency appeal involving DOGE's attempts to gain access to sensitive information kept by the Social Security Administration and was asked to intervene in a legal battle over reductions in force at 21 agencies.",

    "story": [
      "China said Wednesday that the Trump administration's plan to construct a so-called \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the U.S. from missile attacks carries \"strong offensive implications\" and will increase the risks of a global arms race and militarizing outer space. President Trump said Tuesday that his administration had \"officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system,\" and that a budget package currently being deliberated by Congress would provide an initial $25 billion in funding for the project.",
      "An unclassified assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency shows the military expects to be contending with missile threats that are greater in \"scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" noting specifically that \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses.\"",
      "\"North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability,\" the DIA assessment said, warning that already, \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\"",
      "But China, which has been deepening its ties with Russia while rapidly developing its missile and other military capabilities, including its nuclear weapons, accused the Trump administration of obsessing over U.S. defense at the risk of endangering global security.",
      "\"The United States, in pursuing a 'U.S.-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself. This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability. China is seriously concerned about this,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Wednesday during a regular briefing in Beijing, according to multiple international news agencies.",
      "The White House plan \"heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield, fuels an arms race, and undermines international security,\" she said. \"We urge the United States to abandon the development and deployment of a global missile defense system as soon as possible.\"",
      "The U.S. military has said for years that China and Russia are already deploying weapons in space, with reports suggesting everything from laser weapons to Chinese satellites with the ability to disable or even capture American satellites. Last year, the U.S. warned Russia against deploying a\u00a0nuclear-capable anti-satellite weapon that analysts believe could loiter in space for long periods of time before emitting a burst that would disable all satellites around it.",
      "In Russia's capital, meanwhile, the Kremlin said Wednesday that Mr. Trump's plans would require consultations between Moscow and Washington, but a spokesperson said it was largely a \"sovereign matter\" for the U.S.",
      "It was a softer stance than taken previously by the regime of President Vladimir Putin, which had recently published a statement saying the new American missile defense system would explicitly give Moscow an impetus \"for a significant strengthening of the arsenal for conducting combat operations in space.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, as he made his announcement, that he'd not yet spoken with Putin about his plans, but he said he would, \"at the right time.\"",
      "China and Russia, in a joint statement issued earlier in the month, called the Golden Dome project, \"deeply destabilizing in nature,\" and the two U.S. adversaries said it would turn space into \"an arena for armed confrontation.\"",

      "For seven minutes, Van Hollen criticized Rubio on his handling of issues ranging from the freezing of humanitarian assistance in Sudan during a genocide, deportations to El Salvador without due process and revoking student visas.",
      "\"You and I served together in Congress for 15 years,\" Van Hollen said. \"We didn't always agree, but I believe we shared some common values \u2014 a belief in defending democracy and human rights abroad and honoring the Constitution at home. That's why I voted to confirm you. I believed you would stand up for those principles. You haven't. You've done the opposite.\"",
      "Van Hollen continued, \"You used to speak with conviction about the importance of foreign aid as a tool to advance American values and interests. Then you stood by while Elon Musk took a chainsaw to USAID and other assistance programs.\"",
      "The senator said people have died as a result of the gutting of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. Earlier this year, Rubio said 83% of programs funded by the federal agency were being canceled after it became a target for the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Van Hollen also said that Rubio has \"made a mockery of our country's refugee process, turning it into a system of global apartheid where political ideology and race more than truth or need matter.\" The criticism was in reference to the Trump administration granting refugee status to White South Africans over claims that they have faced discrimination by the country's post-apartheid government.",
      "\"I have to tell you directly and personally that I regret voting for you as secretary of state,\" he said.",
      "Rubio said Van Hollen's regret \"confirms I'm doing a good job.\"",

      "\"The Supreme Court, in a 9-0 decision, instructed you to facilitate the return to the United States of Abrego Garcia, who the administration admitted was wrongfully deported to El Salvador,\" Sen Van Hollen said. \"Your response, you have openly flouted judicial orders.

      "In a criminal referral last year, a House panel on the COVID-19 pandemic alleged Cuomo was involved in drafting and editing a 2020 state report on nursing home deaths, but he testified to the committee in June 2024 that he was not involved. The referral claims Cuomo violated a law against making false statements to Congress.",
      "The Biden-era Justice Department did not act on the referral. But after President Trump returned to office, Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the House Oversight Committee, urged federal prosecutors to look into the case, alleging Cuomo was \"caught red-handed lying to Congress.\"",
      "\"Governor Cuomo testified truthfully to the best of his recollection about events from four years earlier, and he offered to address any follow-up questions from the Subcommittee \u2014 but from the beginning this was all transparently political,\" Azzopardi told CBS News.",

One of the department's top leaders said the charges had impeded Adams' ability to run for reelection or govern the city, and had made it harder for Adams to cooperate with the federal government on crime.",
      "Several members of the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office resigned in protest and accused the administration of a quid pro quo, effectively letting Adams off in exchange for his cooperation with the Trump administration's immigration enforcement. The Trump administration and Adams have denied any quid pro quo.",

    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought Tuesday to reassure farmers and one Republican senator about his upcoming report on how pesticides are driving up rates of childhood chronic diseases, acknowledging that chemicals like glyphosate that he has long criticized are widely used for growing crops in the U.S.",
      "\"I have said repeatedly throughout this process, that we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" Kennedy said at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\"",
      "The White House in February tasked Kennedy with leading a \"Make America Healthy Again Commission,\" which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children.",
      "Targets include the \"potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures\" in children. Kennedy said their report was due to be released Thursday.",
      "\"Your information about the report is just simply wrong,\" Kennedy told Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi in response to a question about the report. \"The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.\"",
      "Hyde-Smith had told Kennedy that she was \"deeply concerned\" that the report will \"unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools\" that U.S. farmers use.",
      "\"We all know what confirmation bias is. It's no secret that you were involved with pesticide litigation, prior to becoming secretary,\" Hyde-Smith told Kennedy.",
      "What has RFK Jr. said about pesticides like glyphosate?",
      "Kennedy has criticized the use of several pesticides in the U.S. food supply, including as an environmental attorney during court battles with chemical manufacturer Monsanto over accusations that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup \u2014 made from the chemical glyphosate \u2014 was causing cancer.",
      "\"If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luther. I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value,\" Kennedy wrote in a 2020 Facebook post.",
      "During his longshot independent presidential campaign, Kennedy pledged to get toxins out of the food supply, warning that \"toxic chemicals like glyphosate\" were widely contaminating what Americans were eating.",
      "He continued that criticism in the months ahead of the 2024 election as he stumped in support of President Trump, recalling how his son resolved his \"really agonizing\" eczema by switching to eating pasta made in Europe.",
      "\"As soon as he comes back here and he eats the pasta in this country, he gets eczema,\" he told Donald Trump Jr. on a podcast in September of last year. \"And you know, they don't have the glyphosate like we do, that is sprayed on the wheat at harvest time. So it's going right into the food.\"",
      "What will be in RFK Jr.'s \"MAHA Commission\" report?",
      "One of Kennedy's top HHS advisers, Calley Means \u2014 whose sister Dr. Casey Means was nominated by President Trump earlier this month for the surgeon general post \u2014 said that the report is aimed at outlining \"obvious\" ways that children are \"being poisoned through areas that there's not even that much scientific disagreement on.\"",
      "\"Obviously, it's because of environmental toxins,\" Means said, speaking at a May 15 event hosted by the Kennedy-aligned MAHA Institute. \"We produce and ingest 25% of the world's pesticides. The leading herbicides and pesticides that we use in the United States, many of them are phased out or banned in every other country in the world.\"",
      "Means said that the report was not intended to result in \"a European nanny state system\" to crack down on pesticides, pledging instead to come up with \"pro-innovation policies to solve this issue\" under Kennedy. He blasted lobbyists for opposing the report's release.",
      "Beyond \"environmental toxins\" like pesticides, Means listed a number of other issues he alleges are making American children sick, including ultra-processed foods, added sugars, seed oils, sedentary behavior, lack of sleep, overprescriptions and vaccines.",
      "\"They're saying it's going to scare the American people to get facts out. They're putting so much pressure on President Trump, so much pressure on Secretary Kennedy to not release facts,\" Means said last week.",
      "What power does RFK Jr. have over pesticides?",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services does not directly set the limits on how glyphosate and other pesticides are used. That is left up to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, HHS does oversee the major research that underpins how the EPA regulates chemicals.",
      "Studies into pesticides like glyphosate to inform the EPA's limits often come from the federal health agencies within HHS.",
      "For example, the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program published results in 2023 suggesting that glyphosate is \"unlikely\" to be genotoxic, which had been one of the main ways international experts previously suspected it might cause cancer.",
      "Results from a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in 2022 found that diet was likely a factor in how much glyphosate people were being exposed to, based on urine samples taken in adults and children.",
      "Through the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy also has authority over how glyphosate levels in food are tracked and the EPA's limits are enforced.",
      "The last round of published sampling by the FDA in 2022 found that 54 samples of human food had detectable amounts of glyphosate out of 731 analyzed. Corn and beans were among the most frequent detections.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday announced his administration has selected the architectural design for a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the United States from foreign threats.",
      "The president also said the budget package Republicans are currently ironing out on Capitol Hill will include an initial $25 billion to begin construction on the missile defense system. Mr. Trump said the project's total cost will be about $175 billion, although it could be much more. Congress hasn't yet funded any of the project, although Mr. Trump told reporters he thinks it'll be easy to fund on Capitol Hill.",
      "\"Today, I'm pleased to announce that we have officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system that will deploy next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors,\" the president announced in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "Mr. Trump said the project should be \"fully operational before the end of my term,\" which would be before January 2029. The president said the system will be built in states including Alaska, Florida, Georgia and Indiana, and involve multiple, yet-to-be-selected American defense and technology companies.",
      "Canada wants to be involved in the project, the president said, adding that the U.S. wants to help Canada as it can.",
      "\"Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" he said. \"And we will have the best system ever built.\"",
      "The president told reporters that he suggested a comprehensive new missile defense system to U.S. military leaders, and they agreed, not the other way around.",
      "\"I suggested it and they all said, 'We love the idea, sir.' That's the way it's gotta be, right? But they want it. And they wanted it badly once it was suggested.\"",
      "The president has for months expressed a desire for a defense system like Israel's. In his March joint address to Congress, the president requested funding for the system.",
      "\"I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome shield to protect our homeland,\" the president said in his address to Congress. \"All made in the USA. Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology wasn't there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually. And other places have it. Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it too.\"",
      "A new, unclassified assessment from the Pentagon's intelligence agency shows what threats the U.S. needs to defend itself from in the next decade.",
      "The Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, expects that missile threats to the U.S. will expand both in scale and sophistication, as the U.S. faces threats from foreign actors in the shape of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, two types of hypersonic weapons, land attack cruise missiles, and fractional orbital bombardment systems.",
      "Mr. Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" in the vein of Israel's Iron Dome, the country's mobile all-weather air defense system that has intercepted projectiles since its installation in 2011. However, Israel's Iron Dome largely defends against shorter-range threats, like rockets, while it has two other air defense systems to defend against missiles, which are increasingly being used in conflict.",
      "\"Missile threats to the U.S. homeland will expand in scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" the assessment says. \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses, but traditional ballistic missiles \u2014 which are guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight \u2014 will remain the primary threat to the homeland. North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability.\"",
      "The assessment warns that China, Iran and North Korea will have significantly more intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\" Although Iran doesn't currently have known ICBMs, the DIA assessment suggests it will have 60 by 2035. Keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear power has been a key goal of the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The assessment also warns that China's submarine-launched ballistic missiles will increase in number by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing adversary SLBMs.\" Russia, too, has submarine-launched ballistic missiles.",
      "Further, the assessment warns that both China and Russia will increase their boosted hypersonic weapons multiple times over by 2035. The report says that Russia and China can reach parts of the U.S. with these systems. The report also says China and Russia's land attack cruise missile capacity will significantly increase by 2035, and both countries have the potential to reach parts of the U.S.",
      "Finally, the report says both Russia and China are expected to have what's known as fractional orbital bombardment systems by 2035. These will be able to orbit the globe, traveling over the South Pole to avoid early detection.",

      "A new study casts doubt on a phenomenon that was previously believed to show water flowing on the surface of Mars.",
      "Since the 1970s, scientists have studied dark streaks seen on Mars' cliff sides and crater walls. The streaks tend to be hundreds of meters long. Some can last for a long time, while others are more short-lived. Those more short-lived slope streaks, called recurring slope lineae, or RSLS, tend to recur in the same areas from year to year, according to a news release announcing the study.",
      "Some scientists believe the streaks are proof of flowing water on the planet and could suggest the Red Planet is home to habitable environments. Others believe the streaks are caused by dry processes, like rock falls or wind gusts, and said the streaks only appear like liquid remnants because scientists are studying orbital images.",
      "Adomas Valantinas, a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University, and Valentin Bickel, a researcher at Switzerland's University of Bern, used machine learning to study the streaks. The process cataloged more than 86,00 high-resolution satellite images of the slope streaks and RSLs.

      "\"Once we had this global map, we could compare it to databases and catalogs of other things like temperature, wind speed, hydration, rock slide activity and other factors.\" Bickel said. \"Then we could look for correlations over hundreds of thousands of cases to better understand the conditions under which these features form.\"",
      "The analysis, published in Nature on Monday, found that the slope streaks were not \"generally associated with factors that suggest a liquid or frost origin,\" according to the news release. Such factors would include a specific orientation of slopes, high humidity or surface temperature fluctuations.",
      "What the study did find was that the slopes were more likely to form in places that had above-average wind speeds and dust deposition, likely pointing to a dry origin. The slope streaks were more often found near recent-impact craters and could be caused when shockwaves shake surface dust. RSLs are more common in areas with frequent rockfalls or dust devils.",
      "\"Our study reviewed these features but found no evidence of water. Our model favors dry formation processes,\" Valantinas said.",
      "The results of the study cast doubt on claims that slope streaks could be signs of habitable regions. That means that researchers could send rovers or other spacecraft to explore the areas without contaminating the sites.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 09:00:42 -0400",
    "summary": "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
    "story": [
      "Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023. Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place \u2014 with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Last week, Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly's Education Committee, called phones \"a cancer on our kids\" that are \"driving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\"",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\"This is a not just an academic bill,\" Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \"This is a mental health bill. It's a public safety bill.\"",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "Teachers and administrators have long known cellphones were major distractions in learning: A\u00a02023 Pew survey showed 72%\u00a0 of high school teachers\u00a0view cellphones as a major problem in their classrooms. And U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has\u00a0issued an advisory\u00a0on the effects of social media on youth mental health.",
      "Aside from academic benefits, cellphone restrictions can assist with social development and creating community at the school, Kim Whitman a parent-turned-advocate told CBS News last year. Whitman, a co-founder of Phone Free, said if schools \"allow phones to be present it's hard for students to connect and create a sense of belonging.\"",
      "More focus on bans throughout school day",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \"a huge win.\"",
      "\"Teachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \"bell-to-bell\" bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group's political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\"That's often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\" Hoffman said.",
      "Some states want districts to set rules",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "Opposition from some parents, students",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\"It was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\"It is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\" Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "Most states provide no funding for laws",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",
      "\"Providing some specific money for this would kind of ease some of those implementation challenges,\" Hoffman said. \"That said, most states have not.\"",

GOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio opposed the bill. House Freedom Caucus chairman Andy Harris of Maryland voted present.",

      "\"This one big beautiful bill is the most consequential legislation that any, any party has passed, certainly under a majority this thin,\" the speaker said.",
      "All Democrats opposed the package. And after House Democrats threw up procedural roadblocks overnight to delay a vote on the measure, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries railed against the bill in a speech from the House floor early Thursday, calling it a \"reckless, regressive and reprehensible GOP tax scam.\"",
      "\"This is one big, ugly bill that House Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of the American people under the cover of darkness,\" Jeffries said.",
      "The New York Democrat, alluding to the midterm elections next year, warned that \"this day might very well turn out to be the day that House Republicans lost control of the United States House of Representatives.\"",
      "The vote comes after right-wing holdouts met Wednesday afternoon with Mr. Trump and Johnson at the White House. After the meeting, Johnson huddled with other members of the Republican conference to brief them on the changes while House Freedom Caucus members met separately.",
      "Before the White House meeting Wednesday, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he wasn't optimistic the bill could pass this week, though he was \"pretty confident\" it could be passed within 10 days.",
      "But other budget hardliners said after the meeting that negotiations were headed in the right direction.",
      "During a visit to the Capitol Tuesday, Mr. Trump pressured Republicans to fall in line behind the legislation \u2014 which House GOP leaders have named \"The Big, Beautiful Bill\" \u2014 and suggested that those who don't could face primary challenges.",
      "In a statement of administrative policy issued Wednesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget urged House Republicans to pass the measure, saying it \"reflects the shared priorities of both Congress and the Administration,\" adding, \"failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "The details of the updated version of the legislation came together in the final hours before the vote.",
      "Johnson also negotiated with Republicans from blue states over a provision on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The moderates advocated for an increase to the SALT cap, currently set at $10,000, but argued that the $30,000 cap outlined in the package remained too low. An agreement was reached to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000, according to the managers amendment.",
      "The vote marks a key victory for Johnson, after days of shepherding his conference through difficult disagreement over the legislation. But even with the victory, the legislation is expected to face resistance in the Senate \u2014 where numerous Republicans have said they'll seek changes to the bill.",
      "Johnson met with Senate Republicans to discuss the budget process Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Wednesday that the speaker would \"like to see as little change to the product as possible, because they cobble together a very delicate balance over there.\" But Thune said \"the Senate will have its imprint on it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump met Wednesday with key conservative holdouts to the massive budget package containing his second-term agenda, before GOP leaders made concessions to fiscal hawks and blue-state Republicans \u2014 as leadership aims to hold a vote on the bill possibly within hours.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, returned from the meeting between Mr. Trump and members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, calling it \"productive.\" Johnson said the plan is still to move forward as expected, with the details of the final version of the legislation unveiled later Wednesday.",
      "\"There's not much changing here, because the underlying product we thought was so well done,\" Johnson told reporters ahead of its release.",
      "Timing for a floor vote remained in flux. Johnson had said the vote could happen Wednesday night or Thursday morning. And House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said he expected the vote would take place Wednesday night.",
      "\"We've got to keep the bill moving,\" Scalise said. \"Because there's a lot more steps in the process. The Senate, of course, has to go and do their work.\"",
      "Before the legislation could move to the floor, it had to make it through the Rules Committee, which advanced the measure late Wednesday after a nearly 21-hour session. The committee began meeting shortly after 1 a.m. early Wednesday morning, and continued meeting late into the night Wednesday. Eighteen hours after the committee began meeting, House Republican leadership unveiled a \"manager's amendment,\" which included highly anticipated changes to the legislation that had been negotiated in recent days.",
      "The developments on Wednesday came after Mr. Trump also met Tuesday morning with House Republicans as leaders ramped up their efforts to push the bill forward.",
      "The president put pressure on members to fall in line Tuesday as the party's dueling factions threatened to upend the plan with demands that will be difficult to reconcile. When he arrived on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump suggested that any GOP member who doesn't back what he and Republicans have deemed the \"big, beautiful bill\" would be \"knocked out so fast,\" a warning to a handful of \"grandstanders.\"",
      "\"It's the biggest bill ever passed, and we've got to get it done,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Johnson can only afford three defections in a floor vote, if all members are present and voting, given his slim majority. All Democrats are expected to oppose it.",
      "\"I would say that if the vote were held right now, it dies a painful death,\" Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee said Tuesday evening.",
      "But a day later, on Wednesday evening, Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota expressed confidence in the outcome: \"I believe we'll have the votes.\"",
      "Rules committee meets overnight \u2014 as conservatives push for more spending cuts",
      "When the Rules Committee began meeting early Wednesday, Democrats chastised Republicans over the timing.",
      "\"If you guys think this ugly bill is so damn beautiful, like Trump keeps saying, you should have the courage to debate it in primetime,\" Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, said.",
      "Republicans, however, rejected the request to adjourn the meeting until daylight hours. And the committee's chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, said the Rules Committee \"has a long tradition of meeting late into the evening and reporting legislation long after most of America has gone to bed.\"",
      "The committee's rare overnight meeting took place as Republican leadership races to pass the budget package before its self-imposed Memorial Day deadline.",
      "Johnson has been meeting with the different factions in recent days to hear the demands and build a consensus around a modified version of the legislation that was produced by nearly a dozen House committees.",
      "More conservative members, who are upset that that bill does not make steep enough spending cuts to significantly bring down the deficit, have pushed for Medicaid work requirements to kick in much sooner than a 2029 deadline. They also want to eliminate all the clean energy subsidies that were implemented under the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by former President Joe Biden.",
      "After right-wing opposition appeared to remain firm overnight, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Wednesday morning the White House offered a proposal that would enable these holdouts to back the budget bill, if it were to be included in the package.",
      "\"I don't think it can be done today,\" Harris said. \"I think that there is a pathway forward that we can see.\"",
      "Within the manager's amendment released late Wednesday was a provision that would move up the timeline for Medicaid work requirements to kick in from the beginning of 2029 to the end of 2026, while also phasing out some of the clean energy subsidies earlier than previously outlined in the package.",
      "Conservatives have also been pushing to change the rate by which the federal government pays states for Medicaid, a point of contention with moderates, who have warned against larger cuts to the program.",
      "Johnson reiterated earlier this week that the change has \"been off the table for quite some time,\" however. And Mr. Trump said ahead of the meeting Tuesday morning that \"we're not doing anything cutting of anything meaningful,\" adding that on Medicaid, \"the only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "Before the manager's amendment's release, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the original version of the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. And a new preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office found it would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion.",
      "SALT conflict may be resolved",
      "Right-wing Republicans weren't the only ones with objections to the legislation, though. Blue-state Republicans opposed a provision on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and they threatened to withhold their votes unless their demands were met.",
      "Prior to the SALT deduction cap, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits\u00a0wealthy homeowners\u00a0in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But others also pointed out that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Republicans who represent blue states balked at the $30,000 cap outlined in the package and reached an agreement to further increase it to $40,000. The manager's amendment included a provision that increases the SALT deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said Wednesday night that with the increase he believed all those opposed to that provision were now on board.",
      "Mr. Trump weighed in on the SALT issue Tuesday, suggesting that he opposes raising the cap because he claimed Democratic governors from states like New York, Illinois and California would benefit, calling them the \"biggest\" beneficiaries. But after the group of moderates met with the speaker Tuesday evening, Johnson indicated that they had \"found a point of compromise.\"",
      "According to a senior White House official, Mr. Trump told the House GOP conference during the meeting that they should not let division over the SALT cap get in the way of the bill, and said they should not touch Medicaid, except for addressing waste, fraud and abuse, along with cutting benefits for noncitizens and imposing work requirements. The official said Mr. Trump also made clear he wants every Republican to vote \"yes\" on the bill, while saying he's losing patience with the remaining holdouts.",

      "The administration has not publicly disclosed the whereabouts of the flight, which a federal judge on Wednesday said \"unquestionably\" violated a court ruling blocking deportations to third countries without allowing detainees to contest their removal.",
      "Top Department of Homeland Security officials said the eight men were in the U.S. illegally and hailed from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam. The department shared case information indicating all the would-be deportees had criminal convictions, including for homicide, attempted murder, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery.",
      "In a statement Wednesday evening, DHS released the names of the eight men. They were identified as Dian Peter Domach of South Sudan, Enrique Arias-Hierro of Cuba, Jose Manuel Rodriguez-Quinones of Cuba, Thongxay Nilakout of Laos, Jesus Munoz-Gutierrez of Mexico, Kyaw Mya of Myanmar, Nyo Myint of Myanmar and Tuan Thanh Phan of Vietnam.",
      "On Tuesday, immigration lawyers told the federal district court in Massachusetts that at least two men from Myanmar and Vietnam were likely being deported to South Sudan, saying the reported deportation flight would violate an order by federal judge Brian Murphy that blocked deportations to third countries unless detainees were provided certain due process rights.",
      "During a briefing in Washington on Wednesday to discuss a migrant flight to South Sudan, top DHS officials confirmed a deportation flight had left Texas on Tuesday, saying the eight detainees from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam were being transported as part of \"a diplomatic and military security operation.\"",

      "Following an emergency motion by the lawyers who alerted him of the potential deportation flight to South Sudan, Murphy, the federal judge in Massachusetts, ordered the Trump administration late Tuesday to retain \"custody and control\" of the would-be deportees.",
      "In a written order Wednesday, the judge also ordered the government to give six deportees \"reasonable fear\" interviews, which usually assess whether a migrant is legally entitled to stay in the U.S. because of a risk of persecution or torture. If they express a fear that falls short of that standard, they must get at least 15 days to \"reopen immigration proceedings to challenge the potential third-party removal,\" the judge said.",
      "The Trump administration was also ordered to provide status reports every seven days, and to maintain custody over the deportees.",
      "On Wednesday, top DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the eight men who had been placed on the deportation flight that departed Texas remained in U.S. custody.",
      "McLaughlin also sharply criticized Murphy's ruling. \"It is absolutely absurd for a district judge to try and dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States of America,\" McLaughlin said, accusing Murphy of \"trying to force\" officials to bring back dangerous individuals to the U.S.",
      "During a hearing Wednesday, a Justice Department lawyer told Murphy the flight in question had landed somewhere and also confirmed the men remained in U.S. custody but said the current location of the flight could only be discussed in private, out of earshot of the press.",
      "The Justice Department said the situation was dangerous for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees on the flight because of the severity of the detainees' criminal records.",
      "After a private conversation with both parties, Murphy said that the government's attempted deportations \"are unquestionably violative of this court's order.\" He noted that the detainees were put on the deportation flight less than 24 hours after being told they would be deported to South Sudan.",
      "\"I don't see how anybody could say that these individuals had a meaningful opportunity to object\" to their removal, Murphy said. \"They did not offer any opportunity to object.\" Murphy noted the detainees were put on a deportation flight less than a day after being told they would be deported to South Sudan.",
      "The Justice Department attorneys arguing the case said Murphy's orders in the case were \"not specific enough,\" which gave rise to \"misunderstanding.\"",
      "Murphy did not rule out holding the Trump administration in contempt of court for violating his order, but said that issue would be \"left for another day.\"",

      "A cause of death was not immediately given, but the team said Irsay died \"peacefully in his sleep\" on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Irsay, the son of former Baltimore Colts owner Robert Irsay, spent much of his young life around the team, including serving as a ball boy during games.",
      "\"Some of Jim's fondest memories came from his youth working training camps in Baltimore and growing relationships with players, coaches, and staff whom he considered his extended family,\" the Colts said. \"He worked in every department before he was named the youngest general manager in team history in 1984 when the Colts arrived in Indianapolis.\"",
      "That move from Baltimore to Indianapolis, carried out suddenly by Robert Irsay in March 1984 to avoid having the team be seized by the city of Baltimore, would remain a lingering sore spot for former fans in Maryland.",
      "\"Jim's love and appreciation for the NFL in addition to its history, tradition, and principles influenced him to become a steward of the game throughout his 50-plus years in the League,\" the team said.",
      "Jim Irsay took over sole ownership of the team after his father's death in 1997. Under his leadership, the team drafted Peyton Manning No. 1 overall in 1998. Widely considered one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play the game, he helped deliver the Indianapolis Colts their first and thus far only Super Bowl title in 2006.",

He was subsequently suspended by the NFL for six games and fined $500,000.",

One was to fix an issue that affected his left leg, quadriceps and back that stemmed from a fall in his bathroom that impacted his nerves, leading to lingering numbness, CBS affiliate WTTV reported. He then had surgery in mid-May to take care of a serious hematoma, according to WTTV.",

He relied frequently on the lessons he learned from rubbing elbows with some of the game's most important owners \u2014 Al Davis, Lamar Hunt, Wellington Mara and Art Rooney \u2014 as they worked through the 1982 players' strike and the implementation of a salary cap.",
      "And he presided over the greatest quarter-century of Colts football thanks to Manning, quarterback Andrew Luck, Hall of Fame general manager Bill Polian and Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy.",
      "Irsay handled everything from ticket sales to public relations as he rose through the organization even watching No. 1 overall pick John Elway force a trade to Denver in 1983.",
      "When he took over as owner following his father's death in 1997, things were different. The arrival of Manning helped Irsay \u2014 and the Colts \u2014 create a passionate local following that hadn't previously existed but still remains strong today.",
      "It wasn't always easy, either. When a 55% inheritance tax threatened his hold on the team, the younger Irsay found enough cash to keep the family business. And when his most prominent players were about to cash in during free agency, Irsay often ponied up top dollar to keep them.",
      "But football was only part of Irsay's story.",
      "He spent millions buying the original manuscripts to Jack Kerouac's generation-defining novel \"On The Road\" and Alcoholics Anonymous' \"Big Book\" and routinely made them available to the public.",
      "His ever-expanding musical collection included instruments and items from The Beatles, James Brown, Prince, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Elton John, Johnny Cash and Jerry Garcia; signed Presidential documents; an original \"wanted\" poster for John Wilkes Booth; a 1953 Jackie Robinson bat; Muhammad Ali's title belt from the 1974 \"Rumble in the Jungle;\" even the saddle from Secretariat's triple crown wins.",
      "Irsay also befriended singers such as Stephen Stills and John Mellencamp, took inspiration from the lyrics of Bob Dylan and revered the writings of Hunter S. Thompson, the self-described \"Gonzo journalist.\"",
      "\"It's a lot of fun to have these pieces, and guitars are always kind of the most interesting, in some ways, because you can play them, unlike a book, a manuscript or a painting,\" Irsay said during the summer of 2016. \"You can play them, and they can become four-dimensional.\"",
      "But Irsay also had his struggles.",
      "He was a recovering alcoholic and his professional successes couldn't insulate him from a constant battle with painkillers. In a November 2023 interview with HBO Sports, he acknowledged he had been to rehab at least 15 times and once accidentally overdosed.",
      "The low point may have come in March 2014 when he was arrested near his home in Carmel while driving erratically. When officers searched the car, they found nearly $30,000 in cash and numerous bottles of prescription pills. Five and a half months later, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle while intoxicated, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Irsay for six games and fined him $500,000.",
      "Irsay described the absence as heartbreaking.",
      "\"I couldn't even imagine how hard that was,\" former Colts punter and now talk-show host Pat McAfee said after the suspension ended. \"You're talking about a guy who's been around the Colts his entire life, who personifies the Horseshoe.\"",
      "Still, he was wise enough to allow Polian almost free rein to construct a team that won a then-record number of regular-season games in a decade (115).",
      "Aside from the images of Irsay wearing a tie wrapped around his forehead on a magazine cover, tossing footballs in a suit, or his utterances on Twitter, he was a shrewd businessman with a big heart.",
      "When the Colts won the Super Bowl, he even sent a ring to two-time rushing champ Edgerrin James, who had left in free agency before the championship season.",
      "\"The guy grew up with this team,\" then-coach Chuck Pagano said in January 2015. \"He's got so much insight and so much knowledge. He's a football man through and through. It runs through his veins and he's got so much wisdom to share with all of us. He makes a huge impact.\"",

      "According to the American Trucking Association, the industry is currently facing a shortage of about 60,000 drivers.",
      "With each mile, the 48-year-old Badilla is filling a critical need and mapping out a future he never thought he'd have.",
      "\"I have an opportunity to do something positive for my life,\" Badilla told CBS News. \"It feels great to be free.\"",
      "Freedom is especially meaningful to Badilla, who spent nearly a decade in federal prison for selling drugs from a housing project in New York City's Queens borough.",
      "\"The FBI agent had his gun pointed to my face,\" Badilla said of his arrest. \"...I didn't see the daylight for the next nine years.\"",
      "While in prison, Badilla earned his GED diploma. And while getting out of prison may have been the end of his sentence, it was the beginning of a different kind of struggle.",
      "\"When you come out of prison, you feel like all the doors are locked,\" Badilla said. \"Nobody wants to give you a job.\"",
      "Nationwide, six out of every 10 formerly incarcerated people are still jobless four years after getting out of prison, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Close to 70% will end up back in prison, according to numbers from the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, a problem called recidivism.",
      "Badilla said that while in prison, seeing \"a lot\" of ex-felons who were rearrested \"also helped me wake up.\"",
      "Following his release, Badilla entered the Commercial Driver's License Workforce Development Program, a pilot program that is a partnership between the New York City's Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice, and Emerge Career, a tech company, that trains formerly incarcerated people who are considered low-risk for trucking jobs. It helps them get a commercial driver's license and connects them with trucking companies in states across the U.S.",

      "Logan said the trucking industry provides a promising on-ramp to the labor market while filling a critical need in the American supply chain.",
      "\"We looked at what was lucrative and accessible to people who are coming back from incarceration,\" Logan said. \"We don't have enough people who are skilled, and it's a very skilled profession...It gave [the formerly incarcerated] a really big opportunity to be part of the communities that they knew they did harm to.\"",
      "While the program may raise eyebrows for some New Yorkers who are skeptical of how their taxpayer dollars are being spent, Logan pointed to the impact of giving formerly incarcerated people a second chance to help drive the economy in their communities.",
      "\"If I have you incarcerated on Rikers, I have to pay for [the] facility, the officers, the food,\" she said. \"Whereas, when I take a person and give them opportunity, they pay taxes. So now, we as a society are getting taxpayer revenue from a person that is not in a box on a shelf.\"",
      "Emerge Career co-founder Uzoma \"Zo\" Orchingwa said the program is rooted in the belief that people coming out of prison are often undervalued and underestimated.",
      "\"Our people are just looking for someone that believes in them and someone that can give them a legit chance,\" Orchingwa told CBS News. \"These are people that \u2014 for the most part \u2014 have not had a fair shot for being able to be successful and contributing citizens. They just need that one opportunity that's going to support them.\"",
      "In the 2024 fiscal year, 94% of participants in the training program graduated, according to data provided by Emerge Career. All of those graduates received job offers with an average starting salary of $75,000 per year, the company said.",
      "Since the trucking program launched, 260 formerly incarcerated people have completed it.",
      "Orchingwa emphasized that the training program provides its participants with more than just a paycheck, but a sense of purpose.",

      "St. Louis' emergency management chief has been placed on administrative leave, the city's mayor said, after sirens meant to sound during a tornado warning failed to be activated ahead of Friday's deadly twister.",
      "Sarah Russell, commissioner of the City Emergency Management Agency in St. Louis, will remain on paid administrative leave as an external investigation proceeds into what went wrong.",
      "St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer already ordered an internal probe in the immediate aftermath of the siren failure, when National Weather Service radar indicated that a tornado touched down between 2:30 and 2:50 p.m. local time. It initially struck near central St. Louis before ripping through the area, with officials estimating some 5,000 people were affected.",
      "Five people in St. Louis were killed in the severe weather, officials said. Spencer described it as \"one of the worst storms \u2014 absolutely.\"",
      "There is a system of 60 outdoor sirens stationed around St. Louis, which are meant to be activated once the National Weather Service issues a tornado warning for the area as it did on Friday. There are two places where they can be activated: the CEMA office and the Fire Department.",
      "According to Spencer's office, which announced Russell's leave Tuesday, the commissioner was attending an offsite workshop with other emergency management staff when the tornado warning came down, and that prevented them from activating the sirens from their agency's main building, about a half mile away.",
      "Russell instead contacted the Fire Department to activate the sirens, but the directive was ambiguous, the mayor said. Her office released the recording of Russell's call to the department, in which she confirms they are aware of the NWS warning and briefly clarifies the timing of it before saying, \"OK, you got the sirens?\" The person at the fire department replies \"Yes, ma'am,\" and the call ends.",
      "\"The direction was not clear,\" Spencer said at a news conference Wednesday morning about the phone call. Russel did not clearly direct the person at the Fire Department to press the button to activate the sirens, she said, adding, \"It's my understanding that the button was not pushed.\"",
      "However, even if someone had pressed the button at the Fire Department, city officials learned Tuesday that the button was not working.",
      "\"Work to repair the button began Tuesday afternoon and is expected to be completed within days,\" Spencer's office said.",
      "The button at the CEMA office was functioning, and Fire Department personnel will be stationed there 24/7 to activate the sirens if needed, the office said.",
      "Spencer also signed an executive order Tuesday to change the siren activation protocol, putting the Fire Department solely in charge of activating the warning system. While the standard operating procedure for activating the sirens says the primary activation point is located at the Fire Department headquarters, the de facto protocol had been that CEMA would activate the system at its office and contact the Fire Department if it could not.",
      "\"With the mayor's executive order, this lack of clarity has now been eliminated,\" Spencer's office said.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department said it will bring an end to investigations launched during the Biden administration after the deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department said Wednesday that it is starting the process of dismissing lawsuits against police departments in Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, bringing an end to investigations launched during former President Joe Biden's administration. It will also put an end to proposed accountability agreements with the departments.",
      "The Trump administration said the consent decrees proposed by the Biden administration sought to subject the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments to sweeping terms that went beyond accusations of unconstitutional conduct and would have led to \"years of micromanagement\" of local departments.",
      "The federal involvement began following the deaths of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police and Breonna Taylor in a Louisville police shooting in 2020.",
      "\"Overbroad police consent decrees divest local control of policing from communities where it belongs, turning that power over to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, often with an anti-police agenda,\" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. \"Today, we are ending the Biden Civil Rights Division's failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments with factually unjustified consent decrees.\"",
      "In addition to taking steps to dismiss the lawsuits against the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments, the Trump administration also said it is closing investigations into police departments in Phoenix; Trenton, New Jersey; Memphis; Mount Vernon, New York; Oklahoma City and the Louisiana State Police. The Trump administration said it is retracting the Biden administration's findings of unconstitutional violations by all of the eight named departments, and is looking into potentially dismissing over a dozen other consent decrees across the country.",
      "The Justice Department's decision to drop the lawsuits against the Louisville and Minneapolis departments comes just days before the five-year mark since Floyd's death. Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was convicted in state court\u00a0on murder and manslaughter charges for Floyd's killing and went on to plead guilty in a federal civil rights case.",
      "In a filing with the federal court in Minnesota in the case against the city of Minneapolis, Justice Department lawyers said that the government \"will no longer prosecute this matter.\"",
      "\"After an extensive review by current Department of Justice and Civil Rights Division leadership, the United States no longer believes that the proposed consent decree would be in the public interest,\" the filing, signed by Dhillon and others, reads.",
      "Consent decrees were used in federal investigations of law enforcement agencies during the Obama administration as part of a renewed commitment to civil rights issues and accountability in policing. But the Justice Department during the first Trump administration restricted their use. That policy was rescinded during the Biden administration. Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland subsequently opened the investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department.",
      "Dhillon, the assistant attorney general, told reporters that consent decrees often set \"unrealistic, idealistic expectations that are simply a recipe for non-compliance and perpetual consent decree hell for jurisdictions.\" But she said if there was a \"case of widespread, systemic racist or otherwise excessive-force situations happening despite training, despite litigation, despite local law enforcement taking these issues on,\" consent decrees \"might be an appropriate vehicle.\"",
      "\"Theoretically, we are not ruling it out,\" she added.",
      "The yearslong examination by the Justice Department into the Minneapolis Police Department was launched in 2021, in the wake of Floyd's death, and found that the Minneapolis Police Department disproportionately targeted Black and Native American people in law enforcement activity and used unjustified force in many instances.",
      "The probe was undertaken to determine whether the department engaged in a \"pattern or practice\" of unconstitutional or unlawful policing. That civil investigation was separate from a federal criminal probe into Floyd's death, which led to convictions of three Minneapolis police officers who were found to have failed to step in to stop Chauvin's use of force against Floyd.",
      "Investigators had recommended nearly 30 remedial measures and improvements for Minneapolis to implement to combat racial disparities and excessive use of force by the department, such as enhanced training and accountability measures, and improved data collection of police activity.",
      "The city of Minneapolis and the Justice Department had entered into an agreement in principle to reach a court-authorized consent decree, which would have formalized the federal findings and recommendations, and appointed an independent monitor for the police department.",
      "The Minneapolis City Council and Mayor Jacob Frey approved the terms of a court-enforceable consent decree in early January, which had to be approved by a federal judge before taking effect. The city has begun implementing the reforms laid out in the agreement and said it will continue to do so despite the Trump administration's decision to dismiss the consent decree case.",
      "\"We're doing it anyway,\" Frey said in a statement. \"We will implement every reform outlined in the consent decree\u2014because accountability isn't optional. Our independent monitor has lauded the meaningful progress we've made under the state settlement agreement, and the public can count on clear, measurable proof that our reforms are moving forward.\"",
      "As for the Louisville Police Department, the Justice Department's investigation found that it, too, likely engaged in a pattern of conduct that violated citizens' civil and constitutional rights. The Justice Department, city of Louisville and its police department reached an agreement in principle toward a consent decree.",
      "Four Louisville Metro Police Department officers faced federal charges in connection with Taylor's death in March 2020. Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was shot when officers stormed into her apartment while she was asleep with her boyfriend. Her boyfriend, who thought the officers were intruders, fired a handgun as they entered. The officers in response fired 22 shots into the apartment, and one struck Taylor in the chest.",
      "But in announcing the decision to dismiss the lawsuits against the Minneapolis and Louisville police departments, the Justice Department under President Trump claimed they accused the agencies of engaging in patterns of unconstitutional policing by \"wrongly equating statistical disparities with intentional discrimination and heavily relying on flawed methodologies and incomplete data.\"",
      "The Trump administration also said the consent decrees went too far and would have subjected the police departments to sweeping oversight.",
      "\"In short, these sweeping consent decrees would have imposed years of micromanagement of local police departments by federal courts and expensive independent monitors, and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of compliance costs, without a legally or factually adequate basis for doing so,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Dhillon said the agreements cost an average of $10 million a year and \"should be a rare exception and not the norm.\" She said \"specifics of policing, policy, hiring, training, management, promotion and internal policies are best made at a local level, where there's local accountability, and local control over funding and policy issues.\"",
      "Both Minneapolis and Louisville either already have consent decrees at the state level or are hiring their own monitors and taking actions on their own to ensure constitutional policing, Dhillon said, adding that the cities should save money thanks to the Justice Department's decision.",
      "\"You can actually use that money, tens of millions of dollars, to hire more cops for your communities that will keep you safer than a partner at a big law firm in D.C. getting paid to monitor you,\" Dhillon said.",

    "summary": "President Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who pushed back on claims about White genocide in South Africa.",
    "story": [
      "Differences between President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa came to a head Wednesday afternoon in a tense exchange in the Oval Office, as Mr. Trump confronted him over whether White genocide is taking place in South Africa.",
      "Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa met for a critical conversation \u2014 with South African-born billionaire Elon Musk in the room \u2014 amid tensions between the U.S. and South Africa, after the U.S.\u00a0accepted\u00a059 White Afrikaners last week and granted them status as refugees.",
      "At one point in the meeting, Ramaphosa took a question intended for Mr. Trump about what it would take to persuade him that White genocide is not occurring in South Africa.",
      "\"It will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends, like those who are here,\" responded Ramaphosa, who brought South African golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen and billionaire businessman Johann Rupert with him to the White House. \"When we have talks between us at a quiet table, it will take President Trump to listen to them. I will not be repeating what I've been saying.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded that there are \"thousands of stories\" and \"documentaries\" about the situation in South Africa, before directing his staff to dim the lights in the Oval Office and play a video for everyone in the room about allegations of violence against White South Africans.",
      "The president said white crosses seen in the video showed burial sites of White farmers. In fact, they were part of a\u00a0protest, filmed near Normandien, South Africa, on Sept. 5, 2020, after the killing of Glen and Vida Rafferty, a White farming couple. Participants\u00a0said\u00a0the demonstration aimed to draw attention to all farm murders in the region, not solely those involving White farmers. Elon Musk previously shared the same video on X, posting it on\u00a0March 8\u00a0and\u00a0May 13\u00a0with the claim that the crosses represented White farmers.",
      "The video also included footage of a crowd at a rally being led in a chant against White farmers. After the video concluded, Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa went back and forth about the situation.",
      "Ramaphosa said he hadn't seen the videos the president's staff played and said the videos do not represent government policy. He said he and his party are \"completely opposed\" to the language used in the footage.",
      "\"We have dead White people, dead White farmers, mostly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Others in the South African delegation who accompanied Ramaphosa told Mr. Trump the issue is not White genocide in South Africa, but rather, crime in general, affecting South Africans across demographics. Ramaphosa, too, pushed back.",
      "\"There is criminality in our country,\" he said. \"People who do get killed unfortunately through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people.\"",
      "The Trump-Ramaphosa meeting, in which reporters were allowed in the room for over an hour, is yet another instance of the U.S. president inviting the media to witness and broadcast testy exchanges with other world leaders, instead of keeping those discussions behind closed doors.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said White farmers in South Africa have been targets of \"genocide\" \u2014 an allegation South Africa and Ramaphosa have rejected \u2014 and insists South Africa is \"out of control,\" echoing Musk. In the meeting Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"Elon wanted\" the Afrikaners to be allowed into the U.S. as refugees. During the time reporters were in the Oval Office for the meeting, Musk said nothing.",
      "The beginning of the Oval Office meeting was smoother. Mr. Trump called it a \"great honor\" to be with the South African president, who, he said \"is certainly in some circles, really respected, other circles, a little bit less respected, like all of us, in all fairness.\"",
      "\"We are essentially here to reset the relationship between the United States and South Africa,\" Ramaphosa said in his opening comments.",
      "Asked by a reporter why the government is letting White Afrikaners into the U.S. while denying entry to other refugees, the president began by lambasting the news outlet that asked the question.",
      "\"We've had tremendous complaints about Africa, about other countries too, from people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They said there's a lot of very bad things going on in Africa, and that's what we're going to be discussing today.\"",
      "\"We have many people that feel they're being persecuted,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "The expedited process for the Afrikaners comes as the Trump administration is working to suspend the refugee admission program, drawing multiple court challenges.",
      "In a tense exchange during a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday on budget matters, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio if the Afrikaners are more persecuted than the Uyghurs or Rohingyas, or dissidents in Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua, or than those who would be threatened by the Taliban, should they return to Afghanistan.",
      "Kaine suggested the Trump administration is giving preference to Afrikaners due to the color of their skin, and asked Rubio why the U.S. should prioritize Afrikaners. Rubio said the Afrikaners are a \"small subset.\"",
      "\"It's a new issue,\" Rubio said. \"And the president identified it as a problem and wanted to use it as an example. But that's different from having these refugee programs that were basically spending money to put people up in communities and accommodate them, and it was acting as a magnet.\"",
      "\"Let me challenge you, and I'm just going to say for the public, if you want to understand about the quote, persecution, of Afrikaner farmers, go look at the composition of the South African government,\" Kaine responded. \"Since July of 2024, there's a government of national unity. And the opposition party today \u2014 the ANC \u2014 the Afrikaner Party, the Democracy Alliance, is part of the governing coalition. They joined the governing coalition a year ago, and the leader of that party was given the remit of Agriculture Minister Jan Steenhuisen, and he is the leader of the former Afrikaner party, still widely representing Afrikaners. He is the minister of agriculture in South Africa right now. I assert that this claim that there's persecution of Afrikaner farmers is completely specious.\"",

    "story": [
      "Less than two weeks until the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season, Federal Emergency Management Agency acting Administrator David Richardson has rescinded the agency's strategic plan, a comprehensive policy document that outlines the disaster relief agency's priorities.",
      "In a short memo sent to FEMA employees on Wednesday and obtained by CBS News, Richardson wrote, \"The 2022-2026 FEMA Strategic Plan is hereby rescinded. The Strategic Plan contains goals and objectives that bear no connection to FEMA accomplishing its mission. This summer, a new 2026-2030 strategy will be developed. The strategy will tie directly to FEMA executing its Mission Essential Tasks.\"",
      "The memo authored by Richardson was brief \u2014 the new agency head now requires that all FEMA memos to, from or for his office be no longer than one page in length, according to multiple current FEMA employees.",
      "FEMA did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for comment.",
      "Wired was the first to report that the plan had been rescinded.",

      "\"Without it, there are just a bunch of offices doing whatever they feel like doing,\" the official said.",
      "The strategic plan, which was published in December 2021 under former administrator Deanne Criswell, was set to expire in 2026. The plan no longer appears on FEMA's website.",
      "Criswell, in a news release at the time the plan was published, laid out three main goals for the agency: \"Instill Equity as a Foundation of Emergency Management,\" \"Lead Whole of Community in Climate Resilience\" and \"Promote and Sustain a Ready FEMA and Prepared Nation.\"",
      "The official told CBS News Richardson is now trying to figure out how to operate FEMA so that it does nothing more or less than what the law requires. Part of that includes nixing the agency's Office of Resilience Strategy.",
      "\"That office exists to figure out how to maximize efficacy of publicly spent money on projects that build a resilient infrastructure that can withstand disaster events,\" the official said. \"Without that guiding star, FEMA will operate as triage instead of actually trying to mitigate future damage before it happens.\"",
      "The official compared the removal of the ORS to people relying solely on emergency rooms for health care rather than also getting preventative care.",
      "\"A primary care physician would've been able to tell you that you have a disease that makes your blood not clot properly. Pulling the Office of Resilience Strategy out of the equation means that you'll bleed out and die from a paper cut because nobody was around to tell you that your life was at risk in the first place,\" the said.",
      "The move to rescind the strategic plan comes a little over a week after an internal agency presentation featured a slide that noted, \"As FEMA transforms to a smaller footprint, the intent for this hurricane season is not well understood, thus FEMA is not ready.\"",
      "A Department of Homeland Security official told CBS News in response that FEMA is \"fully activated in preparation for Hurricane Season,\" and described the assessment as \"one line in a nineteen-page slide deck and the unsubstantiated opinion of one official inside the agency.\"",
      "The presentation also cited \"culture issues,\" staffing shortages and problems coordinating with other federal agencies among the issues it was contending with.",
      "President Trump, who has been critical of how the agency responded to past disasters, has suggested transforming it into a \"support agency\" that largely defers to the states or\u00a0scrapping FEMA\u00a0entirely.",
      "Richardson has been FEMA's acting administrator for less than two weeks, replacing the agency's former acting head, Cameron Hamilton, who was fired by the Trump administration after he told lawmakers he doesn't believe eliminating FEMA is in the country's \"best interests.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday struck down regulations requiring most U.S. employers to provide workers with time off and other accommodations for abortions.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge David Joseph of the Western District of Louisiana was a victory for conservative lawmakers and religious groups who decried the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's decision to include abortion among pregnancy-related conditions in regulations on how to implement the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed in December 2022.",
      "The EEOC's decision swiftly prompted several lawsuits and eroded what had been strong bipartisan support for the law designed to strengthen the rights of pregnant workers.",
      "Joseph, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, ruled that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion in its regulations. His ruling came in two consolidated lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic University and two Catholic dioceses.",
      "Joseph sided with the plaintiffs' argument that if Congress had intended for abortion to be covered by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, \"It would have spoken clearly when enacting the statute, particularly given the enormous social, religious, and political importance of the abortion issue in our nation at this time.\"",
      "Mississippi and Louisiana have near-total bans on abortion, except to save the life of the pregnant person or in cases of a rape that has been reported to law enforcement in Mississippi, and when there is a substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient in continuing the pregnancy and in cases where the fetus has a fatal abnormality in Louisiana.",
      "Bipartisan support for pregnant workers law",
      "The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act passed with widespread bipartisan support after a decade-long campaign by women's right advocates, who hailed it as a win for low-wage pregnant workers who have routinely been denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job.",
      "The federal law applies to employers with 15 or more employees.",
      "While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibits employers from firing pregnant workers, the law did little to guarantee that women would receive accommodations they might need at work. As a result, many women were forced to keep working under unsafe conditions, or were forced to take unpaid leave by employers who refused to accommodate their needs.",
      "But many Republican lawmakers, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who co-sponsored the bill, were furious when the EEOC stated that the law covered abortions. The EEOC's commissioners approved the rules in a 3-2 vote along party lines, with both Republican commissioners voting against it.",
      "Joseph vacated the provision of the EEOC regulations that included abortion as a \"related medical condition\" of pregnancy and childbirth. However, the rest of the regulations still stand.",
      "\"Victory! A federal court has granted Louisiana's request to strike down an EEOC rule requiring employers to accommodate employees' purely elective abortions. This is a win for Louisiana and for life!\" Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement e-mailed to The Associated Press.",
      "A Better Balance, the advocacy group that spearheaded a decade-long campaign for passage of the law, condemned the ruling.",
      "\"This court's decision to deny workers reasonable accommodations for abortion-related needs is part of a broader attack on women's rights and reproductive freedom,\" A Better Balance President Inimai Chettiar said in a statement.",
      "EEOC adrift",
      "Wednesday's ruling comes as the Trump administration has moved to impose tumultuous changes at the EEOC that will almost certainly lead the agency to eventually rewrite the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act regulations.",
      "President Trump fired two of the EEOC's democratic commissioners before their terms ended, paving the way for him to establish a Republican majority and make major policy changes on how to interpret and enforce the nation's workplace civil rights laws.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump's move left EEOC without the quorum needed to make key decisions, including rescinding or revising regulations. The president tapped an assistant U.S. attorney in Florida, Brittany Panuccio, to fill one of the vacancies. If she confirmed by the Senate, the EEOC will regain its quorum.",
      "Acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, who voted against the regulations because of the abortion provision, has said she will work to change them.",
      "Similar lawsuits challenging the abortion provision are underway, including one filed by 17 states, led by Tennessee and Arkansas. In February, an appeals court ruled that lawsuit could proceed, overturning a lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the Justice Department had defended the EEOC against those lawsuits but it is unclear whether it will continue to do so under the Trump administration. The Justice Department did not reply to request for comment on Wednesday's ruling.",
      "Chettiar said the Trump administration is unlikely to appeal the ruling, adding to its significance.",
      "\"The impact of this is huge,\" Chettiar said in an interview with The Associated Press, calling the decision \"symbolic and a big signal of where the right is when it comes to the rights of women.\"",

    "summary": "The FDA is requiring COVID vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna to update their warnings about the possible risk of myocarditis and pericarditis.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is telling Pfizer and Moderna to expand the warning labels on their COVID-19 vaccines about the risk of a possible heart injury side effect linked to the mRNA shots, primarily in teen boys and young men, citing findings from a study published last year and new agency data.",
      "Orders to expand the warnings were posted Wednesday by the FDA, in letters dated April 17 to Pfizer and BioNTech about their Comirnaty vaccine and Moderna about its Spikevax vaccine.",
      "Both vaccines previously carried warnings about how the risk of the heart side effects \u2014 which doctors call myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) \u2014 looked to be higher in young men, generally within the first week after vaccination. While the earlier labels specified ages 18 to 24 years old for Moderna's vaccine and 12 to 17 years old for Pfizer's, the new warning will apply to males ages 16 to 25 for both vaccines.",
      "\"Following administration of the 2023-2024 Formula of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the highest estimated incidence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" the FDA says in the new blanket warning it will require for both vaccines.",
      "The rate of myocarditis and pericarditis was around 8 cases per million doses for children and adults under 65 years old after use of that season's vaccines, the FDA says.",
      "The new warnings ordered by the FDA add that the \"highest estimated incidence was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" with a rate of 38 cases per million.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has previously described rates of myocarditis and pericarditis as rare after COVID-19 vaccination.",
      "CDC officials told the agency's vaccine advisers last month that acute myocarditis \"tends to resolve quickly\" after vaccination, and no increased risk had been seen in data from recent seasons in people 12 to 39 years old.",
      "It is unclear whether Pfizer or Moderna disputed the order. They had \"within 30 calendar days of the date of this letter\" to try to rebut the demand. Spokespeople for Moderna and Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"Americans deserve radical transparency around the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines and the FDA is delivering on their promise to do just that. Moderna and Pfizer should take steps to ensure that individuals are aware of COVID vaccine-related adverse events resulting in myocarditis and pericarditis,\" Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the\u00a0Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News in an email. Nixon did not explain why the letters were posted more than a month after they were written.",
      "They appeared on the FDA's website hours ahead of a hearing organized by the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on \"how health officials downplayed and hid myocarditis and other adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccines.\"",
      "Aaron Siri, an attorney who worked closely with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the past to call on the FDA to pull COVID-19 and other vaccines and vet nominees during the transition, is among the witnesses.",
      "The FDA says the warnings were spurred by new data from the agency's safety surveillance system and results published in October from scientists following up with people who developed COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis.",
      "Talks about this kind of safety labeling change began before the ouster of the FDA's previous top vaccines official, Dr. Peter Marks, multiple people familiar with the situation said, but had not yet been finalized as officials wrestled with how to accurately present the findings. Marks left the FDA on April 5.",
      "Scientists in that study followed up with people who had faced chest pain and elevated amounts of troponin in their blood, a protein that usually signals some kind of heart damage. They were predominantly young adolescent males.",
      "\"While their clinical course was nearly always mild with a low prevalence and extent of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury was common,\" the scientists wrote in the study, which was co-authored by FDA officials.",
      "Similar to what the study described, the FDA's new warning also says that the heart MRI findings showed \"improvement over time in most people.\"",
      "\"It is not known if these heart MRI findings might predict long-term heart effects of myocarditis. Studies are underway to find out if there are long-term heart effects in people who have had myocarditis after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine,\" the FDA said.",

    "summary": "President Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system like Israel's Iron Dome.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday announced his administration has selected the architectural design for a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the United States from foreign threats.",
      "The president also said the budget package Republicans are currently ironing out on Capitol Hill will include an initial $25 billion to begin construction on the missile defense system. Mr. Trump said the project's total cost will be about $175 billion, although it could be much more. Congress hasn't yet funded any of the project, although Mr. Trump told reporters he thinks it'll be easy to fund on Capitol Hill.",
      "\"Today, I'm pleased to announce that we have officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system that will deploy next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors,\" the president announced in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "Mr. Trump said the project should be \"fully operational before the end of my term,\" which would be before January 2029. The president said the system will be built in states including Alaska, Florida, Georgia and Indiana, and involve multiple, yet-to-be-selected American defense and technology companies.",
      "Canada wants to be involved in the project, the president said, adding that the U.S. wants to help Canada as it can.",
      "\"Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" he said. \"And we will have the best system ever built.\"",
      "The president told reporters that he suggested a comprehensive new missile defense system to U.S. military leaders, and they agreed, not the other way around.",
      "\"I suggested it and they all said, 'We love the idea, sir.' That's the way it's gotta be, right? But they want it. And they wanted it badly once it was suggested.\"",
      "The president has for months expressed a desire for a defense system like Israel's. In his March joint address to Congress, the president requested funding for the system.",
      "\"I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome shield to protect our homeland,\" the president said in his address to Congress. \"All made in the USA. Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology wasn't there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually. And other places have it. Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it too.\"",
      "A new, unclassified assessment from the Pentagon's intelligence agency shows what threats the U.S. needs to defend itself from in the next decade.",
      "The Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, expects that missile threats to the U.S. will expand both in scale and sophistication, as the U.S. faces threats from foreign actors in the shape of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, two types of hypersonic weapons, land attack cruise missiles, and fractional orbital bombardment systems.",
      "Mr. Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" in the vein of Israel's Iron Dome, the country's mobile all-weather air defense system that has intercepted projectiles since its installation in 2011. However, Israel's Iron Dome largely defends against shorter-range threats, like rockets, while it has two other air defense systems to defend against missiles, which are increasingly being used in conflict.",
      "\"Missile threats to the U.S. homeland will expand in scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" the assessment says. \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses, but traditional ballistic missiles \u2014 which are guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight \u2014 will remain the primary threat to the homeland. North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability.\"",
      "The assessment warns that China, Iran and North Korea will have significantly more intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\" Although Iran doesn't currently have known ICBMs, the DIA assessment suggests it will have 60 by 2035. Keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear power has been a key goal of the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The assessment also warns that China's submarine-launched ballistic missiles will increase in number by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing adversary SLBMs.\" Russia, too, has submarine-launched ballistic missiles.",
      "Further, the assessment warns that both China and Russia will increase their boosted hypersonic weapons multiple times over by 2035. The report says that Russia and China can reach parts of the U.S. with these systems. The report also says China and Russia's land attack cruise missile capacity will significantly increase by 2035, and both countries have the potential to reach parts of the U.S.",
      "Finally, the report says both Russia and China are expected to have what's known as fractional orbital bombardment systems by 2035. These will be able to orbit the globe, traveling over the South Pole to avoid early detection.",

    "story": [
      "Refugee admissions to the United States have all but ground to a halt \u2014 except for one group, or a \"small subset,\" as Secretary of State Marco Rubio called them on Tuesday: Afrikaners. They are members of the White ethnic minority that once led South Africa's brutal, four-decade apartheid regime, which ended in 1994 with the election of Nelson Mandela as president.",
      "The Trump administration has already welcomed the first group of Afrikaner asylum applicants, who were given expedited refugee status after claiming they were the victims of violence and discrimination in South Africa.",
      "Other Afrikaners are waiting, keen to take advantage of the offer of special treatment from the Trump administration to gain protected status and the right to live and work in the U.S.",
      "Those hopefuls have been meeting to share information on the process, including Dolf Grobler, who has already applied. The professional hunter told CBS News he has $2.5 million to help make America great again.",
      "\"I'm worried that the genocide, which is currently mainly focused on White farmers, is going to spread,\" he said. The claim of a White genocide is one that President Trump's adviser Elon Musk, whose family are Afrikaners, has backed.",
      "Musk joined Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday as the U.S. leader hosted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa for an official visit. The Afrikaner refugee program was a topic of discussion, along with trade and other matters. In the Oval Office meeting, Ramaphosa pushed back against Mr. Trump's repeated claims of Whites being targeted.",
      "\"Those people in many cases, are being executed, being executed, and they happen to be White, and most happen to be farmers,\" Mr. Trump said, calling the situation \"sort of the opposite of apartheid.\"",
      "\"People who do get killed, unfortunately, through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people,\" Ramaphosa said.",
      "According to South African police, in the last three months of 2024, 12 people were murdered on farms there; one was a White farmer, while the others were Black laborers or security workers.  Asked if he believed life for him and his family was better under apartheid \u2014 an overtly racist minority-rule system that denied equal rights to South Africa's vast majority Black population \u2014 Grobler didn't hesitate.",
      "\"Yes,\" he told CBS News. \"I can't say in my heart that we are better off now.\" Although he did concede apartheid was wrong.",
      "Claims of a White genocide are often circulated by right-wing groups, but the view is not held widely within the Afrikaner community.",
      "Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp, an academic at North-West University in South Africa, says the claims are simply untrue.",
      "\"There's no sign of it, never has been. In fact, Whites are economically the strongest group\" in South Africa, Croucamp told CBS News. \"64% of all boardrooms in South Africa are still White. The average incomes of White South Africans are vastly higher than Black South Africans ... they have better schools, they have better education, private health care. This is the land of milk and honey if you're White.\"",
      "Croucamp suspects the South African government's strong stance against Israel's actions in Gaza, and its relations with China, could have played some part in Mr. Trump's decision to embrace the controversial amnesty program for Afrikaners, but he believes there's more to it.",
      "\"In South Africa, right-wing groups, so-called civil society groups, we know that they have access to the Trump administration because they claim that. And just over the last few days, they have, several times, they said that they will speak to the American government, as if they have access to them. And if you listen to what Trump has said, it corresponds exactly with the genocide narrative that they sell and that they market,\" Croucamp said. \"So, I'm afraid I have to believe them when they say they have direct access to the Trump administration, and we see what Trump has been doing.\"",
      "Grilled about the refugee program Tuesday on Capitol Hill, in a testy exchange with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Secretary of State Rubio insisted that U.S. foreign policy \"doesn't require even-handedness, it involves prioritizing the interests of the United States. ... The United States has a right to pick and choose who they allow into the United States.\"",
      "White South Africans make up only about 7% of the country's population, but they still own more than half of all its farmland. And while the country has a staggeringly high crime rate, racial motives are not generally a factor, according to Afrikaner cattle farmer Nick Serfontein.",
      "He acknowledged that violent attacks on farmers do occur, especially in agricultural land near big cities, where there are often large, impoverished populations, but he said overall, \"I feel safe. I sleep with my doors open here on the farm.\"",
      "There have also been allegations that White farmers are the victims of land expropriation, with the government seizing farms without providing compensation. In January, Ramaphosa signed into law measures to expropriate mostly unused land for public use,  which his government said was necessary to address the consequences of decades of apartheid. While the law provides for fair compensation in most cases, it also allows for expropriation without compensation under limited  circumstances. And any measures can be challenged in court.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that it unfairly targets White landowners, though the law does not mention the race of anyone who could be affected under the legislation.",
      "And more importantly, there hasn't been a single case of expropriation without compensation documented in the 31 years since apartheid ended.",
      "Serfontein argues the problem isn't a deliberate effort by the government to seize White-owned land without compensation, but rather \"because of a dysfunctional government. The model is wrong.\"",
      "He said that for decades, land has been handed over to a Black population with compensation for former owners under established rules, but without any support for the new owners. So, almost a decade ago, Serfontein helped to launch a project aimed at training new Black farmers to work the land.",
      "To date, he says he's personally helped train more than 700 young Black farmers \u2014 the country's next generation of agricultural workers.",
      "\"I'm extremely positive, and so are the young people, the young farmers, they are positive,\" he said.",
      "As for a white genocide, he agreed with Croucamp, saying bluntly: \"It's not happening.\"",
      "Serfontein said he didn't know the histories of the Afrikaners who had already left for the U.S., and he didn't doubt they \"probably had some unhappy experiences in South Africa, about a number of things. But let me tell you that if you went to NAMPO last week \u2014 NAMPO is the biggest agricultural show in the Southern Hemisphere \u2014 you would have found a vibe there between the farmers, young farmers, old farmers, Black farmers, White farmers, that you've never experienced before. They are so excited about the future of South Africa.\"",

      "Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa met for a critical conversation \u2014 with South African-born billionaire Elon Musk in the room \u2014 amid tensions between the U.S. and South Africa, after the U.S.\u00a0accepted\u00a059 White Afrikaners last week and granted them status as refugees.",
      "At one point in the meeting, Ramaphosa took a question intended for Mr. Trump about what it would take to persuade him that White genocide is not occurring in South Africa.",
      "\"It will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends, like those who are here,\" responded Ramaphosa, who brought South African golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen and billionaire businessman Johann Rupert with him to the White House. \"When we have talks between us at a quiet table, it will take President Trump to listen to them. I will not be repeating what I've been saying.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded that there are \"thousands of stories\" and \"documentaries\" about the situation in South Africa, before directing his staff to dim the lights in the Oval Office and play a video for everyone in the room about allegations of violence against White South Africans.",
      "The president said white crosses seen in the video showed burial sites of White farmers. In fact, they were part of a\u00a0protest, filmed near Normandien, South Africa, on Sept. 5, 2020, after the killing of Glen and Vida Rafferty, a White farming couple. Participants\u00a0said\u00a0the demonstration aimed to draw attention to all farm murders in the region, not solely those involving White farmers. Elon Musk previously shared the same video on X, posting it on\u00a0March 8\u00a0and\u00a0May 13\u00a0with the claim that the crosses represented White farmers.",
      "The video also included footage of a crowd at a rally being led in a chant against White farmers. After the video concluded, Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa went back and forth about the situation.",
      "Ramaphosa said he hadn't seen the videos the president's staff played and said the videos do not represent government policy. He said he and his party are \"completely opposed\" to the language used in the footage.",
      "\"We have dead White people, dead White farmers, mostly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Others in the South African delegation who accompanied Ramaphosa told Mr. Trump the issue is not White genocide in South Africa, but rather, crime in general, affecting South Africans across demographics. Ramaphosa, too, pushed back.",
      "\"There is criminality in our country,\" he said. \"People who do get killed unfortunately through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people.\"",
      "The Trump-Ramaphosa meeting, in which reporters were allowed in the room for over an hour, is yet another instance of the U.S. president inviting the media to witness and broadcast testy exchanges with other world leaders, instead of keeping those discussions behind closed doors.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said White farmers in South Africa have been targets of \"genocide\" \u2014 an allegation South Africa and Ramaphosa have rejected \u2014 and insists South Africa is \"out of control,\" echoing Musk. In the meeting Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"Elon wanted\" the Afrikaners to be allowed into the U.S. as refugees. During the time reporters were in the Oval Office for the meeting, Musk said nothing.",
      "The beginning of the Oval Office meeting was smoother. Mr. Trump called it a \"great honor\" to be with the South African president, who, he said \"is certainly in some circles, really respected, other circles, a little bit less respected, like all of us, in all fairness.\"",
      "\"We are essentially here to reset the relationship between the United States and South Africa,\" Ramaphosa said in his opening comments.",
      "Asked by a reporter why the government is letting White Afrikaners into the U.S. while denying entry to other refugees, the president began by lambasting the news outlet that asked the question.",
      "\"We've had tremendous complaints about Africa, about other countries too, from people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They said there's a lot of very bad things going on in Africa, and that's what we're going to be discussing today.\"",
      "\"We have many people that feel they're being persecuted,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "The expedited process for the Afrikaners comes as the Trump administration is working to suspend the refugee admission program, drawing multiple court challenges.",
      "In a tense exchange during a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday on budget matters, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio if the Afrikaners are more persecuted than the Uyghurs or Rohingyas, or dissidents in Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua, or than those who would be threatened by the Taliban, should they return to Afghanistan.",
      "Kaine suggested the Trump administration is giving preference to Afrikaners due to the color of their skin, and asked Rubio why the U.S. should prioritize Afrikaners. Rubio said the Afrikaners are a \"small subset.\"",
      "\"It's a new issue,\" Rubio said. \"And the president identified it as a problem and wanted to use it as an example. But that's different from having these refugee programs that were basically spending money to put people up in communities and accommodate them, and it was acting as a magnet.\"",
      "\"Let me challenge you, and I'm just going to say for the public, if you want to understand about the quote, persecution, of Afrikaner farmers, go look at the composition of the South African government,\" Kaine responded. \"Since July of 2024, there's a government of national unity. And the opposition party today \u2014 the ANC \u2014 the Afrikaner Party, the Democracy Alliance, is part of the governing coalition. They joined the governing coalition a year ago, and the leader of that party was given the remit of Agriculture Minister Jan Steenhuisen, and he is the leader of the former Afrikaner party, still widely representing Afrikaners. He is the minister of agriculture in South Africa right now. I assert that this claim that there's persecution of Afrikaner farmers is completely specious.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Defense Department said Wednesday it has accepted a Boeing jet from Qatar that will be retrofitted and used to transport President Trump.",
      "Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth accepted the Boeing 747 \"in accordance with all federal rules and regulations.\"",
      "\"The Department of Defense will work to ensure proper security measures and functional-mission requirements are considered for an aircraft used to transport the President of the United States,\" Parnell said.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the Pentagon had accepted the jetliner from the government of Qatar.",
      "\"As directed by the Secretary of Defense, the Air Force is preparing to award a contract to modify a Boeing 747 aircraft for executive airlift. Details related to the contract are classified,\" a spokesperson for the Air Force said in a statement.",
      "Hegseth's acceptance of the plane comes days after sources confirmed to CBS News that the Qatari royal family would be donating aircraft for Mr. Trump's use. The gift was first reported by ABC News. Valued at $400 million, the jumbo jet will be donated to Mr. Trump's future presidential library just before he leaves office.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters last week that the Qataris are \"giving us a gift\" and lamented that the current plane used for Air Force One is nearly four decades old. When the president is aboard either of the two Boeing aircrafts that are part of the presidential air transport fleet, its call sign is \"Air Force One,\" according to the Air Force.",
      "\"If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Now I could be a stupid person and say, oh no, we don't want a free plane.\"",
      "The president has continued to defend the notion of receiving the plane from Qatar, writing on social media that the Boeing jet is being given to the Defense Department, and is a gift that will be used as a \"temporary Air Force One\" until new Boeing planes arrive.",
      "\"Why should our military, and therefore our taxpayers, be forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars when they can get it for FREE from a\u00a0 country that wants to reward us for a job well done. This big savings will be spent, instead, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country,\" he wrote last week.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also reiterated Monday that the plane is a donation to the nation and the Air Force.",
      "\"The government of Qatar, Qatari family, has offered to donate this plane to the United States Air Force, where that donation will be accepted according to all legal and ethical obligations,\" she said. \"It will be retrofitted to the highest of standards by the Department of Defense and the United States Air Force. This plane is not a personal donation or a gift to the president of the United States.\"",
      "Still, news of the gift raised concerns among members of Congress and questions of whether the transaction complied with federal ethics rules.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York sent a letter last week to three internal government watchdogs asking them to conduct an ethics review of the gift and issue an advisory opinion on whether it violates federal ethics regulations and the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which bars federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign nations.",
      "\"The American presidency is not a personal inheritance. It does not exist to enrich Donald Trump,\" he wrote. \"It belongs to 'We the People.' If we fail to draw the line here, there may soon be no line left to draw.\"",
      "Some Republicans, too, have expressed unease with the gift from the Qatari government. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said last week that there are \"lots of issues associated with that offer,\" which he said should be discussed further.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said that while he understands the need for a new Air Force One, \"I'd love to have a big, beautiful jet that's built in the United States of America.\" Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina warned \"everybody needs to know that Air Force One is not like every other Boeing.\"",
      "\"It's going to have to be put through a lot of paces and probably every square inch analyzed before I think the president should consider it as a primary means of transportation,\" he said.",
      "The secretary of the Air Force, Troy Meink, who was only confirmed last week, told Congress on Tuesday that the Air Force had already started looking into what modifications would be required to retrofit the jet.",
      "\"The secretary of defense has directed the Air Force to basically start planning to modify the aircraft. We are postured to do that,\" Meink told Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, who asked about the potential security concerns of such a transfer.",
      "Meink said turning any civilian aircraft to Air Force One standards \"will take significant modifications.\"",

      "A pro-Russian former politician from Ukraine was fatally shot Wednesday morning outside his children's school in the Spanish capital Madrid, according to the Reuters news agency and multiple Spanish outlets. Andriy Portnov was killed outside the American School of Madrid by an unidentified gunman or gunmen, according to the reports.",
      "\"Several persons shot him in the back and the head and then fled toward a forested area,\" Reuters quoted an unnamed source at the Spanish Interior Ministry as saying.",
      "There was no immediate confirmation of the slain man's identity by Spain's National Police or other authorities, and no indication of a motive or any suspects who might have been identified. Witnesses told Spanish media that at least one possible suspect was seen running into a nearby wooded area.",
      "According to Spain's El Diario newspaper, citing witnesses, Portnov was shot right after dropping off his children at the American School. Photos from the scene showed a man's body lying motionless on the ground behind a Mercedes sedan.",
      "Portnov was a senior aid to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich, a pro-Russian leader who was ousted during the Euromaidan Revolution in 2014. That ouster brought Ukraine's current, Western-backed government to power, and it infuriated Russia, which launched its first, initial invasion of Ukrainian territory that same year, quickly culminating in the unilateral annexation of Crimea.",
      "Portnov was a lawyer, and his political opponents in Ukraine had accused him of helping build a legal framework to enable the former government in Kyiv to crack down on protesters during the 2014 pro-democracy uprising.",
      "Portnov continued living in Ukraine after the 2014 revolution, despite his close ties with the Yanukovich administration, until he left the country in 2022, according to the Radio Freedom Ukraine network.",
      "In 2021, Portnov was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department under the Magnitsky Act, an American law designed to target foreign individuals implicated in corruption and human rights abuses.",
      "The U.S. government accused him of having \"cultivated extensive connections to Ukraine's judicial and law enforcement apparatus through bribery,\" and said he had been \"credibly accused of using his influence to buy access and decisions in Ukraine's courts and undermining reform efforts.\"",

    "summary": "Trump's plans to build a \"Golden Dome\" U.S. missile defense system undermine \"global strategic balance and stability,\" and should be abandoned, China says.",
    "story": [
      "China said Wednesday that the Trump administration's plan to construct a so-called \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the U.S. from missile attacks carries \"strong offensive implications\" and will increase the risks of a global arms race and militarizing outer space. President Trump said Tuesday that his administration had \"officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system,\" and that a budget package currently being deliberated by Congress would provide an initial $25 billion in funding for the project.",
      "An unclassified assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency shows the military expects to be contending with missile threats that are greater in \"scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" noting specifically that \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses.\"",
      "\"North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability,\" the DIA assessment said, warning that already, \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\"",
      "But China, which has been deepening its ties with Russia while rapidly developing its missile and other military capabilities, including its nuclear weapons, accused the Trump administration of obsessing over U.S. defense at the risk of endangering global security.",
      "\"The United States, in pursuing a 'U.S.-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself. This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability. China is seriously concerned about this,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Wednesday during a regular briefing in Beijing, according to multiple international news agencies.",
      "The White House plan \"heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield, fuels an arms race, and undermines international security,\" she said. \"We urge the United States to abandon the development and deployment of a global missile defense system as soon as possible.\"",
      "The U.S. military has said for years that China and Russia are already deploying weapons in space, with reports suggesting everything from laser weapons to Chinese satellites with the ability to disable or even capture American satellites. Last year, the U.S. warned Russia against deploying a\u00a0nuclear-capable anti-satellite weapon that analysts believe could loiter in space for long periods of time before emitting a burst that would disable all satellites around it.",
      "In Russia's capital, meanwhile, the Kremlin said Wednesday that Mr. Trump's plans would require consultations between Moscow and Washington, but a spokesperson said it was largely a \"sovereign matter\" for the U.S.",
      "It was a softer stance than taken previously by the regime of President Vladimir Putin, which had recently published a statement saying the new American missile defense system would explicitly give Moscow an impetus \"for a significant strengthening of the arsenal for conducting combat operations in space.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, as he made his announcement, that he'd not yet spoken with Putin about his plans, but he said he would, \"at the right time.\"",
      "China and Russia, in a joint statement issued earlier in the month, called the Golden Dome project, \"deeply destabilizing in nature,\" and the two U.S. adversaries said it would turn space into \"an arena for armed confrontation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV called Wednesday for sufficient humanitarian aid to be allowed into war-ravaged Gaza, where humanitarian agencies say a total blockade has sparked critical food and medicine shortages. Israel has, under massive pressure from the U.S. and other allies, started to allow more aid into Gaza this week, but it has not eased its military operations, and aid agencies say the amount of humanitarian goods entering the strip is nowhere near enough to meet the urgent needs of a battered civilian population.",
      "The United Nations announced Monday that it had been cleared to send in aid for the first time since Israel imposed a total blockade on March 2, sparking severe shortages of food and medicine.",
      "\"The situation in the Gaza Strip is worrying and painful,\" the pope said during his first weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square. \"I renew my heartfelt appeal to allow the entry of sufficient humanitarian aid and to put an end to the hostilities, the heartbreaking price of which is paid by children, the elderly, the sick.\"",
      "Leo, who was elected on May 8 to be the Catholic Church's first U.S. pope, has made peace an early theme of his papacy, calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "The Israeli army has stepped up its offensive in Gaza in recent days, with the enclave's Hamas-run Ministry of Health saying some 600 people have been killed over the last week alone. Israel says both the restrictions on aid and the stepped-up military campaign are aimed at pressuring Hamas \u2014 long designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israel \u2014 to release the remaining 58 hostages held in Gaza and to accept a ceasefire on Israeli terms.",
      "Israel has vowed to carry on with its war until the hostages, about 20 of whom are believed to be alive, are free, Hamas is defeated and disarmed and its leaders are sent into exile. The war was sparked by the Hamas-led, Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, which killed some 1,200 people and saw 251 taken as hostages into Gaza.",
      "The health ministry, which does not differentiate between combatant and civilian casualties, says more than 53,500 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory war, many of them women and children.",
      "Charity calls Israeli easing of Gaza blockade \"a smokescreen\"",
      "The amount of aid Israel has started to allow into war-ravaged Gaza is not nearly enough and is \"a smokescreen to pretend the siege is over,\" the MSF aid group said Wednesday.",
      "\"The Israeli authorities' decision to allow a ridiculously inadequate amount of aid into Gaza after months of an air-tight siege signals their intention to avoid the accusation of starving people in Gaza, while in fact keeping them barely surviving,\" said Pascale Coissard, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) emergency coordinator in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. \"The current authorization for 100 [trucks] per day, when the situation is so dire, is woefully inadequate.\"",
      "\"Meanwhile, evacuation orders are continuing to uproot the population, while Israeli forces are still subjecting health facilities to intensive attacks,\" Coissard said.",
      "Israel said 93 trucks had entered Gaza from Israel on Tuesday, but the United Nations said the aid had been held up.",
      "Asked Tuesday about Israel's latest moves, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters in Washington that the Trump administration had been \"pleased to see that aid is starting to flow in again.'",
      "\"I understand your point that it's not in sufficient amounts,\" he told a journalist. \"But we were pleased to see that decision was made. I understand another 100 trucks are behind that and maybe more in the next few days.\"",
      "Rubio said the U.S. was working with the U.N.'s World Food Program \"to walk through some of the ideas and plans they had for distribution\" of aid inside Gaza, but he stressed that in the administration's view, \"ultimately the answer here is for this [war] to end, hopefully with the elimination of Hamas, because the people of Gaza deserve a more prosperous, peaceful future, which they will never have as long as Hamas exists.\"",

    "story": [
      "A soaring death toll in the Gaza Strip and an increasingly vocal outcry over near-famine conditions in the Palestinian territory are piling pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a negotiated ceasefire with Hamas and drop his country's near-total blockade of the enclave. Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry said Tuesday that at least 87 people were killed by Israeli military strikes over the last 24 hours alone.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces have ramped up operations in Gaza over the last week, killing hundreds of people, many of them women and children, in what Netanyahu's government insists is legitimate self-defense and aimed entirely at securing the return of 58 hostages still held by Hamas and its allies in Gaza, and destroying the group. Israel blames Hamas \u2014 long designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and the European Union \u2014 for all casualties in Gaza, accusing the group of operating in and around civilian infrastructure.",
      "On Monday, for the first time in two and a half months, Netanyahu permitted a handful of trucks carrying aid to enter Gaza. He said he had been pressured into easing the total blockade by allies who could not tolerate \"images of mass famine.\"",
      "There were unconfirmed reports on Tuesday that as many as 100 trucks had been allowed to cross the Gaza border. But the United Nations' World Food Program said this week that a few trucks would be just a drop in the bucket given the vast and urgent need for food in Gaza, where more than 2 million Palestinians have been trapped for more than two years of blistering war.",
      "Thousands of trucks have been lined up for weeks just across the Gaza border, waiting to cross in. No food, fresh water or medicine had entered the territory for nearly 80 days under the Israeli blockade. Hunger is so rife that full-blown famine is once again stalking Gaza's population, according to the WFP's director for the Palestinian territories, Antoine Renard, who's just returned from the enclave.",
      "\"You have around an estimated 14,000 children that I know are facing what we call severe acute malnutrition,\" he told CBS News on Monday, meaning those children could die without rapid intervention. \"We always wait for when 'famine' is on. But when famine is on, it's already too late. That will be a failure of all the international community.\"",
      "Until this week, Israel's government had insisted there were no food shortages in Gaza. But for the first time, in a message posted Monday on social media, Netanyahu acknowledged that Gaza is nearing a hunger crisis.",
      "\"Our best friends in the world, senators that I know as enthusiastic Israel supporters, who I know for many years, are come to me and telling me, 'we give you all the support for a final victory \u2014 arms, support on your maneuvers to destroy Hamas, support at the U.N. Security Council. There is one thing we cannot endure \u2014 pictures of mass famine. This is something we are unable to witness. We will not be able to support you.'\"",
      "As a result of that pressure, he's allowing the limited amount of aid into Gaza.",
      "Renard said the WFP had sufficient food on standby, ready to enter, to feed the entire population of Gaza for a month.",
      "\"It must stop,\" he said of the Israeli blockade. \"The civilian population shouldn't be trapped. There's no reason, actually, to hold them accountable for what they are not part of.\"",
      "Netanyahu did not name any of the nations exerting pressure on his government to ease the blockade, and while Israel's closest and most vital ally the U.S. was almost certainly the country he referred to when mentioning long-friendly senators, it's not just the U.S. calling for a resolution to the crisis \u2014 and other countries have been doing so more assertively.",
      "In a strongly worded statement published Monday, the leaders of the U.K., France and Canada called the level of human suffering in Gaza intolerable, and they threatened to take action.",
      "\"The Israeli Government's denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law,\" the countries said in a joint statement. \"We oppose any attempt to expand settlements in the West Bank ... We will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions.\"",
      "Netanyahu decried the threat, saying in a statement that by \"asking Israel to end a defensive war for our survival before Hamas terrorists on our border are destroyed and by demanding a Palestinian state, the leaders in London, Ottowa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more such atrocities.\"",
      "\"The war can end tomorrow if the remaining hostages are released, Hamas lays down its arms, its murderous leaders are exiled and Gaza is demilitarized,\" said the Israeli leader. \"No nation can be expected to accept anything less and Israel certainly won't. This is a war of civilization over barbarism. Israel will continue to defend itself by just means until total victory is achieved.\"",
      "Israel has escalated its war with a new offensive that has killed nearly 600 people over the last week, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health.",
      "Doctors are running out of supplies \u2014 barely able to treat malnourished children, let alone the hundreds of people injured by the Israeli strikes who stream in day after day.",
      "The war in Gaza was sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and left 251 others as hostages in Gaza. Israel's retaliatory war has destroyed large swaths of Gaza, displaced 90% of its population \u2014 most of them multiple times \u2014 and killed more than 53,500 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",

    "story": [
      "A pack of veterinarians clambered over hefty metal crates on Tuesday morning, loading them one by one onto a fleet of semi-trucks. Among the cargo: tigers, monkeys, jaguars, elephants and lions \u2014 all fleeing the latest wave of cartel violence eclipsing the northern Mexican city of Culiacan.",
      "For years, exotic pets of cartel members and circus animals have been living in a small animal refuge on the outskirts of Sinaloa's capital. However, a bloody power struggle erupted last year between rival Sinaloa cartel factions, plunging the region into unprecedented violence and leaving the leaders of the Ostok Sanctuary reeling from armed attacks, constant death threats and a cutoff from essential supplies needed to keep their 700 animals alive.",
      "The aid organization is now leaving Culiacan and transporting the animals hours across the state in hopes that they'll escape the brunt of the violence. But fighting has grown so widespread in the region that many fear it will inevitably catch up.",
      "\"We've never seen violence this extreme,\" said Ernesto Zazueta, president of the Ostok Sanctuary. \"We're worried for the animals that come here to have a better future.\"",
      "Violence in the city exploded eight months ago when two rival Sinaloa Cartel factions began warring for territory after the dramatic kidnapping of Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, the leader of one of the groups, by a son of notorious capo Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n who then delivered him to U.S. authorities via a private plane.",
      "Zambada and \"El Chapo's\" son Joaquin Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez were arrested when they landed in Texas.",
      "Since then, intense fighting between the heavily armed factions has become the new normal for civilians in Culiacan, a city that for years avoided the worst of Mexico's violence in large part because the Sinaloa Cartel maintained such complete control.",
      "\"With the escalating war between the two factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, they have begun to extort, kidnap and rob cars because they need funds to finance their war,\" said security analyst David Saucedo. \"And the civilians in Culiacan are the ones that suffer.\"",
      "Animals scared by cartel fighting",
      "Zazueta, the sanctuary director, said their flight from the city is another sign of just how far the warfare has seeped into daily life.",
      "This week, refuge staff loaded up roaring animals onto a convoy as some trainers attempted to sooth the animals. One murmured in a soft voice as he fed a bag of carrots to an elephant in a shipping container, \"I'm going to be right here, no one will do anything to you.\"",
      "Veterinarians and animals, accompanied by the Mexican National Guard, began traveling along the freeway to seaside Mazatlan, where they planned to release the animals into another wildlife reserve.",
      "The relocation came after months of planning and training the animals, a move made by the organization in an act of desperation. They said the sanctuary was caught in the crossfire of the warfare because of its proximity to the town of Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, a stronghold of Los Chapitos, one of the warring factions.",
      "During intense periods of violence, staff at the sanctuary can hear gunshots echoing nearby, the roar of cars and helicopters overhead, something they say scares the animals. Cartel fighting regularly blocks staff off from reaching the sanctuary, and some animals have gone days without eating. Many have started to lose fur and at least two animals have died due to the situation, Zazueta said.",
      "Complicating matters is the fact that an increasing number of the animals they rescue are former narco pets left abandoned in rural swathes of the state. In one case, a Bengal tiger was discovered chained in a plaza, caught in the center of shootouts. Urban legends circulate in Sinaloa that capos feed their enemies to pet lions. The U.S. Justice Department alleged in an indictment released in 2023 that the sons of \"El Chapo\" and their cartel associates fed some of their victims \"dead or alive to tigers.\"",
      "Diego Garc\u00eda, a refuge staff member, is among those who travel out to rescue those animals. He said he regularly receives anonymous threats, with callers claiming to know his address and how to find him. He worries he'll be targeted for taking away the former pets of capos. Zazueta said the refuge also receives calls threatening to burn the sanctuary to the ground and kill the animals if payment isn't made.",
      "\"There's no safe place left in this city these days,\" said Garc\u00eda.",
      "That's the feeling for many in the city of 1 million. When the sun rises, parents check for news of shootouts as if it were the weather, to determine if it's safe to send their kids to school. Burned houses sit riddled with bullets and occasionally bodies appear hanging from bridges outside the city. By night, Culiacan turns into a ghost town, leaving bars and clubs shuttered and many without work.",
      "\"My son, my son, I'm here. I'm not going to leave you alone,\" screamed one mother, sobbing on the side of the road and cursing officials as they inspected her son's dead body, splayed out and surrounded by bullet casings late Monday night. \"Why do the police do nothing?\" she cried out.",
      "\"What are we doing here?\"",
      "In February, while driving a refuge vehicle used for animal transport, Garc\u00eda said he was forced from the car by an armed, masked man in an SUV. At gunpoint, they stole the truck, animal medicine and tools used by the group for rescues and left him trembling on the side of the road.",
      "The breaking point for the Ostok Sanctuary came in March, when one of the two elephants in their care, Bireki, injured her foot. Veterinarians scrambled to find a specialist to treat her in Mexico, the United States and beyond. No one would brave the trip to Culiacan.",
      "\"We asked ourselves, 'what are we doing here?'\" Zazueta said. \"We can't risk this happening again. If we don't leave, who will treat them?\"",
      "The concern by many is that Mexico's crackdown on the cartels will be met with even more violent power moves by criminal organizations, as has happened in the past, said Saucedo, the security analyst.",
      "Zazueta blames local government and security forces for not doing more, and said their pleas for help in the past eight months have gone unanswered.",
      "Sinaloa's governor's office did not immediately respond to a request comment.",
      "The sanctuary made the move without any public announcement, worried that they might face repercussions from local officials or the same cartels forcing them to flee, but they hope the animals will find some relief in Mazatlan after years of conflict.",
      "Garc\u00eda, the sanctuary staff member, is not so sure. While he hopes for the best, he said he's also watched cartel violence spread like a cancer across the Latin American country. Mazatlan, too, is also facing bursts of violence, though nothing compared to the Sinaloan capital.",
      "\"It's at least more stable,\" he said. \"Because here, today, it's just suffocating.\"",
      "Cartel violence is also frequent in the central state of Guanajuato, Mexico's most deadly state. This week, gunmen opened fire and killed seven people, including some minors, in a plaza in the city of San Felipe, police said. The violent crime is believed to be linked to conflict between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of the most powerful in Mexico.",

      "A new, unclassified assessment from the Pentagon's intelligence agency shows what threats the U.S. needs to defend itself from in the next decade.",
      "The Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, expects that missile threats to the U.S. will expand both in scale and sophistication, as the U.S. faces threats from foreign actors in the shape of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, two types of hypersonic weapons, land attack cruise missiles, and fractional orbital bombardment systems.",
      "Mr. Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" in the vein of Israel's Iron Dome, the country's mobile all-weather air defense system that has intercepted projectiles since its installation in 2011. However, Israel's Iron Dome largely defends against shorter-range threats, like rockets, while it has two other air defense systems to defend against missiles, which are increasingly being used in conflict.",
      "\"Missile threats to the U.S. homeland will expand in scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" the assessment says. \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses, but traditional ballistic missiles \u2014 which are guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight \u2014 will remain the primary threat to the homeland. North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability.\"",
      "The assessment warns that China, Iran and North Korea will have significantly more intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\" Although Iran doesn't currently have known ICBMs, the DIA assessment suggests it will have 60 by 2035. Keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear power has been a key goal of the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The assessment also warns that China's submarine-launched ballistic missiles will increase in number by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing adversary SLBMs.\" Russia, too, has submarine-launched ballistic missiles.",
      "Further, the assessment warns that both China and Russia will increase their boosted hypersonic weapons multiple times over by 2035. The report says that Russia and China can reach parts of the U.S. with these systems. The report also says China and Russia's land attack cruise missile capacity will significantly increase by 2035, and both countries have the potential to reach parts of the U.S.",
      "Finally, the report says both Russia and China are expected to have what's known as fractional orbital bombardment systems by 2035. These will be able to orbit the globe, traveling over the South Pole to avoid early detection.",

If push comes to shove, they can then have the President weigh in and use his powers to coax those holdouts to vote yes.",
      "Here\u2019s the long-term outlook: If the House passes the bill, this goes to the Senate. This will be a project which will consume most of June. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) wants this done by July 4. But the question is what the Senate actually produces. The House and Senate must be on the same page. If the Senate crafts a different legislative product, then this must return to the House to sync up. Either the House eats what the Senate put together. Or the House and Senate must blend their differing versions together into a single, unified bill. That could take most of July. Remember that this bill includes an increase in the debt ceiling. The Treasury says Congress must lift the debt ceiling by early August.",

      "McMahon responded, \"Well, it isn\u2019t being decimated. We have reduced the size of it. However, we are taking on a backlog of cases that were left over from the Biden administration.\"",
      "Watson Coleman grew visibly frustrated and accused the administration of racial bias in immigration and education policies, saying its actions amounted to \"favoritism and prioritization of white over color.\"",
      "In a blistering rebuke, Watson Coleman said, \"Your rhetoric means nothing to me. What means something to me is the actions of this administration. I\u2019m telling you, the Department of Education is one of the most important departments in this country.

      "The exchange came as part of a larger hearing in which McMahon laid out President Donald Trump\u2019s 2026 education budget proposal, which calls for a $12 billion cut to the Education Department, a 15% reduction.",

      "\"Let\u2019s focus on literacy. What we\u2019re seeing in those scores is a failure of our students to learn to read,\" McMahon said. \"We\u2019ve lost the fundamentals.\"",

      "A Texas-based doctor was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years\u00a0in prison for healthcare fraud after he carried out what prosecutors said was a nearly two-decade scheme that involved falsely diagnosing thousands of patients with degenerative diseases and profiting handsomely off their treatments.",
      "Jorge Zamora-Quezada, a rheumatologist licensed to practice medicine in Texas, Arizona and Massachusetts before being stripped of his licenses in each state, raked in hundreds of millions of dollars for the misdiagnoses and treatment he ordered during his roughly 20 years as a medical practitioner. The treatments included punishing rounds of chemotherapy, intravenous infusions, and a battery of other tests, monthly visits, and regular procedures associated with the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic, autoimmune condition for which there is no cure.",

Prosecutors detailed his extravagant lifestyle, including a private jet, 13 properties across the U.S., including in Aspen and various towns in Mexico, and a Maserati \u2013 while the health of the patients he defrauded continued to worsen.",

Unlike other departments, it is one of the few where career and political staff alike are largely in lockstep, with goals and cases that transcend partisan politics and seek instead to hold criminals like the Texas doctor accountable.",

They said he commuted to his various doctors\u2019 offices in Texas in a Maserati and a private jet, both emblazoned with his initials, \"ZQ.\" His assets were forfeited after he was charged, prosecutors said.",

      "Vice President JD Vance's suggestion this week that the U.S. could walk away from supporting Ukraine if peace talks with Russia stagnate could serve as catnip for the Kremlin, according to experts who say Russian President Vladimir Putin might choose to smother progress in hopes of getting America to wash \"its hands of the war.\"",
      "While President Donald Trump has indicated that the U.S. may disengage from the negotiations as a last resort if they prove futile, Vance has taken the rhetoric a step further by saying the U.S. is definitely open to doing so.",
      "\"We\u2019re more than open to walking away,\" Vance told reporters on board Air Force Two on Monday, just moments before a high-stakes phone call between Trump and Putin. \"The United States is not going to spin its wheels here. We want to see outcomes.\"",

      "For the moment, Moscow still benefits from U.S. involvement in the talks because the Kremlin wants the U.S. to help advance a deal that benefits Russia and alleviates sanctions, Hardie said.",
      "\"But, for the Kremlin, the United States washing its hands of the war would be the next best outcome if it means an end or reduction to U.S. support for Ukraine, especially since President Trump may well move to normalize relations with Russia anyhow,\" Hardie told Fox News Digital. \"So the administration\u2019s threat to walk away risks perversely incentivizing Kremlin intransigence.

      "Rough noted that other administration officials besides Vance, including Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have mentioned the possibility of walking away from a deal, so Vance's comments don't necessarily reflect a huge change in policy. And it's unclear right now what exactly stepping aside would mean.",
      "\"The purpose of those comments has been to impress on the Kremlin that U.S. patience is not limitless,\" Rough said.",

From sparring with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office in February to appearing to counter Trump when Vance remarked in May that the war in Ukraine was far from over after Trump indicated a deal might emerge soon, Vance has been outspoken in a way most vice presidents haven't been.",

      "\"I know the president's willing to do that, but if Russia's not willing to do that, then we're eventually just going to have to say ... this is not our war,\" Vance said. \"It's Joe Biden's war, it's Vladimir Putin's war.

      "Removing your personal information from people-search sites can feel pretty overwhelming. There are hundreds of these sites in the U.S. alone. In fact, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse says there are over 500 companies that collect and sell personal information.",
      "At first, it might seem impossible to get your details removed from all of them. But here's the good news: You don't need to tackle every single site. Your information isn't on all 500-plus sites.",

      "First, find which people-search sites have your info",
      "The process will be easier if you have a list of people-search sites that have your personal information. Not only can you check them off as you go, but you'll also need a list for the last step. The easiest place to start is with a\u00a0free scan that some data removal services provide. These scans automatically check a ton of people-search sites for your personal information and send you a report. You can also search for your full name on Google. This will probably bring up a mix of results, including your social media profiles.",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR DATA YOURSELF? HERE'S WHY YOU'RE PROBABLY WRONG",
      "The bigger your online presence, the more search results you'll likely have to sift through to find the people-search sites. I recommend searching for your name together with other personal details, like your email, phone number or home address. For some reason, this is more likely to bring up people-search sites, different ones depending on the combination of personal details you try. You may not be able to find all the people-search sites that have your info like this, though. You should also check any state-specific people-search sites, like\u00a0StateofFlorida.com, and search all of the most popular people-search sites like:",

      "Keep in mind that many smaller or niche sites exist, especially those that are state or region-specific. These sites can be harder to find but may still have your information. Using scanning tools or data removal services can help uncover these less obvious listings.",
      "Follow the opt-out process for each site",
      "Every people-search site has its own opt-out process, but most of them will require you to do something like this:",
      "Find your listing:\u00a0You'll usually need to search for your name, phone number, address or email on the site.Submit a removal request:\u00a0Most sites have an online form where you can request removal. Look for links that say \"Opt-Out,\" \"Do Not Sell My Info\" or \"Privacy Rights,\" which are usually found in the website footer.Verify your request:\u00a0Most sites will send you a confirmation email with a link you'll need to click. Some ask for a phone call verification. A few people-search sites request documents, like a photo ID (I recommend avoiding sending sensitive documents unless absolutely necessary).

      "Pro tip: Use a separate email address for opt-out requests",
      "Many sites require email verification. Using your regular email can expose it to spam or further data collection. Creating a dedicated or alias email address just for these requests helps protect your primary inbox and keeps things organized. Also, using various email aliases makes it so you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Phone verification and a secondary number",
      "If a site requires phone verification, consider using a secondary number to avoid exposing your personal phone number. Services like\u00a0Google Voice can provide you with a secondary number that you can use for online activities, keeping your primary number private. The process should take between five and 20 minutes for each site on your list, depending on how difficult they make it for you. But once you submit the request, removal is usually pretty quick. Your information should be off the site within 24 hours to a week, though it can sometimes take up to 30 days.",
      "Don't forget about Google search results",
      "People-search sites aren't the only places your info can pop up. Sometimes your personal info appears directly in Google search results, pulled from public records or other sites. If you find sensitive info in Google results, you can request removal through Google's own removal tools, especially if the info includes things like your Social Security number, bank account info or images you don't want to be public. This is a separate process, but it is worth doing alongside removing info from people-search sites.",

      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",
      "Keep in mind, this isn't a one-and-done deal",
      "Even after you remove your info, there's a good chance it'll show up again. People-search sites constantly scrape public records and other databases to refresh their listings. Some sites offer \"suppression lists\" you can add your name to, but it's not a perfect system. Small changes, like a slightly different address, a new phone number or a missing middle name, can slip past their filters and pop up as a \"new\" profile.",
      "The best way to stay on top of it is to set a reminder to recheck the main people-search sites every few months and repeat the opt-out process when needed. Maintaining a detailed tracker or spreadsheet with the sites you've contacted, dates and confirmation info can make this easier and help you avoid missing any sites.",

      "If you live in one of these states, you now have a much stronger legal footing to demand that people-search sites remove your information. Many of these laws require companies to honor requests to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal data, and some even require businesses to respect browser-based global opt-out signals. But even if you don't live in one of these states, you should still submit removal requests. Most people-search sites do not filter opt-out requests by state; they generally process any request they receive to avoid potential legal issues, regardless of your location.",
      "If this sounds like too much work, there's help",
      "Removing your data manually takes real time and commitment, especially since you have to keep doing it to stay off these sites. That's why many people turn to personal data removal services. Instead of going site by site yourself, a service can automatically send removal requests on your behalf, track the responses and re-request removals if your data reappears later.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Manual removal is free and gives you full control, but it takes time and requires ongoing effort. Automated services cost money but save you time, handle rechecks and can catch new listings faster. Choose what best fits your budget and privacy needs. If you follow these steps and stay consistent, you can take back control of your personal information online. It might take some work, but every removal counts toward protecting your privacy.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 16:07:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reports that healthcare information of more than 430,000 Ascension patients was exposed in a data breach.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses how users can keep their genetic data safe amid DNA testing company 23andMe's bankruptcy sale.",
      "The state of cybersecurity in the healthcare industry worries me a lot. Healthcare organizations, whether nonprofit or for-profit, collect an enormous amount of data. And it's not just phone numbers, addresses or emails but also sensitive information like medical records, insurance details and more. This data is extremely valuable, which makes it a prime target for hackers.",
      "What's worse is that many healthcare institutions often neglect cybersecurity and treat it as an afterthought. In 2024 alone, an industry tracker recorded 1,160 healthcare breaches that exposed 305 million patient records. This marked a 26% increase compared to the previous year.",
      "Against this backdrop, Ascension, a Missouri-based Catholic health system with 142 hospitals and 142,000 employees, recently disclosed that a December 2024 breach exposed the personal and medical information of more than 430,000 patients.",

      "A hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "According to\u00a0Ascension's breach notification letters, the compromise began on Dec. 5, 2024, when the network learned patient data\u00a0\"may have been involved in a potential security incident.\" By Jan. 21, 2025, its investigators had determined that Ascension had \"inadvertently disclosed information to a former business partner,\" and that attackers likely stole data from that partner via a flaw in its software. In other words, patient records passed from Ascension into a third party's system and were then siphoned off by cybercriminals.",
      "The attackers gained a broad array of information. Impacted patients' demographic and financial details, names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, race, gender and Social Security numbers were exposed. Even more worryingly, the breach included clinical data from hospital stays, including physician names, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and procedure codes, medical record numbers and insurance details. This is the very data that criminals can exploit for fraud or identity theft.",
      "A healthcare worker typing on a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",
      "Timeline and involvement",
      "Ascension reported the breach to regulators via an HHS filing on April 28, 2025, which shows 437,329 patients affected. By comparison, the company had earlier disclosed the impact in state filings. For example, 114,692 Texas patients and 96 Massachusetts residents were individually notified of exposure. In response, Ascension is offering those affected two years of free identity monitoring services (credit monitoring, fraud consultation and identity theft restoration).",
      "For scale, Ascension is a major nonprofit health system, one of the largest in the U.S., operating 142 hospitals across North America. The company has not named the third-party partner, but its description fits a vendor whose secure file-transfer software was breached.",
      "The timing aligns with a series of\u00a0recent Cl0p ransomware attacks. Cl0p has publicly claimed responsibility for exploiting a zero-day flaw in Cleo's secure file-transfer products, stealing data from dozens of organizations worldwide. While Ascension itself was not directly hit by ransomware, its data might have ended up in that same attack campaign.",
      "Ascension's patients and employees are no strangers to data breaches. In May 2024, a\u00a0Black Basta ransomware attack compromised Ascension's own network. That incident, traced back to a single employee opening a malicious file, resulted in the exfiltration of data belonging to nearly 5.6 million people.",
      "The fallout was severe. Hospitals lost access to digital records, forcing clinicians to record vitals, medications and orders on paper. Elective procedures and some appointments were paused, and emergency services were redirected to unaffected facilities to avoid delays in care.",
      "We reached out to Ascension for a comment on our article but did not hear back before our deadline.",

      "If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Ascension data breach.",
      "1) Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, Ascension attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Ascension breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Ascension breach, including Social Security numbers and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You might want to consider investing in identity theft protection, which can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5) Monitor your credit reports: Regularly check your credit reports through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6) Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7) Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Attackers have frequently targeted Ascension, but the company does not seem to be learning its lesson. If it were a one-off incident, it might be understandable. But how do you fail to strengthen cybersecurity after experiencing a nationwide blackout? Rather than being an isolated event, this breach feels like part of a larger pattern. The industry relies on complex vendor networks and outdated IT systems, while cybercriminals continue to exploit emerging vulnerabilities.",

      "Scammers are always coming up with new tricks. Just when you start feeling confident about spotting phishing emails, suspicious links and fake banking apps, they find a new angle. Lately, they have been getting more creative, turning to the built-in features of our phones to pull off their schemes. One of the latest targets is NFC, the technology behind tap-to-pay.",
      "It might seem harmless, but a new scam is using it in ways most people would never expect. An Android malware called SuperCard goes beyond just stealing your card details. It gives attackers the ability to use your card remotely for real transactions. And the worst part is that it all begins with something as simple as a text message.",

      "An Android phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What makes SuperCard X different?",
      "SuperCard X stands out from other Android malware because of how it operates. As reported by\u00a0researchers at Cleafy, instead of stealing usernames, passwords or verification codes, it uses a method called NFC relay. This allows attackers to copy card data from a victim's device in real time and use it elsewhere to make payments or withdraw cash. The process does not require physical access to the card or knowledge of the PIN.",
      "The malware is offered through a Malware-as-a-Service model, which means different cybercriminals can use it in their own regions. This makes the threat more scalable and harder to contain. Unlike most banking trojans, SuperCard X is not focused on one specific institution. It targets any cardholder regardless of which bank issued their card.",
      "Another key difference is how stealthy the malware is. It uses minimal permissions and does not include extra features that would make it easier to detect. This lean approach helps it avoid detection by antivirus software and allows it to operate quietly on infected devices.",
      "SuperCardX fully undetectable (FUD | Cleafy) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "How the scam works",
      "The fraud begins with a message sent through SMS or WhatsApp. It pretends to be from a bank and warns the recipient about a suspicious transaction. The message includes a phone number and urges the person to call to resolve the issue. This is the first step in gaining the victim's trust.",
      "Once on the phone, the attacker poses as a bank representative and walks the victim through a fake security process. This may include asking them to confirm personal details or adjust settings in their mobile banking app, such as removing spending limits on their card.",
      "Next, the attacker asks the victim to install a mobile app that is described as a tool to verify the account or enhance security. In reality, this app contains the SuperCard X malware. After the installation, the attacker instructs the victim to tap their card against the phone. The malware then captures the NFC data from the card and sends it to a second phone controlled by the attacker.",
      "Using the copied data, the attacker can make contactless payments or make ATM withdrawals almost instantly. This method allows them to steal funds quickly and leaves little opportunity for banks or victims to intervene in time.",
      "A woman scrolling on her phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "8 ways you can stay safe from SuperCard X malware",
      "1) Be cautious of suspicious texts and calls. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Fraudulent campaigns often begin with an SMS or call that seems to come from your bank. These messages usually claim there's suspicious activity on your account and urge you to click a link or dial a number to resolve the issue. However, this is a tactic used to gain access to your personal information. Always approach such messages with skepticism.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:\u00a0One of the key ways malware like SuperCard X spreads is through deceptive apps that victims are persuaded to install. These apps often look harmless, posing as tools for security or account verification. If you receive a link to download an app via SMS, email or messaging apps like WhatsApp, do not click on it. Instead, only download apps from trusted sources, such as the Google Play Store. Additionally, carefully review app permissions and avoid granting unnecessary access, particularly to sensitive data like NFC, location or personal contacts.",
      "3) Turn off NFC when not in use:\u00a0NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a useful feature that allows contactless payments and data exchanges. However, it can be exploited by attackers to capture your card information without you even realizing it. To minimize your risk of falling victim to NFC-based malware like SuperCard X, turn off NFC when you're not actively using it.",
      "On most Android devices, you can do this by going to \"Settings,\" then \"Connected Devices\" or \"Connection Preferences,\" where you\u2019ll find the NFC toggle. By disabling NFC, your phone won't transmit data wirelessly, which helps protect your payment card information from being stolen by nearby attackers.",
      "4) Keep a close eye on your bank accounts and cards:\u00a0If your device has come into contact with the SuperCard or anything similar, it\u2019s possible your banking details are already compromised. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to regularly check your transaction history for anything odd, like a small payment you don\u2019t remember making or a charge from a strange location could be a sign of misuse. If you spot anything suspicious, report it to your bank right away. It\u2019s also worth checking your credit reports every now and then to catch signs of identity theft before they snowball into bigger issues.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: If scammers have targeted you once, there's a higher chance they\u2019ll try again, especially if your personal details (like your phone number, address or email) are easily found online. Data removal services scan people-search sites and brokers, then request the removal of your info. This reduces your exposure and helps prevent future phishing or social engineering attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Contact your bank and freeze your cards:\u00a0If you think you\u2019ve tapped or handled a suspicious card, or if your phone acted strangely afterward, don\u2019t brush it off. Call your bank and let them know what happened. They can freeze your card to stop any unauthorized payments and issue a new one for added safety. You should also ask them to monitor your account more closely for a while. On top of that, place a fraud alert with a credit bureau so no one can easily open a new line of credit in your name.",
      "7) Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you've been targeted by a sophisticated scam like SuperCard X, there's a chance your personal information, not just your card data, may be at risk. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information, like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8) Report the scam to your national cybercrime authority: Whether or not you lost money, reporting the scam helps authorities track emerging threats and warn others. You can report such fraud to the FBI\u2019s\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center or the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. Your report could help catch the people behind the scam or at least shut down their infrastructure.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The SuperCard X malware campaign represents a significant shift in how cybercriminals are targeting individuals and financial institutions. By exploiting NFC technology and combining it with social engineering tactics, attackers have found a way to bypass traditional fraud detection systems.

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reports on China\u2019s Zhiyuan unveiling the world\u2019s first tri-ducted wearable eVTOL with hands-free control.",
      "Have you ever imagined what personal flying could look like in the near future? China's Zhiyuan Research Institute, based in Hangzhou, is bringing that vision closer to reality. They just unveiled what they're calling the world's first tri-ducted wearable electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for individual use, and their recent demo flight is already sparking curiosity about the future of personal flight.",

      "Tri-ducted wearable eVTOL for individual use (Zhiyuan Research Institute) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's so special about this flying machine?",
      "The coolest thing about this eVTOL is its tri-ducted propulsion system. That means it has three powerful propellers, one on the left, one on the right and one in the back, all working together to keep the aircraft stable and efficient. This setup isn't just for show. It actually helps the vehicle fly smoother, cut down on noise and hover more reliably. It's the first time a manned aircraft has used this kind of design, which is pretty groundbreaking.",
      "Safety is a huge focus for the Zhiyuan team. They built in a one-click separation system that lets the pilot quickly detach from the aircraft and deploy a low-altitude parachute if something goes wrong. That way, the pilot can land safely even in an emergency, which is a big comfort for anyone flying solo.",
      "Flying this thing isn't just for experts. Zhiyuan developed a ground control system that helps keep things simple. The eVTOL can hover steadily and fly on its own without the pilot having to constantly control it, and it can make quick, agile moves when needed. The controls are designed to be easy to use, so even people without much flying experience can handle them.",
      "On the power side, the team created a new propulsion system with a high thrust-to-weight ratio. They used advanced ducted motor designs to make the whole thing more efficient. Plus, the flight control system can handle turbulent weather, so the ride stays smooth even when the air gets rough.",

      "ARE THESE AUTONOMOUS TRANSPORT PODS THE FUTURE OF SKY-HIGH COMMUTING?",
      "China's growing low-altitude economy",
      "This new eVTOL is part of a much bigger trend in China. The country is working hard to grow what it calls its \"low-altitude economy,\" which includes drones, eVTOLs and other aircraft that fly below about 3,280 feet. The government has made low-altitude aviation a priority and is promising support for commercial spaceflight and next-generation air mobility technologies. Experts estimate that this industry could be worth more than $137 billion by 2030 as these aircraft find more uses in areas like logistics, tourism and public services.",

      "1. Use a black gel pen: When writing checks, always use a\u00a0black gel pen. The ink is much harder to remove compared to regular ballpoint pen ink.",
      "2. Bring checks directly to the post office when mailing them: If using a mailbox, make sure to drop off your mail before the final scheduled pickup so it is not left sitting overnight.",
      "3. Sign up for USPS Informed Delivery: Stay ahead by signing up for\u00a0USPS Informed Delivery. You will receive digital previews of incoming mail so you can monitor for any missing items early. Learn more about why it's important\u00a0here.",
      "4. Monitor your bank accounts: Set up real-time alerts for check clearing and review your statements weekly to catch any suspicious activity. Also, ask your bank about any other fraud-prevention tools they offer to protect your accounts.",
      "5. Switch to digital payments when possible: Use your bank\u2019s mobile app to deposit checks without mailing or physically delivering them, reducing the risk of theft or tampering.",
      "6. Use checks with built-in security features: Choose checks printed on paper with watermarks, chemical-sensitive coatings or other security features that make check washing much harder.",
      "7. Limit the information on checks: Avoid unnecessary personal details. Do not print your Social Security number, driver\u2019s license number or phone number on your checks. The less information available, the less a fraudster can use.",
      "HOW CYBERSCAMS ARE DRAINING AMERICANS WALLETS BY THE BILLIONS",
      "8. Store checks securely: Keep blank checks in a safe place. Store your checkbook in a locked drawer or safe, not in your purse, car or an easily accessible location at home.",
      "9. Check your mailbox security: Install a\u00a0locking mailbox. If possible, use a mailbox with a lock to prevent thieves from stealing outgoing or incoming mail.",
      "10. Be cautious with endorsements: When endorsing checks, write \"For Deposit Only\" along with your account number to prevent others from cashing the check.",
      "11. Enroll in identity theft protection with check fraud specialization: Choose services that specifically monitor for compromised check details on dark web marketplaces and alert you to suspicious check-cashing patterns.

      "12. Invest in personal data removal services: Minimize exposure of sensitive details (like addresses or banking affiliations) that fraudsters could exploit for check-washing scams. Removing your personal information from these sites can help reduce your risk of becoming a victim. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "13. Shred sensitive documents: Shred old checks and bank statements. Don\u2019t just throw them away. Shred any documents with sensitive banking information.",
      "14. Report suspicious activity immediately: If you suspect check fraud or missing mail, report it to your bank and the\u00a0U.S. Postal Inspection Service right away.",
      "15. Use Positive Pay if you are a business:\u00a0Positive Pay is a fraud prevention service offered by most banks to business customers. It works by matching the checks you issue with the ones presented for payment. If something doesn\u2019t add up, like a changed amount or payee, the bank flags it for your review before it\u2019s processed. You usually need to sign up through your bank, and there might be a fee, but it\u2019s a smart way to protect your business from check fraud, especially if you write a lot of checks.",

Even if the system still runs smoothly, it becomes more vulnerable to cyber threats like\u00a0malware,\u00a0ransomware,\u00a0phishing attacks and\u00a0data theft. An outdated operating system is like an unlocked door. Hackers and malicious software often target these systems specifically because of their weaknesses.

      "4. Install strong antivirus software that supports legacy systems: Even an offline PC can be exposed via USB drives or transferred files. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Before installing antivirus software, make sure your older computer meets the minimum system requirements. Check for supported operating system (OS) version, RAM, and processor architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).

For most older machines, look for SSDs labeled \"2.5-inch SATA\", which are the most widely compatible and easy to install.

One significant advantage of cloud storage is accessing files from any device with an internet connection, whether on your phone, tablet or another computer.",

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "5. Regularly update your operating system and applications: Keep your devices and software\u00a0up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6. Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Avoid accessing sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public networks, or use a VPN for added security. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Backup your data regularly: Create\u00a0multiple backups of your important files, including at least one offline copy.",
      "8. Use secure file transfer methods: When sharing files, use encrypted transfer methods or\u00a0password-protected links.",
      "By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the security of your data and protect yourself from potential cyber threats.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Your PC\u2019s storage can fill up fast, but you can always free up some space. I personally prefer storing images and videos that take up too much space on an external drive. This way, I can access them whenever I need to while keeping my PC storage free. If an external drive feels like too much of a hassle, you can always opt for cloud storage.

      "The head trauma and skull fractures he sustained, coupled with hypothermia from the cold, would not have killed him immediately, according to Dr. Aizik Wolf, who testified he treated many similar injuries in his career working in Minneapolis.",

      "\"We have 58 hostages in Gaza. This war will not end when the hostages are left behind. We will bring all of them back,\" Danon said, emphasizing Israel's determination to finish the war and bring home those held captive. Danon also expressed frustration that the international community has not placed more pressure on Hamas over the hostages, urging those countries to make stronger statements on their behalf.",
      "The joint statement issued by the leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Canada condemned Israel's military operations in Gaza, criticizing the humanitarian situation and calling for an immediate ceasefire. The statement also urged Israel to allow more aid into Gaza, specifically calling on the Israeli government to engage with the United Nations to resume aid in line with humanitarian principles and to push for the release of all hostages held by Hamas.",

Security Council. Fletcher criticized Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, stating that most of the region was either under Israeli military control or subjected to displacement orders.",
      "\"What Mr. Fletcher said at the Security Council was unacceptable and shameful, accusing us for committing a genocide. He knows better than that. That\u2019s a libel and I expect him to take back those words and apologize. We will not work with him until he will make it clear that Israeli isn\u2019t committing a genocide. We have no intention for that, he knows that. We are doing our best to defeat the terror group Hamas. We will defeat Hamas, but blaming us for committing such atrocities, that is something we cannot accept from any U.N. official.\"",

      "Regarding the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the recent opening of the borders to allow aid trucks into Gaza after two months, Fletcher commented on X, calling Israel's temporary permission to deliver limited aid a \"drop in the ocean.\"",
      "Danon stressed that the aid was only granted to NGOs that ensure Hamas does not infiltrate their ranks or loot aid intended for civilians.",
      "\"Let\u2019s stick to the facts,\" Danon said. \"We are still expecting a retraction of the inappropriate libel that you asserted last week at the Security Council.\"",
      "In a briefing today, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesperson for the secretary-general, also referenced the statement by Fletcher, who stressed that the scale of aid is still insufficient to meet the overwhelming needs of the population. He called for more crossings to be opened and for the simplification of procedures to ensure a regular flow of aid, emphasizing that without such measures, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza would continue to worsen.",

He voiced support for the U.S. initiative, calling it a welcome step toward addressing Gaza\u2019s humanitarian crisis. \"I cannot understand how anyone can boycott a humanitarian effort,\" he added. \"If those people in the U.N. care so much about the humanitarian crisis, they should take part in these efforts, not boycott them.\"",

That followed a slim-margin 2016 referendum vote calling for the U.K.'s departure. The government of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other senior EU officials, billed the summit as a major milestone in resetting relations.",

The prime minister has faced growing challenges from the Reform U.K. party, which supported Brexit and opposes mass migration policies upending the powerful island nation.",

    "summary": "Republicans released a package of revisions to their massive party-line bill for President Donald Trump's agenda Wednesday night, with the hope of quickly bringing it to the House floor and passing it.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 After a marathon hearing, the GOP-led House Rules Committee advanced a sweeping package for President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda Wednesday night, teeing it up for a vote in the full chamber.",
      "Members of the committee met starting at 1 a.m. ET Wednesday and adjourned around 10:40 p.m. ET before they voted for the legislation along party lines, 8-4.",
      "The vote came shortly after Republicans released a set of revisions to their massive bill, a product of last-minute negotiations to placate various factions of the party, including conservative hard-liners and blue-state Republicans, that were threatening to sink the measure.",
      "The 42-page amendment to the multitrillion-dollar legislation includes moving up the enforcement of work requirements for eligible Medicaid recipients by two years, to the end of 2026, phasing out clean energy tax credits earlier and expanding the federal deduction for state and local taxes to $40,000 for people earning less than $500,000 annually.",
      "It's unclear exactly when the House will take up the package for a vote. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., navigating a narrow three-seat majority in the chamber, had said he hoped to hold the vote Wednesday night or Thursday morning.",
      "Here are some of the biggest changes GOP leaders made to Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" Wednesday.",
      "Medicaid changes",
      "In a win for conservative hard-liners in the House Freedom Caucus, the agreement speeds up the timeline when work requirements would kick in for able-bodied adults ages 18 to 64 to be able to receive Medicaid benefits.",
      "The original legislation, adopted by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for work requirements to start at the beginning of 2029. But anti-spending hawks, led by Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., pushed to have them begin \"not later than Dec. 31, 2026,\" so savings would take effect sooner.",
      "The new language would also allow states to move the date to earlier if they chose to do so.",
      "Shifting the start date sooner would mean millions of people could lose Medicaid benefits before the 2028 presidential election, and some could possibly lose them before the 2026 midterm election. That could be a political liability for Republicans up and down the ballot, though Trump and congressional GOP leaders say they are simply rooting out \"fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "In another significant shift, states that declined the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act would get higher payments as an incentive to encourage them not to expand the program.",
      "Clean energy credits",
      "The Freedom Caucus notched another victory in its eleventh-hour negotiations: more quickly phasing out clean energy tax breaks from former President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The measure would cut off production and investment tax credits for any facility if the construction began 60 days after the bill was enacted, or after 2028.",
      "The revised bill would also unwind credits for wind and solar leasing arrangements for properties.",
      "\u201cWe worked with the White House to get some important revisions to expedite the phase out,\u201d Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters. \u201cLook, President Trump doesn\u2019t want these, either, and so we worked with them to get really tight language to limit dramatically any new projects from starting.\u201d",
      "Boosting the SALT cap",
      "Republicans who represent districts in high-tax blue states said their top priority in the package was raising the SALT cap, the amount federal taxpayers can deduct in state and local taxes.",
      "The original legislation, passed out of the Ways and Means Committee, hiked the SALT cap to $30,000, up from the current $10,000 cap imposed in Trump's 2017 tax cut law. But members of the SALT Caucus slammed that increase as insufficient.",
      "The new bill would boost the SALT cap to $40,000 for people making less than $500,000 a year. Both the cap and the income level would increase by 1% annually for 10 years.",
      "\"This is the No. 1 federal issue for my constituents. If I do a bad deal, I would expect my constituents to throw me out. If I did a deal at $30,000, my own mother wouldn't vote for me,\" Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., said this week in the middle of the negotiations.",
      "\"Now is the time to make it right what we got wrong in 2017; now is the time to deliver on promises that we've made,\" he added.",
      "'MAGA Accounts' renamed to 'Trump Accounts'",
      "In a more trivial change to the bill, Republicans are renaming their tax-preferred savings accounts that parents could set up for children\u00a0from \"MAGA Accounts\" to \"Trump Accounts.\"",
      "The first line of the manager's amendment reads, \"Page 10, in the item relating to section 110115, strike 'MAGA' and insert 'Trump'.\""

    "story": [
      "More than 200 wealthy, mostly anonymous crypto buyers are coming to Washington on Thursday to have dinner with President Donald Trump. The price of admission: $55,000 to $37.7 million.",
      "That\u2019s how much the 220 winners of a contest to meet Trump spent on his volatile cryptocurrency token, $TRUMP, according to an analysis by the blockchain analytics company Nansen.",
      "The top $TRUMP coin holders at a specific time \u2014 determined by the dinner\u2019s organizers \u2014 secured a seat.",
      "In total, the winners spent $394 million on Trump\u2019s official cryptocurrency, Nansen found, though some have sold portions of or all of their holdings since the contest ended. The amount varied significantly by spender, with the top seven winners each spending more than $10 million and the bottom 24 each spending less than $100,000. A third of the winners \u2014 67 of them \u2014\u00a0spent more than a million dollars, the research shows. The average winner spent $1,788,994.42.",
      "Like many meme coins, $TRUMP\u2019s value fluctuates wildly, according to CoinMarketCap, which tracks cryptocurrency prices. Nansen tracked how much each of the contest winners spent on their $TRUMP at the time they purchased it.",
      "The top 220 contest winners were invited to the black-tie optional dinner at the Trump National Golf Club Washington, D.C. While the website for the contest claims that Trump \u201cis appearing at the dinner as a guest and not soliciting any funds for it,\u201d it also says that 80% of the $TRUMP coin project is owned by two Trump-affiliated companies, CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight LLC.",
      "The personal cryptocurrency and associated contest, which ended last Monday, adds to the litany of ways Trump has appeared to use the office of the presidency to profit personally. His business interests are in a trust controlled by his son Donald Trump Jr., and he has intertwined many of his family businesses with his activities as president, including holding events, like the crypto dinner, at his social clubs, and issuing exclusive political statements on his social media app Truth Social.",
      "Trump\u2019s cryptocurrency also makes money for the Trump-tied groups that created it simply by being traded. For every $TRUMP coin that\u2019s traded, a transaction fee is taken. Chainalysis, another cryptocurrency research firm, has estimated that the $TRUMP coin made nearly $900,000 in transaction fees within the first two days of the contest being announced.",
      "While most federal employees would be legally barred from using their office for financial gain, the president is largely exempt, Dan Weiner, the director of the Elections and Government Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThe president is not subject to the broad prohibition on conflicts of interest that affects almost everyone else who works for the federal government,\u201d Weiner said.",
      "\u201cIn general this is pretty wild even by the standards of the first Trump administration, when you had a variety of people doing business at the president\u2019s hotels. This goes far beyond that, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily make it illegal for him,\u201d he said.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement: \u201cThe President is working to secure GOOD deals for the American people, not for himself. President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public \u2014 which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media.\u201d",
      "Even the winners at the bottom of the leaderboard spent far more than the legal limit for an American to donate directly to a political candidate, $3,500.",
      "The top spender revealed himself Tuesday as Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto entrepreneur who told Forbes in March he had become a citizen of the tiny island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis. Sun was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that case has been paused under the Trump administration.",
      "The identities of most of the other contest winners are largely private, known only by their pseudonymous nicknames and cryptocurrency wallet addresses. However, a majority of the attendees appear to be foreign nationals, according to Molly White, an independent crypto researcher who has written about the contest.",
      "White examined each winning wallet\u2019s transactions as they crossed through different crypto exchanges, and noted when the holder appeared to use an exchange that does not legally allow U.S. citizens. Of the 220 wallets tied to contest winners, 158 of them, or 72%, appear foreign, White told NBC News.",
      "A New York Times investigation reported that the leaderboard included people representing crypto businesses in Singapore and Australia.",
      "The prevalence of non-U.S. citizens among the contest winners is notable, as it is generally illegal for people who are not U.S. citizens to donate to American political candidates, Weiner said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible contrast. We have very strict laws that prohibit foreign nationals from making campaign donations. So the great irony here is that many of the people buying this currency would not be eligible to donate $100 to the president\u2019s campaign,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe have a variety of laws that are designed to prevent undue foreign influence over our politics, something actually both parties agree is a legitimate thing to try to avoid. And yet you have this happening,\u201d he said."

      "And the postgame \u201cbromance\u201d is just one symbol of the team\u2019s youth and togetherness, two qualities that helped make the Thunder the league\u2019s best team during the regular season.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very unique in the way we all get along,\u201d All-Star forward Jalen Williams told NBC News earlier this season. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what shows up on the court. When you have 15 guys that all believe in each other and all want each other to do well, it allows you to go out there and play very free.\u201d",
      "The Thunder played free to the tune of 68 wins before the playoffs, the best regular season winning percentage since the 2016 Warriors won 73 games. The Thunder were fueled by a stingy defense, posting a defensive rating of 106.6, the second-best mark this decade. (So far in the postseason, that defense has gotten even stingier, with Oklahoma City posting the best defensive efficiency of any playoff team since 2016 with a minimum of 10 games played.)",
      "The Thunder are doing all of this their own way.",
      "Conventional wisdom in the NBA is veteran-laden teams typically do best come playoff time. The Timberwolves and the New York Knicks, two of the other conference finalists, have rosters with average experience in the top half of the NBA.",
      "Oklahoma City, meanwhile, entered the season with the lowest average age and least experience of any roster.",
      "The leader is Gilgeous-Alexander, 26, who on Wednesday was named the league\u2019s Most Valuable Player. He averaged 32.7 points, 5.0 rebounds and 6.4 assists during his MVP campaign.",
      "In addition to SGA, key players include Williams and big man Chet Holmgren, the second overall pick in the 2022 NBA draft. Veteran guard Alex Caruso is another important figure, clocking in at an ancient 31 years old.",
      "The whole group is tight-knit, celebrating one another\u2019s success.",
      "Take, for example, forward Kenrich Williams, who hardly played in each of OKC\u2019s first two postseason series except for mop-up duty. He played 10 minutes off the bench in Tuesday's game, making all three shot attempts, including two 3-pointers. When he was on the floor, the Thunder outscored the Timberwolves by 19 points, a performance coach Mark Daigneault lauded as a \u201chuge energy boost.\u201d",

      "The roster was built slowly but surely by executive Sam Presti, who had to deal with the departures of previous MVP winners Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook in the 2010s before he could turn the franchise back into a contender, mostly through the draft and shrewd trades.",
      "Since it hired Daigneault 2020, Oklahoma City has increased its win total every year, from 22 to 24 to 40 to 57 last season. During that time, Presti added players such as Williams, Holmgren, Caruso, center Isaiah Hartenstein and guard Cason Wallace to a core that already included Gilgeous-Alexander and perimeter defender Lu Dort.",
      "The franchise had to endure some lean years at the start of the decade, but now the young group is peaking all at once.",
      "\u201cMaybe from the outside, a lot of people probably think it's a surprise,\u201d Williams said of the team\u2019s success. \u201cBut internally, everybody on our staff and organization see how hard everybody works on a daily basis. So it's kind of one of those things that it's more like timing than it would be anything else.\u201d",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/economics/trumps-pledge-cut-taxes-tips-overtime-means-practice-moves-closer-law-rcna208228",
    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump sought to win over working-class voters in key swing states with a promise to exempt tips and overtime pay from federal income taxes.",
    "story": [
      "On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump sought to win over working-class voters in key swing states with a promise to exempt tips and overtime pay from federal income taxes.",
      "Now, Congress is inching closer to making that promise a reality, despite some concerns about how the moves would contribute to the deficit and potentially disrupt the labor market.",
      "Both measures still face multiple hurdles. House leadership was working throughout the day Wednesday to rally its members to pass a budget that includes a tax exemption for tips and overtime before the legislation will then head to the Senate. A separate bill that would exempt tips, but not overtime, from federal income taxes unanimously passed the Senate this week and will now need to be taken up by the House.",
      "The tax breaks, which Trump first floated on the campaign trail, have generated a rare coalition of support stretching across typical partisan divides, with unions, including the Teamsters, and industry groups, like the National Restaurant Association, advocating for the tax exemptions along with some Democrats. At the same time, conservative-leaning think tanks and economists have raised concerns over how the exemptions would contribute to the deficit and potentially affect the job market by rewarding some workers over others.",
      "When Trump first raised the idea of ending taxes on tips, several influential Republicans told NBC News they were skeptical of it, citing rising national debt and questioning whether it would be fair to earners who don\u2019t make tips.",
      "But now, with Trump in the White House, the tax exemptions would offer congressional Republicans a selling point to working-class voters in a broader budget bill that's also stocked with benefits for companies and higher-income households. Eliminating taxes on tips has broad support from the public, with around 75% of voters across party lines supporting the move, according to an Ipsos poll last year.",
      "\u201cThe working class has left the Democrats and come over to the Republican Party, especially with Trump, that\u2019s who he appeals to \u2014 so it feeds the constituency of a lot of our members, and frankly, it\u2019s just really a good idea,\u201d said Sarah Chamberlain, head of the Republican Main Street Partnership, a moderate Republican group. \u201cI realize some of the Freedom Caucus guys don\u2019t like this, but we can find money in other areas to save in order to help the working man and woman.\u201d",
      "While Democrats have largely supported the exemptions, with Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., helping advance the bill in the Senate, the party still plans to highlight cuts elsewhere in the Republican budget that could hurt the same workers benefiting from the tax cuts, like reductions to Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "\"The hypocrisy comes because Republicans are giving a tax cut to tipped workers while decimating Medicaid,\" said Martha McKenna, a Democratic strategist. \"They are giving tipped workers a small break and then punching them in the face with these health care cuts.\"",
      "The numbers on tipped workers and overtime",
      "While some workers would see significant increases in their after-tax income, the wider impact on the economy would be relatively limited, economists said. Tipped workers make up about 2.5% of the workforce, and about 12% of hourly workers clock some overtime each year, according to an analysis by the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "As many as 40% of tipped workers already don\u2019t make enough money to have to pay federal income tax on any of their earnings, the Yale Budget Lab found.",
      "\u201cThis is really a narrow segment of the labor force that is going to see any benefit at all from this \u2014 but that does limit its cost,\u201d said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, who was chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Biden administration. \u201cI think a big reason why Congress is embracing it is because this is one of the lower-cost ideas, and it\u2019s a very high-profile win. You can say that you are helping low-wage workers, even if it\u2019s not that many workers.\u201d",
      "The tax exemption would apply only to federal income tax, so workers would still have to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on their income, along with any state or local taxes.",
      "Both tax exemptions are structured as deductions that workers would claim when they filed their taxes the following year. That means employers would still withhold money for tax payments on tips or overtime through their regular paychecks, but the income would be deductible from their final tax bills when they filed their annual taxes.",
      "The overtime exemptions could benefit workers in a variety of fields, like manufacturing, mining, construction and public safety. The International Association of Fire Fighters, which said its members are often required to work dozens of hours of overtime a month because of staffing shortages, is among the unions supporting the measure.",
      "\u201cFire fighters already work 53 hours a week before even qualifying for overtime pay. That\u2019s 35% more hours a week than the average worker. The proposal to eliminate taxes on overtime would bring meaningful relief to fire fighters, helping them keep more of what they earn while working long hours to keep their communities safe,\u201d Edward Kelly, general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, said in a statement.",
      "Limitations and budgetary costs",
      "The House and Senate bills include some limits on tip exemptions that would make it more difficult for employers to try to manipulate the system \u2014 for example, making it harder to shift hourly or salaried workers to tip-based compensation. It would also exclude higher-income earners making more than $160,000, and it would limit the amount of tips that could be deducted from a yearly tax return to $25,000.",
      "\u201cI think the worst-case scenario from a budgetary cost perspective has been averted, at least on that provision, by limiting it to traditionally tipped industries and excluding highly compensated employees,\u201d said Alex Muresianu, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a group that advocates for tax policy reforms. \u201cThis limits the potential of behavioral change to introduce tipping to more occupations, and that could have really blown the budget.\u201d",
      "But the measures would still come at a cost to the federal budget. The exemption for overtime in the House budget bill would result in $124 billion in lost tax revenue compared with current policy, and the tax break on tips would reduce tax collections by $40 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Under the current legislation, the tax breaks would expire in 2028 \u2014 which would create political pressure to extend them amid that year's presidential election. The impact on the deficit could go even higher if the exemptions were extended beyond then, which would be likely given the political challenge of raising taxes on workers who had been benefiting from the cuts, said Brett Loper, executive vice president of policy for the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which advocates for reducing the national debt.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re making it more challenging for a more limited base to raise revenue, and from our perspective, the gaping hole that you have between revenues and spending, and the political appetite to keep the revenues low and the spending high, is creating sustained deficits,\u201d said Loper, who has worked for Republicans in Congress and the White House. \u201cYou\u2019re accelerating the amount of our national debt, which we think is going to have severe long-term economic consequences.\u201d",
      "Opponents have also argued that the exemptions would distribute the tax burden unfairly, with a worker who is paid an hourly wage, like a janitor, having a higher tax bill than a bartender working at the same restaurant \u2014 disadvantaging one group of workers over another for no clear reason. It could also shift the demand for tipped jobs and those with overtime, creating shortages of workers in other areas.",
      "Reducing taxes on overtime could also lead more employees to be willing to work overtime, which could mean fewer jobs overall in the labor market in certain sectors if employers are able to get additional hours out of their existing workers.",
      "\u201cWorkers get a tax benefit, but over time, employers are going to pay a little bit less than they otherwise would have in wages to these workers,\u201d Tedeschi said. \u201cWith tips, it's shifting the burden of compensation from the restaurant or the employer to the customer. With overtime, that\u2019s going to let those employers pay a little bit less in base salary or base wages to those employees.\u201d"

      "Grammy award-winning rapper Kid Cudi is expected to testify in the federal trial against Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs on Thursday in what could prove to be a pivotal moment for prosecutors.",
      "The rapper is expected to delve into details about his romantic relationship with Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura from more than a decade ago, including allegations that Combs blew up his car.",
      "Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi, is known for his contemporary and alternative style of hip-hop.",
      "The 41-year-old artist first gained national attention with the release of his mixtape \u201cA Kid Named Cudi\u201d in 2008 and often raps about his childhood struggles with depression, loneliness and alienation and occasionally touches on alcohol and drug use.",
      "His testimony will be key as he answers questions from federal prosecutors about his past relationship with Ventura as they try to bolster their charges that Combs engaged in racketeering and sex trafficking.",
      "Combs is charged with one count of racketeering conspiracy; two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty and vehemently denied all five counts. His trial began May 5 in Manhattan.",
      "Calling Mescudi to the witness stand could help the prosecution if it can demonstrate Combs used his considerable financial and business resources to carry out the bombing of Mescuni\u2019s car, said Rachel Maimin, a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York.",
      "\u201cThe burden of proof is on the federal government, so they\u2019ll have to show this was part of the racketeering,\u201d said Maimin, now a criminal defense attorney with Lowenstein Sandler LLP. \u201cThis may be a way of explaining how he used his business empire to further the prosecution\u2019s goal of proving the racketeering enterprise.\u201d",
      "In a five-count indictment, prosecutors said Combs \u201crelied on the employees, resources and influence of the multi-faceted business empire that he led and controlled \u2014 creating a criminal enterprise whose members and associates engaged in, and attempted to engage in, among other crimes, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.\u201d",
      "Ventura alleged in a 2023 civil lawsuit against Combs that he told her he would blow up Mescudi\u2019s car. The lawsuit was settled privately in a day without Combs admitting any wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cAround that time, Kid Cudi\u2019s car exploded in his driveway,\u201d the suit said. \u201cMs. Ventura was terrified, as she began to fully comprehend what Mr. Combs was both willing and able to do to those he believed had slighted him.\u201d",
      "Ventura testified in court last week that she kept a burner phone to keep her relationship with Mescudi private and away from Combs because she thought it would be dangerous if he found out.",
      "Ventura said in court that Combs attacked her when he found out about Cudi while going through her phone during a paid sexual encounter known as a \u201cfreak off.\u201d",
      "She said she broke off the relationship with Mescudi because there was too much uncertainty and danger and she was afraid Combs would hurt them both.",
      "Ventura testified that Combs told her that when she was out of the country, \u201cScott\u2019s car would be blown up.\u201d",
      "No matter what Mescudi says on the stand, there\u2019s little doubt people will be listening intently to the biggest name yet to testify in Combs\u2019 trial.",
      "After Kanye West, now known as Ye, signed Cudi to his Good Music record label, he had a hit song the following year with \u201cDay N Nite,\u201d which reached No. 3 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart.",
      "He won a Grammy in 2012 for best rap/sung collaboration for the song \u201cAll of the Lights\u201d with West and Rihanna. He has been nominated for five other Grammy awards.",
      "Cudi helped bring about a shift to hip-hop by introducing moodiness, unconventionality and introspection to the genre, trends that still hold today and influenced West, said Shamira Ibrahim, a freelance culture writer.",
      "\u201cPeople look at hip-hop as this big performance art as if it has to be extroverted or bombastic, but his work was internal and reflective,\u201d she said."

      "The archdiocese, its parishes and several insurers will pay $179.2 million into a trust to benefit survivors, according to a statement by the committee that negotiated the agreement. The money will be distributed after the church emerges from bankruptcy, it said.",
      "But many of the survivors were not on board, their lawyers said.",

      "The agreement, which would settle a lawsuit filed in 2020, requires approval from the survivors as well as the bankruptcy court and other Archdiocese creditors.",
      "Aaron Hebert, who says he was abused by a priest in the 1960s as an eighth grader, called the deal \"an insult and a slap to the face.\"",
      "\"The Archdiocese of New Orleans and Archbishop (Gregory) Aymond are throwing this offer out to prevent victims and survivors from taking their claims to state court,\" Hebert said.",

      "\"I am grateful to God for all who have worked to reach this agreement and that we may look to the future towards a path to healing for survivors and for our local church,\" Aymond said in a statement.",
      "The suit involves more than 500 people who say they were abused by clergy. The case produced a trove of church records said to document years of abuse claims and a pattern of leaders transferring clergy without reporting their alleged crimes to law enforcement.",
      "In 2018 the archdiocese released a list identifying more than 50 clergy members who were removed from the ministry over the years due to \"credible accusations\" of sexual abuse."

      "Moments later, police arrived on scene to arrest the suspect, named as Elias Rodriguez.",
      "Kalin said the Young Diplomats reception was focused on the theme, \u201cturning pain into purpose,\u201d with the aim of bringing together young professionals, both Jewish and non-Jewish, to talk about bridge-building in the Middle East and North Africa region.",
      "\u201cWe were wanting to counter the us-versus-them narrative,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s painfully ironic that at a time we were speaking about bridge building, somebody came in with such hate and destruction.\u201d",
      "The shooting comes more than 18 months after Israel launched a bombing campaign and ground invasion in Gaza following the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas militants, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and hundreds more were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.",
      "Israel\u2019s counteroffensive has killed more than 53,000 people in Gaza, many of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. International aid groups and governments have also warned of the risk of famine in the enclave. Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel would allow a limited amount of humanitarian aid to flow in following a three-month blockade.",
      "\u201cFree Palestine\u201d has become a popular refrain among supporters of the Palestinian cause.",
      "\u201cThe couple that was gunned down tonight in the name of \u2018Free Palestine\u2019 is a young couple about to be engaged,\" he said at a late-night news conference. \"The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem.\"",
      "President Donald Trump condemned the violence.",
      "\"These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that such things as this can happen!\" he said on social media.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi offered prayers to the victims on X.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be doing everything in our power to keep all citizens safe, especially tonight our Jewish community,\u201d Bondi said at the news conference. She added that Jeanine Pirro, the interim U.S. attorney for Washington, will prosecute the case.",
      "Other U.S. officials also decried the shooting. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the victims were \"senselessly killed,\" and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who is Jewish, called it \"another horrific instance of antisemitism which as we know is all too rampant in our society.\u201d",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said the agency was working with police to learn more and asked for prayers for the victims and their families.",
      "Steve Jensen, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington field office, said his team was working to pin down whether the shooting may have been hate-motivated or potentially an act of terrorism."

    "story": [
      "A new North Korean warship was damaged in a \u201cserious accident\u201d during a launch ceremony attended by leader Kim Jong Un, state media reported Thursday in a rare admission of failure by the secretive nuclear-armed state.",
      "The 5,000-ton destroyer slid off a flatcar because of \u201cinexperienced command and operational carelessness in the course of the launch,\u201d according to the Korean Central News Agency, crushing parts of the bottom of the ship.",
      "Lee Sung-joon, spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that U.S. and South Korean intelligence authorities had been monitoring the failed launch and that the ship was \u201clying on its side in the sea.\u201d",
      "South Korea also said Thursday that North Korea had fired multiple unidentified cruise missiles and that U.S. and South Korean intelligence authorities were analyzing the details.",
      "The ship accident Wednesday at the northeastern port of Chongjin is a blow to Kim, who has stressed the importance of such destroyers for advancing North Korea\u2019s military capabilities.",
      "Kim described the incident as a \u201ccriminal act caused by absolute carelessness\u201d that \u201ccould not be tolerated,\u201d KCNA said.",
      "He censured the officials involved in the accident, which he said \u201cbrought the dignity and self-respect of our state to a collapse,\u201d and said the ship should be restored before next month\u2019s plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party.",
      "The North Korean report did not say whether there were any casualties.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Lee said the damaged ship was believed to have capabilities similar to those of North Korea\u2019s first destroyer, the Choe Hyon-ho, which was unveiled late last month in what Kim called a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in modernizing his naval forces. North Korean state media reported that Kim had supervised tests of the destroyer\u2019s supersonic and strategic cruise missiles, anti-aircraft missile, automatic guns and electronic jamming guns.",
      "Kim said that the destroyer would be deployed early next year and that his next goal in naval modernization was to acquire a nuclear-powered submarine.",
      "Experts say that although North Korea\u2019s naval forces still lag behind those of South Korea, which has 12 destroyers, the new destroyer is considered a serious threat. It is believed to have been built with assistance from Russia, where North Korea has been sending troops and weapons to support its war against Ukraine.",
      "The U.S.-based website 38 North said last week that North Korea was preparing to launch the second destroyer and that it was \u201clikely be side-launched from the quay, a method not previously observed in North Korea.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe use of this launch method could be one of necessity, as the quay where the ship is being built does not have an incline,\u201d it said in a report.",
      "Tensions have heightened on the Korean Peninsula in recent years as Kim accelerates weapons testing for his nuclear and missile programs in what he says is a response to intensifying military cooperation between the United States and its allies. North Korea views joint military exercises among the United States, South Korea and others as a rehearsal for invasion, which those nations deny.",
      "While North Korea\u2019s cruise missile launches on Thursday did not violate United Nations Security Council resolutions, which bar the North from testing ballistic missiles, experts say they are equally as deadly."

      "A rapper from Northern Ireland who has criticized Israel\u2019s war in Gaza was charged with a terrorism offense after he was accused of displaying the flag of the Hezbollah militant group, British authorities said Wednesday.",
      "London\u2019s Metropolitan Police accused Liam O\u2019Hanna, 27, who whose name in Irish is Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh and who performs as Mo Chara in the hip-hop trio Kneecap, of violating a provision in the country\u2019s terrorism law that bans people from displaying flags \u201cin such a way or in such circumstances as to arouse reasonable suspicion that he is a supporter\u201d of groups the United Kingdom considers terrorists.",
      "The Met said it launched an investigation after it learned of an online video last month that showed O\u2019Hanna displaying the flag of Hezbollah at a venue north of London on Nov. 21.",
      "Representatives for Kneecap did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday night.",
      "Hezbollah, a Shia political party and militant organization based in Lebanon, has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, the U.K. and other countries over its militant activities and its ties to Iran.",
      "The group expressed support for Hamas\u2019 attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel soon after. The conflict exploded into a war that has killed thousands of people in Lebanon and displaced tens of thousands more in Israel.",
      "After Wednesday\u2019s announcement, Kneecap\u2019s X account posted a previous interview with O\u2019Hanna in which he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be 80, 90 years of age and my grandkids asking me, 'Why did nobody do anything about the Palestinian genocide?' And me sitting there being like, 'F---, I didn\u2019t do enough.' I don\u2019t want to be on that side of history.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are clearer than ever on who we are and what we stand for,\u201d the post added.",
      "More than 53,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its bombing campaign and ground invasion after Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack, according to health officials in the enclave. The attack killed more than 1,200 people in Israel, and hundreds more were taken hostage by Hamas militants, according to Israeli tallies.",
      "After a weekslong ceasefire fell apart in March, Israel resumed its bombardment of the enclave, including a series of assaults that killed 300 people in 72 hours this month. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country was \"moving toward full control\" of Gaza.",
      "Kneecap has described criticism of its outspoken views about the war in Gaza as a \"coordinated smear campaign\" by those who \"want to silence criticism of a mass slaughter. They weaponize false accusations of antisemitism to distract, confuse, and provide cover for genocide.\u201d",
      "After the group performed at Coachella last month in front of a screen that said, \u201cF--- Israel, Free Palestine,\" the organizers behind Israel's Tribe of Nova music festival, where hundreds of people were killed in the October 2023 attack, said Kneecap's messaging was \"an affront made even more painful in light of the massacre.\"",
      "\"We invite the members of Kneecap to visit the Nova Exhibition in Toronto and experience firsthand the stories of those who were murdered, those who survived, and those are still being held hostage,\" the organizers said. \"Not to shame or silence \u2014 but to connect. To witness. To understand.\"",

    "summary": "Republicans released a package of revisions to their massive party-line bill for President Donald Trump's agenda Wednesday night, with the hope of quickly bringing it to the House floor and passing it.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 After a marathon hearing, the GOP-led House Rules Committee advanced a sweeping package for President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda Wednesday night, teeing it up for a vote in the full chamber.",
      "Members of the committee met starting at 1 a.m. ET Wednesday and adjourned around 10:40 p.m. ET before they voted for the legislation along party lines, 8-4.",
      "The vote came shortly after Republicans released a set of revisions to their massive bill, a product of last-minute negotiations to placate various factions of the party, including conservative hard-liners and blue-state Republicans, that were threatening to sink the measure.",
      "The 42-page amendment to the multitrillion-dollar legislation includes moving up the enforcement of work requirements for eligible Medicaid recipients by two years, to the end of 2026, phasing out clean energy tax credits earlier and expanding the federal deduction for state and local taxes to $40,000 for people earning less than $500,000 annually.",
      "It's unclear exactly when the House will take up the package for a vote. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., navigating a narrow three-seat majority in the chamber, had said he hoped to hold the vote Wednesday night or Thursday morning.",
      "Here are some of the biggest changes GOP leaders made to Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" Wednesday.",
      "Medicaid changes",
      "In a win for conservative hard-liners in the House Freedom Caucus, the agreement speeds up the timeline when work requirements would kick in for able-bodied adults ages 18 to 64 to be able to receive Medicaid benefits.",
      "The original legislation, adopted by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for work requirements to start at the beginning of 2029. But anti-spending hawks, led by Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., pushed to have them begin \"not later than Dec. 31, 2026,\" so savings would take effect sooner.",
      "The new language would also allow states to move the date to earlier if they chose to do so.",
      "Shifting the start date sooner would mean millions of people could lose Medicaid benefits before the 2028 presidential election, and some could possibly lose them before the 2026 midterm election. That could be a political liability for Republicans up and down the ballot, though Trump and congressional GOP leaders say they are simply rooting out \"fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "In another significant shift, states that declined the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act would get higher payments as an incentive to encourage them not to expand the program.",
      "Clean energy credits",
      "The Freedom Caucus notched another victory in its eleventh-hour negotiations: more quickly phasing out clean energy tax breaks from former President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The measure would cut off production and investment tax credits for any facility if the construction began 60 days after the bill was enacted, or after 2028.",
      "The revised bill would also unwind credits for wind and solar leasing arrangements for properties.",
      "\u201cWe worked with the White House to get some important revisions to expedite the phase out,\u201d Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters. \u201cLook, President Trump doesn\u2019t want these, either, and so we worked with them to get really tight language to limit dramatically any new projects from starting.\u201d",
      "Boosting the SALT cap",
      "Republicans who represent districts in high-tax blue states said their top priority in the package was raising the SALT cap, the amount federal taxpayers can deduct in state and local taxes.",
      "The original legislation, passed out of the Ways and Means Committee, hiked the SALT cap to $30,000, up from the current $10,000 cap imposed in Trump's 2017 tax cut law. But members of the SALT Caucus slammed that increase as insufficient.",
      "The new bill would boost the SALT cap to $40,000 for people making less than $500,000 a year. Both the cap and the income level would increase by 1% annually for 10 years.",
      "\"This is the No. 1 federal issue for my constituents. If I do a bad deal, I would expect my constituents to throw me out. If I did a deal at $30,000, my own mother wouldn't vote for me,\" Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., said this week in the middle of the negotiations.",
      "\"Now is the time to make it right what we got wrong in 2017; now is the time to deliver on promises that we've made,\" he added.",
      "'MAGA Accounts' renamed to 'Trump Accounts'",
      "In a more trivial change to the bill, Republicans are renaming their tax-preferred savings accounts that parents could set up for children\u00a0from \"MAGA Accounts\" to \"Trump Accounts.\"",
      "The first line of the manager's amendment reads, \"Page 10, in the item relating to section 110115, strike 'MAGA' and insert 'Trump'.\""

      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine \u2014 An unusual May nor\u2019easter is set to wallop New England on Thursday, providing a soaking before the Memorial Day holiday weekend with weather more commonly associated with fall and winter.",
      "Nor\u2019easters usually arrive in the end of fall and winter and bring high winds, rough seas and precipitation in the form of rain or snow. This week\u2019s nor\u2019easter could bring wind gusts over 40 mph  and up to 2 inches of rain in some areas. Snow is even possible at high elevations.",
      "The storm has New Englanders preparing for a messy couple of days during a time of year usually reserved for sunshine and cookouts.",
      "What is a nor\u2019easter?",
      "A nor\u2019easter is an East Coast storm that is so named because winds over the coastal area are typically from the northeast, according to the National Weather Service. The storms can happen at any time of the year, but they are at their most frequent and strongest between September and April, according to the service.",
      "The storms have caused billions of dollars in damage in the past. They usually reach the height of their strength in New England and eastern Canada. The storms often disrupt traffic and power grids and can cause severe damage to homes and businesses.",
      "\u201cWe have a stronger jet stream, which is helping intensify a low pressure system that just happens to be coming up the coast. And so that\u2019s how it got the nor\u2019easter name,\u201d said Kyle Pederson, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Boston.",
      "Who will get rain and snow",
      "The heaviest rain is likely to fall in Rhode Island and southern and eastern Massachusetts, Pederson said. Localized nuisance flooding and difficult driving conditions are possible Thursday, and catastrophic flooding is not expected.",
      "The storm is then expected to pass, leaving light rain and patchy drizzle, on Friday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just really a nice dose of rain for the region \u2014 not expecting much for flooding,\u201d Pederson said.",
      "Snow is expected to be confined to mountainous areas, but accumulations there are possible.",
      "Why nor\u2019easters are rare in May",
      "Nor\u2019easters are usually winter weather events, and it is unusual to see them in May. They typically form when there are large temperature differences from west to east during winter when there is cold air over land and the oceans are relatively warm.",
      "But right now there is a traffic jam in the atmosphere because of an area of high pressure in the Canadian Arctic that is allowing unusually cold air to funnel down over the Northeast. The low pressure system off the East Coast is being fueled by a jet stream that is unusually south at the moment.",
      "\u201cIt really is a kind of a winter-type setup that you rarely see this late,\u201d said Judah Cohen, seasonal forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research.",
      "If this type of pattern in the atmosphere happened two months earlier, he said, \u201cwe\u2019d be talking about a crippling snowstorm in the Northeastern U.S., not just a wet start to Memorial Day weekend.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House has removed official transcripts of President Donald Trump\u2019s public remarks from its government website, replacing them with selected videos of his public appearances.",
      "As recently as Sunday, transcripts of Trump\u2019s speeches and comments were still showing up in the \u201cRemarks\u201d section of WhiteHouse.gov. The next day, they were gone, snapshots of the site from an internet archive show. The only transcript appearing now is of Trump\u2019s inaugural address on Jan. 20.",
      "Government stenographers are still recording and transcribing Trump\u2019s remarks, a White House official said. But in an internal policy change in recent days, the White House took down the transcripts in favor of audio and video of his appearances.",
      "The idea behind the move is that people will get a fuller and more accurate sense of Trump by watching and listening to him as opposed to reading a transcript, which they may not be inclined to do anyway, the official said. Purging the transcripts and switching to audio and video of Trump's remarks was intended to create \"consistency\" across the website, the official said.",
      "\u201cIn an effort to maintain consistency, previous transcripts that were available have been removed and replaced with the audio and visual components of that transcript,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe White House continues to work to upload the multitude of public engagements that the president has done and will continue to make sure that the website consists of a full and complete representation of the president\u2019s public comments.\u201d",
      "In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \u201cThe president\u2019s remarks are live on the website for every person in the world, including journalists, to access and watch for themselves. The Trump White House is the most transparent in history.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance\u2019s office continues to make public transcripts of his remarks, sending them out to the media. Since last month, Vance\u2019s office has shared eight transcripts with reporters, including his comments at a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a speech he gave about U.S. manufacturing and another one that involved the war between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Asked why Vance is putting out official transcripts while Trump is not, Vance\u2019s office declined to comment.",
      "Historians and former White House officials denounced the move to do away with public transcripts that have long served as the definitive record of what the president says in public.",
      "\"I hope he and his communications team see the light on this,\u201d said Barbara Perry, a co-chair of the presidential oral history program at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not only good for history, which they may not care about, but they do care about how he\u2019s viewed by history. And second, they should also realize that it is his very communication style and substance that won him the presidency twice.\u201d",
      "A public transcript also provides some protection for Trump if he feels misquoted or misunderstood. He can point to the document to settle the issue.",
      "Transcripts coming out of the White House have at times become points of contention. Days before the 2024 election, President Joe Biden made a comment that seemed to disparage Trump voters.",
      "A comedian speaking at a Trump rally had referred to Puerto Rico as a \"floating island of garbage.\"",
      "Speaking to a Latino audience, Biden said, \"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.\" That comment had the potential to alienate millions of voters on the eve of the election and potentially harm Democratic nominee Kamala Harris' chances.",
      "The Biden press office, however, altered the stenographer's transcript and instead released a document that changed the meaning of his remarks, adding an apostrophe so that the quote read \"supporter's\" \u2014 an apparent reference to the comedian who had made the remark, according to The Associated Press.",
      "President Barack Obama once mistakenly used the word \"abortion\" in an interview when he meant to say, \"aberration,\" said Beck Dorey-Stein, who was a White House stenographer during his presidency and in the first couple of months of Trump's last term. Obama aides flagged Obama's bit of misspeak, but the transcript was allowed to stand, Dorey-Stein said.",
      "In another transcript kerfuffle, in 2007, President George W. Bush talked about how \"childrens do learn when standards are high and results are measured.\" The official transcript, however, changed the word to \"children.\" The White House insisted it had not asked for the edit and had it changed back to Bush's actual words.",
      "Withholding transcripts \u201cseems really irresponsible and a self-inflicted wound,\u201d Dorey-Stein said. \u201cWith a transcript he can say, \u2018This is exactly what I said.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cHow many times in the press briefing room would someone say, \u2018President Obama said this,\u2019 and the press secretary would say, \u2018No, he didn\u2019t. Check the transcript\u2019? Now, there\u2019s no way for anyone to check the transcript,\u201d she added.",
      "Others questioned the rationale the White House official put forward. The real motivation may be that Trump\u2019s frequent digressions \u2014 which he calls \u201cthe weave\u201d \u2014 can come off as gibberish in written form, critics said.",
      "Perhaps the White House \u201cdidn\u2019t want \u2018the weave\u2019 exposed,\u201d said Mike McCurry, a press secretary in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House.",
      "The last presidential event that the White House transcribed and made public happened more than two months ago \u2014 an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.",
      "Though some videos of Trump's appearances are available on the White House's website, many are not.",
      "The site shows 10 videos in April, including events with Ohio State University\u2019s football team, the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, the Philadelphia Eagles football team and the Italian and Norwegian prime ministers.",
      "Not shown are videos of more than two dozen events Trump participated in last month. Among them is an Oval Office meeting on April 14 with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, who is accepting migrants deported from the United States and putting them in a maximum-security prison. In the meeting, Trump said he wanted Bukele to take in as many criminals \u201cas possible.\u201d",
      "Also missing are videos of Trump's various interactions with the media. There is no record, for example, of a Q&A with reporters on April 17 covering issues involving a school shooting at Florida State University (\u201cThe gun doesn\u2019t do the shooting; the people do,\u201d he said) and Harvard University\u2019s tax-exempt status (\u201cI think Harvard is a disgrace. They\u2019re obviously antisemitic.\").",
      "This month, the White House website has posted 11 videos of Trump\u2019s appearances. That accounts for less than half of the Q&A sessions with the media and other events Trump has participated in so far.",
      "The left-out events include a meeting with Canada\u2019s new prime minister, Mark Carney, who batted down Trump\u2019s interest in making Canada the 51st state.",
      "\u201cCanada won\u2019t be for sale, ever,\u201d Carney said.",
      "Past White Houses routinely publicized the official transcripts of the president\u2019s remarks. Indeed, in the first four months of Trump\u2019s first term, the White House posted more than 100 transcripts of his remarks. By contrast, in Trump\u2019s new term, his White House posted only 30 before they disappeared.",
      "Dorey-Stein said that in her brief stint at the start of Trump\u2019s first term, the new president\u2019s aides were wary of the stenographer corps. A former press officer said that the stenographers were positioning their microphones too close to Trump\u2019s face and that he did not like it, Dorey-Stein recalled.",
      "\u201cAt the time, there was an overwhelming feeling of distrust,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThey really felt we were an extension of the press rather than a safeguard.\u201d"

      "Jim Irsay, who grew up around the NFL's Colts before he assumed control of the team himself, died in his sleep Wednesday at 65, the team announced.",
      "No cause of death was given. Irsay had battled health issues in recent years. When he appeared at the Indianapolis Colts' training camp last summer, it was his first public appearance since the previous season, The Indianapolis Star reported, and he told the Star that he had been recuperating after having undergone several operations following a fall at his home.",
      "Irsay was 13 when his father, Robert, bought the Baltimore Colts in 1972. When the franchise moved to Indianapolis in 1984, the younger Irsay was named vice president and general manager; he became its chief operating officer in 1996.",
      "Upon his father's death in 1997, Irsay took over his family's business as the team's owner and chief executive. His time in ownership overlapped with the arrival of quarterback Peyton Manning, who led the Colts to a win in the Super Bowl in 2007.",
      "\u201cJim\u2019s love and appreciation for the NFL, in addition to its history, tradition and principles influenced him to become a steward of the game throughout his 50-plus years in the League,\u201d the Colts said in a statement.",
      "NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement that he was \"deeply saddened.\"",
      "\"He spent his life and career in the National Football League,\" Goodell said. \"Starting as a teenager as a Colts\u2019 ballboy, he learned every position in the organization before assuming leadership of the Colts approximately 30 years ago. Jim\u2019s Colts won the Super Bowl, hosted another and built Lucas Oil Stadium.\"",
      "Beyond football, Irsay was known for his collection of pop culture, historic and music artifacts, including guitars played by John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Prince; a first edition of Allen Ginsberg's poem \"Howl\"; and items used by presidents. He had also spoken candidly about his history of addiction. In 2023, he told HBO's \"Real Sports\" that he had been in rehab at least 15 times and had once accidentally overdosed.",
      "Irsay is survived by daughters, Carlie Irsay-Gordon, Casey Foyt and Kalen Jackson."

    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Billy and Tina, the last remaining elephants at the Los Angeles Zoo, were quietly moved this week to a zoo in Oklahoma despite pending lawsuits seeking to have them transferred instead to an animal sanctuary where they could live out their days with more room to roam.",
      "The announcement last month that Billy, 40, and Tina, 59, would be sent to the Tulsa Zoo angered animal advocates who argue that they would be subjected again to an enclosure that's too small for aging elephants.",
      "The move came \"under cover of darkness,\" said Jake Davis, an attorney for the Nonhuman Rights Project. Davis said he received reports that the Asian elephants were transferred out about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday to elude protesters who've been staking out the zoo.",
      "The nonprofit on Tuesday filed a petition asking a court to release Billy and Tina from the L.A. Zoo and send them to one of two accredited sanctuaries appropriate for elephants where they would have full-time care and ample space.",
      "\"At a sanctuary, they could live as nature intended,\" Davis said Wednesday. \"They need massive swaths of land; they need varied terrain.\"",
      "The L.A. Zoo said in a statement Wednesday that the elephants \"have arrived safely at the Tulsa Zoo\" but didn't say when the transfer occurred.",
      "The move was necessary because the Tulsa Zoo has other Asian elephants who will provide important socialization for Billy and Tina because \"keeping them in larger groups is crucial for their well-being,\" especially at their advanced age, the L.A. Zoo statement said. Asian elephants typically live around 60 years.",
      "A move to a sanctuary was considered, but the Tulsa Zoo was the top recommendation based on the standards of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Elephant Species Survival Plan, which considers \"space, herd dynamics, and expertise of the staff,\" the L.A. Zoo said.",
      "\"This option also ensured that Billy and Tina would be able to remain together,\" the statement said.",
      "Davis said he expects the Los Angeles lawsuit will be dismissed, but his group will not give up the fight to get Billy and Tina a sanctuary retirement home. He said his team is exploring legal options in Oklahoma. The Tulsa Zoo didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "A lawsuit filed this month by an L.A. resident sought to halt the elephants' transfer, but a judge denied an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. That lawsuit includes a declaration by the singer Cher, who has advocated for the elephants for years, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "\"Billy and Tina have served their time in confinement,\" Cher said in the declaration. \"They deserve the chance to live out their lives in peace and dignity.\"",
      "The L.A. Zoo referred questions about the court actions to the city attorney's office, which said it doesn't comment on pending litigation.",
      "Los Angeles City Councilmember Bob Blumenfield introduced a motion in April requiring the zoo to explore sanctuary options for the pair. But before the council could act, the zoo went forward with the move, \"thwarting public discourse and transparency,\" In Defense of Animals said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "The nonprofit said the Tulsa Zoo's enclosure is \"cramped, unnatural, and harmful to elephant health,\" with seven animals \"jammed into an enclosure less than one percent the size of their smallest natural range.\"",
      "The Tulsa Zoo said last month that it has renovated and expanded its elephant exhibit, which dedicates 17 of its 124 total acres to pachyderms. A large barn was built in 2024 and an additional 10 acres will be added to the preserve this summer, the zoo said in an April statement.",
      "Zoos across the country have been targeted in recent years by animal activists who criticize living conditions for elephants. Broadly, some elephant experts say urban zoos simply don't have the space that elephants, who roam extensive distances in the wild, need for a normal life.",
      "Some larger zoos such as the Toronto Zoo and San Francisco Zoo have phased out their elephant programs, sending their aging animals to sanctuaries that have far more space.",
      "But other zoos say they are committed to keeping elephants and are turning to breeding, arguing that a sustainable population of zoo elephants will help spur a commitment to wildlife conservation among future generations of visitors.",
      "In New York, the Nonhuman Rights Project filed legal papers to try to free the Asian elephant Happy from the Bronx Zoo but lost in court in 2022. The group then filed similar papers in California to try to free the Fresno Chaffee Zoo 's three African elephants but a judge ruled against the group."

      "On Wednesday, Gilgeous was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player after he produced league-leading averages in points (32.7), free-throw attempts (7.9) and shot attempts (21.8) while leading Oklahoma City to a franchise-record 68 victories and the top seed in the Western Conference for the second consecutive season. The award is voted on by media members.",

      "By the end of the three-hour Season 48 finale, just three castaways lasted to the Final Tribal Council: Kyle, Eva and Joe.",

      "Kyle Fraser won \"Survivor\" 48, Probst revealed. Read on for how it all shook out.",
      "What happened during the 'Survivor' 48 finale?",
      "Following the blindside of Shauhin Davari in the penultimate episode, the final five returned to their Niu Nai camp to discuss Tribal Council. Eva and Joe thanked Kyle for tipping them off that Shauhin had turned on them, not realizing that Kyle and Kamilla concocted a plan to trick the duo into eliminating Shauhin.",
      "Kyle pointed out in his confessional that he was in a good spot, with the option of either sticking beside his strongest ally, Kamilla, or going to the final three with Eva and Joe. But, he still had more obstacles to tackle, like winning the next immunity challenge. He also worried about how Eva planned to play her hidden immunity idol.",
      "Meanwhile, Kamilla marveled at her lying abilities, adding that she planned to own all her deceptive game play if she made it to Final Tribal Council.",
      "But first, the players had to unlock a puzzle that would give them an advantage in the next challenge. Eva secured the advantage by cracking the code.",
      "At the next immunity challenge, which also included a pasta-filled reward, Probst welcomed the final five and explained that Eva's advantage allowed her to skip one of the ball toss sections. But despite the leg up, Kamilla pulled off the victory in a \u201cmassive comeback,\u201d as the host said.",
      "After Kamilla secured her spot in the final four, the other finalists had multiple conversations to decide who would join the jury as the next castaway voted out of \u201cSurvivor\" 48. Although the obvious choice seemed to be to get rid of Joe, Kamilla and Kyle contemplated eliminating Mitch instead. They were convinced that Mitch could make a better pitch to the jury if he made it to the end of the game.",
      "So when the second-to-last Tribal Council began, Mitch was a sitting duck. Kyle directly told Probst that Mitch's name was tossed around at camp. Mitch became emotional as he said it \"sucked\" knowing his game was over. But, he said he didn't have any regrets.",
      "With Mitch getting his torch snuffed, the final four journeyed to the Niu Nai camp, again, and celebrated.",
      "The next morning, the final four watched the sunrise together. In her confessional, Eva said she would take Joe to the end despite him being a strong competitor. Kamilla had a different plan for her other half in the game. She told Kyle she would select him to make fire against Joe. Kyle agreed with her thinking. As for Joe, he wanted to go to the end with Eva.",
      "For the final immunity challenge, Probst said the final four would have to\u00a0participate in a \"Survivor\" \"classic.\" The ball challenge, called \"Simmotion,\" which has appeared in multiple past seasons, required concentration and hand-eye coordination.",
      "After a close battle with Joe, Kyle became the last \u201cSurvivor\" 48 contestant to have the immunity necklace placed around his neck. He was also tasked with choosing which castaway would automatically join him in the finale, thus confirming the other two would have to participate in the fire-making challenge.",
      "Kyle upheld a promise he made before the challenge and told Joe he was taking him to the final three, meaning Eva and Kamilla had to make fire. While prepping for the challenge, Eva became overwhelmed. Joe offered to take her spot, but she declined. So, he sat with her and shared some tips to improve her fire-making skills.",
      "Before facing off, the jury looked stunned to learn that Kyle chose Joe. Each player then sat at their respective stations and began building their fires. Eva easily pulled off the victory, cementing her spot in the final three, as Kamilla struggled to get anything going.",
      "On Day 26, the last day of the season, Kyle, Joe and Eva enjoyed their breakfast feast as viewers heard the jury \u2014 Cedrek McFadden, Chrissy Sarnowsky, David Kinne, Star Toomey, Mary Zheng, Shauhin, Mitch and Kamilla \u2014 share what they hoped to hear at Final Tribal Council.",
      "As the sun set, Eva, Kyle and Joe made their way to Probst, ready to be grilled by the eliminated cast members.",
      "Probst advised them, \"Own your game and claim your victory,\" before the questions began.",
      "Multiple secrets were spilled, including Kyle revealing his true occupation as a lawyer and his undercover partnership with Kamilla.",
      "For their final pitches, Kyle said he was the most well-rounded player because he built strong relationships and played in the middle all season long. Joe spoke about being a 45-year-old firefighter and needing the money to take care of his family. Eva said  there has never been a player like her on the show and that she \"embodied\" the season by being \"unprecedented.\"",
      "After the votes were cast, Probst revealed that Kyle won, receiving five votes. Eva had two and Joe had one, marking a rare occasion in which all three finalists received votes at Final Tribal Council.",

      "\u201cI see it at the beginning. I always know my beginning scene,\u201d Flynn says. \"I pictured it with \u2018Gone Girl \u2014 a man coming home to a house and the door is wide open, and that moment of feeling like, \u2018Why is the door wide open?\u2019\u201d",
      "As a self-proclaimed true crime fanatic, Flynn says her initial scenario invoked fear around, \u201cWhat would it be like to have your spouse mysteriously disappear? And everyone says, \u2018It\u2019s always the husband.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd you cannot not look guilty. Because if you\u2019re crying, people say, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s putting on a show.\u2019 And if you\u2019re not crying, people say, \u2018Oh, he doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s a freak.\u2019\u201d she adds. \u201cSo, you know, I started playing with that from there.\u201d",
      "For any book Flynn writes, be it her 2006 debut \"Sharp Objects\" or 2012's \u201cGone Girl,\u201d the plot unfolds as she gets inside her characters' heads.",
      "This means Flynn reaches the story's end nearly at the same point the reader does \u2014 but she gets to choose how the characters are remembered in their final moments on the page.",
      "For \u201cGone Girl,\u201d Flynn says the twisted ending readers now know didn\u2019t always exist. Instead, she tells TODAY.com how the book originally painted characters Amy and Nick.",
      "\u201cThere was the one (ending) I was originally going to go with \u2014 that you didn\u2019t know that Amy had framed Nick until the very end, so you didn\u2019t meet Amy at all,\u201d Flynn says, explaining that the draft's entire story was \u201call Nick\u2019s point of view as he\u2019s bouncing around, looking more and more guilty.\u201d",
      "In this end of the story, which \u201cno one read\u201d aside from Flynn, the reader would have discovered Amy framed the man they\u2019d been following for the entire novel, naturally prompting more sympathy for Nick.",
      "\u201cAnd then I started thinking, \u2018Who is this woman who did all this stuff?\u2019 I kept getting obsessed with, \u2018Who would do this?\u2019 And so then I was like, \u2018I need Amy in this story. I can\u2019t hide her until then. That\u2019s no fun,\u2019\u201d Flynn says.",
      "As readers know, Amy became the focal point of the page-turner. But Flynn wrote other endings, too.",
      "\u201cI had the Ozark grifters come back into (Amy\u2019s) life at the end and frame her,\u201d Flynn says. \u201cI did have one ending where she was going to go to jail and that lasted for a day, literally. I was like, \u2018She would never go to jail. Amy would never go to jail.\u2019\u201d",
      "Though Flynn is known for her twists, she says she's more interesting in making points about the human psyche and larger-scale world issues.",
      "\u201cI always say, I write character studies and themes, and I hide it all inside the chocolate of a juicy mystery, so that I can get people to read it,\u201d she says.",
      "Now, Flynn is working on screenwriting and also became a publisher herself, starting her own imprint, Gillian Flynn Books.",
      "Flynn chatted with TODAY.com about her books, her new imprint and the advice she'd give aspiring authors.",
      "This interview has been edited.",
      "How did you decide to make the move into publishing with Gillian Flynn Books?",
      "It started with Molly Stern, who was my publisher during \u201cGone Girl,\u201d asking me if I'd be interested in an imprint.",
      "I wasn't looking to have an imprint. But I realized I could create my own mission statement and could make sure there were voices getting out there who weren't just copying whatever previous popular book was, falling into a pre-arranged shape or done only by people who already have platform.",
      "I find a really dangerous trend, that this current market is really squashing out the kind of voices that I love, which are the quirky, weird, off kilter, not easy to put inside a box.",
      "The current series that I\u2019m publishing, Margot Douaihy\u2019s series, is about a punk rock former addict nun who is totally tattooed and solves mysteries in New Orleans. Or Stacey Horn\u2019s nonfiction book, \u201cThe Killing Fields of East New York,\u201d is all about white collar crime and how it decimated a community. These are things that aren\u2019t necessarily going to get snapped up immediately. And I wanted to give that voice.",
      "Was it intentional that all the authors you've published so far have been female?",
      "It is not. It has just happened to be the ones that have come to me that I really, really love. It has not been an intentional thing, but it has been the ones so far that have really drawn me.",
      "Would you agree the audience predominantly consuming crime and thriller storylines are women? Why do you think that is?",
      "I think women are more acquainted with fear than men are. We live with it as part of our everyday. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t obsess you or control you too much, but I don\u2019t know any woman who doesn\u2019t, in the very back of her mind go, \u2018\" could walk out the door and if I walk down the wrong corner, if I stay out too late, if I get in the wrong place, something really, really bad could happen to me.\" I don\u2019t know very many women who haven\u2019t had some sort of close up moment that made them a little frightened. I mean, we all carry that with us.",
      "I think the crime genre, when it\u2019s done right, really can touch on that issue and give us a vocabulary and a means to talk about it, and give us almost a way to purge that fear a little bit \u2014 understanding that it\u2019s out there and that I\u2019m not crazy. Sometimes you have that moment of, like, \u2018\"m I crazy to be nervous in this situation? Is it me?\" And the answer is f------ better safe than sorry.",
      "Writing wise, what are you working on right now?",
      "I\u2019m working on a lot, writing wise. Most of it is screenplay stuff. Ever since I did adapted \u201cGone Girl\u201d for the screen, I\u2019ve been really attracted to screenwriting and creating film and TV. And that\u2019s largely because I grew up in a household where my mom taught reading and my dad taught film. And so, to me, they\u2019re both equally viable ways of telling a story.",
      "The one I\u2019m most excited about is adapting \u201cDark Places,\" my second book, for HBO. It's not official yet, but fingers crossed.",
      "I\u2019ve told myself that after I get these couple projects done, that I\u2019m going to shut down that part for a little bit and just finish this book I\u2019m writing. It\u2019s daunting writing a book after \u201cGone Girl.\u201d You have the demons on your shoulder going, \u201cIs this too much like \u2018Gone Girl\u2019? Is it not enough like \u2018Gone Girl\u2019?\u201d",
      "What is your initial writing process like?",
      "I write in my head all the time. I can\u2019t turn it off. I was writing something in my head on the way to work today, on the way to the office, that is not going to go anywhere. It was just something I was thinking about, like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a great line. What is that? Where\u2019s that line go?\u201d It\u2019s describing a character or describing a moment or scenery.",
      "One of the walls in my office is a whiteboard. It's got whiteboard wallpaper just entirely on it, which is fantastic for a writer. But it looks like the scribblings of a mad woman because I just write different ideas for different projects. People will look at it and it really does look like a crazy person because it's all over.",
      "Do you still write down those random ideas?",
      "Yeah. I\u2019ll probably never remember where it\u2019s at or to look at it. But every once in a while I do go like, \u201cAh, I wrote that down somewhere.\u201d But I\u2019m like, \u201cDid I write in my email? Did I write on my wall. Is it in a notebook?\u201d",
      "What does the rewriting process look like for you?",
      "I loop around and rewrite a little bit as I go. But my aim is generally to get a crappy first draft. And that's what I would tell anyone who wants to be a writer because you're never going to know what's wrong with your story until you have a really crappy first draft. And then don't be afraid of it. You can go back and see what's wrong.",
      "Then I rewrite and I rewrite and I rewrite. I mean, I love rewriting. That's when I get happy. That's my happy spot. Though, writing the actual opening draft is terrifying \u2014 and it's suspenseful because you really don't know where you're going.",
      "At what point do you let people read?",
      "Not until it\u2019s done. Third or fourth draft. I want to make sure that I\u2019m writing the book I want to write. I think you give it to people early on, and they\u2019re telling you, \u201cOh, I could do this.\u201d Even if you really respect them, and it\u2019s a great idea, it\u2019s not what I want. It\u2019s really hard to get to a point where you say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to you to tell me what I should do here.\u201d",
      "So I figure it all out. I get it in really, really good shape. And then I give it to my husband, first and foremost. He\u2019s an amazing reader and editor, basically. And then I give it to a very small circle of friends \u2014 very small, like, two.",
      "Have you ever made major changes after hearing feedback?",
      "I will admit, I give it to people and I change very little afterwards. I\u2019ll listen, though. My husband will say something like, \u201cThis scene is cool. It goes on a little long.\u201d OK, yeah.",
      "I take it back \u2014 for \u201cDark Places,\u201d he did give me some criticism. I made big changes on that one. But for the most part, it\u2019s more, \u201cThis seemed to go on too long. Make your point. Should I move along from this?\u201d That sort of thing.",
      "Do you have any advice for writers navigating the world of publishing right now?",
      "Whatever you do, don't chase what seems popular right now. It's very tempting. It may pay off, but you're still always going to be the knockoff of someone else. You're going to be the, \"If you like so and so, you'll like this person.\" And how much do you want to be that? Do you want to have your own voice? That's why you're writing. So even though the market is tighter, the great voices do get found. It may take a little longer, but it's about unique, interesting, great writing.",
      "When I did \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d we got rejected quite a bit. At that time, it was sort of strange. People always said women don\u2019t want to read about dark women, and we proved that wrong. Might take more. Might take a little longer. But it\u2019ll get there if you have a bold and unique voice. Those are the ones that usually make it through the clutter of all the imitators."

      "\u201cI think Willie (Geist) is one of the most amazing interviewers,\u201d Sara Hamlin, a longtime fan and Chicago resident tells TODAY.com at a reception ahead of Willie\u2019s Sunday Sitdown Live with guest Ina Garten on May 19. \u201cHe\u2019s just different than any other interviewer, and Ina is one of my favorite chefs.\u201d",
      "Along with her husband Scott, Hamlin flew into New York City just to see Willie speak with his friend Garten at City Winery at Pier 57.",
      "\u201cShe made me feel like I could actually cook,\u201d Sara says of the Barefoot Contessa, adding that she regularly makes her roast chicken recipe. \u201cIt\u2019s a bucket list for me to be here to see two of my favorite people. We\u2019ve never seen her in person before.\u201d",
      "And the Hamlins aren\u2019t the only far-flung fans to make the trip to the event.",
      "\u201cThe one thing that I do is rosemary lemon chicken,\u201d Luz Rivera, who traveled from St. Pete, Florida, tells TODAY.com of her go-to recipe: Garten\u2019s Tuscan Lemon Chicken.",
      "\u201cNails it!\u201d Simeon Pappas, her husband, chimes in. \u201cWhen she makes that, there\u2019s no chicken left at the end between the two of us, not when we have five friends over, either.\u201d",
      "Other folks in attendance from Dallas, Texas, San Diego, California and other stretches of the U.S. dressed to the nines in sparkly skirt-sets, pearl-embroidered collars, Garten-esque scarves and denim to see the woman who personifies simple comfort, at least according to Tina Fey on \u201c30 Rock.\u201d",
      "Fans from as far as Canada made the journey to see Willie and Garten chat and do a short cooking demo, too \u2014 a kind of dedication that our host finds thrilling.",
      "\u201cIt still blows me away,\u201d Willie tells TODAY.com backstage. \u201cThese people out there feel strongly and passionately about our show, so let\u2019s bring them into the room.\u201d",
      "Garten walked onstage to Eartha Kitt\u2019s \u201cC\u2019est Si Bon\u201d to an audience of more than 500 fans, who gave the francophile a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cLove the music,\u201d Garten said with a smile.",
      "\u201cYes, right? Little French music for Ina,\u201d Willie replied, to laughter from everyone in the room.",
      "During their sitdown, Garten spoke with Willie about her memoir \u201cBe Ready When the Luck Happens,\u201d dinner party no-nos, her relationship with husband Jeffrey and her Food Network show \u201cBe My Guest,\u201d which has welcomed such names as Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jennifer Garner and Stanley Tucci.",
      "\u201cThe list of people who sort of make the pilgrimage to your barn is amazing,\u201d Willie said, before asking if she had a dream guest. The crowd listened in rapt attention \u2014 and Garten didn\u2019t hesitate with her answer.",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift,\u201d she said to cheers and applause.",
      "Garten and Swift have become close over the years, sharing mutual admiration. The cookbook author has previously shared that she first met the 14-time Grammy winner at TODAY. Later, their budding friendship was cemented when Food Network Magazine asked musicians who their favorite Food Network cooks were.",
      "\u201cTaylor chose me, which was so sweet,\u201d Garten said.",
      "Garten added that Swift has been to the barn \u2014 the Contessa\u2019s nickname for her East Hampton home \u2014 about 10 years ago, and they spent time in her kitchen.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t wanna just stand there and take pictures of her,\u201d Garten said with a chuckle. \u201cI wanted to cook with her.\u201d",
      "She said she asked Swift\u2019s longtime publicist Tree Paine what the pop star likes to eat and was told the \u201cBlank Space\u201d singer\u2019s favorites are Garten\u2019s mustard-roasted fish, filet of beef and date nut spice bread, but Garten ultimately decided against those options.",
      "\u201cA friend of mine said, \u2018That doesn\u2019t sound like Taylor Swift, that sounds like a Ukrainian grandmother,\u2019\u201d Garten said to laughter. \u201cI was, like, \u2018Okay, we\u2019re not gonna make any of those things.\u2019\u201d",
      "Instead, Garten decided to make pavlova. Her recipe tosses blueberries, raspberries and strawberries in a framboise-spiked berry sauce over a big meringue base.",

      "The decision, he said, coincides with his multimedia company, More Better Industries, increasing its global investments, which now includes soccer teams in Colombia and Mexico.",
      "\"As our business and our storytelling is expanding into other regions of the world and other languages in which my name is even harder to pronounce, I\u2019m just going by Rob Mac,\u201d he said.",

      "Last month, family members who celebrated his birthday with McElhenney confided they, too, were interested in a name change.",
      "Olson, who tied the knot with McElhenney in 2008, told Variety she and the couple's sons \u2014 Axel Lee, 14, and Leo Grey, 13 \u2014\u00a0weren't sure what to make of the idea.",

      "The essay itself is dense and sophisticated, exploring parallels between public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and strategies for confronting climate change. But tucked inside all that research is something more personal: a peek into the thoughts of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner's eldest child.",
      "According to Violet, Garner was \u201cshell-shocked, astonished, at the scale of destruction\u201d wrought by the wildfires in the neighborhood where she is raising her family. Garner, 53, and Affleck, who divorced in 2018, are also parents to Fin, 16, and Samuel, 13.",
      "\u201cI was surprised at her surprise: as a lifelong Angelena and climate-literate member of generation Z, my question had not been whether the Palisades would burn but when,\u201d Violet wrote.",
      "The January, 2025 fires in the Los Angeles area killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes.",
      "Violet, a rising sophomore at Yale, recounted growing increasingly frustrated with other adults who dismissed the crisis as if it were merely a \u201cburst of bad luck.\u201d",

      "In 2024, Violet delivered a passionate speech at a Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors meeting, pushing back against proposed mask bans in public spaces and healthcare settings. She spoke from personal experience, having dealt with a post-viral condition herself, and stressed how serious and long-lasting the effects of viral infections can be, especially for vulnerable communities.",
      "Violet also has a knack for language. When dad Ben Affleck appeared on TODAY in April, he described Violet as a \"student of Spanish.\" He studied the subject at the University of Vermont.",

Moore also founded DNA Detectives, which helps people connect with their biological families \u2014 no \"Finding Your Roots\" needed.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Moore explained that much of her work doesn\u2019t make the episode. Each \u201cBook of Life\u201d takes hundreds of hours to create. The show tapes Gates\u2019 presentation of the book for about four hours \u2014 and the final edit is a fraction of that.",
      "Below, Moore shares more notable discoveries throughout her decade on \u201cFinding Your Roots.\u201d",
      "Henry Louis Gates Jr.",
      "Gates simultaneously asked Moore to work on his family secret that he\u2019d learned about at age nine, which Moore would be tasked with working on for the next decade. It culminated in one of the most satisfying \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d discoveries for Moore in the show\u2019s history, causing Gates to tear up during the filming while Moore hosted in Gates\u2019 place.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so meaningful because his original family mystery is really what sparked all of this,\u201d Moore told TODAY.com in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know if finding your roots would even exist if he hadn\u2019t been so intrigued with that mystery.\u201d",
      "The findings of the mystery, uncovered in the season 11 finale of the show, revealed the life surrounding Gates\u2019 great-great-grandmother Jane Gates, uncovering the husband of Jane Gates as well as estate papers showing her listed in slave records along with her two sons.",
      "Moore, who spent over a decade working on the project, learned the identity of Gates\u2019 great-great-grandfather Charles Wesley Kelly in 2017 thanks to the growth of public DNA databases online. Despite finding the identity of Kelly, she wanted to provide Gates with a full spectrum of information on his family tree.",
      "\u201cTrying to give my friend and my colleague information that would be valuable and meaningful to him, it was pretty daunting,\u201d Moore laughs.",
      "The result was worth the wait; Moore uncovered over 300 of Jane Gates\u2019 descendants who gathered for a Gates family reunion, a full-circle moment for the \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d host.",
      "LL Cool J",
      "In a 2016 episode of \u201cFinding Your Roots,\u201d rapper and actor LL Cool J, born James Todd Smith, appeared on the show to discuss his family\u2019s roots.",
      "When Moore examined the rapper\u2019s mother\u2019s DNA, she realized his mother\u2019s DNA did not match any predecessors on the family tree.",
      "Moore later discovered LL Cool J\u2019s mother, Ondrea Griffith, was adopted, meaning that the rapper was not related to his grandparents.",
      "LL Cool J was raised in his grandparents\u2019 house after his father, James Nunya, shot his mother and grandfather. Though they both survived, LL Cool J found the two wounded on the floor, a traumatic experience for the rapper, which he wrote about in his memoir.",
      "\u201cThat was tremendously concerning, because it\u2019s not something we would surprise him with on camera. That would not be kind,\u201d Moore recalls about the discovery.",
      "Ahead of filming, Gates called LL Cool J to see if he wanted to proceed, as is the show\u2019s policy. He insisted he wanted to discuss it on camera, and his mother agreed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little devastating to know that the guy that raised me, the guy that was so kind to me, wasn\u2019t my blood,\u201d LL Cool J said during the episode.",
      "Moore compared Griffith\u2019s DNA to a database of millions of available samples and found a match with a half sister named Claudia Lewis, sharing 24.7% matching DNA, which led to the discovery of LL Cool J\u2019s biological grandfather, Nathaniel Christy Lewis.",
      "Moore also discovered LL Cool J\u2019s maternal grandmother, a woman named Ethel Mae Jolly, quickly learning that Jolly was still alive in her late 80s.",
      "Moore told TODAY.com that LL Cool J and his mom ended up meeting Jolly, saying that the rapper took his grandmother \u201cunder his wing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey ended up really bonding and becoming close, and it made a huge difference for both LL Cool J\u2019s mother and her mother,\u201d Moore says, \u201cThat was the first really significant DNA story that was on the show.\u201d",
      "Looking back, Moore says \u201cadoptees really gained a lot from watching that episode.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought it was very compassionate that he and his mom decided to go ahead and let the public share in that discovery,\u201d she continues.",
      "Joe Manganiello",
      "Moore says actor Joe Manganiello \"has the richest, most varied, intricate family history\" she's ever worked on.",
      "During the episode, Manganiello discovered his great-grandfather was a German soldier, unearthed what his family endured during the Armenian genocide and learned he had Black ancestry.",
      "Manganiello\u2019s great-grandmother on his mother\u2019s side, Terviz \u201cRose\u201d Darakjian, was a survivor of the Armenian genocide. Nearly all of her family was killed, including her husband, parents and seven of her eight children.",
      "Using DNA evidence, Moore discovered Manganiello's grandmother became pregnant by a German soldier in a refugee camp after fleeing during the Armenian genocide.",
      "Then, on his father's side, DNA evidence revealed that Manganiello showed no genetic relation to the man he assumed to be his father\u2019s father. Manganiello\u2019s father had no idea he was not raised by his biological father, but agreed to share the findings on the PBS show.",
      "Manganiello eventually learned his biological paternal grandfather was of African American descent.",
      "Moore says that the countless discoveries made in the episode inspired Mangianello to continue research after the show, the first guest to become invested in genealogy afterwards.",
      "\u201cHe talked at one point like, \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll quit being an actor and I\u2019ll become a genetic genealogist.\u2019 That\u2019s how much he loved it,\u201d Moore says"

      "Wendt, as Bob Swerski, would open the sketch, with cigar in hand, by casually announcing he\u2019s filling in for his brother, Bill, who suffered another heart attack. The panelists, of course, are surrounded by artery-clogging foods on the table around them; a heart attack is as natural a byproduct as quenching their thirst with a beer after eating the caloric explosion of cuisine set before them.",

      "\u201cThey just had this swagger to them and I just, in my head, I was like, \u2018Da Bears!\u2019\u201d Smigel once told Antenna TV.",

You didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d",
      "Joe Mantegna appeared in the sketch the first time it aired. Wendt would step in for the second sketch later in 1991, a point in which Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls began their run of six NBA titles that decade. That marked a turning point for the sketch.",

      "When she spotted the result, Engemann gasped, took a huge step back, covered her face with her arm and began to sob. The test was positive. But she knew it wasn't hers.",
      "In a confessional interview, Engemann described how unsettling it was to look at a positive pregnancy test.",
      "Though she asked for the pregnant women to reveal themselves, Matthews and Neely (who had previously announced their pregnancies on social media) remained silent.",
      "This situation was \"the exact opposite\" of how Neely said she wanted to reveal her pregnancy to the group.",
      "\"This is also my moment that I don't want to be taken away from me, and I also want to be sensitive to how (Demi is) feeling,\" Matthews said.",
      "Engemann's \"frenemy\" on the show, Jessi Ngatikaura, consoled her as she sobbed. Eventually Matthews and Neely joined the pair and confessed that they were pregnant. Engemann ended up apologizing for her negative reaction to their positive tests.",
      "In her press interview, Taylor tells TODAY.com that she spent time with Engemann afterward to try to console her, but the scene was edited out of the final episode.",
      "\"They didn't show me in the bathroom, both of us crying and me consoling her and being like, 'I'm so sorry that this just happened. I feel awful. I'm so, so sorry,\" Taylor explains. \"A lot of things are definitely taken out of context.\""

    "summary": "The \"Norm!\" greeting on \"Cheers\" and George Wendt's jokes that followed helped make the show the success it was. TODAY.com looks back following Wendt's death.",
    "story": [
      "One word can have such an impact.",
      "\u201cCheers\u201d star George Wendt, who died May 20 at the age of 76, left behind a legacy in the annals of TV comedy that is hard to equal, thanks to one word: Norm.",
      "Norm was the embodiment of the show's well-known theme song about a place \u201cwhere everybody knows your name and they\u2019re always glad you came.\u201d",
      "An alum of Chicago's Second City comedy troupe, Wendt, who played the perpetually underachieving barfly Norm Peterson on the classic sitcom, was one of the strings that held the show together. He was an accountant by trade, but a loyal patron of the bar, first and foremost, a man whose love for the watering hole superseded his career and his marriage to his never-seen-on-camera wife, Vera.",
      "Norm was the everyman, literally always at the ready with a joke. And nowhere was that more evident than when he walked into the bar. As Cheers\u2019 most frequent and dedicated customer, Norm was always greeted by other customers and workers with a buoyant \u201cNorm!\u201d when he entered, providing a monosyllabic setup for the joke to follow.",
      "There is no shortage of witty lines.",
      "\u201cWhat are you up to, Norm?\u201d Sam, played by Ted Danson, asks in one episode.",
      "\u201cMy ideal weight, if I were 11 feet tall,\u201d he quickly shoots back.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Mr. Peterson,\u201d Woody Harrelson\u2019s na\u00efve Woody asks him in another episode.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s talk about what\u2019s going in Mr. Peterson,\u201d he nonchalantly replies.",
      "\u201cHey, what\u2019s happening, Norm?\u201d Sam once innocently asks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a dog-eat-dog world, Sammy, and I\u2019m wearing Milk Bone underwear,\u201d he casually responds as he saunters to his bar stool.",
      "The premise initially appeared in the show\u2019s pilot.",
      "\u201cGeorge Wendt entered for the first time and said, \u2018Afternoon, everybody!\u2019\u201d \u201cCheers\u201d co-creator and longtime director, James Burrows, wrote in his 2022 book, \u201cDirected by James Burrows.\u201d \u201cAnd, of course, everybody yelled back, \u2018Norm!\u2019 Then Teddy said, \u2018What do you know?\u2019 And George said, \u2018Not enough.\u2019\u201d",
      "In that moment, a recurring bit was born.",
      "\u201cIt was really a straight line in the script, but it got this huge laugh from the audience,\u201d Burrows continued. \u201cI turned to my two partners and said, \u2018Wow, they\u2019re laughing not only at this joke but they\u2019re laughing at this character, the person saying it.\u2019 Right then I had a sense that we had something special.\u201d",
      "\u201cCheers,\u201d which was nominated for a staggering 117 Emmy Awards and won 28, never lost its luster over its 11-year run, even as cast changes challenged its dynamic. \u201cNorm!\u201d was a constant, a warm blanket for viewers looking for laughs.",
      "\u201cNorm!\u201d became a signature greeting that Burrows said was created by Nicholas Colasanto, who played Coach on the show before his death prior to the fourth season. It was simple, effective and eventually, daunting to write.",
      "\u201cWe wound up with ten of the greatest seconds of sitcom history each week, every time Norm walked in and made a joke,\u201d Burrows wrote. \u201cThe Norm\u2019isms \u2014 the interchange when Norm walks into the bar in each episode \u2014 became harder and harder to write, because the audience expected so much.\u201d",
      "\u201cCheers\u201d was an escape from the daily travails and aggravation of life. Norm was the poster child.",
      "\u201cEvery character wanted something or had some kind of problem, except for Norm, who was wonderful and essential in a different way, because he was the anchor for the group,\u201d Burrows wrote. \u201cBecause Norm was relatively happy and well-adjusted, everything was fine.\u201d",
      "Wendt\u2019s portrayal of Norm earned him six Emmy nominations, although he never won. It was a career-defining role for a man who took to comedy the way Norm took to beer. He enjoyed other success, including a recurring role on \u201cSabrina the Teenage Witch.\u201d He also appeared in his own short-lived series, \u201cThe George Wendt Show,\u201d and had multiple uncredited appearances on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in the popular \u201cSuper Fans\u201d sketches, which wrought the phrase \u201cDa Bears!\u201d in the early 1990s.",
      "He even had supporting roles in \u201880s movies such as \u201cFletch\u201d and \u201cGung Ho\u201d and once even shared a screen with Macaulay Culkin in Michael Jackson\u2019s heavily hyped video for \u201cBlack or White.\u201d He was  also the uncle to comedy star Jason Sudeikis.",
      "Wendt was just plain funny, a linchpin in a \u201cCheers\u201d cast that was a linchpin in NBC\u2019s vaunted Thursday night lineup that featured hits like \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d \u201cFamily Ties\u201d and \u201cNight Court.\u201d There are no words to explain how valuable he was \u2014 except one: Norm."

      "VATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Leo XIV called Wednesday for humanitarian aid to reach the Gaza Strip and for an end to the \u201cheartbreaking\u201d toll on its people, as he presided over his first general audience in St. Peter\u2019s Square.",
      "The Vatican said that around 40,000 people were on hand for the audience, which came just days after an estimated 200,000 people attended the inaugural Mass on Sunday for history\u2019s first American pope.",
      "Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost of Chicago, began the audience with a tour through the piazza in the popemobile and stopped to bless several babies. In addressing specific greetings to different groups of pilgrims, Leo spoke in his native English, his fluent Spanish as well as the traditional Italian of the papacy.",
      "\u201cI renew my heartfelt appeal to allow the entrance of dignified humanitarian aid to Gaza and to put an end to the hostilities whose heartbreaking price is being paid by children, the elderly and sick people,\u201d he said.",
      "Leo did not mention the plight of hostages taken by Hamas during the assault on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, as Pope Francis normally would.",
      "The general audience on Wednesdays is a weekly appointment that popes have kept for decades to allow ordinary faithful to have a face-to-face encounter with the pontiff. It features the pope delivering a brief reflection on a theme or Scripture passage, with summaries provided by others in different languages and the pope directing specific messages to particular faith groups.",
      "The encounter, which lasts more than an hour, usually ends with a brief topical appeal by the pope about a current issue or upcoming event. Leo began it with his now-frequent mantra \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d",
      "To that end, Leo on Tuesday reaffirmed the Vatican\u2019s willingness to host the next round of ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine during a phone call with Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, the Italian leader\u2019s office said.",
      "Meloni made the call after speaking with President Donald Trump and other European leaders, who asked her to verify the Holy See\u2019s offer.",
      "\u201cFinding in the Holy Father the confirmation of the willingness to welcome the next talks between the parties, the premier expressed profound gratitude for Pope Leo XIV\u2019s willingness and his incessant commitment in favor of peace,\u201d Meloni\u2019s office said in a statement late Tuesday.",
      "Trump had referred to the Vatican\u2019s longstanding offer to host talks in reporting on his phone call Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "While low-level talks could take place in Rome, Italy would be hard-pressed to allow Putin to fly into Rome for any higher-level negotiation. Putin is subject to an international arrest warrant against him from the International Criminal Court, of which Italy is a founding member and therefore obliged to execute its warrants."

    "summary": "Back home after more than a year in Hamas captivity, Edan Alexander recalled to his parents his conditions as a hostage.",
    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 On Mother\u2019s Day, Yael Alexander got perhaps the best gift: the news that her son Edan Alexander would be released from Hamas captivity the following day.",
      "One week after that life-changing phone call, NBC News spoke to Yael Alexander and her husband, Adi Alexander, about their son\u2019s more than a year in captivity and his eventual release.",
      "Edan Alexander, who was believed to be\u00a0the last living U.S. citizen\u00a0held captive in Gaza, was freed on May 12 after having been captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "Born in Tel Aviv, Edan, 21, grew up in New Jersey but had returned to Israel to serve in the army. His parents said he recounted to them the details of his capture and his time in captivity.",
      "Attacked on his army base on Oct. 7, Edan faced off with almost 30 militants by himself before he was kidnapped, Adi Alexander said. His son called the first year in captivity \u201ccomplete hell,\u201d he said, because he was frequently moved around to various locations above ground, underground and in tents, at one point during the war living in a tent that, his father recounted, Edan said he couldn\u2019t leave for weeks.",
      "\u201cThe conditions in those tents are not easy. They couldn\u2019t get out,\u201d Adi said, noting that Edan\u2019s time in the tent was his \u201ctoughest period\u201d in captivity.",
      "Edan was in good physical shape when he was taken, whereas a number of other captives, including injured people, children and the elderly, weren\u2019t, Adi said, so Edan helped those being held with him, especially when they moved between locations.",
      "Edan endured hunger, eating only hummus, pita bread, rice and whatever his captors served him from cans, his father said, a reflection of the food scarcity in Gaza since the start of the war. Fears of famine have heightened there in recent weeks as Israel has carried out a nearly three-month blockade on the enclave \u2014\u00a0the longest of its kind since the start of the conflict.",
      "Israel said Sunday it would begin allowing limited resources to flow into the Gaza Strip to avoid a \u201chunger crisis.\u201d Worries of such a crisis aren\u2019t new, with aid groups warning about such conditions for months as a result of Israel\u2019s military operation.",
      "Food began to flow more regularly during the fragile January ceasefire brokered during the Biden administration, offering the hostages an opportunity to eat meat, Adi Alexander said. Edan told his parents conditions improved during what Adi called the \u201csecond phase\u201d of his son's captivity \u2014 after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "By then, he said, Edan, who had lost about a quarter of his body mass, stayed in one \u201csecure and safe\u201d location for the rest of his time in Gaza and was able to regain some weight.",
      "Adi lauded his son\u2019s \u201cwisdom to get along with the captors and survive,\u201d even when death from bombardments by the Israeli army \u2014 which he said Edan described as \u201clike an earthquake\u201d \u2014 seemed possible. At one point, Edan also survived a tunnel collapse, his father said.",
      "\u201cWe consider ourselves lucky that he survived that day,\u201d Adi said of the collapse. \u201cHe has some injury from that event, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something major now.\u201d",
      "Adi said he and his family were devastated when the ceasefire collapsed and \u201cthe war re-started.\u201d",
      "On May 5, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced an intensive military operation aiming to take the whole of the Gaza Strip in an effort to eliminate Hamas, a move approved by the country\u2019s security Cabinet.",
      "But the plan hasn\u2019t been without pushback. A number of military reservists have rejected the call to serve in the operation, saying it is part of a war that has become politically motivated. At a Knesset committee\u00a0meeting this month, the father of one of the remaining hostages called on soldiers \u201cnot to report for reserve duty for moral and ethical reasons.\u201d",
      "More than 1,200 people were killed in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, and around 250 hostages were taken, according to Israeli tallies. Fifty-eight hostages are believed to remain in captivity.",
      "More than 53,000 people \u2014 many of them women and children \u2014 have been killed in Gaza in the resulting war, according to health officials in the enclave, which Hamas has run since 2007.",
      "Talks to end the war have stalled, even as many Israelis urge their leaders to bring the rest of the hostages home. Adi Alexander expressed reservations about the \u201cmixed messaging.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy hope is that it\u2019s just a political posture,\u201d he said of Netanyahu's plan for an expanded military operation. \u201cMy expectation is going back to the bargaining table, rising above politics and prioritizing human life.\u201d",
      "The Alexander family knows all too well the suffering of the hostages.",
      "Yael Alexander recalled how her son said he held on to hope in captivity, thanks in part to seeing glimpses of his family on the news.",
      "\u201cHe saw us,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knew we were fighting for him.\u201d",
      "Their fight culminated on Mother\u2019s Day with a call from Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s\u00a0special envoy to the Middle East, who told the Alexanders that Hamas would be announcing the release of their son momentarily.",
      "Yael said she immediately packed her things and got the next flight to Israel. Adi and their other children followed on a later flight.",
      "\u201cIt was perfectly timed, and everyone was together just one time,\u201d Yael said of Edan\u2019s release. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d",
      "Despite being a bit thinner, paler and weaker, Yael said, her son is the same as before he was captured, and in their first conversation since his kidnapping, he joked that he needs a tan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same laughter, the same smile, the same kind eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is our boy.\u201d"

      "Israeli bombardment had killed more than 300 people in the 72 hours to early Monday, the Health Authority in Gaza said. Children were among the dead after a wave of airstrikes in the southern city of Khan Younis that came even after Netanyahu said his forces would allow in limited amounts of food to avoid the risk of famine.",
      "In a statement Monday, Gaza's Hamas-run government urged the international community to pressure Israel to allow the entry of at least 500 aid trucks and 50 fuel trucks daily, adding that \u201csigns of famine and humanitarian collapse are worsening at a terrifying rate.\u201d",
      "That came after the Israeli government announced plans Sunday that, if actioned, would end its 11-week aid blockade of Gaza and allow in \u201cbasic\u201d quantities of food. Netanyahu doubled down Monday on his decision, responding on Telegram to critics from Israel\u2019s political right wing.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of criticism from the right this morning regarding the humanitarian issue \u2014 and that\u2019s understandable. But it\u2019s important to know the facts,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe must avoid a situation of famine, both in substance and in perception.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf there is famine,\u201d he added, \u201cwe will lose international support and won\u2019t be able to achieve victory.\u201d",
      "That decision came even as Israel moved ahead with plans for a new ground offensive, dubbed \u201cChariots of Gideon,\u201d after its security Cabinet earlier this month unanimously approved plans to\u00a0seize all of the Gaza Strip.",
      "It was in his statement Monday that Netanyahu said that \u201cthere is intensive and large-scale military activity in Gaza\u201d and that the Israeli military was \u201cmoving toward full control of the entire Strip.\u201d",
      "Israel says the operation is aimed at defeating Hamas and ensuring the return of the remaining hostages of the 250 taken captive during the Hamas-led terrorist attacks\u00a0in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, during which around 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli counts.",
      "The ensuing war in Gaza has killed more than 53,000 people in the enclave, Palestinian health officials say. That death toll is still rising.",
      "Those killed in airstrikes added to what has become one of\u00a0the deadliest weeks\u00a0of the conflict since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas collapsed in March.",
      "In a statement Monday, Hamas said that the Israeli military had launched \u201chundreds of highly destructive shells, missiles, and bombs daily, targeting residential neighborhoods and densely populated civilian areas.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Monday that it had struck 160 of what it called \u201cterror targets\u201d in the past 24 hours.",
      "The attacks come as international aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks of the risk of famine\u00a0in Gaza after the Israeli government maintained a complete aid blockade since March 2.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a race against time to avoid famine,\u201d the United Nations' World Food Programme said in an X post Sunday, in which it urged the international community to \u201cact urgently to get aid flowing again.\u201d",
      "Those warnings have sparked alarm among even Israel\u2019s closest allies, with President Donald Trump telling reporters Friday that \u201ca lot of people are starving\u201d in Gaza.",
      "The United Nations said Monday that 92% of homes in Gaza have already been destroyed or damaged, in a post on X, adding that \u201ccountless people have been displaced multiple times, and shelter is scarce.\u201d",
      "In footage captured Sunday by NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground, Israeli missiles struck a cluster of tents sheltering displaced families in the Al-Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, killing at least 40 people and injuring dozens of others.",
      "\u201cI brought five charred bodies to Nasser Hospital, but many more are still by the tents \u2014 we couldn\u2019t reach them because of the flames,\u201d Jaafar Ezzedine, a civil defense medic, told NBC News.",

    "story": [
      "The phone call between President Donald Trump and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin may not have achieved great strides on ending the war in Ukraine, but it did confirm one thing: The bromance is real. But a question is left hanging: What does this bonhomie actually deliver for the men in the Kremlin and White House?",
      "\u201cThe tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent,\u201d Trump said of his Russian counterpart after their two-hour conversation Monday, adding that Putin is a \u201cnice gentleman.\u201d Putin adviser Yuri Ushakov, meanwhile, said Trump and Putin called each other by their first names and \u201cneither of them wanted to end the conversation.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Putin commissioned a portrait of his American counterpart and delivered it to him. One of Trump\u2019s envoys, Steve Witkoff, told Tucker Carlson in March that the president was \u201cclearly touched\u201d by what he called a \u201cbeautiful\u201d portrait.",
      "Trump is not just seeking an end to the war in Ukraine, which Russia started by launching its large-scale 2022 invasion; in addition, he has made no secret of his desire to do lucrative deals with a Kremlin reintroduced to the international financial fold.",
      "In April he wrote on Truth Social that he was \u201chopeful Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week,\u201d adding that \u201cboth will then start to do big business with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "Before that happens, Trump and his team have suggested they want the war to end, something the president has made a clear political goal, having promised during his presidential campaign that it would take just 24 hours to secure, although he later told Time magazine that this was an \u201cexaggeration.\u201d",
      "His call with Putin appears to have brought that no closer to fruition, with a chasm still aching between Ukraine\u2019s willingness for a 30-day ceasefire and Russia\u2019s demand for Kyiv\u2019s effective surrender.",
      "It\u2019s not been a total love-in between the leaders of these former Cold War foes. Trump has expressed frustration with his Russian counterpart for continuing to launch missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians while negotiations to end the fighting are ongoing.",
      "And Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the White House is not asking the Senate to hold back on a bill that would slap a 500% tariff on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, gas and other products.",
      "But one thing that Putin\u2019s personal connection with Trump does is buy him time, according to Mark Galeotti, director of the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "Putin has shown little desire for any sort of ceasefire that does not satisfy his maximalist goals. And right now his forces continue to make slow but steady battlefield advances in eastern Ukraine, according to independent monitors like the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War think tank.",
      "So, with negotiations at an impasse, Putin will be more than happy to delay any definite decision \u2014 on both American support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, Galeotti said.",
      "\u201cEvery week counts\u201d in this \u201cparticularly pivotal moment,\u201d Galeotti said. If his call with Trump delays making any decisions, then \u201cI think Putin will see it as a good job done,\u201d he said.",
      "As with its lack of detail on how the war might end, the call also provided little clarity on whether or when Trump and Putin might meet in person, something they have both suggested could happen. If and when this real-world t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate does take place, it will be harder for Putin to resist giving Trump something, according to Galeotti.",
      "The Russians are \u201ctrying to avoid giving anything because they are very, very hard-nosed negotiators,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they do meet in person, then Trump will have to leave with something.\u201d",
      "While no date for a meeting between the two leaders has been set, their longtime fondness has long caused widespread alarm across the West. Intelligence agencies see Putin as a foe who has challenged international norms through hybrid warfare such as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against democratic institutions.",
      "Asked for a response to these criticisms, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in an email that \u201cunlike his predecessor, President Trump is willing to look anyone in the eye and negotiate deals that deliver peace.\u201d",
      "Kelly said that \u201cthanks to his leadership\u201d Russia and Ukraine \u201cwill begin ceasefire talks to stop the killing in the bloodiest European war since World War II.\u201d A date and venue for ceasefire talks has not been set.",
      "The American president\u2019s connection with Putin has roots at least as far back as 2013, when he visited Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant and pondered on Twitter whether Putin will \u201cbecome my new best friend?\u201d",
      "By 2015, before the two men had even met, Putin was heaping praise on Trump as a \u201ccolorful, talented person,\u201d something the American leader said was a \u201cgreat honor\u201d coming from the \u201chighly respected\u201d Russian leader.",
      "A year later, Trump openly urged Putin to influence the American presidential election, telling a rally in Doral, Florida, that \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201d This was in the eyes of many observers an overt invitation for Russian intelligence services to hack into the account of his opponent, Hillary Clinton.",
      "Putin would indeed conduct a campaign to interfere, according to a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released in 2020.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, the pair met on multiple occasions without any staff present, a highly unusual departure from standard protocol. But the Russian government would ultimately conclude that while the president himself was friendly, his administration was not. The Trump White House imposed sanctions and withdrew from a nuclear deal it said Russia wasn\u2019t respecting.",
      "Now Trump\u2019s second term looks like it could be a repeat.",
      "Asked about future opportunities for face-to-face diplomacy between himself Putin, Trump replied: \u201cWe have to meet. He and I will meet. I think we\u2019ll solve it, or maybe not.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Young people in Taiwan are used to living with uncertainty when it comes to China \u2014 a situation they generally say is for the best for the time being, particularly when recent actions by the Trump administration have some of them asking a certain question.",
      "\u201cCan Taiwan continue to view the U.S. as an ally?\u201d said Chan Yu-hsiang, 25, a graduate student at National Taiwan University.",
      "Chan\u2019s question reflects growing concern in Taiwan over the reliability of the U.S. as a security partner under President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the Beijing-claimed island in the face of Chinese military threats but also made critical remarks and upended trade relations.",
      "In a Taiwan government poll released in March, the percentage of respondents who said the U.S. military would \u201cdefinitely\u201d intervene in the event of a Chinese invasion dropped to 14% from 19% a year earlier. Almost half of respondents said the U.S. military was unlikely to intervene, the same as a poll by the Brookings Institution conducted the same month.",
      "According to the same Taiwan government poll, 36% of respondents said U.S.-Taiwan relations would get worse under Trump, a 12% increase since January.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s rising wariness toward the U.S. comes amid growing pressure from China, which claims the self-governing democracy as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force in achieving its unification goal. Beijing sends warplanes and ships toward the island on near-daily sorties.",
      "Last month, the Chinese military conducted large-scale drills around Taiwan in what it said was a warning to \u201cseparatist\u201d forces. The Taiwan government has warned that Beijing could hold more drills in the coming days as the island marks one year under President Lai Ching-te, whom China describes as a \u201cseparatist\u201d and \u201ctroublemaker.\u201d",
      "China has rebuffed multiple offers of talks from Lai, who says only Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people can decide its future. Beijing insists the island\u2019s future is \u201cby no means an \u2018internal affair of Taiwan,\u2019\u201d warning that Taiwanese authorities would \u201csuffer an apocalypse\u201d if they sought formal independence.",
      "Strategic ambiguity",
      "The U.S. has no formal relations with Taiwan but is its most important international backer, bound by law to provide it with defensive weapons. On Monday, Taiwan test-fired for the first time a new rocket system provided by the U.S. that Ukraine has also used against Russia.",
      "Washington has long maintained a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d when it comes to whether the U.S. military would defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, not giving a definitive answer either way.",
      "Trump has not given any indication of a change in that policy. But he has unnerved Taiwan with comments accusing it of stealing semiconductor business from the U.S. and calling for Taiwan to pay more for its own defense, which it has pledged to do.",
      "Last month, he also slapped Taiwan with a 32% tariff on its goods, with an exemption for the chip industry, which makes up a big part of the Taiwan economy and which the U.S. relies on heavily.",
      "Taiwan has said it will not retaliate against the U.S. and that it is ready for trade talks \u201cat any time,\u201d offering a package of zero tariffs on American goods and increased U.S. investment.",
      "The duties came as a surprise to Taiwan after state-backed chipmaker TSMC announced a plan in March to invest an additional $100 million in the U.S., where it is already building multiple factories.",
      "For Chan, this suggested that even Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield\u201d \u2014 the semiconductor industry that makes the island so indispensable to the global economy \u2014 is not enough to guarantee U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIf you keep giving away Taiwan\u2019s last line of defense, the U.S. will take advantage of it, but they won\u2019t necessarily treat you well,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhy would Taiwan still believe that Trump would definitely deploy troops if it was to fall?\u201d",
      "Maintaining the status quo",
      "Though some U.S. officials and Taiwan\u2019s military point to 2027 \u2014 the 100th anniversary of the founding of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2014 as a possible timeline for China to attack, polls show that most Taiwanese believe an invasion is unlikely in the next five years.",
      "A survey last year by National Chengchi University in Taipei showed that over 88% of people in Taiwan support maintaining the status quo, in which Taiwan operates as a de facto independent country without formally declaring independence, a move that would risk all-out war with China.",
      "That\u2019s especially true for Taiwan\u2019s youngest voters, said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and assistant professor at National Taiwan University who has studied their views.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Gen Zers \u201care by no means pro-China relative to other generations, but they don\u2019t have the same attitude towards Taiwan independence\u201d as millennials do, he said.",
      "\u201cInstead, we see younger generations having a much more sort of pro-status-quo approach to politics,\u201d Nachman said.",
      "Young people in Taiwan were too young to be radicalized in political upheavals such as the island\u2019s Sunflower Movement in 2014 and the martial law era, he said.",
      "They don\u2019t want to \u201crock any major boat\u201d with any \u201cradical change\u201d in the Taiwan Strait, Nachman added, though the desire for unification with mainland China is still \u201cincredibly low.\u201d",
      "The Taiwan government poll found that over a third of respondents ages 18 to 29 viewed China as the island\u2019s \u201cprimary threat\u201d despite efforts by Beijing to win them over with preferential policies for studying and working in the mainland, as well as various activities including sponsored trips, internships and cultural events.",
      "Last year, over 4 million people from Taiwan visited mainland China for tourism, study or work, a year-over-year increase of 54.3%, according to official data released by Chinese authorities. According to China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, young people were the \u201cmost active\u201d group.",
      "\u201cYou are also Chinese. You are our family,\u201d Chan said he and other students from Taiwan were told by a tour guide last year on a Beijing-sponsored trip to the Chinese province of Henan.",
      "While some accuse Beijing of using such efforts to strengthen its sovereignty claims, these measures are \u201cquite good\u201d and enable young people in Taiwan to visit and explore different places, said Chen Pin-yin, a student at the National Taiwan University of Arts.",
      "Chen, 21, who is also pro status quo, said not everything is about politics. Young people in Taiwan are mainly concerned about practical issues such as the cost of living and their job prospects, she said.",
      "Chen did a one-month internship last summer for a variety show in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that was partly funded by Chinese organizers.",
      "The experience was \u201ca dream come true\u201d for Chen, who said the Chinese TV industry is \u201chighly developed.\u201d She said she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree in mainland China next year and that she would also consider working there.",
      "The most important thing \u201cis to avoid wars for now,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI hope the U.S. can play the role of a mediator when tensions are high.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "BASEL, Switzerland \u2014 Austria was crowned the winner at Saturday\u2019s grand finale of the Eurovision Song Contest, the world\u2019s most popular singing tournament, beating strong competition from Israel and Switzerland to come in first place on an evening full of glitz and glamour.",
      "Austria\u2019s song, \u201cWasted Love\u201d by JJ, was awarded 436 points by a combination of votes from viewers and juries of music professionals from each participating country.",
      "JJ is a countertenor opera singer, and the song makes use of his impressive vocal range. It starts with a swelling orchestral sound that builds to a dance club finish.",
      "Despite widespread rumors and high anticipation for a homecoming appearance by Celine Dion, who won the contest while representing Switzerland in 1988 (artists don\u2019t have to be from the country they represent), the Canadian star was unable to attend. The singer has curtailed her recent public appearances due to a diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome. She had earlier sent a video message, played during Tuesday\u2019s semifinal, in which she said she \u201cwould love nothing more\u201d than to attend Eurovision, calling winning the contest \u201clife-changing.\u201d",
      "Every country that competes in Eurovision also votes on the winner,  meaning rivalries and regional alliances from the real world spill over into the results.",
      "Allies Greece and Cyprus have a long history of giving each other 12 points (the most possible), which is often met with boos from the crowd. Only Greece made it to this year\u2019s final, and Cyprus gave it 12 points.",
      "On the other hand, neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan, which have fought wars over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, has awarded its neighbor more than a handful of points. This year, Azerbaijan didn\u2019t make it to the final. Azerbaijan yet again did not give any jury points to Armenia.",
      "The most geopolitically divisive entrant was Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, whose song \u201cNew Day Will Rise\u201d is about finding hope after tragedy. While the song does not mention any specific events, Raphael survived the Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 were taken hostage.",
      "Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 53,000 people and has brought the surviving population of about 2 million to the brink of starvation. For many critics, Israel\u2019s inclusion in Eurovision is tantamount to accepting its military campaign, and protesters demand Israel\u2019s expulsion from the contest, just as Russia was in 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Raphael\u2019s song, which was met with scattered boos as well as cheers, came in second place, racking up 357 points.",
      "There were gasps of disbelief in the audience when the other top contender, Switzerland, was awarded no points from the public.",
      "Sweden\u2019s failure to triumph was a surprise amid its favored status, buoyed by KAJ\u2019s \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d a humorous ode to the Nordic tradition of going to the sauna. The performance by the act\u2019s trio of Finns featured a faux sauna complete with backup dancers in towels \u2014 a vision of European culture, just not a winning one on Saturday.",
      "The event was a jamboree of glitz and showbiz glamour, with fans from across the continent cheering on their favored contestants as a TV audience of hundreds of millions watched at home and at viewing parties.",
      "Eurovision began in Switzerland in 1956 as a way to test new television technology, and to help bring postwar Europe together. At the time, the contest only featured seven countries. This year, there were 37 nations taking part, whittled down to 26 finalists over two semifinals earlier this week. And the production is now a behemoth, with hundreds of crew members and 22 cameras capturing the action.",
      "The first act to perform was Kyle Alessandro, a 19-year-old from Norway, who took the stage wearing chain mail for a pyrotechnic-enhanced rendition of his entry, \u201cLighter.\u201d",
      "His song kicked off a show that included a number of memorable performances, including that of Finland\u2019s Erika Vikman, whose sexually charged \u201cIch Komme\u201d ends with her suspended in the air atop a giant microphone stand emitting sparks.",
      "Poland\u2019s Justyna Steczkowska made her return to Eurovision after 30 years with a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-inspired performance that saw the 52-year-old lifted into the air by ropes as a CGI dragon swooped behind her on an 8,000-square-foot LED video wall.",
      "Some 163 million people watched the Eurovision final and the two semifinals last year. Final viewing figures are not yet available for this year\u2019s competition, but it is sure to remain one of the most-watched events in the world. It attracts more viewers than the Super Bowl, which had 123.4 million viewers last year, according to CBS.",
      "That viewership will likely see \"Wasted Love\" climb the charts across Europe. For some Eurovision winners like Dion and ABBA, international stardom awaits.",
      "Most artists aren\u2019t quite that lucky, but the massive platform means winners can see levels of fame they would otherwise only dream of.",
      "Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin performed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d after winning the 2021 contest, and Dutch singer Duncan Laurence performed his winning 2019 song \u201cArcade\u201d on NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d show when it started climbing U.S. charts after going viral on TikTok.",
      "For the 25 artists who didn\u2019t win, there\u2019s still the hope that they\u2019ll have found new fans.",
      "Holly-Anne Hull, a member of this year\u2019s British act, Remember Monday, told NBC News in a Zoom interview last month that for her group, the outcome is secondary to the opportunity to be able to perform together on the world stage.",
      "\u201cWe aren\u2019t even doing it for the live show. We\u2019re doing it for the fact that we can live in this band every single day up until that moment,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we\u2019ve ever dreamed of is doing this band full time.\u201d"

      "A new North Korean warship was damaged in a \u201cserious accident\u201d during a launch ceremony attended by leader Kim Jong Un, state media reported Thursday in a rare admission of failure by the secretive nuclear-armed state.",
      "The 5,000-ton destroyer slid off a flatcar because of \u201cinexperienced command and operational carelessness in the course of the launch,\u201d according to the Korean Central News Agency, crushing parts of the bottom of the ship.",
      "Lee Sung-joon, spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that U.S. and South Korean intelligence authorities had been monitoring the failed launch and that the ship was \u201clying on its side in the sea.\u201d",
      "South Korea also said Thursday that North Korea had fired multiple unidentified cruise missiles and that U.S. and South Korean intelligence authorities were analyzing the details.",
      "The ship accident Wednesday at the northeastern port of Chongjin is a blow to Kim, who has stressed the importance of such destroyers for advancing North Korea\u2019s military capabilities.",
      "Kim described the incident as a \u201ccriminal act caused by absolute carelessness\u201d that \u201ccould not be tolerated,\u201d KCNA said.",
      "He censured the officials involved in the accident, which he said \u201cbrought the dignity and self-respect of our state to a collapse,\u201d and said the ship should be restored before next month\u2019s plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party.",
      "The North Korean report did not say whether there were any casualties.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Lee said the damaged ship was believed to have capabilities similar to those of North Korea\u2019s first destroyer, the Choe Hyon-ho, which was unveiled late last month in what Kim called a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in modernizing his naval forces. North Korean state media reported that Kim had supervised tests of the destroyer\u2019s supersonic and strategic cruise missiles, anti-aircraft missile, automatic guns and electronic jamming guns.",
      "Kim said that the destroyer would be deployed early next year and that his next goal in naval modernization was to acquire a nuclear-powered submarine.",
      "Experts say that although North Korea\u2019s naval forces still lag behind those of South Korea, which has 12 destroyers, the new destroyer is considered a serious threat. It is believed to have been built with assistance from Russia, where North Korea has been sending troops and weapons to support its war against Ukraine.",
      "The U.S.-based website 38 North said last week that North Korea was preparing to launch the second destroyer and that it was \u201clikely be side-launched from the quay, a method not previously observed in North Korea.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe use of this launch method could be one of necessity, as the quay where the ship is being built does not have an incline,\u201d it said in a report.",
      "Tensions have heightened on the Korean Peninsula in recent years as Kim accelerates weapons testing for his nuclear and missile programs in what he says is a response to intensifying military cooperation between the United States and its allies. North Korea views joint military exercises among the United States, South Korea and others as a rehearsal for invasion, which those nations deny.",
      "While North Korea\u2019s cruise missile launches on Thursday did not violate United Nations Security Council resolutions, which bar the North from testing ballistic missiles, experts say they are equally as deadly."

      "After Wednesday\u2019s announcement, Kneecap\u2019s X account posted a previous interview with O\u2019Hanna in which he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be 80, 90 years of age and my grandkids asking me, 'Why did nobody do anything about the Palestinian genocide?'

The attack killed more than 1,200 people in Israel, and hundreds more were taken hostage by Hamas militants, according to Israeli tallies.",
      "After a weekslong ceasefire fell apart in March, Israel resumed its bombardment of the enclave, including a series of assaults that killed 300 people in 72 hours this month. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country was \"moving toward full control\" of Gaza.",
      "Kneecap has described criticism of its outspoken views about the war in Gaza as a \"coordinated smear campaign\" by those who \"want to silence criticism of a mass slaughter. They weaponize false accusations of antisemitism to distract, confuse, and provide cover for genocide.\u201d",
      "After the group performed at Coachella last month in front of a screen that said, \u201cF--- Israel, Free Palestine,\" the organizers behind Israel's Tribe of Nova music festival, where hundreds of people were killed in the October 2023 attack, said Kneecap's messaging was \"an affront made even more painful in light of the massacre.\"",
      "\"We invite the members of Kneecap to visit the Nova Exhibition in Toronto and experience firsthand the stories of those who were murdered, those who survived, and those are still being held hostage,\" the organizers said. \"Not to shame or silence \u2014 but to connect.

    "story": [
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 The head of American chipmaker Nvidia praised President Donald Trump\u2019s move to modify U.S. curbs on the export of artificial intelligence chips to China, saying Wednesday that the Biden-era controls were a \u201cfailure\u201d that had cost his and other U.S. companies billions of dollars in sales.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the United States rolled out a three-tiered system of export curbs on advanced chips aimed at regulating the global diffusion of AI, blocking China entirely. While Biden said the curbs were necessary to slow China\u2019s development of technology that could have military applications, critics said they could undermine U.S. tech leadership.",
      "The Trump administration said last week that it plans to rescind some of those curbs and replace them with its own restrictions.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s billionaire chief executive, Jensen Huang, said his company controls 50% of the market in China today, compared with almost 95% at the start of the Biden administration in 2021.",
      "\u201cAll in all, the export control was a failure,\u201d he told reporters on the sidelines of Computex, a top technology trade show in the Taiwanese capital of Taipei, saying the curbs were based on the \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d assumption that the U.S. is the only source of AI technology.",
      "Huang, 62, said Chinese companies blocked from buying American products had instead turned to local sources such as Chinese tech giant Huawei, and that they had been spurred to make advances with as little outside help as possible.",
      "\u201cThe local companies are very, very talented and very determined,\u201d Huang said, \u201cand the export control gave them the spirit, the energy and the government support to accelerate their development.\u201d",
      "Those companies \u201cwould love for us never to go back to China,\u201d he said, adding that China is home to 50% of the world\u2019s AI researchers and has an AI market he estimated would be worth $50 billion by next year.",
      "Nvidia said last month that it would write off about $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips it had specifically designed for the China market to comply with previous curbs after the Trump administration said those chips would also be restricted.",
      "\u201cI really do hope that the U.S. government recognizes that the ban is not effective and give us a chance to go back and win the market as soon as possible,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Huang, who was with Trump on his Middle East trip last week along with other tech leaders, lauded the president for his \u201cgreat reversal\u201d of Biden\u2019s policy, known as the AI diffusion rule, saying Trump \u201crealizes it\u2019s exactly the wrong goal.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe sees it very clearly that the race is on,\u201d Huang said, \u201cand if the United States wants to stay ahead, we need to maximize, accelerate our diffusion, not limit it, because somebody else is more than happy to provide it.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s state-led investment in chips has probably exceeded $150 billion over the past decade, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.",
      "Beijing has repeatedly criticized the U.S. over its chip curbs, including guidelines Washington issued last week that said companies anywhere in the world risked violating U.S. export controls if they used advanced Chinese chips such as Huawei\u2019s Ascend without a license.",
      "The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said Monday that the U.S. action \u201cseriously undermines\u201d the consensus the U.S. and China reached earlier this month on slashing their tariffs on each other\u2019s goods.",
      "On Wednesday, the ministry further accused the U.S. of \u201cabusing export controls to suppress and contain China.\u201d It pledged to invoke China\u2019s anti-foreign sanctions law against anyone involved in enforcing the U.S. move, slamming it as \u201ca typical example of unilateral bullying and protectionism.\u201d",

      "The early-morning arrests in various parts of the country on Wednesday were accompanied by searches at 13 properties, federal prosecutors said in a statement.",
      "Four of those arrested \u2014 identified only as Benjamin H., Ben-Maxim H., Lenny M. and Jason R., in line with German privacy rules \u2014 are suspected of membership in a domestic terror organization. The fifth, Jerome M., is accused of supporting the group. Two of the arrested also are accused of attempted murder and aggravated arson. All are between the ages of 14 and 18.",
      "Prosecutors said they are also investigating three other people, ages 18 to 21, who are already in custody. All the suspects are German citizens.",
      "According to the prosecutors, the group was formed in mid-April 2024 or earlier. They said that its members saw themselves as the last resort to defend the \u201cGerman nation\u201d and aimed to bring about the collapse of Germany\u2019s democratic order, with attacks on homes for asylum-seekers and on facilities associated with the left-wing political spectrum.",
      "Two of the suspects set a fire at a cultural center in Altd\u00f6bern in eastern Germany in October, prosecutors said, adding that several people living in the building at the time escaped injury only by chance.",
      "In January, another two suspects allegedly broke a window at a home for asylum-seekers in Schm\u00f6lln and tried unsuccessfully to start a blaze by setting off fireworks. They daubed the group\u2019s initials and slogans such as \u201cForeigners out,\u201d \u201cGermany for the Germans\u201d and \u201cNazi area,\u201d as well as swastikas, prosecutors said.",
      "Also in January, three suspects allegedly planned an arson attack on a home for asylum-seekers in Senftenberg, but it never came about because of the earlier arrests of two of the men.",
      "Justice Minister Stefanie Hubig said it was \u201cparticularly shocking\u201d that all of those arrested Wednesday were minors at the time the group was allegedly founded.",
      "\u201cThis is an alarm signal and it shows that right-wing extremist terrorism knows no age,\u201d Hubig said in a statement.",
      "In a separate case a week ago, German authorities banned a far-right group called \u201cKingdom of Germany\u201d as a threat to the country\u2019s democratic order and arrested four of its alleged leaders.",
      "In an annual report released Tuesday, the Federal Criminal Police Office said that the number of violent crimes with a right-wing motivation was up 17.2% last year to 1,488. That was part of an overall increase in violent politically motivated offenses to 4,107, an increase of 15.3%."

      "U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to increase deportations substantially. Experts believe the self-deportation offer will only appeal to a small portion of migrants already considering return, but unlikely to spur high demand.
