      "Brand names, not filmmakers or stars, are said to rule the box office these days",
      "NEW YORK -- Brand names, not filmmakers or stars, are said to rule the box office these days. But Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners,\u201d led by twin Michael B. Jordans, proved a bloody exception to modern movie rules, launching with $45.6 million in ticket sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "\u201cSinners,\u201d a Warner Bros. release that cost about $90 million to produce, was a bold gamble on originality \u2014 albeit with genre elements \u2014 and one of the most bankable American directors in Coogler. The \u201cCreed\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d director wrote and produced \u201cSinners,\u201d a 1932-set vampire movie about bootlegging brothers (both played by Jordan) who open a juke joint in their Mississippi hometown.",
      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d the year\u2019s biggest Hollywood hit, followed close behind in second, collecting $41.3 million in its third week of release. That gave Warner Bros., after a handful of disappointments, an enviable one-two punch at the box office with one original, director-driven movie and one IP-based property.",
      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d which Warner Bros. co-produced with Legendary Pictures, has amassed $720.8 million worldwide in three weeks of release.",
      "Pam Abdy and Mike De Luca, co-chairs of Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, celebrated the two films\u2019 resonance with moviegoers. The studio accounted for a remarkable 64% of the domestic box office for the Easter weekend.",
      "\u201cMovies have the power to transport us to worlds only seen on the big screen, and Warner Bros. Pictures remains committed to bringing singular in-theater experiences to audiences looking for bold movies, both original and those based on beloved existing properties,\u201d Abdy and De Luca said in a statement Sunday.",
      "But all eyes were on the performance on \u201cSinners,\u201d which Warner Bros. went to extreme lengths to secure. Abdy and De Luca agreed to give Coogler not just a cut of gross ticket sales but ownership of the film after 25 years \u2014 a virtually unheard of concession.",
      "But Coogler and Jordan, whose collaborations stretch back to \u201cFruitvale Station,\u201d make up one of the industry\u2019s most potent director-actor duos. Reviews (98% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were stellar for \u201cSinners\u201d and audiences, too, were enthralled by its supernatural twists. The film earned an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore from moviegoers.",
      "Overseas, \u201cSinners\u201d faced a more uphill battle. It collected $15.4 million in 71 international markets. Domestically, \u201cSinners\u201d attracted a diverse audience: 38% Black, 35% white, 18% Hispanic and 5% Asian.",
      "Before \u201cSinners,\u201d dual roles had been rough business for Warner Bros. The studio saw flops in both \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d (a period gangster film featuring a doubled Robert De Niro) and \u201cMickey 17\u201d (a sci-fi movie with two Robert Pattinsons).",
      "But the strong opening for \u201cSinners,\u201d which should be sustained in the coming weeks given the strong word of mouth, cements Coogler\u2019s place as one of a handful of filmmakers whose name draws big audiences. Another would be Jordan Peele, whose \u201cNope\u201d (2022) debuted similarly with $44.3 million.",
      "Angel Studios\u2019 \u201cThe King of Kings,\u201d an animated tale of Jesus\u2019 life aimed at Christian audiences, capitalized on the Easter weekend, grossing $17.2 million in its second week of release. That was nearly equal to its opening weekend ($19.1 million), and brought \u201cThe King of Kings\u201d to a domestic total of $45.3 million.",
      "Bleecker Street\u2019s \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d Andrew Ahn\u2019s reimagining of Ang Lee\u2019s 1993 queer comedy of errors, opened on 1,142 North American screens with $922,906 in ticket sales. \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d a hit at the Sundance Film Festival, stars Lily Gladstone, Bowen Yang, Kelly Marie Tran and newcomer Han Gi-chan.",
      "With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",
      "1. \u201cSinners,\u201d $45.6 million.",
      "2. \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d $41.3 million.",
      "3. \u201cThe King of Kings,\u201d $17.3 million.",

      "Two days later, officers received another report at Chick-fil-A and took Seiders into custody. They searched his home and found evidence connecting him to the two incidents. His charges include possession of child sex abuse materials, molesting a child, and invasion of privacy, the sheriff's department said.",
      "The Riverside County Public Defender's Office declined to comment on Seiders' behalf.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The last time Keri Hilson put out an album, Barack Obama was in the second year of his first term as U.S. president, the iPad was released and Instagram was brand new.",
      "\u201cOn some days, I\u2019m like that was just a blink away. But for the most part, yeah, it feels like a long time because I\u2019ve been waiting. I felt stagnant, I felt stuck for a while, and conflicted,\u201d said the two-time Grammy-nominated artist. \u201cI\u2019m very much approaching this like I\u2019m starting over because that\u2019s how it feels to me. I\u2019ve lived nine lives since I last released \u2026 I\u2019m a whole different person.\u201d",
      "Hilson, the 42-year-old R&B star known for late 2000s hits like \u201cKnock You Down,\u201d featuring Kanye West and Ne-Yo. and \u201cPretty Girl Rock,\u201d released \u201cWE NEED TO TALK: LOVE\u201d on Friday. It's her third album, following 2010\u2019s \u201cNo Boys Allowed,\u201d and is the first of a trilogy set for release this year. Led by the sultry single \u201cBae,\u201d the nine-track album delves into romance and introspection.",
      "\u201cI feel resolved, both with the art and within about stepping back into the light. So, I think that resolve kind of had to be found before I felt confident enough to release the body of work and also unleash myself to the world again,\u201d explained Hilson, who said she\u2019s never stopped recording. \u201cThere were songs in my past that I felt were political moves, songs I didn\u2019t really love that I had to sing \u2026 I didn\u2019t want to feel like that this time around.\u201d",
      "One of those songs was a leaked remix to her popular 2009 single \u201cTurnin Me On\u201d featuring Lil Wayne, which peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. Lyrics included a diss fans perceived to be aimed at Beyonc\u00e9.",
      "Hilson, who had yet to drop her introductory album, \u201cIn A Perfect World,\u201d which debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard Top 200 and No. 1 on Top R&B albums, claimed that she was forced to sing the lines, \u201cShe can sing / But she need to move it to the left, left,\u201d assumed to reference Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cIrreplaceable.\u201d She says she was threatened her album might not be released if she refused.",
      "Last week, Hilson trended on social media following an interview with iHeartMedia\u2019s \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d after recalling the incident. While she has talked about it several times in the past, during that interview, the singer publicly named those involved, including producer Polow Da Don who she was signed to. She did not name singer-songwriter Ester Dean. However, after social media users tagged Dean in posts, she later identified herself.",
      "The ending of a decadelong relationship, a lack of control over her career and the intense, never-ending backlash from the BeyHive triggered depression and led to her retreat from music.",
      "During her time away, the Georgia native embarked on a journey of healing that included therapy, journaling and spiritual retreats.",
      "\u201cThere were some perspectives that I needed to uncover ... untruths, beliefs that I kind of picked up or inherited about myself,\u201d said Hilson, who shifted to acting.",
      "Her comeback has included very selective press, avoiding what she describes as \u201cnew media\u201d outlets such as social media-driven platforms, saying monetization can reward the promotion of gossip or incentivize the creation of lies. The salacious blog culture of the 2010s was a driving force in fanning the flames of her perceived beef with Beyonc\u00e9, who has never publicly commented on the situation.",
      "Hilson \u201ccan definitely operate and navigate within the realm of R&B. She has a fan base,\u201d said Keithan Samuels, founder of the popular website RatedRnB.com. \u201cHer core fan base has matured \u2026 she can navigate within this new era of R&B where there\u2019s a lot of diversity and sound.\u201d",
      "Crafted with unofficial writing camps and records created throughout the years, \u201cWE NEED TO TALK: LOVE\u201d finds Hilson delivering vulnerable and flirty lyrics over a wide range of R&B sounds. Writing on all but one song, she avoided current R&B trends that developed during her absence, citing individuality as a key to her early success. She also believes algorithms have created a culture of musical homogeny, rather than creativity.",
      "There are quintessential \u201cMs. Keri Baby\u201d songs like the fun, Pop&B styled \u201cSomethin (Bout U),\u201d but there\u2019s also the introspective \u201cNaked (Love),\u201d and \u201cSay It,\u201d in which she expresses, \u201cI won\u2019t say I love you / \u2018til you say you love me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very \u2018girl boss\u2019 in my life, right? When it comes to relationships, I prefer to be a lady. I prefer to be approached. \u2026 I prefer for the man to say \u2018I love you\u2019 first. I just prefer for a man to lead,\u201d said Hilson. \u201cI\u2019m really a damsel \u2013 without the distress.\u201d",
      "The bedroom mood is set on the sexy slow jam \u201cScream,\u201d while the bright \u201cWhatever\u201d floats with beautiful stacked harmonies.",
      "\u201cI feel like it\u2019s something I would have written for Whitney. And I actually wrote a song for Whitney that she never was able to record,\u201d said Hilson, who began her career as an in-demand writer whose credits include songs for Chris Brown, Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears. \u201cThis reminds me of a Whitney Houston record, where I think she would be now.\u201d",
      "Samuels of RatedRnB.com says this project is evident of the newfound control Hilson has over her career.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not, to me, an attempt to have this commercial comeback \u2026 it feels more personal,\u201d said Samuels. \u201cThe other two albums, I feel like were more catered to what was current then.\u201d",
      "Hilson says she\u2019s still open to writing for other artists and giving away songs that may not fit her current musical era. She also has a new Lifetime movie, \u201cFame: A Temptations Story,\u201d co-starring Keshia Chant\u00e9, premiering April 26 at 8 p.m. EDT. Hilson says acting is now an equal part of her career.",
      "Though Hilson may be cautiously re-emerging musically, fans are welcoming her return. After The Breakfast Club interview, fans flooded her with sympathy and positivity, possibly due to a combination of her finally telling her side of the story in detail, as well as the passing of time. Some fans said they forgot about the incident or were too young to know about it.",
      "\u201cI just control what I can control \u2026 I control what I allow to bring me up or down. These are realizations that I\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been away,\u201d said Hilson. \u201cI feel unburdened \u2026 I\u2019m not projecting too much of the past onto now, and all of that is freeing.\u201d",

      "Judge Paul Goetz late Thursday ordered that Weinstein be immediately relocated from the city\u2019s notorious Rikers Island jail complex to the prison ward at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan so he can receive necessary medical treatment.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers lobbied for the move as jury selection got underway this week.",
      "They argued in court papers that being locked up in a sometimes freezing jail cell was exacerbating the Oscar-winning producer's health issues, which include chronic myeloid leukemia, diabetes and walking difficulties that require a wheelchair to get in and out of court.",
      "Goetz\u2019s order will remain in effect at least until next Thursday, when he is set to hold a hearing to discuss the matter further.",
      "A different judge, Curtis Farber, is presiding over Weinstein's retrial. The case will resume Monday with more jury selection after nine jurors were picked this week. In all, 12 jurors and six alternates need to be seated.",
      "Weinstein is being tried again on rape and sexual assault charges after New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, last year overturned his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial, finding that improper rulings and prejudicial testimony tainted the original one.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "Weinstein has been back and forth numerous times to Bellevue in recent months for treatment of various maladies. At a pretrial hearing in January, he railed against his treatment at Rikers, telling Farber he wanted to \u201cget out of this hellhole as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Weinstein's lawyers filed a legal claim against New York City last November, alleging he was receiving substandard medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at Rikers. The claim, which seeks $5 million in damages, argues that Weinstein has been returned to Rikers each time before fully recovering at the hospital.",
      "The troubled jail complex has faced growing scrutiny for its mistreatment of detainees and dangerous conditions. Last year, a federal judge cleared the way for a possible federal takeover, finding the city had placed inmates in \u201cunconstitutional danger.\u201d",

      "Hip hop superstar Drake is now complaining about rival rapper Kendrick Lamar's performance of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d at this year's Super Bowl, adding it to his defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group over the diss track and its allegations of pedophilia against Drake.",
      "\u201cThe Recording was performed during the 2025 Super Bowl and broadcast to the largest audience for a Super Bowl halftime show ever, over 133 million people, including millions of children, and millions more who had never before heard the song or any of the songs that preceded it,\" says the amended lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "It adds, \"It was the first, and will hopefully be the last, Super Bowl halftime show orchestrated to assassinate the character of another artist.\u201d",
      "Although Lamar removed the word \u201cpedophile\u201d that's in the track during the halftime show, the fact that it was omitted showed that \u201cnearly everyone understands that it is defamatory,\u201d the suit says. It also alleges Universal Music used financial benefits and leveraged business relationships to secure the headliner spot for Lamar at the Super Bowl, and promoted the performance.",
      "\u201cDrake\u2019s amended complaint makes an already strong case stronger,\u201d his lawyer, Michael Gottlieb, said in a statement. \"Drake will expose the evidence of UMG\u2019s misconduct, and UMG will be held accountable for the consequences of its ill-conceived decisions.\u201d",
      "This year's Super Bowl and its halftime show were the most-watched ever, according to Nielsen.",
      "In a statement responding to the court filing, Universal Music, the parent record label of both artists, continued to deny Drake's allegations.",

      "The amended lawsuit also adds that defamatory portions of \u201cNot Like Us\" were played at the Grammy Awards in February, when the single won five awards, including song and record of the year. The suit claims that Universal Music also helped secure the Grammy nominations and allowed the song to be played at the ceremony.",
      "Drake sued Universal Music, but not Lamar, for undisclosed damages in January, saying the company published and promoted \u201cNot Like Us\u201d despite its false pedophilia allegations and suggestions that listeners should resort to vigilante justice.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard at Drake\u2019s Toronto home and two attempted break-ins there, online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and a decrease in his brand\u2019s value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year. The amended lawsuit also adds more online comments indicating people believe the pedophilia allegations.",
      "Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner with 22 Grammy wins, have been beefing for years. The feud is among the biggest in hip hop in recent years.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year, as both launched diss tracks at each other, including Lamar's \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young / You better not ever go to cell block one,\u201d Lamar raps.",
      "In its motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Universal Music says Drake helped fuel the beef with his own inflammatory diss tracks aimed at Lamar.",
      "\u201cPlaintiff, one of the most successful recording artists of all time, lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated,\" the motion says. \"Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds.\u201d",

By then, Presley had become a major star and agreed to the appearance.",
      "Martindale and Presley stayed in touch on occasion through the years, and in 1959 he did a trans-Atlantic telephone interview with Presley, who was in the Army in Germany.

His first venture was \u201cHeadline Chasers,\u201d a coproduction with Merv Griffin that debuted in 1985 and was canceled after one season.

      "Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d has become a phenomenon",
      "Before Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d began airing Tuesday, Ulla Malmgren stocked up on coffee and prepared meals. She doesn't want to miss a moment of the 20-day, 24-hour event.",
      "\u201cSleep? Forget it. I don\u2019t sleep,\u201d she said.",
      "Malmgren, 62, isn't alone. The show, called \u201c Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen \u201d in Swedish and sometimes translated as \u201cThe Great Elk Trek\u201d in English, began in 2019 with nearly a million people watching. In 2024, the production hit 9 million viewers on SVT Play, the streaming platform for national broadcaster SVT.",
      "The livestream kicked off a week ahead of schedule due to warm weather and early moose movement. Malmgren was ready.",
      "From now until May 4, the livestream's remote cameras will capture dozens of moose as they swim across the \u00c5ngerman River, some 300 kilometers (187 miles) northwest of Stockholm, in the annual spring migration toward summer grazing pastures.",
      "Not much happens for hours at a time, and fans say that's the beauty of it.",
      "\u201cI feel relaxed, but at the same time I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a moose, oh! What if there\u2019s a moose? I can\u2019t go to the toilet!\u2019\u201d said William Garp Liljefors, 20, who has collected more than 150 moose plush toys since 2020.",
      "\u201cThe Great Moose Migration\" is part of a trend that began in 2009 with Norwegian public broadcaster NRK's minute-by-minute airing of a seven-hour train trip across the southern part of the country.",
      "The slow TV style of programming has spread, with productions in the United Kingdom, China and elsewhere. The central Dutch city of Utrecht, for example, installed a \u201c fish doorbell \u201d on a river lock that lets livestream viewers alert authorities to fish being held up as they migrate to spawning grounds.",
      "Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University in Sweden, said slow TV has roots in reality television but lacks the staging and therefore feels more authentic for viewers. The productions allow the audience to relax and watch the journey unfold.",
      "\u201cIt became, in a strange way, gripping because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,\" she said. \"But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.\u201d",
      "As an expert and a fan of \u201cThe Great Moose Migration,\u201d Hill said the livestream helps her slow down her day by following the natural rhythms of spring.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely a moment to have a calm, atmospheric setting in my own home, and I really appreciate it,\u201d she said.",
      "The calming effect extends to the crew, according to Johan Erhag, SVT's project manager for \u201cThe Great Moose Migration.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone who works with it goes down in their normal stress,\u201d he said.",
      "The moose have walked the route for thousands of years, making it easy for the crew to know where to lay some 20,000 meters (almost 12 miles) of cable and position 26 remote cameras and seven night cameras. A drone is also used.",
      "The crew of up to 15 people works out of SVT\u2019s control room in Ume\u00e5, producing the show at a distance to avoid interfering with the migration.",
      "SVT won't say how much the production costs, but Erhag said it's cheap when accounting for the 506 hours of footage aired last year.",
      "Erhag said Swedes have always been fascinated by the roughly 300,000 moose roaming in their woods. The Scandinavian country's largest animal is known as \u201cKing of the Forest.\u201d A bull moose can reach 210 centimeters (6 feet 10 inches) at shoulder height and weigh 450 kilograms (992 pounds).",
      "Despite their size, the herbivores are typically shy and solitary.",
      "\u201cWe actually don\u2019t see it very often. You often see it when you\u2019re out driving maybe once or twice in your life,\u201d Erhag said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one thing why it has been so, so popular. And then you bring in the nature to everyone\u2019s living room.\"",
      "Hanna Sandberg, 36, first began watching the show in 2019, though she didn't spot any moose. She tuned in the following year, finally saw some and got hooked.",
      "\u201cYou can watch them and be a part of their natural habitat in a way that you could never be otherwise,\u201d she said.",
      "After hours of showing an empty forest, a camera captures footage of a moose approaching the riverbank. Suddenly, slow TV turns urgent.",
      "The push alert hits SVT's app \u2014 \u201cF\u00f6rsta \u00e4lgarna i bild!\u201d which translates to \u201cFirst moose on camera!\u201d \u2014 as viewers worldwide tune in. The livestream's chat explodes as commenters type encouragement for the animal, now making its way into the water.",
      "\u201dI would actually like to be a little fly on the wall in every household that watches the moose migration. Because I think there is about a million people saying about the same thing: \u2018Go on! Yes, you can do it!\u2019\" Malmgren said.",
      "Mega-fans like Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, are committed to watching as many hours as possible.",
      "\u201cI was late to school because I saw moose and my teacher was like, \u2018What, you saw moose in the city?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018No, it\u2019s on the TV,\u2019\u201d Garp Liljefors said.",
      "Malmgren said friends and family have learned not to bother her when the moose are on the move.",
      "\u201cWhen someone asks me, \u2018What are you doing? Oh, never mind, it\u2019s the great migration,\u2019\" she said. \"They know.\u201d",

      "Five years after Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and hauled to jail in handcuffs, the disgraced movie mogul returns to a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday for a new trial covering the very same allegations",
      "NEW YORK -- Five years after Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and hauled to jail in handcuffs, the former movie mogul returns to a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday for a new trial covering the very same allegations \u2014 plus one that hasn't been tried before.",
      "It isn\u2019t double jeopardy, but rather a legal redo after a New York appeals court overturned the landmark #MeToo verdict a year ago.",
      "The state\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s convictions and 23-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial after finding that the original one was tilted by \u201cegregious\u201d judicial rulings and prejudicial testimony.",
      "Jury selection could take a few days. Opening statements and the start of testimony are expected next week. Judge Curtis Farber said that in addition to 12 jurors, six alternates will be picked. Prosecutors expect the retrial to last a month.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Weinstein\u2019s retrial:",
      "In some ways, the new trial will be two trials spliced into one.",
      "Weinstein, 73, faces charges involving two women from his original trial in 2020, Jessica Mann and Miriam Haley, and he\u2019s being tried for the first time on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t in the first case.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone. Prosecutors are not allowed to retry Weinstein on certain counts that he was acquitted of during his first trial, including charges of predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape.",
      "The judicial reboot will play out in a different climate than Weinstein\u2019s first trial, which drew intense media attention and saw protesters chanting \u201crapist\u201d outside the courthouse.",
      "The #MeToo movement, spawned by scores of allegations in 2017 against the ex-studio boss, has evolved and ebbed over time, and Weinstein has since been convicted in a separate rape case in Los Angeles \u2014 a verdict he is also appealing.",
      "While some stars are still facing a legal reckoning for alleged sexual misconduct \u2013 like Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who is set to go to trial next month \u2013 the drumbeat of allegations against powerful figures has abated from #MeToo\u2019s early days.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on two charges from his original trial: one count of criminal sex act for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and one count of third-degree rape for allegedly assaulting an aspiring actor in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Haley, a former production assistant on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway,\u201d testified at the 2020 trial that he pushed her onto a bed at his Manhattan apartment in June 2006 and forced oral sex on her, undeterred by her kicks and pleas of, \u201cNo, please don\u2019t do this, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, acknowledged that she kept in touch with Weinstein, exchanged warm messages with him, and accepted an invitation to his hotel room two weeks after the alleged assault, where he pulled her into bed for sex. Under New York law applicable at the time, Weinstein has not being charged with rape in connection with Haley\u2019s allegations.",
      "Mann, who said she saw Weinstein as a \u201cpseudo father\u201d figure as she pursued an acting career after a rough upbringing, testified at the 2020 trial that he trapped her in a hotel room in March 2013, ordered her to undress as he loomed over her, and then raped her. She alleges that Weinstein raped her again eight months later at a Beverly Hills hotel, where she worked as a hairdresser.",
      "Mann also kept in touch with Weinstein after the alleged assault, testifying that she sent him flattering emails, because \u201chis ego was so fragile,\u201d she said, and it \u201cmade me feel safe, worshipping him in this sense.\u201d",
      "In addition to Haley and Mann, Weinstein is also charged with one count of criminal sex act for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "That woman, who was not part of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, has not been named publicly. The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have done.",
      "Prosecutors said that the woman came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein's conviction, but revisited them and secured a new indictment after the first verdict was thrown out.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors shouldn't have waited nearly five years to bring the additional charge.",
      "New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction in April 2024.",
      "In a 4-3 decision, the court said then-Judge James Burke had denied Weinstein a fully fair trial by letting three women testify about allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case and his decision to let prosecutors confront Weinstein, if he had testified, over his history of brutish behavior.",
      "The court labeled the allegations against Weinstein \u201cappalling, shameful, repulsive conduct\u201d but warned that \u201cdestroying a defendant\u2019s character under the guise of prosecutorial need\u201d did not justify some trial evidence and testimony. Burke\u2019s term expired at the end of 2022, and he is no longer a judge.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Court of Appeals Judge Madeline Singas wrote that her colleagues in the majority were continuing a \u201cdisturbing trend of overturning juries\u2019 guilty verdicts in cases involving sexual violence.\u201d",
      "The ruling came at \u201cthe expense and safety of women,\u201d she wrote.",

      "SAN ANTONIO -- A Texas rapper who performed as Tay-K and was best known for his 2017 single \u201cThe Race\u201d was convicted of murder for a second time after a jury found him guilty of fatally shooting a San Antonio man.",
      "Taymor McIntyre faces up to life in prison with the possibility of parole for the killing of 23-year-old Mark Anthony Saldivar in 2017. McIntyre had already been been serving a 55-year sentence over a separate fatal shooting.",
      "Prosecutors said that McIntyre shot Saldivar after the rapper tried to rob him. Authorities said McIntyre had picked up Saldivar, who was a photographer, in a car after asking him to take photos of the rapper for a new song.",
      "McIntyre\u2019s attorneys had criticized the police investigation of the shooting, alleging the case relied too much on self-serving statements from witnesses in the car when the shooting happened.",
      "\u201cTaymor McIntyre is not guilty of capital murder, murder, or manslaughter, and the reason for that is very simple,\u201d John Hunter, one of McIntyre\u2019s attorneys, told jurors during closing arguments last week. \u201cYou have to do it right. You have to do the work. And this case clearly demonstrates the work wasn\u2019t done.\u201d",
      "The jury found McIntyre not guilty of capital murder, which would have meant a life sentence without the chance of parole. The jury will now hear evidence in the trial\u2019s punishment phase before deciding on a sentence.",
      "McIntyre was also convicted in 2019 for the shooting death of 21-year-old Ethan Walker during a home invasion in 2016 in Mansfield, southeast of Fort Worth, Texas.",

      "Amazon and Walmart are undergoing national expansions in same-day prescription deliveries. They\u2019re joining a trend that has gained momentum since the COVID-19 pandemic, with drugstore chains and companies like Instacart and DoorDash rushing to deliver prescriptions as soon as possible.",
      "Fast prescription delivery options are growing as traditional drugstores close and more people use telemedicine or subscription-based care that encourages regular deliveries.",
      "But this trend may run into limits in the complicated U.S. health care system, where drug costs and coverage can outweigh convenience for consumers, some of whom still like visiting a store.",
      "\u201cIt takes a lot to change people\u2019s behavior when it comes to their health care,\u201d said Arielle Trzcinski, a principal analyst with the consulting firm Forrester.",
      "Independent drugstores have done same-day deliveries for years, especially for patients who are homebound or recovering from surgeries, said Brigid Groves, a vice president with the American Pharmacists Association.",
      "CVS Health started same-day deliveries in 2017 and has since expanded its reach. The chain delivered more than 4 million prescriptions through that service in 2023.",
      "Walgreens also does this nationally and offers a service at hundreds of locations that will deliver within two hours.",
      "Instacart got into prescription deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic when it started a partnership with Costco. The grocery delivery company has since launched same-day delivery partnerships with Wegmans and Publix.",
      "Amazon expects to offer same-day prescription deliveries to nearly half of its U.S. customers by the end of this year. It\u2019s adding 20 small pharmacies to distribution centers around the country to improve delivery speeds.",
      "Separately, the company also has opened 10 prescription processing centers in the past few years. It can do same-day deliveries from those as well.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re building a modern pharmacy, what we like to think of as a pharmacy in your pocket,\u201d Amazon executive Hannah McClellan said at a company presentation last fall.",
      "The Amazon Pharmacy vice president added that this included rapid deliveries and around-the-clock access to pharmacists.",
      "Walmart launched same-day deliveries last fall in six states and expanded earlier this year to every state except North Dakota, where it has no pharmacies. The company allows customers to get their medicines along with groceries or other store items.",
      "It offers several levels of service, including some deliveries in a half hour.",
      "Customer demand drove Walmart\u2019s expansion, said Kevin Host, a pharmacy senior vice president. He said prescription deliveries were the top thing customers requested when surveyed by the company.",
      "Host noted that most people pick a pharmacy based on how close it is to their home or whether it has a drive-through window.",
      "\u201cThis is just elevating that level of convenience,\u201d he said.",
      "Same-day deliveries can help people get started quicker on antibiotics or COVID-19 treatments when they are sick and see a doctor via telemedicine.",
      "McClellan also said that customers who get their prescriptions quickly are more likely to take them. She said Amazon was doubling down on same-day deliveries this year and has \u201cbig plans to continue to build and scale those capabilities in the years to come.\u201d",
      "Patients may like convenience, but they like saving money even more.",
      "Same-day deliveries can come with additional fees. People who consider them will want to know whether they are getting a better deal on their medicines, Trczinski said. She noted that this is especially true with so-called maintenance prescriptions that are refilled repeatedly.",
      "People with insurance who are taking those maintenance drugs may already have them delivered, noted Andrew Mulcahy, a senior health economist with the nonprofit research organization RAND Corp.",
      "\u201cThe practical implications of these kinds of programs will be very muted,\u201d he said.",
      "Customers also will have to trust that their regular prescriptions get delivered on time and are covered by their health insurer, especially if they switch pharmacies for deliveries. Some pharmacy benefit managers limit coverage outside certain pharmacies.",
      "Drugstore pharmacists also have started providing more care and working with customers to manage conditions like high blood pressure. These things give people more reasons to visit a store.",
      "Plus, some people just prefer going to drugstores. Don Watson says he might consider prescription deliveries \u201cmaybe 10 years from now when I\u2019m not able to do it myself.\u201d",
      "The 72-year-old Indianapolis resident said as he left a Walgreens store recently that he has no problem picking up prescriptions.",

      "Allergy season can be miserable for tens of millions of Americans each year",
      "ATLANTA -- ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Allergy season can be miserable for tens of millions of Americans when trees, grass, and other pollens cause runny noses, itchy eyes, coughing and sneezing.",
      "Where you live, what you\u2019re allergic to and your lifestyle can make a big difference when it comes to the severity of your allergies. Experts say climate change is leading to longer and more intense allergy seasons, but also point out that treatments for seasonal allergies have become more effective over the last decade.",
      "Here are some tips from experts to keep allergy symptoms at bay \u2014 maybe even enough to allow you to enjoy the outdoors.",
      "The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America issues an annual ranking of the most challenging cities to live in if you have allergies, based on over-the-counter medicine use, pollen counts and the number of available allergy specialists.",
      "This year, the top five cities are: Wichita, Kansas; New Orleans; Oklahoma City; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Memphis.",
      "There are three main types of pollen. Earlier in the spring, tree pollen is the main culprit. After that grasses pollinate, followed by weeds in the late summer and early fall.",
      "Some of the most common tree pollens that cause allergies include birch, cedar, cottonwood, maple, elm, oak and walnut, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Grasses that cause symptoms include Bermuda, Johnson, rye and Kentucky bluegrass.",
      "Pollen trackers can help you decide when to go outside. The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology tracks levels through a network of counting stations across the U.S. Counts are available at its website and via email.",
      "The best and first step to controlling allergies is avoiding exposure. Keep the windows in your car and your home closed, even when it\u2019s nice outside.",
      "If you go outside, wearing long sleeves can keep pollen off your skin to help ward off allergic reactions, said Dr. James Baker, an allergist at the University of Michigan. It also provides some sun protection, he added.",
      "When you get home, change your clothes and shower daily to ensure all the pollen is off of you \u2014 including your hair. If you can\u2019t wash your hair every day, try covering it when you go outside with a hat or scarf. Don\u2019t get in the bed with your outside clothes on, because the pollen will follow.",
      "It's also useful to rinse your eyes and nose with saline to remove any pollen, experts said. And the same masks that got us through the pandemic can protect you from allergies \u2014 though they won\u2019t help with eye symptoms.",
      "Over-the-counter nasal sprays are among the most effective treatments for seasonal allergies, experts said.",
      "But the vast majority of patients use them incorrectly, irritating parts of the nose, said Dr. Kathleen Mays, an allergist at Augusta University in Georgia. She suggested angling the nozzle outward toward your ear rather than sticking it straight up your nose.",
      "Over-the-counter allergy pills like Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec are helpful, but may not be as effective as quickly since they're taken by mouth, experts said.",
      "Experts also said that if your allergy symptoms are impacting your quality of life, like causing you to lose sleep or a lack focus at work or school, it might be time to consider an allergist appointment for immunotherapies.",
      "Some remedies for allergy relief that have been circulating on social media or suggested by celebrities \u2014 like incorporating local honey into your diet to expose yourself to pollen \u2014 have been debunked.",
      "Dr. Shayam Joshi, an allergist at Oregon Health and Science University, said that's because the flowers that bees pollinate typically don't contain the airborne pollen that causes allergy symptoms.",
      "With climate change, winters are milder and growing seasons are longer, meaning there\u2019s more opportunity for pollen to stay in the air, resulting in longer and more severe allergy seasons.",
      "In many areas across the country, pollen counts have broken decades of records. In late March, the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Center measured a pollen count of over 14,000 grains per cubic meter, which is considered extremely high.",

      "First, the nation\u2019s top law firms",
      "WASHINGTON -- First the nation\u2019s top law firms. Then its premier universities. Now, President Donald Trump is leaning on the advocacy groups that underpin U.S. civil society.",
      "Trump said Thursday that the administration is looking at the tax-exempt status not just of Harvard, but environmental groups and specifically the ethics watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. It could be a devastating financial blow to the nonprofit organizations \u2014 and his perceived political foes.",
      "The president\u2019s remarks, during an event at the White House, began to confirm what advocacy groups have been quietly warning: Trump\u2019s campaign of retribution is coming next for them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a charitable organization,\u201d Trump said about CREW, in particular. \u201cThe only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at a lot of things.\u201d",
      "Trump and his team have been working their way through the nation\u2019s institutions, threatening to chisel away at the independence and autonomy of the law firms, college campuses and now advocacy groups \u2014 or putting them at risk of losing their federal funds or professional livelihood.",
      "It's all coming quickly, not yet 100 days into the new administration, and in ways historically unheard of in this country for their speed and scope. And it's sending shock waves reverberating throughout the American system.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day in this country when organizations that provide critical services to their communities are under attack from their government,\u201d said Cole Leiter, executive director of the advocacy group Americans Against Government Censorship. \u201cNo administration, Republican or Democratic, should be able to weaponize the weight of the government against their political enemies.\"",
      "On their own, Trump's actions are an almost daily list of executive pronouncements from the White House. The Trump administration has issued orders against the law firms that had cases or attorneys perceived to be against him, and it has made demands of the universities over their rules around campus activism.",
      "Thursday brought potentially more to the stack: Trump singled out CREW, the watchdog group whose founder, Norm Eisen, played a pivotal role in Trump\u2019s first impeachment, and the environmental groups that largely stand at odds with his \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d agenda.",
      "\u201cTax exempt status \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a privilege. It\u2019s really a privilege, and it\u2019s been abused by a lot more than Harvard,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be making some statements. It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d",
      "But taken together, the executive orders and actions and memos are making one thing clear: The Trump administration is eager to test new ways to flex executive power, and dare the courts and Congress to intervene. And there\u2019s more expected to come.",
      "Environmental, immigration and civil society advocacy groups have been bracing for potential threats to their tax-exempt status, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. The person said some expect Trump might start taking action against the environmental groups on Earth Day, which is Tuesday.",
      "These are the largely nonprofit organizations and groups, many based in Washington, advocating for various communities, constituencies and causes.",
      "Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said environmental groups have heard that the Trump administration is preparing executive orders targeting the tax status of environmental groups that work on climate change, as well as that of any foundations that fund their work.",
      "\u201cTrump is marshaling all the power of government to punish his perceived enemies,\" Suckling said. \"We\u2019ve got a crack legal team and will have him in court within 24 hours. We\u2019re ready and waiting for him to come at us.\u201d",
      "CREW has been a leading ethics group in Washington, with Trump long the subject of its probes.",
      "Ahead of the 2024 election, the group was part of the legal effort to disqualify Trump from regaining the White House under the 14th Amendment, in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. More recently, CREW sued over the firing of federal workers by Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\u201cFor more than 20 years, CREW has exposed government corruption from politicians of both parties who violate the public trust and has worked to promote an ethical, transparent government,\" said Jordan Libowitz, the organization's vice president.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on civil society have created a climate that is potentially chilling for the organizations in question \u2014 but they have had mixed results.",
      "Five of the major law firms and Trump reached a deal in which they agreed to provide a combined hundreds of millions of dollars in pro bono counsel to causes the administration says it supports. The firms are trying to avoid various sanctions, including terminated federal contracts, federal employment investigations over diversity hiring and others.",
      "While Columbia University agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s demands to overhaul its rules for public protests rather than risk billions of dollars in lost federal funds, Harvard rebuffed the administration and now faces a $2 billion federal funding freeze and the threat to its tax-exempt status.",
      "The tax-exempt status allows nonprofit organizations to receive donations that are crucial to their financial bottom line. Changing that could, in some situations, lead to calamity.",
      "\u201cGood governance groups are the heart of a healthy democracy,\" Libowitz said. \"We will continue to do our work to ensure Americans have an ethical and accountable government.\u201d",

      "Taking a mental health leave from work is becoming more of an option for people in the United States even thought most of them probably don't know it",
      "NEW YORK -- Her first panic attack came at a company-wide meeting, right before her scheduled presentation. Carolina Lasso had given many similar talks about her marketing team's accomplishments. When her name was called this time, she couldn\u2019t speak.",
      "\u201cI felt a knot in my throat,\u201d Lasso said. \u201cMy head, it felt like it was inside a bubble. I couldn\u2019t hear, I couldn\u2019t see, and it felt like an eternity. It was just a few seconds, but it was so profound, and in a way earth-shattering to me.\u201d",
      "Lasso was struggling after a cross-country move followed by a divorce. Her boss suggested a mental health leave, a possibility she didn\u2019t know existed. She worried whether taking time off would affect how her team viewed her or cost her a future promotion, but in the end she did.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thankful for that opportunity to take the time to heal,\" Lasso, 43, said. \u201cMany people feel guilty when they take a leave of absence when it\u2019s mental health-related. ... There is some extra weight that we carry on our shoulders, as if it had been our fault.\u201d",
      "Despite a fear of repercussions, more adults are recognizing that stepping back from work to deal with emotional burdens or psychological conditions that get in the way of their lives is a necessary choice, one that a growing number of employers recognize.",
      "ComPsych Corp., a provider of employee mental health programs and absence management services, encourages its business clients to make the well-being of workers a priority before individuals get to a breaking point while also having processes in place for those who require leaves of absence.",
      "\u201cSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, collectively we\u2019ve just been in this constant state of turmoil,\u201d Jennifer Birdsall, the senior clinical director at ComPysch, said. \u201cWe just have had this barrage of change and uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Depression, anxiety and adjustment disorder, which involves excessive reactions to stress, were the top three diagnoses of employees who took mental health leaves in the past two years among clients of Alight, a Chicago-based technology company which administers leaves and benefits for large employers.",
      "A mental health leave can last weeks or months. In some cases, workers get approval to work a reduced schedule or to take short periods of time off when needed, using an approach called \u201cintermittent leave.\u201d",
      "At most U.S. organizations with 50 or more employees, people can request leaves through the Family and Medical Leave Act. The federal law entitles workers with serious health conditions to paid or unpaid leaves of up to 12 weeks, depending on state and local laws.",
      "Some employers require people to use sick days or accumulated vacation days to continue receiving a paycheck while out. For longer leaves, workers can access short-term disability plans, if their employer offers one.",
      "Lasso's leave lasted six months, and included therapy and travel to India for additional treatment. She returned to her job but decided after a year to leave for good. She later launched a business to train people on fostering a more humane work culture.",
      "A mental health leave is \u201cnot only OK, but it can really unlock new possibilities once we have the time to do the work \u2014 therapy, medication, whatever it is \u2014 and have enough distance from work to be able to reconnect with ourselves,\u201d Lasso said.",
      "A social stigma around mental health challenges causes many people to avoid seeking treatment or requesting a leave of absence. Newton Cheng, director of health and performance at Google, hopes to change that by sharing his own struggles.",
      "His first self-disclosure happened during the pandemic, when a senior manager invited employees at a meeting to share how they were doing. When it was his turn, Cheng started crying.",
      "He explained he was struggling to live up to his expectations of himself as a father and didn't know how to turn things around.",
      "\u201cIt was just totally horrifying to me because, one, I had just cried in front of my coworkers and I was definitely taught as a professional \u2014 and as a man \u2014 you do not do that,\" Cheng recalled. \"And then two, I had never really articulated and said out loud those words. I hadn\u2019t even allowed myself to think that. But now they\u2019re out there and I had to face them.\u201d",
      "Colleagues responded by relaying their own struggles, but Cheng's difficulties continued. By February 2021, he couldn't get out of bed because he felt paralyzed by dread, he said. A therapist said he was showing symptoms of major depression and anxiety.",
      "\u201cI just realized, \u2018I\u2019m struggling a lot and this goes pretty deep. I don\u2019t think I can keep just putting duct tape on this. I probably need to take some leave,\u2019\u201d Cheng recalled.",
      "Hoping his decision would benefit others, he announced to 200 people at a conference that he planned to take mental health leave. Instead of derailing the gathering as he feared, his honesty inspired fellow conference attendees to open up.",
      "\"It was like a fireworks show,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe he did that.\u2019 Then they forgot about me. But the tone was set. It was like \u2019Oh, this is what we\u2019re doing. Let me talk about what\u2019s going on with me, too.'\u201d",
      "While balancing classes and a full-time job during her last year of college, Rosalie Mae began struggling to get out of bed and crying uncontrollably. Yet she felt like she had \u201cto keep it together\u201d to avoid burdening her colleagues at the University of Utah bookstore, where Mae worked as an accounting clerk.",
      "Then she found herself calling a suicide hotline. \u201cOnce it reached that point, I knew, especially at the urging of my husband, we need to do something more,\u201d Mae, 24, said.",
      "In her case, that meant taking a five-week work leave to put her own health and well-being first. She recommends the same for others who find themselves in a similar position.",
      "\u201cTaking a mental health leave is not necessarily a cure-all, but it is important to give yourself a break and allow yourself to regroup, make a plan of how to proceed and take the steps to work towards feeling better,\" Mae said.",
      "Before broaching the subject of a mental health leave with a manager, consider the workplace culture and the strength of your professional relationships, Cheng said. He recalls saying, \u201cFor my health and well-being, and the sake of my family and what's best for the business, the least risky thing for me to do is to go on leave soon.\u201d",
      "Individuals who suspect an unsympathetic reception can simply say, \u201cI need to go on medical leave. I need time to recover,\u201d he advised.",
      "There's also no legal or ethical requirement to tell everyone you work with the nature of your leave.",
      "\u201cYour coworkers don't need to know why,\u201d said Seth Turner, co-founder of AbsenceSoft, a leave and accommodation management solutions provider. \u201cThey just need to know, 'I\u2019m going to be here at this time, and I'm going to be gone at this time, and I'll be back.'\u201d",

      "The U.K. Supreme Court has ruled that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition",
      "LONDON -- In a judgment with far-reaching implications, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition.",
      "The ruling was cheered by some feminists who have campaigned to safeguard rights for women on the basis of biological sex. Trans rights campaigners were disappointed, and worry about the ruling's implications for transgender women.",
      "The court was asked to determine the definition of a woman under Britain\u2019s 2010 Equality Act, which sets out protections against discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, race, religion and other traits.",
      "The case stems from a 2018 law passed by the Scottish Parliament calling for 50% female representation on the boards of Scottish public bodies. Its definition of women included trans women whose gender is legally affirmed with a Gender Recognition Certificate.",
      "A feminist group, For Women Scotland, challenged that in court, saying the Scottish government had overstepped its powers by effectively redefining the meaning of \u201cwoman.\u201d",
      "The group lost a ruling in a Scottish court in 2022 but was later granted permission to take its case to the Supreme Court, which held hearings in November.",
      "Justice Patrick Hodge said he and four other judges ruled unanimously that \u201cthe terms woman and sex in the Equality Act refer to a biological woman.\u201d",
      "In the law, \u201cthe words \u2018sex,\u2019 \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019 \u2026 mean (and were always intended to mean) biological sex, biological woman and biological man,\u201d the judges wrote.",
      "The judges argued that a broader definition that includes transgender people would make the Equality Act \u201cincoherent and unworkable.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can identify no good reason why the legislature should have intended that sex-based rights and protections under the (Equality Act) should apply to these complex, heterogenous groupings, rather than to the distinct group of (biological) women and girls (or men and boys) with their shared biology leading to shared disadvantage and discrimination faced by them as a distinct group,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The ruling makes no mention of intersex people, who also are not explicitly protected under the Equality Act.",
      "As in other countries, the issue has polarized opinion, pitting transgender rights campaigners against \u201cgender critical\u201d feminists, who argue that trans women's rights should not come at the expense of those who are born biologically female.",
      "For Women Scotland said it was \u201cabsolutely jubilant\u201d at the ruling. \u201cHarry Potter\u201d author J.K. Rowling, a prominent supporter of the group, said the court victory had \u201cprotected the rights of women and girls across the U.K.\u201d",
      "But LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall said there is \u201cdeep concern\u201d surrounding the ruling's consequences.",
      "Vic Valentine, manager of the group Scottish Trans, said the judgment \u201cseems to have totally missed what matters to trans people \u2014 that we are able to live our lives, and be recognized, in line with who we truly are.\u201d",
      "Amnesty International U.K. described the ruling as \u201cdisappointing,\u201d but said it is \u201cimportant to stress that the court has been clear that trans people are protected under the Equality Act against discrimination and harassment.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court judges stressed that their ruling should not be seen as an attack on transgender people. They said it \u201cdoes not remove or diminish the important protections \u2026 for trans people\u201d under the Equality Act, which bans discrimination against transgender people.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what the ruling will mean in practice.",
      "The judgment highlights a range of spaces and services that could be intended just for women, including \u201crape or domestic violence counselling, domestic violence refuges, rape crisis centers, female-only hospital wards and changing rooms.\u201d The law already allowed for trans women to be excluded from single-sex spaces under certain circumstances, but Wednesday\u2019s ruling appears to make such a ban easier.",
      "The ruling could also see transgender female athletes excluded from participating in women\u2019s and girls sports, and there could also be ramifications in workplaces.",
      "But much depends on how the ruling is interpreted and implemented.",
      "Hannah Ford, an employment partner at law firm Stevens & Bolton, told the BBC that because of the ruling, ensuring workplaces are welcoming places for trans people will be \u201can uphill battle.\u201d",
      "She said one positive aspect was that \u201cat least we have simplicity and clarity. So it is in one sense a triumph of sense over legal incoherency and legal fiction.\u201d",

      "U.S. researchers are about to test if livers from gene-edited pigs could treat people with sudden liver failure \u2014 not with a transplant but temporarily attached outside the body",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. researchers will soon test whether livers from a gene-edited pig could treat people with sudden liver failure \u2014 by temporarily filtering their blood so their own organ can rest and maybe heal.",
      "The first-of-its-kind clinical trial has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, according to pig producer eGenesis, which announced the step Tuesday with its partner OrganOx.",
      "An estimated 35,000 people in the U.S. are hospitalized each year when their liver suddenly fails. There are few treatment options and death rates as high as 50%. Many don't qualify for a liver transplant or can't get a match in time.",
      "The new study, which is expected to get underway later this spring, is a twist on the quest for animal-to-human organ transplants. Researchers won't transplant the pig liver but instead will attach it externally to study participants.",
      "The liver is the only organ that can regenerate, but the question is whether having the pig's liver filter the patient's blood for several days could give it that chance.",
      "In experiments with four deceased bodies, that \u201cbridge\u201d attempt showed the pig liver could support some functions of a human liver for two or three days, said Mike Curtis, CEO of Massachusetts-based eGenesis, which genetically modifies pigs so their organs are more humanlike.",
      "The trial will enroll up to 20 patients in intensive-care units who don't qualify a liver transplant, he said. A device made by Britain\u2019s OrganOx, currently used to preserve donated human livers, will pump participants' blood through the pig liver.",
      "It\u2019s the latest step in attempts to use gene-edited pig organs to save human lives. Pig kidneys from eGenesis and another pig producer, United Therapeutics, are being used in experimental transplants.",

      "A new study has found that fewer people crossed state lines for abortions in 2024 than the previous year",
      "Fewer people crossed state lines to obtain abortions in 2024 than a year earlier, a new survey has found.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, estimates in a report released Tuesday that the overall number of clinician-provided abortions in states where it's legal rose by less than 1% from 2023 to 2024.",
      "But the number of people crossing state lines for abortions dropped by about 9%.",
      "The report, based on a monthly survey of providers, is the latest look at how the abortion landscape in the U.S. has evolved since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022 in a ruling that eliminated a national constitutional right to abortion and opened the door to state bans and restrictions.",
      "Guttmacher estimates there were 1.04 million abortions in 2024, up about 1% from its total the previous year.",
      "Multiple studies have found that the total number of abortions in the U.S. has risen since Dobbs, despite some states implementing bans.",
      "Twelve states currently enforce abortion bans with limited exceptions at all stages of pregnancy. Four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "Guttmacher's tally does not capture self-managed abortions such as people obtaining abortion pills from community networks, foreign pharmacies or through telehealth from medical providers in states that have laws intended to protect those who send pills into places with bans. There\u2019s a court battle over the constitutionality of such laws. But another survey found that the number of telehealth pills being sent into states with bans has been growing and accounted for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S. by the summer of 2024.",
      "Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at Guttmacher, said even though the number of abortions is up, it's likely some people who would like to end their pregnancies are not able to.",
      "\u201cWe know that some people are accessing abortion through telehealth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know it\u2019s not an option for everybody.\u201d",
      "The number of people crossing state lines for abortions dropped to about 155,000 from nearly 170,000.",
      "The year-to-year impact varies by state.",
      "For instance, about 1 in 8 abortions in Florida in the first half of 2023 were provided to people coming from out of state. By the second half of 2024 \u2014 when a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy took effect \u2014 only about 1 in 50 were for people from another state.",
      "More people traveled to states including Virginia and New York after the Florida law took hold.",
      "A drop in people traveling to Minnesota could be linked to abortions being offered again in clinics in Wisconsin.",
      "Most abortions in Kansas are provided to people from elsewhere and the number grew as clinic capacity expanded.",
      "A working paper released in March provided different insight into the impact of the bans.",
      "It found that birth rates rose from 2020 to 2023 in counties farther from abortion clinics. Rates rose faster for Black and Hispanic women, those with lower education levels, and people who are unmarried.",
      "\u201cThe takeaway is that distance still matters,\u201d said Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economic professor and one of the authors of the working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t obvious that that would be the case.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese bans are more than just policies; these are direct attacks on bodily autonomy,\" said Regina Davis Moss, president and CEO of In Our Own Voice: National Black Women\u2019s Reproductive Justice Agenda.",
      "The bans also exacerbate the huge disparities in maternal mortality for Black women in the U.S, she said. Black women died around the time of childbirth at a rate nearly 3.5 times higher than white women in 2023.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be faced with increasing numbers of births, which is going to increase the maternal mortality rate, the infant mortality rate and inequities in care,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very upsetting and sad.\u201d",
      "Bree Wallace, director of case management at the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund in Florida, which helps with the logistics and costs of abortions, said people who consider getting an abortion don\u2019t always know their options.",
      "\u201cMany people don\u2019t know their choices or think that it\u2019s just not possible to go out of state,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people hear \u2018ban\u2019 or \u2018six-week ban\u2019 in their state and that\u2019s it.\u201d",

      "An Associated Press and Side Effects Public Media data analysis shows one in six visits to the emergency department in 2022 that resulted in hospital admission had a wait of four or more hours",
      "AURORA, Ill. -- At her mother\u2019s home in Illinois, Tracy Balhan flips through photos of her dad, Bill Speer. In one picture, he\u2019s smiling in front of a bucket of sweating beers and wearing a blue T-shirt that reads, \u201cPops. The man. The myth. The legend.\u201d",
      "Balhan\u2019s father died last year after struggling with dementia. During one episode late in his life, he became so agitated that he tried to exit a moving car. Balhan recalls her dad \u2014 larger than life, steady and loving \u2014 yelling at the top of his lungs.",
      "His geriatric psychiatrist recommended she take him to the emergency room at Endeavor Health\u2019s Edward Hospital in the Chicago suburb of Naperville because of its connection to an inpatient behavioral care unit. She hoped it would help get him a quick referral.",
      "But Speer spent 12 hours in the emergency room \u2014 at one point restrained by staff \u2014 waiting for a psych evaluation. Balhan didn\u2019t know it then, but her dad\u2019s experience at the hospital is so common it has a name: ER boarding.",
      "One in six visits to the emergency department in 2022 that resulted in hospital admission had a wait of four or more hours, according to an Associated Press and Side Effects Public Media data analysis. Fifty percent of the patients who were boarded for any length of time were 65 and older, the analysis showed.",
      "Some people who aren\u2019t in the middle of a life-threatening emergency might even wait weeks, health care experts said.",
      "ER boarding is a symptom of the U.S. health care system\u2019s struggles, including shrinking points of entry for patients seeking care outside of ERs and hospitals prioritizing beds for procedures insurance companies often pay more for.",
      "Experts also warn the boarding issue will worsen as the number of people 65 and older in the U.S. with dementia grows in the coming decades. Hospital bed capacity in the U.S. may not keep up. Between 2003 and 2023, the number of staffed hospital beds was static, even as emergency department visits shot up 30% to 40% over that same period.",
      "For older people with dementia, boarding can be especially dangerous, Chicago-based geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Shafi Siddiqui said. One research letter published in June 2024 in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at more than 200,000 patients and found long ER stays could be linked to a higher risk of dementia patients developing delirium \u2014 a temporary state of mental confusion and sometimes hallucinations.",
      "\u201cPeople need to be enraged about (boarding),\u201d said Dr. Vicki Norton, president-elect of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine.",
      "National emergency physician groups have lobbied for years to keep boarding under control. While they\u2019ve made some progress, nothing substantial has changed, despite concerns that it leads to worse patient outcomes.",
      "Dr. Alison Haddock, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said that\u2019s because boarding is a failing of the entire health care system that manifests in the ER, so solving it demands a systemic approach.",
      "Federal and state policy decisions made nearly 40 years ago limited the number of hospital beds, said Arjun Venkatesh, who studies emergency medicine at Yale. People are now living longer, he said, resulting in more complicated illnesses.",
      "In 2003, there were 965,000 staffed hospital beds compared to 913,000 in 2023, according to the American Hospital Association. And another JAMA research letter published in February shows there are 16% fewer staffed beds in the U.S. post-pandemic.",
      "The ones available may be prioritized for \u201cscheduled care\u201d patients who need non-urgent procedures, like cancer care or orthopedic surgeries. Insurance companies pay hospitals more for those surgeries, Haddock said, so hospitals aren\u2019t likely to move patients into those beds \u2014 even as emergency rooms fill up.",
      "Though long stays in the emergency department are common, there isn\u2019t good data that tracks the extremes, emergency medicine experts said.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently ended a requirement that hospitals track the \u201cmedian\u201d wait times in their emergency departments. An advisory group that develops quality measures for CMS recommended that the agency try to more accurately capture long emergency department stays. That measure has recently been submitted to CMS, which can choose to adopt it.",
      "Patients\u2019 families worry that long emergency room stays may make things worse for their loved ones, forcing some to search for limited alternatives to turn for support and care.",
      "Nancy Fregeau lives in Kankakee, Illinois, with her husband Michael Reeman, who has dementia.",
      "Last year, she said he visited the Riverside Medical Center emergency department several times, often staying more than four hours and in one case more than 10, before finally getting access to a behavioral care bed. Riverside declined to comment on Reeman\u2019s case.",
      "During long waits, Fregeau doesn\u2019t know what reassurance she can offer her husband.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough for anyone to be in the ER but I cannot imagine someone with dementia being in there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just kept saying \u2018When am I going? What\u2019s happening?\u2019\u201d",
      "Since November, Reeman has been going to the MCA Senior Adult Day Center in Kankakee. Fregeau said Reeman treats the day center like it\u2019s his job, offering to vacuum and clean, but comes home happier after having time around other people and away from the house.",
      "In Illinois, there are fewer adult day centers than there are counties, and other resources for people with dementia are shrinking, too. A report from the American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living found that 1,000 nursing homes in the U.S. closed between 2015 and 2022. At least 15 behavioral health centers, which are facilities that specialize in treating mental health issues, closed in 2023.",
      "With fewer places for patients to go after being discharged, hospital beds are being used for longer, exacerbating the boarding problem. It\u2019s becoming more difficult to get a specialty hospital bed, especially when patients\u2019 dementia causes aggression.",
      "That was the case for Balhan\u2019s father, who became increasingly agitated during his ER stay. Hospital staff told Balhan the behavioral care unit wasn\u2019t taking dementia patients, so Speer was stuck in the ER for 24 hours until they found a behavioral health facility, separate from the health system, that would take him.",
      "While the hospital couldn\u2019t comment on Speer\u2019s specific situation, Endeavor Health spokesperson Spencer Walrath said its behavioral care unit typically admits geriatric psychiatry patients, including those with dementia, but it depends on factors like bed availability and the patient\u2019s specific medical needs.",
      "Balhan feels that the U.S. health care system failed to treat her dad as a human being.",
      "\"It didn\u2019t feel to me like he was being treated with any dignity as a person,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anything could change, that would be the change that I would want to see.\"",

      "The man was spotted around 11 a.m. in a parking lot outside of the UnitedHealthcare corporate campus in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka. City spokesman Andy Wittenborg said the man contacted the FBI's field office in Minneapolis once he arrived, and an FBI negotiator made contact with him by phone.",

      "City police and the FBI coordinated their response and had steady contact with the man, successfully encouraging him to peacefully surrender to authorities after about an hour with no threat to the public, Wittenborg said. The man, who'd had previous contacts with Minnetonka police, had showed up at a security checkpoint where he was not supposed to be.",
      "Wittenborg said the incident had nothing to do with the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was shot to death in New York City on Dec. 4 as he was walking to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan. The man accused of killing him, Luigi Mangione, 26, pleaded not guilty in December to state murder and terror charges.",
      "News helicopter video of the aftermath showed over a dozen law enforcement vehicles from multiple agencies at the scene, as well as an ambulance that was standing by. There were no reports of injuries.",
      "The CEO\u2019s killing and ensuing manhunt leading to Mangione\u2019s arrest rattled the business community, with some health insurers hastily switching to remote work or online shareholder meetings. It also galvanized health insurance critics \u2014 some of whom rallied around Mangione as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty medical bills.",

      "Dozens of Ukrainians have gathered at a bombed-out church in the country\u2019s north to celebrate Easter Sunday, doubting a ceasefire with Russia is possible",
      "LUKASHIVKA, Ukraine -- Dozens of Ukrainians gathered outside the ruins of a damaged church in northern Ukraine on Sunday to mark Easter, doubting a ceasefire with Russia is possible.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin unilaterally announced a temporary Easter truce from Saturday evening to midnight following Easter Sunday, citing humanitarian reasons. This came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are \u201ccoming to a head.\u201d",
      "Kyiv has voiced skepticism about the Easter ceasefire, saying it would only mirror a genuine halt in hostilities. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine\u2019s offer of a 30-day, full and unconditional ceasefire and called on Moscow to respond.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday night that Russian strikes continued, although with less intensity, particularly near the border where Ukrainian forces maintain footholds in Russia\u2019s Kursk and Belgorod regions. Ukrainian soldiers interviewed by The Associated Press at various frontline positions confirmed the ongoing hostilities.",
      "In the village of Lukashivka in the Chernihiv region, briefly occupied by Russian forces in 2022, parishioners of the damaged Ascension Church arrived early at a small makeshift wooden church built last year to cater to the needs of the faithful, holding traditional Easter baskets and cakes to have them blessed.",
      "As the sun rose, they stood quietly in the spring chill, the roofless silhouette of the wrecked church behind them, its pale walls scarred by shell fragments.",
      "The church\u2019s priest, Serhii Zezul, walked among them, shouting \u201cChrist is risen!\u201d as he sprinkled holy water over the baskets \u2014 his voice nearly drowned out by the hum of a nearby generator.",
      "The restoration of the original church, a 20th-century architectural landmark, would require at least hundreds of thousands of dollars, money the community doesn't have as the war rages on.",
      "Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, about 530 churches across Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed, and at least 25 clergy members have been killed, according to Ruslan Khalikov, head of the \u201cReligion on Fire\u201d project, which monitors Russian war crimes against religious communities.",
      "\u201cA destroyed church is a shattered soul of the community,\u201d Zezul said. \u201cWhen churches fall, the heart and core that unite people begin to collapse.\u201d",
      "More people than usual gathered in the damaged church's courtyard on Sunday. Some said they drove from cities to Lukashivka to mark Easter, fearing Russian forces might target large gatherings, especially after a recent string of missile strikes killed dozens of civilians.",
      "For 26 years, 44-year-old Olha Rudeno attended church in the nearby city of Chernihiv, where she got married.",
      "\u201cBut given the war, it\u2019s psychologically difficult for me to go where there are large gatherings in cities,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cBelieving in a ceasefire is deceiving yourself. I don\u2019t know how much time has to pass for me to truly believe one is possible,\" she said.",
      "Doubt of a truce between Russia and Ukraine has deepened as U.S.-led efforts have so far yielded no breakthrough. Moscow has effectively rejected a separate, comprehensive ceasefire proposal, backed by Trump and endorsed by Ukraine, tying any agreement to a halt in Kyiv\u2019s troop mobilization and Western arms supplies \u2014 conditions Ukraine has refused, fearing they would allow Russia to regroup and escalate.",
      "\u201cMy personal opinion is that there will be no ceasefire,\u201d said the church's priest Serhii Zezul. \u201cAnd even if there is one, there are no details on where it would apply. On the front line, our soldiers are still fighting.\u201d",
      "Still, Zezul said that celebrating Easter among ruins reflects the resilience of faith during war. \u201cDespite everything, people still gather. They believe in something better. We are being reborn, we are standing back up. Truth always triumphs over evil. People believe that, they hope for that.\u201d",
      "In his Easter message, Zelenskyy reflected on suffering and the struggle to hold on to faith. \u201cEach of us has lived through such moments ... and you ask: \u2018God, why is this happening to us?\u2019\u201d",
      "He also mentioned the deadly missile strike on Sumy during Palm Sunday, and the bombardments of Kryvyi Rih, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Odesa, and other cities, saying people tend to turn inward when they can't make sense of things.",

The thousands of people below erupted in cheers as a military band kicked off a round of the Holy See and Italian anthem.",

This year, Easter is being celebrated on the same day by Catholics and Orthodox Christians, and has been marked by Russia's announced a temporary Easter truce in its war in Ukraine.",
      "Easter at the Vatican traditionally involves a Mass and the pope\u2019s Urbi et Orbi blessing (Latin for \u201cto the city and the world\u201d), a speech delivered from the loggia over the basilica entrance which is usually a roundup of global hotspots and human suffering. It remained to be seen if Francis would appear to pronounce the speech or just impart the apostolic blessing at the end.",
      "Francis has sharply cut back his workload as he follows doctors\u2019 orders of two months of convalescence and respiratory therapy to improve his lung function. He still seems to require great effort to project his voice, and his breathing remains labored.",
      "Before Sunday, his biggest outing had been a visit to Rome\u2019s downtown prison to spend Holy Thursday with inmates. The visit made clear his priorities as he slowly recovers: to spend time with the people most on the margins.",

      "While the nearly 14-year Syrian civil war came to an end with the fall of Bashar Assad on Dec. 8, war remnants continue to kill and maim. Contamination from land mines and explosive remnants has killed at least 249 people, including 60 children, and injured another 379 since Dec. 8, according to INSO, an international organization which coordinates safety for aid workers.",
      "Mines and explosive remnants \u2014 widely used since 2011 by Syrian government forces, its allies, and armed opposition groups \u2014 have contaminated vast areas, many of which only became accessible after the Assad government\u2019s collapse, leading to a surge in the number of land mine casualties, according to a recent Human Rights Watch (HRW) report.",
      "Prior to Dec. 8, land mines and explosive remnants of war also frequently injured or killed civilians returning home and accessing agricultural land.",
      "\u201cWithout urgent, nationwide clearance efforts, more civilians returning home to reclaim critical rights, lives, livelihoods, and land will be injured and killed,\u201d said Richard Weir, a senior crisis and conflict researcher at HRW.",
      "Experts estimate that tens of thousands of land mines remain buried across Syria, particularly in former front-line regions like rural Idlib.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t even have an exact number,\u201d said Ahmad Jomaa, a member of a demining unit under Syria's defense ministry. \u201cIt will take ages to clear them all.\u201d",
      "Jomaa spoke while scanning farmland in a rural area east of Maarrat al-Numan with a handheld detector, pointing at a visible anti-personnel mine nestled in dry soil.",
      "\u201cThis one can take off a leg,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to detonate it manually.\u201d",
      "Farming remains the main source of income for residents in rural Idlib, making the presence of mines a daily hazard. Days earlier a tractor exploded nearby, severely injuring several farm workers, Jomaa said. \u201cMost of the mines here are meant for individuals and light vehicles, like the ones used by farmers,\u201d he said.",
      "Jomaa\u2019s demining team began dismantling the mines immediately after the previous government was ousted. But their work comes at a steep cost.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had 15 to 20 (deminers) lose limbs, and around a dozen of our brothers were killed doing this job,\u201d he said. Advanced scanners, needed to detect buried or improvised devices, are in short supply, he said. Many land mines are still visible to the naked eye, but others are more sophisticated and harder to detect.",
      "Land mines not only kill and maim but also cause long-term psychological trauma and broader harm, such as displacement, loss of property, and reduced access to essential services, HRW says.",
      "The rights group has urged the transitional government to establish a civilian-led mine action authority in coordination with the UN Mine Action Service (UNMAS) to streamline and expand demining efforts.",
      "Syria's military under the Assad government laid explosives years ago to deter opposition fighters. Even after the government seized nearby territories, it made little effort to clear the mines it left behind.",
      "Standing before his brother\u2019s grave, Salah Sweid holds up a photo on his phone of Mohammad, smiling behind a pile of dismantled mines. \u201cMy mother, like any other mother would do, warned him against going,\u201d Salah said. \u201cBut he told them, \u2018If I don\u2019t go and others don\u2019t go, who will?

      "Mohammad was 39 when he died on Jan. 12 while demining in a village in Idlib. A former Syrian Republican Guard member trained in planting and dismantling mines, he later joined the opposition during the uprising, scavenging weapon debris to make arms.",
      "He worked with Turkish units in Azaz, a city in northwest Syria, using advanced equipment, but on the day he died, he was on his own. As he defused one mine, another hidden beneath it detonated. After Assad\u2019s ouster, mines littered his village in rural Idlib. He had begun volunteering to clear them \u2014 often without proper equipment \u2014 responding to residents\u2019 pleas for help, even on holidays when his demining team was off duty, his brother said.",
      "For every mine cleared by people like Mohammad, many more remain.",
      "In a nearby village, Jalal al-Maarouf, 22, was tending to his goats three days after the Assad government\u2019s collapse when he stepped on a mine. Fellow shepherds rushed him to a hospital, where doctors amputated his left leg.",
      "He has added his name to a waiting list for a prosthetic, \"but there\u2019s nothing so far,\u201d he said from his home, gently running a hand over the smooth edge of his stump. \u201cAs you can see, I can\u2019t walk.\u201d The cost of a prosthetic limb is in excess of $3,000 and far beyond his means.",

      "U.S. Vice President JD Vance is set to visit India on a four-day tour as the two countries seek to strengthen their partnership by negotiating a bilateral trade deal",
      "NEW DELHI -- U.S. Vice President JD Vance will embark on a four-day visit to India on Monday as the two countries seek to unlock economic opportunities and negotiate a bilateral trade deal.",
      "Vance will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi for talks on the economy, trade and geopolitical ties. Vance\u2019s visit is seen as an important diplomatic mission by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, and it coincides with a rapidly intensifying trade war between Washington and Beijing, which is New Delhi's main rival in the region.",
      "A trade deal between India and the U.S. could significantly enhance economic ties between the two countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties.",
      "The U.S. is also India\u2019s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $190 billion until recently.",
      "India\u2019s foreign ministry has said the visit will \u201cprovide an opportunity for both sides to review the progress in bilateral relations\u201d and two leaders will \u201cexchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what to know more about Vance\u2019s visit:",
      "Vance\u2019s arrival in India comes weeks after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was in India for a geopolitical conference and two months after Modi met Trump in Washington.",
      "Modi was among the first leaders to visit the U.S. and hold talks with Trump after he returned to the White House. During his visit, Modi hailed a \u201cmega partnership\u201d with the U.S. and kickstarted a negotiation process to minimise the possible fallout of Trump\u2019s tariffs after it had already cut tariffs on a range of U.S. goods.",
      "Regardless, Trump targeted India with a 26% levy as part of his now-paused tariff programme, which has provided temporary relief for Indian exporters.",
      "During his visit, Modi sought to soften impending trade barriers by saying he was open to reducing more tariffs on U.S. goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military gear. The two countries also agreed to start talks towards clinching the bilateral trade agreement.",
      "Modi on Friday said he spoke with Elon Musk and said he and the SpaceX CEO \u201cdiscussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation,\u201d saying \u201cIndia remains committed to advancing our partnerships with the U.S. in these domains.\u201d",
      "India is a close partner of the U.S. for bilateral trade, foreign direct investments, defence cooperation, and an important strategic ally in combating the rising influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "It is also part of the Quad, which is made up of the United States plus India, Japan and Australia and seen as a counter-balance to China\u2019s expansion in the region.",
      "Leading U.S companies such as Apple Inc. and Google have expanded operations in India in recent years. Last month, Musk's Starlink entered into agreements with two of India\u2019s top telecom operators to provide satellite-based internet services.",
      "To further boost trade ties, the U.S. and India have set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030 under the expected trade deal agreement.",
      "The negotiations are especially urgent for New Delhi as it could be hit hard by Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, particularly in sectors of agriculture, processed food, auto components, high-end machinery, medical equipment and jewelry. This poses a significant challenge for Modi government as it hopes to spruce up the country's economy and generate jobs with an export-led recovery.",
      "Modi established a good working relationship with Trump during his first term in office. It now appears that the two leaders are likely to further boost cooperation between their countries, particularly in trade as Chinese President Xi Jinping is aiming to position Beijing as a reliable trade partner in the Asia-Pacific region amid rising tensions with Washington.",
      "India has also already taken a number of steps to win over Trump. It will purchase more oil, energy and defence equipment, including the fifth-generation stealth fighter jets, from the U.S.",
      "The U.S, however, wants greater market access for its agricultural and dairy products in India, but New Delhi has been reluctant so far as the farm sector employs bulk of the country\u2019s workforce.",
      "Vance\u2019s visit to India marks his first official trip to the country, which has added significance for the second family. His wife Usha Vance \u2014 a practising Hindu \u2014 is the daughter of immigrants from South India.",
      "In his memoir \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d Vance described his wife a \u201csupersmart daughter of Indian immigrants\u201d whom he met at Yale Law School. Usha\u2019s parents moved to the U.S. in the late 1970s.",
      "Vance will be accompanied by Usha, their children and other senior members of the U.S. administration, and the couple will visit Indian cities of Jaipur and Agra and participate in engagements at cultural sites, a readout from the White House said.",

    "story": [
      "Dozens of journalists in Belarus have been imprisoned in recent years under a crackdown by authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko",
      "TALLINN, Estonia -- Journalist Ksenia Lutskina served only half of her eight-year prison sentence in Belarus after being convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the government. She was pardoned after she kept fainting in her cell from a brain tumor diagnosed during pretrial detention.",
      "\u201cI was literally brought to the penal colony in a wheelchair, and I realized that journalism has really turned into a life-threatening profession in Belarus,\u201d she told The Associated Press in Vilnius, Lithuania, where she lives.",
      "Lutskina was one of dozens of journalists imprisoned in Belarus, where many face beatings, poor medical care and the inability to contact lawyers or relatives, according to activists and former inmates. She compared the prisons to those from the Soviet era.",
      "The group Reporters Without Borders says Belarus is Europe\u2019s leading jailer of journalists. At least 40 are serving long prison sentences, according to the Belarusian Association of Journalists.",
      "Lutskina had quit her job making documentaries for Belarus' state broadcaster in 2020 when mass protests broke out after an election \u2014 widely denounced as fraudulent \u2014 kept authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko in power. Trying to set up an alternative TV channel to fact-check government officials, she was arrested that year, put on trial and later convicted.",
      "Other journalists fled the country of 9.5 million and operate from abroad. But many have had to curtail their work after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration cut off foreign aid, a vital source of funding for many independent media.",
      "\"Journalists are forced to face not only repressions within the country, but also the sudden withdrawal of U.S. aid, which puts many editorial offices on the brink of survival,\u201d BAJ chair Andrei Bastunets told AP.",
      "Lukashenko's brutal crackdown after the disputed election led to over 65,000 arrests between 2020-25. Thousands told of being beaten by police, opposition figures were jailed or forced into exile, and hundreds of thousands fled abroad in fear.",
      "More than 1,200 people behind bars in the nation of 9.5 million are recognized as political prisoners by Belarus' leading rights group, Viasna. Its founder, Nobel Prize Peace laureate Ales Bialiatski, is among them.",
      "Independent journalists have been swept up too, with outlets closed or outlawed. Lukashenko, in power for over three decades, routinely calls them \u201cenemies of our state,\u201d and vows that those who fled won't be allowed to return.",
      "\u201cThe raids, arrests and abuse of journalists have been unceasing for five years, but now they have reached the point of absurdity,\" Bastunets said, noting that families of journalists are being threatened. Families of some targeted journalists have asked rights groups not to talk publicly about their cases for fear of further reprisal.",
      "Every month brings new arrests and searches, with almost all independent media leaving Belarus. The crackdown even hits those who switch their focus to nonpolitical content.",
      "In December, authorities arrested the entire editorial staff of the popular regional publication Intex-press, which covers local news in the city of Baranavichy. Seven journalists were charged with \u201cassisting extremist activity.\u201d",
      "Extremism is the most common charge used to detain, fine and jail critically minded citizens. Even reading independent media that's been declared extremist can result in short-term arrest. Working with or subscribing to banned media is seen as \u201cassisting extremism,\u201d punishable by up to seven years in prison. Websites of such outlets are blocked.",
      "According to Reporters Without Borders, 397 Belarusian journalists have been victims of what the group deems unjust arrests since 2020, with some detained multiple times.",
      "At least 600 moved abroad, the group said. Even then, many still face pressure from authorities who can open cases against them in absentia, put them on international wanted lists, seize their property inside Belarus and target relatives in raids.",
      "Reporters Without Borders filed a lawsuit with the International Criminal Court in January, accusing Belarusian authorities of \u201ccrimes against humanity,\u201d citing torture, beatings, imprisonment, persecution and forced displacement of journalists.",
      "Katsiaryna Bakhvalava, a journalist for Belsat, a Polish-Belarusian independent TV channel, was arrested while covering the 2020 protests. Initially convicted of disrupting public order and sentenced to two years. she was put on trial for treason while in a penal colony and convicted, with her sentence extended to eight years and three months.",
      "Her husband, political analyst Ihar Iliyash, was arrested in October 2024 on charges of \u201cdiscrediting Belarus\u201d and is jailed while awaiting trial.",
      "Now 31, Bakhvalava, has been placed in a \u201cpunishment isolation\u201d cell several times and in 2022 was beaten, according to a former inmate.",
      "Palina Sharenda-Panasiuk, a former political prisoner who fled to Lithuania, told reporters she heard that four prison guards had beaten Bakhvalava, who was crying and asking for a doctor.",
      "Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the influential Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza and a prominent figure in the Union of Poles in Belarus, was convicted of \u201charming Belarus\u2019 national security\u201d and sentenced to eight years, which he is serving in the Novopolotsk penal colony.",
      "Poczobut, 52, suffers from a serious heart condition and was placed in solitary confinement several times, sometimes for stretches of up to six months, human rights activists said.",
      "At the end of March, his stay in a punitive cell unit \u2014 the harshest form of incarceration \u2014 was extended for six months. Attempts by Warsaw to intervene have failed and Poczobut has refused to ask Lukashenko for a pardon.",
      "Also imprisoned is Maryna Zolatava, editor of Tut.By \u2014 once the most popular online news outlet in Belarus but shut down by authorities in 2021. Zolatava was convicted in 2023 of incitement and distributing materials urging actions aimed at harming national security, and sentenced to 12 years.",
      "Lukashenko extended his rule for a seventh term in a January election that the opposition called a farce. Since July, he has pardoned over 250 people, seeking to improve ties with the West.",
      "Belarusian analyst Valery Karbalevich said Lukashenko \"views political prisoners as a commodity. He is cynically willing to sell journalists and activists to Europe and the United States in exchange for easing economic sanctions and thawing relations. And this process has already begun.\u201d",
      "Shortly after Trump began his second term, Lukashenko released two U.S. citizens and a journalist from the Belarusian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a U.S. government-funded news outlet. Two more RFE/RL journalists, Ihar Losik and Ihar Karnei, remain imprisoned and were forced to record repentant videos.",
      "Freed journalist Andrey Kuznechyk, who spent three years in prison, left Belarus for Lithuania.",
      "\u201cThe first day after my release, I looked at the list of journalists behind bars and I was shocked by how much it had grown during my imprisonment,\u201d he told AP.",
      "Lutskina, the journalist who also fled to Lithuania, brought her 14-year-old son with her, saying he \u201cmust learn to distinguish truth from lies.\u201d They both have read George Orwell\u2019s dystopian novel \u201c1984,\u201d which was banned in Belarus, and are finding \u201csurprising parallels\u201d with her homeland.",
      "\u201cBelarus has turned into a gray country under a gray sky, where people are afraid of everything and speak in whispers,\u201d she said.",
      "Lutskina, who is being treated for the tumor that caused her fainting spells, said she actually felt less fear in prison than her fellow Belarusians outside it.",
      "They walk around with their heads down, she said, \u201cafraid to raise their eyes and see the nightmare happening around them,\u201d she added.",

    "story": [
      "A collection of Zimbabwean stone sculptures will be the centerpiece of an exhibition at Oxford University meant to \u201ccontextualize\u201d the legacy of British colonialist Cecil John Rhodes",
      "CHITUNGWIZA, Zimbabwe -- A pair of white hands blinding a Black face. A smiling colonizer with a Bible, crushing the skull of a screaming native with his boot. Chained men in gold mines, and a pregnant woman.",
      "These stone sculptures from Zimbabwe will take center stage at an upcoming exhibition at Oxford University in Britain, aiming to \u201ccontextualize\u201d the legacy of British imperialist Cecil John Rhodes with depictions of religious deception, forced labor and sexual abuse.",
      "Rhodes conquered large parts of southern Africa in the late 19th century. He made a fortune in gold and diamond mining and grabbed land from the local population. His grave lies under a slab of stone atop a hill in Zimbabwe.",
      "Oxford\u2019s Oriel College, where the exhibition will be held in September, is a symbolic setting. A statue of Rhodes stands there despite protests against it since 2015. Rhodes, who died in 1902, was an Oriel student who left 100,000 pounds (now valued at about 10.5 million pounds, or $13.5 million) to the school. His influence endures through a scholarship for students from southern African countries.",
      "For Zimbabwean stone carvers at Chitungwiza Arts Center near the capital, Harare, the exhibition is more than an opportunity for Western audiences to glimpse a dark history. It is also a chance to revive an ancient but struggling art form.",
      "Stone sculpture, once a thriving local industry, has suffered due to vast economic challenges and declining tourism.",
      "\u201cThis will boost business. Buyers abroad will now see our work and buy directly from the artists,\u201d said sculptor Wallace Mkanka. His piece, depicting the blinded Black face, was selected as the best of 110 entries and will be one of four winning sculptures on display at Oxford.",
      "Zimbabwe, meaning \u201cHouse of Stone,\u201d derives its identity from the Great Zimbabwe ruins, a 1,800-acre Iron Age city built with precision-cut stones delicately stacked without mortar. It is a UNESCO World heritage site.",
      "The southern African country has long used stone sculpture as a form of storytelling to immortalize history. The craft survived close to a century of colonial rule that sought to erase local traditions, religion and art forms.",
      "It thrived internationally instead. Thousands of pieces were plundered from Africa. Some later became subjects of repatriation campaigns. Others became prized by tourists and collectors. A permanent collection of 20 Zimbabwean stone sculptures is displayed in a pedestrian tunnel at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, one of the world\u2019s busiest.",
      "At its peak following independence, Zimbabwe\u2019s stone sculpture industry thrived, with local white farmers purchasing pieces for their homes and facilitating international sales.",
      "\u201cCustomers were everywhere. They would pay up front, and I always had a queue of clients,\u201d recalled Tafadzwa Tandi, a 45-year-old sculptor whose work will feature in the Oxford exhibition.",
      "However, the industry has struggled over the past two decades.",
      "Zimbabwe\u2019s global image suffered after controversial land reforms more than two decades ago displaced over 4,000 white farmers to redistribute land to about 300,000 Black families, according to government figures. Late ruler Robert Mugabe defended the reforms as necessary to address colonial-era inequities, but they had unintended economic consequences.",
      "\u201cMany of our customers were friends of the farmers. That is where the problem originated from,\u201d said Tendai Gwaravaza, chairman of Chitungwiza Arts Center.",
      "At the center, the sound of grinders filled the air as sculptors carved. Hundreds of finished pieces, ranging from small carvings to life-sized sculptures, waited for buyers.",
      "\u201cThe only solution now is to get out there to the markets ourselves. If we don\u2019t, no one will,\u201d Gwaravaza said.",
      "The Oxford exhibition represents such an opportunity for exposure, he said.",
      "It is the brainchild of the Oxford Zimbabwe Arts Partnership, formed in response to the \u201cRhodes Must Fall\u201d campaign during the Black Lives Matter protests in the U.S.",
      "The group, consisting of Zimbabwean artists, an Oxford alumnus and a professor of African history, initially envisioned a larger project titled \u201cOxford and Rhodes: Past, Present, and Future.\u201d It included enclosing Rhodes\u2019 statue in glass, installing 100 life-size bronze statues of African liberation fighters and creating a collaborative sculpture using recycled materials to represent the future.",
      "However, the project required an estimated 200,000 pounds, far beyond available resources. Eventually, Oriel College provided 10,000 pounds for a scaled-down exhibition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still my hope that one day it could happen, but for now we have just accepted something very small to make a start and to do something,\u201d said Richard Pantlin, the Oxford alumnus and OZAP co-founder.",

      "LONDON -- Thousands of trans rights protesters gathered in central London on Saturday, days after the U.K.'s Supreme Court ruled that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition.",
      "With unease growing over what the ruling means for the rights of transgender people, protesters came together for what was billed as an \u201cemergency demonstration\u201d in Parliament Square. Activists demanded \u201ctrans liberation\u201d and \u201ctrans rights now,\u201d with some waving flags and holding banners.",
      "Trans groups are worried that Wednesday's landmark decision would undermine their rights, even though the U.K.'s highest court said transgender people remain protected from discrimination. The head of Equality and Human Rights Commission said the ruling will mean transgender women will be excluded from women\u2019s toilets, hospital wards and sports teams.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrifying time to have your rights taken away from you,\" said 19-year-old transgender woman Sophie Gibbs. \u201cI was disappointed to think that we could live in a society that seems so progressive now but is willing to make such a dangerous and harmful ruling.\u201d",
      "The British government has said the unanimous decision by the five judges brought \u201cclarity and confidence\u201d for women and service providers.",
      "Out of some 66 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, about 116,000 identified as trans in the latest census count. About 8,500 gender recognition certificates have been issued.",
      "The ruling stemmed from a 2018 law passed by the Scottish Parliament that required at least 50% women on boards of Scottish public bodies. Transgender women with gender recognition certificates were to be included in meeting the quota.",
      "The Supreme Court said that using a certificate to interpret someone\u2019s sex would clash with definitions of man and woman and, therefore, the anti-discrimination provisions of the 2010 Equality Act could \u201conly be interpreted as referring to biological sex.\u201d",
      "Scotland\u2019s First Minister John Swinney said Saturday that he \u201cunderstands\u201d the \u201churt and anguish\u201d trans people are feeling over the verdict, while accepting that the ruling must be followed.",

      "PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo\u2019s legislature on Saturday swore in the 120 lawmakers who will sit in the newly elected Assembly, or Parliament, after procedural disputes between the political parties but failed twice to elect a new speaker, a process which may take the country into a prolonged legislative crisis",
      "All parties who won seats in the Feb. 9 election voted unanimously in favor of taking up their mandates, opening the way to the election of the new speaker and deputy speakers.",
      "The left-wing Self-Determination Movement, or Vetevendosje!, of acting Prime Minister Albin Kurti won 48 out of 120 seats in the election, falling short of the majority needed to elect a new speaker or to form a cabinet on its own. In 2021, the party won 58 seats.",
      "The Vetevendosje! nominee for speaker, Albulena Haxhiu, was defeated in two successive ballots, with 57 votes, falling short of the 61 needed in a 120-seat parliament.",

      "Kurti and the three main opposition parties have all ruled out working together in a coalition. The center-right Democratic Party of Kosovo, or PDK, holds 24 seats, the conservative governing Democratic League of Kosovo, or LDK, won 20 seats, and the right-wing Alliance for Kosovo\u2019s Future, AAK, has eight seats.",

      "Activists called the case baseless and politically motivated. Tunisian President Kais Saied has rolled back many freedoms the North African country gained after spawning the Arab Spring pro-democracy uprisings in 2011.",
      "Those accused in the trial include former diplomats, business leaders, journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders, and some have spent more than two years in pre-trial detention. Others have fled abroad.",
      "The trial began in March and wrapped up late Friday and early Saturday with the court handing down sentences of between 13 and 66 years to prominent opposition leaders, according to official news agency TAP and local radio Jawahra FM.",

      "Former Tunisian legislator Said Ferjani was convicted to 13 years in prison, his daughter Kaouther Ferjani posted on X. Describing it as \u201cyet another fabricated conspiracy case,\u201d she said that other figures from Islamist party Ennahdha were also among those sentenced.",

      "Either way, the ceremony, which goes back at least 1,200 years, is a sight to behold.",
      "It has also ignited safety concerns. In 1834 a frenzied stampede broke out in the darkened church, and the ruler of the Holy Land at the time barely escaped after his guards drew swords and hacked their way through the crowd, the historian Simon Sebag Montefiore recounts in his history of Jerusalem. Some 400 pilgrims died in the melee, most from suffocation or trampling.",
      "Israeli authorities have sought to limit participants in recent years, citing safety concerns. That has drawn protests from church leaders, who have accused it of upsetting the delicate, unwritten arrangements around Jerusalem's holy sites known as the status quo.",
      "On Saturday, there was a heavy military presence as thousands of worshipers passed through Israeli checkpoints to enter. AP reporters saw police detain one man, while scuffles occurred between police and some women who were barred from entering the courtyard.",

Perceived infringements on the status quo in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher have sparked brawls between monks of different denominations.",
      "Israel says it is committed to ensuring freedom of worship for Jews, Christians and Muslims, and has long presented itself as an island of tolerance in the Middle East.",
      "In recent years, however, tensions have risen with the local Christian community, most of whom are Palestinian Christians, a population that has dwindled through decades of conflict as many have sought economic opportunities abroad.",

      "A situation report issued late Friday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said frequent strong aftershocks continue to shake central Myanmar almost daily, increasing fear and uncertainty among affected residents, disrupting response effort s and exacerbating the pressure on already limited resources and services.",
      "\u201cThree weeks after catastrophic twin earthquakes hit Myanmar on 28 March, the worst-affected communities are still without safe shelter, clean water and sanitation, stable electricity, health care and essential services,\u201d the report said.",
      "The epicenter of the 7.7 magnitude quake was near Mandalay, Myanmar\u2019s second-largest city, but it hit a wide swath of the country, causing significant damage to six regions and states including the capital, Naypyitaw.",
      "It also worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis triggered by the country\u2019s civil war that had internally displaced more than 3 million people and left nearly 20 million in need, according to the United Nations.",
      "A report in the state-run Myanma Alinn newspaper published on Saturday said the quake's death toll had reached 3,726, with 5,105 people injured and 129 still missing. It said 1,975 international rescuers and medical workers from 25 countries had collaborated with local rescuers in saving 653 people and recovering 753 bodies from under rubble.",
      "Myanma Alinn said 65,096 houses and buildings, 2,514 schools, 4,317 Buddhist monasterial living quarters, 6,027 pagodas and temples, 350 hospitals and clinics, 170 bridges, 586 dams and 203 sections of the country\u2019s main highway were damaged by the earthquake.",
      "Myanmar Fire Services Department, an official emergency services agency operating in many areas of the country, said in statements posted Friday on its Facebook page that rescue workers were carrying out relief, search and cleaning debris from the big buildings, and had returned valuable jewelry, cash, and documents found among the rubble to their owners.",
      "It also said that rescuers recovered two bodies from collapsed buildings in Mandalay.",

      "The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears arrest for speaking without authorization, said the number of bodies recovered daily has decreased to only one or two.",
      "Another emergency services worker in Mandalay, similarly speaking on condition of anonymity, said the number of rescue teams operating in Mandalay has been steadily decreasing as most of the international rescue teams had returned to their countries after their work to find survivors was considered completed. He said local rescue workers were mainly participating in clearing debris and providing assistance.",
      "The United Nations Development Program earlier this month estimated that at least 2.5 million tons, or roughly 125,000 truckloads, of debris from the quake needs to be removed. It based its estimate on remote sensing analysis of images obtained by satellites.",
      "UN-Habitat, the U.N. agency for human settlements, said in a statement on Friday that its staff and the Myanmar Engineering Society were collaborating in assessing widespread building damage in earthquake-affected regions.",
      "In Naypyitaw, almost all rescuers have ceased their relief efforts, while government buildings that were damaged by the earthquake have not yet been repaired and remain in their post-earthquake condition, said a resident who asked not to be named for security reasons. In residential areas, people have almost completed clearing the debris on their own.",
      "Saturday's report in Myanma Alinn said Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, head of the military government, told his Cabinet members during a meeting on Friday that the urban layout of Naypyitaw will be redesigned.",
      "Naypyitaw became Myanmar\u2019s capital in 2006 after being built at great expense almost from scratch next to what had once been a logging center inhabited by largely by farmers. It is notable for its grandiose government buildings and under-utilized multi-lane roads.",

      "U.S. Vice President JD Vance is meeting with the Vatican No. 2 official",
      "VATICAN CITY -- U.S. Vice President JD Vance is meeting with the Vatican No. 2 official, following a remarkable papal rebuke of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on migrants and Vance\u2019s theological justification of it.",
      "Vance, a Catholic convert, was due to meet Saturday with the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. There was speculation he might also briefly greet Pope Francis, who has begun resuming some official duties during his recovery from pneumonia.",
      "Vance was spending Easter weekend in Rome with his family and attended Good Friday services in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica on Friday after meeting with Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni.",
      "Francis and Vance have tangled sharply over migration and the Trump administration\u2019s plans to deport migrants en masse. Francis has made caring for migrants a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative U.S. Catholic Church.",
      "Vance, who converted in 2019, identifies with a small Catholic intellectual movement, viewed by some critics as having reactionary or authoritarian leanings, that is often called \u201cpostliberal.\u201d",
      "Postliberals share some longstanding Catholic conservative views, such as opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. They envision a counterrevolution in which they take over government bureaucracy and institutions like universities from within, replacing entrenched \u201celites\u201d with their own and acting upon their vision of the \u201ccommon good.\u201d",
      "Just days before he was hospitalized in February, Francis blasted the Trump administration\u2019s deportation plans, warning that they would deprive migrants of their inherent dignity. In a letter to U.S. bishops, Francis also appeared to respond to Vance directly for having claimed that Catholic doctrine justified such policies.",
      "Vance had defended the administration\u2019s America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin as \u201cordo amoris.\u201d He has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care \u2014 to family first, followed by neighbor, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere.",
      "In his Feb. 10 letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance\u2019s understanding of the concept.",
      "\u201cChristian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the \u2018Good Samaritan,\u2019 that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\u201d",
      "Vance has acknowledged Francis\u2019 criticism but has said he would continue to defend his views. During a Feb. 28 appearance at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Vance didn\u2019t address the issue specifically but called himself a \u201cbaby Catholic\u201d and acknowledged there are \u201cthings about the faith that I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "While he had criticized Francis on social media in the past, recently he has posted prayers for Francis\u2019 recovery.",
      "On Friday, Vance, his wife and three young children had front-row seats at the Vatican\u2019s Good Friday service in St. Peter\u2019s, a two-hour solemn commemoration featuring Latin and Italian readings. Francis did not attend.",
      "But the pope has begun receiving visitors, including King Charles III, and this week ventured out of the Vatican to meet with prisoners at Rome's central jail to keep a Holy Thursday appointment ministering to the most marginalized.",
      "He has named other cardinals to preside over Easter services this weekend, but officials haven't ruled out a possible brief greeting with Vance.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m grateful every day for this job, but particularly today where my official duties have brought me to Rome on Good Friday,\u201d Vance posted on X. \u201cI wish all Christians all over the world, but particularly those back home in the US, a blessed Good Friday.\u201d",

      "Romania is gearing up to hold a presidential election redo next month, a high-stakes test for the European Union member\u2019s democracy after last year\u2019s annulled vote triggered the country\u2019s deepest political crisis since 1989",
      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania's presidential election redo next month will be a high-stakes test for the European Union member\u2019s democracy after last year\u2019s annulled vote triggered the country\u2019s deepest political crisis since 1989.",
      "Romania\u2019s Constitutional Court annulled the election on Dec. 6 after the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped first-round polls. The decision followed allegations of electoral violations and a Russian campaign promoting Georgescu, who is now under investigation and barred from the rerun. Moscow has denied it meddled.",
      "\u201cWhat happened last year was very serious and ... at that time, completely anti-democratic,\u201d Elena Lasconi, who came second to enter the runoff last year and is participating in the new election, told The Associated Press. \u201cIt was not justified, in my opinion.\u201d",
      "Once a communist state until the end of the Cold War, Romania has spent decades trying to build strong democratic institutions. But last year\u2019s annulled election shattered public trust \u2014 and it could take years to repair the damage.",
      "\u201cI think the public trust in political parties, in public institutions, in the state generally was quite low,\u201d says Septimius Parvu, coordinator of the electoral program at Expert Forum, a pro-democracy think-tank. \u201cThis dislocated even more the trust. It created an earthquake which would \u2026 leave marks in the longer term on the trust in democracy.\u201d",
      "Many feel Romanian authorities have not sufficiently explained what happened last year, which has left voters to wonder \"whether this will be the final election,\u201d Parvu added.",
      "Complicating Lasconi's chances in the rerun, her Save Romania Union party, or USR, withdrew its support for her last week in favor of incumbent Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan, claiming he has a stronger chance of winning the presidency. Lasconi labeled colleagues who moved against her as \u201ccoup plotters.\"",
      "She said it adds to the chaos in the wake of last year\u2019s election debacle, which has already left many Romanians disillusioned. \u201cNone of the state institutions have assured us that we\u2019ll have fair elections,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople said in the streets, \u2018our votes don\u2019t count\u2019.\u201d",
      "Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, says there is an \u201cunderlying social discontent that could explode again\u201d unless political parties and candidates start to \"speak to all segments of society.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe underlying issue in Romania is the widespread public dissatisfaction with the political class,\" he said. \"It\u2019s important to keep reminding the public of what happened: that we were facing a campaign that attempted to hijack Romania\u2019s democracy using unorthodox and illegal means.\u201d",
      "Georgescu\u2019s stunning rise \u2014 from polling in single digits to leading the first round \u2014 shocked many observers. The Russia-friendly candidate, who has praised fascist figures from Romania\u2019s past, not only unnerved Brussels but raised urgent questions about foreign interference in European elections.",
      "Like other EU countries, the far-right vote in recent years has grown in Romania, fueled by widespread anti-establishment sentiment. After Georgescu was barred from the redo, Romania\u2019s far-right, which holds about a third of legislative seats, scrambled to find a successor.",
      "Up stepped George Simion, the leader of the Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, who came fourth in last year\u2019s race and later backed Georgescu. The second biggest party in the legislature, AUR, proclaims to stand for \u201cfamily, nation, faith, and freedom.\u201d",
      "Simion has drawn criticism in the past due to anti-EU rhetoric and remarks against continued aid to Ukraine, a neighboring country, which like Moldova, he is banned from entering over security concerns.",
      "Romania\u2019s decision to annul the election, and the ban on Georgescu\u2019s candidacy, has been strongly criticized by U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and Moscow \u2014 which publicly supported his candidacy in the rerun.",
      "\u201cGeopolitically, we are in a very complicated situation,\u201d Lasconi warned.",
      "Eleven candidates are participating in the first round, which is scheduled for May 4. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the ballots, a runoff will be held on May 18.",
      "Other key candidates include Dan, the Bucharest mayor running independently under the campaign slogan \u201cHonest Romania,\u201d and Crin Antonescu, who is backed by Romania\u2019s governing coalition and is running on a \u201cRomania forward\u201d platform.",
      "Victor Ponta, a former prime minister between 2012 and 2015 who resigned after a fatal nightclub fire, is running on a MAGA-style \u201cRomania First\u201d ticket and boasts of having close ties to the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "After last year's events, data from local surveys should be taken with caution, given concerns about politicization. Still, a median of polls suggests a runoff could pit the far-right Simion against either Dan, Ponta, or Antonescu.",
      "A Simion presidency could threaten EU unity as the war rages on in neighboring Ukraine. This is compounded by Trump's attempts to forge closer ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin as he seeks an end to the war in Ukraine.",
      "In the wake of the annulled election, the role social media allegedly played in Georgescu\u2019s success came under intense scrutiny when declassified Romanian intelligence pointed to coordinated foreign interference via the Chinese-owned video-sharing platform TikTok.",
      "The case highlighted the threat large social media platforms can pose to liberal democracies, and the EU Commission responded by launching an ongoing probe into TikTok to determine whether it violated the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act in failing to deal with risks to Romania's election.",
      "TikTok said it dismantled covert influence networks targeting Romanians in December, including over 27,000 accounts, which posted comments en masse via a \u201cfake engagement vendor\u201d promoting the AUR party and Georgescu, \"in an attempt to manipulate Romanian elections discourse.\" It also removed more than 1,100 accounts impersonating presidential candidates.",
      "TikTok stated it has taken steps to protect Romania\u2019s election integrity, including expanding its team of Romanian-speaking content moderators, working with a local fact-checking group to combat disinformation, and in-app tools linking to official election information.",
      "The concerns over social media, however, have led to what some critics view as undemocratic overreach by Romania\u2019s Central Election Bureau ahead of the new vote. The bureau has drawn recent criticism for requesting takedowns of online political comments by private citizens.",
      "The political turbulence sparked large street protests and has left many voters uncertain and divided.",
      "\u201cSociety is a bit divided, it\u2019s fragmented in a way as a reaction,\u201d said Octavian Frecea, a voter in Bucharest. \u201cOnly an isolated society isn\u2019t influenced from the outside \u2026 We are economically and politically dependent on everyone.\u201d",
      "As Romania heads into one of its most critical elections since 1989, the stakes go beyond who wins the next five-year presidency and may be viewed as a referendum on democracy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been divided for over 35 years,\u201d Lasconi said. \u201cNow Romania isn\u2019t just split in two \u2014 Romania is shattered into many pieces.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Iran and the United States will hold talks Saturday in Rome, their second round of negotiations over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Iran and the United States will hold talks Saturday in Rome, their second round of negotiations over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "The talks follow a first round held in Muscat, Oman, where the two sides spoke face to face.",
      "Trump has imposed new sanctions on Iran as part of his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign targeting the country. He has repeatedly suggested military action against Iran remained a possibility, while emphasizing he still believed a new deal could be reached by writing a letter to Iran\u2019s 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to jump start these talks.",
      "Khamenei has warned Iran would respond to any attack with an attack of its own.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the letter, Iran\u2019s nuclear program and the tensions that have stalked relations between Tehran and Washington since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Trump dispatched the letter to Khamenei on March 5, then gave a television interview the next day in which he acknowledged sending it. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve written them a letter saying, \u2018I hope you\u2019re going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it\u2019s going to be a terrible thing.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since returning to the White House, the president has been pushing for talks while ratcheting up sanctions and suggesting a military strike by Israel or the U.S. could target Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "A previous letter from Trump during his first term drew an angry retort from the supreme leader.",
      "But Trump\u2019s letters to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in his first term led to face-to-face meetings, though no deals to limit Pyongyang\u2019s atomic bombs and a missile program capable of reaching the continental U.S.",
      "Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, hosted the first round of talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff last weekend. The two men met face to face after indirect talks and immediately agreed to this second round.",
      "Witkoff later made a television appearance in which he suggested 3.67% enrichment for Iran could be something the countries could agree on. But that\u2019s exactly the terms set by the 2015 nuclear deal struck under U.S. President Barack Obama, from which Trump unilaterally withdrew America.",
      "Witkoff hours later issued a statement underlining something: \u201cA deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.\u201d Araghchi and Iranian officials have latched onto Witkoff\u2019s comments in recent days as a sign that America was sending it mixed signals about the negotiations.",
      "Iran has insisted for decades that its nuclear program is peaceful. However, its officials increasingly threaten to pursue a nuclear weapon. Iran now enriches uranium to near weapons-grade levels of 60%, the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program to do so.",
      "Under the original 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity and to maintain a uranium stockpile of 300 kilograms (661 pounds). The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency on Iran\u2019s program put its stockpile at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds) as it enriches a fraction of it to 60% purity.",
      "U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has \u201cundertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.\u201d",
      "Ali Larijani, an adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, has warned in a televised interview that his country has the capability to build nuclear weapons, but it is not pursuing it and has no problem with the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s inspections. However, he said if the U.S. or Israel were to attack Iran over the issue, the country would have no choice but to move toward nuclear weapon development.",
      "\u201cIf you make a mistake regarding Iran\u2019s nuclear issue, you will force Iran to take that path, because it must defend itself,\u201d he said.",
      "Iran was once one of the U.S.\u2019s top allies in the Mideast under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who purchased American military weapons and allowed CIA technicians to run secret listening posts monitoring the neighboring Soviet Union. The CIA had fomented a 1953 coup that cemented the shah\u2019s rule.",
      "But in January 1979, the shah, fatally ill with cancer, fled Iran as mass demonstrations swelled against his rule. The Islamic Revolution followed, led by Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and created Iran\u2019s theocratic government.",
      "Later that year, university students overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, seeking the shah\u2019s extradition and sparking the 444-day hostage crisis that saw diplomatic relations between Iran and the U.S. severed. The Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s saw the U.S. back Saddam Hussein. The \u201cTanker War\u201d during that conflict saw the U.S. launch a one-day assault that crippled Iran at sea, while the U.S. later shot down an Iranian commercial airliner that the American military said it mistook for a warplane.",
      "Iran and the U.S. have see-sawed between enmity and grudging diplomacy in the years since, with relations peaking when Tehran made the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. But Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord, sparking tensions in the Mideast that persist today.",

    "story": [
      "Eastern and Western churches will celebrate Easter on the same day this year, while marking 1,700 years since the Council of Nicaea unified Christian doctrine",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- For more than 400 years, Catholic and Orthodox churches have used different ways to determine the date of Easter. But this Sunday will mark a special moment for Christians, as the churches celebrate of Jesus\u2019 resurrection on the same day.",
      "What\u2019s more, top religious leaders \u2014 including Pope Francis \u2014 are expressing a desire to keep it that way. But the unusual alignment has stirred underlying mistrust between the two major Christian communions.",
      "The movable date for Easter follows a seemingly straightforward rule: the Sunday following the first full moon on or after the spring equinox. But the two churches started using different calendars after Pope Gregory XIII\u2019s adaptation in 1582, when the Western church adopted the Gregorian calendar while the Eastern Orthodox Church kept the older Julian one.",
      "Moreover, each church uses its own ecclesiastical calculations for lunar cycles and the equinox, which don\u2019t neatly match scientific projections.",
      "The result is that Easter dates can be as much as five weeks apart. They can coincide in back-to-back years, or a decade can pass without it happening.",
      "Days before his five-week hospitalization, Pope Francis referred to this year\u2019s Easter celebration while invoking the 1,700th anniversary of the historic Council of Nicaea, when Christian leaders gathered to settle foundational disputes about the faith.",
      "\"Once again, I renew my appeal: Let this coincidence serve as a sign \u2014 a call to all Christians to take a decisive step toward unity around a common date for Easter,\u201d Francis said while leading prayers at the Basilica of St. Paul in Rome.",
      "Francis\u2019 invitation, delivered at the end of a prayer for Christian Unity with Orthodox priests present, wasn\u2019t new. Returning from a trip to Turkey in 2014, he told reporters on the plane that a unified date would be logical.",
      "\u201cIt is a bit ridiculous,\u201d he said, then staged a pretend conversation: \u201c\u2018Tell me, your Christ, when is he resurrected? Next week? Mine was resurrected last week.\u2019\u201d",
      "He has found an ally in Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, a fellow octogenarian and spiritual leader of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians. The two \u201cspeak to one another like brothers,\u201d Francis has said. For his part, Bartholomew has called Francis \u201cour elder brother\u201d and described the Easter initiative as \u201ca real step toward repairing old conflicts.\u201d",
      "The idea of a common Easter has been discussed since the 1960s, with interest often peaking when celebrations coincide. The key obstacle has always been the implication that one side would need to concede.",
      "Protestants, who follow the same calendar as Catholics, have also been in on the discussions.",
      "The Geneva-based World Council of Churches \u2014 a fellowship of Orthodox and Protestant bodies \u2014 has proposed a compromise. It suggests using modern astronomy, basing the calculation on Jerusalem time and following the same basic rule set centuries ago.",
      "\u201cIt has never been more important than now, because we live in a polarized world and people all over the world yearn for more unity,\u201d Lutheran Bishop Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, a senior WCC official, told The Associated Press from his home outside Berlin. \u201cAll other questions \u2013 on calendar, on time, on the moon and the stars and everything \u2013 it\u2019s not primary; it\u2019s secondary.\"",
      "While the pope\u2019s wishes may carry powerful influence through the Vatican\u2019s highly centralized authority, Bartholomew\u2019s role is largely symbolic over the self-governed national and local churches. And discussions between Russia, the Orthodox world\u2019s most populous country, and churches of other Orthodox-majority countries remain stalled due to the war and church divisions in Ukraine.",
      "Further complicating prospects for consensus is a history characterized by centuries of mistrust, largely driven by wariness in the East about the Vatican\u2019s supremacy.",
      "At a Holy Week service Monday in Athens, Father Anastasios welcomed parishioners into the Church of Saint Dimitrios Loumbardiaris, a restored stone chapel near the Acropolis. He said he supports forging bonds with Christianity's other branches \u2014 but with caution.",
      "\u201cWe can try to build bridges, but we cannot distort our faith or the traditions of our ancestors, or the dogmas Christ himself handed down,\" he said. \"There are deeply rooted differences. From my view and that of many people here, the unity sought in the past by the Roman Catholic Church often wasn\u2019t sincere; it came with strings attached, was more about dominance than genuine reconciliation.\u201d",
      "As dialogue between the churches slowly unfolds, common Easter celebrations are already a practical reality in a few places. The Orthodox Church in Finland switched dates in the 1920s to align celebrations with the Lutheran majority. And Catholics in Greece \u2014 while making no official change to their calendar \u2014 have celebrated with the rest of the country since 1970.",
      "Joseph Roussos, a member of a Catholic community on the Greek island of Syros, took his first trip to the Vatican last month.",
      "At age 67, he remembers when Easters in Greece were separate: when schools and shopkeepers on the island closed for different holidays, and the church bells tolled mournfully during two distinct Holy Weeks.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a good situation. But when we did celebrate Easter together, there was great harmony,\u201d he said. \u201cWe live very well (today), and it\u2019s truly beautiful. I hope it stays that way.\u201d",

      "Raising a child in America has never been cheap",
      "Sam Rutledge and his wife have a baby due in mid-July, so they thought they had a few more months to research and buy the gear they\u2019ll need.",
      "But President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcement in early April turned the couple\u2019s slow walk into a sprint. In the past few weeks, they\u2019ve bought two strollers, a car seat, a nursery glider, a crib and a high chair. All of them are made overseas.",
      "\u201cThese are all pretty expensive under normal conditions, but when it became clear tariffs were coming we decided to buy them in case they became prohibitively expensive,\u201d said Rutledge, who is a high school physics teacher.",
      "Raising a child in America has never been cheap. In the first year alone, it costs an average of $20,384, according to Baby Center, a parenting website. But tariffs \u2013 ranging from 10% for imports from most countries to 145% for imports from China -- will make it many times more expensive for new parents.",
      "An estimated 90% of the core baby care products and the parts that go into making baby paraphernalia \u2013 from bottles and diaper pails to strollers and car seats \u2013 are made in Asia, according to the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, a U.S. trade group. The vast majority come from China.",
      "\u201cOverseas manufacturing has been the norm in our industry for decades,\u201d said Lisa Trofe, the association's executive director.",
      "It wasn\u2019t always this way. When Munchkin Inc. CEO Steven Dunn founded his company in 1991, it made baby bottles in California with tooling from New Jersey. But over the years, the manufacturers he used shut down and the cost of doing business in the U.S. skyrocketed. Now, about 60% of Munchkin\u2019s 500 products, from a $5 sippy cup to a $254 Night Owl Stroller with headlights, are made in China.",
      "In response to the tariffs, Dunn halted orders from China and instituted a hiring freeze at Munchkin\u2019s California headquarters, where 320 people are employed. Dunn expects Munchkin will run out of some products within three months.",
      "\u201cThere is no possibility of being able to pass on those tariffs\u201d to customers in the form of price increases, he said.",
      "Dunn said he tried to reduce his dependence on China in recent years, shifting some manufacturing to Vietnam and Mexico. He also spent a year communicating with American manufacturers to see if one could make Munchkin\u2019s new Flow Nipple Shield, which allows a breastfeeding mother to see if her milk is flowing. But most said they couldn\u2019t make the complex silicone product, Dunn said. It\u2019s now made in Vietnam.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not enough tool makers and manufacturing expertise and automation and skilled labor in the U.S. to make the thousands of products the juvenile industry needs,\u201d Dunn said.",
      "Multiple baby brands and companies contacted by The Associated Press didn\u2019t respond or said they weren\u2019t commenting on the tariffs, including Graco, Chicco, Britax, Nuna, Dorel Juvenile, UppaBaby, Evenflo and Bugaboo.",
      "The Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association said it asked the Trump administration for a tariff exemption, arguing that baby products are essential for children's well-being. Trump exempted some baby products, including car seats and high chairs, from import taxes during his first administration. But he hasn't said whether he would consider doing so again.",
      "The Associated Press left a message seeking comment with the White House.",
      "Nurture&, a company that makes a popular nursery glider and other baby furniture, said it\u2019s trying to be transparent about the impact of tariffs.",
      "In a recent email, the company told customers it started lowering prices on some items when the tariffs hit. The company, which was founded in 2020, said it would keep those lower prices in place until April 30, but after that it may not be able to absorb the full cost of the import duties.",
      "\u201cThese are large purchases, these are investments, and this is a very sensitive life stage,\u201d Nurture& Chief Merchant Jill Gruys said. \u201cWe want people to make the best decision for their budget and their family.\u201d",
      "Elizabeth Mahon, the owner of Three Littles, a baby store in Washington, said she\u2019s worried the tariffs will make essential products too expensive for some families.",
      "Mahon volunteers twice per month at the Department of Motor Vehicles, where she teaches people how to buckle their kids safely into car seats. Some families still must be persuaded to use car seats, she said. Mahon fears higher prices would be another deterrent.",
      "\u201cNo one is dying if they can\u2019t buy a toy, but if they don\u2019t have access to car seats, kids will get seriously injured,\u201d she said.",
      "At her own store, Mahon is getting notices that some manufacturers plan to introduce steep price increases in May. She feels lucky she could rent a storage facility and build up inventory ahead of the tariffs. For many small businesses, she said, the extra costs are \u201ca death sentence.\u201d",
      "At The Little Seedling baby shop in Ann Arbor, Michigan, owner Molly Ging said she would normally be putting in Christmas orders at this time of year. Instead, she\u2019s sorting through price increase notices from many of the vendors she works with.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot to manage, and I just have no idea how it\u2019s going to play out,\u201d she said.",
      "Business is brisk right now, with customers hoping to beat tariff-related price increases. But Ging worries about her 13 employees \u2013 all moms who bring their kids to work \u2013 and about whether she can maintain enough inventory to meet future demand.",

      "The Trump administration has called U.S. manufacturing an \u201ceconomic and national security\u201d priority and says tariffs will force companies to have more products made in the U.S. to avoid steep price increases on their imports, leading to \u201cbetter-paying ...",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Drew Greenblatt is fully on board with the Trump administration\u2019s use of tariffs to rebalance a global trading system that it says favors foreign companies over U.S. manufacturers.",
      "Greenblatt is the president and owner of Marlin Steel Wire Products in Baltimore, Maryland, which makes baskets and racks for medical device manufacturers, aerospace companies, food processing companies and others. It has 115 employees and makes its products in three locations in Maryland, Indiana and Michigan. The steel is sourced from Tennessee, Illinois and Michigan.",
      "Currently, it\u2019s hard to compete with baskets made overseas., Greenblatt says, because the countries he competes against have an \u201cunfair advantage.\u201d For example, due to European tariffs and taxes, it costs much more for a German consumer or company to buy Marlin wire baskets than it does for Americans to buy a German-made basket, creating an uneven playing field, Greenblatt said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wildly unfair to the American worker,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this has, by the way, been going on for decades.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has called U.S. manufacturing an \u201ceconomic and national security\u201d priority. U.S. manufacturing has been declining for decades. In June 1979, the number of manufacturing workers peaked at 19.6 million. By January of 2025, employment was down 35% to 12.8 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Small manufacturers, which make up 99% of all American manufacturing, have been hit particularly hard.",
      "The administration has implemented some tariffs against major U.S. trading partners, while putting a hold on other tariffs pending negotiations. The Trump administration says tariffs will force companies to have more products made in the U.S. to avoid steep price increases on their imports, which will mean \u201cbetter-paying American jobs,\u201d for people making cars, appliances and other goods.",
      "Greenblatt agrees, saying he could double his staff if \u201cparity\u201d in tariffs becomes a reality.",
      "While other small manufacturing businesses also support the tariffs, other owners have concerns. The Trump tariffs threaten to upend the existing economic order and possibly push the global economy into recession. And the uneven rollout of the policy has created uncertainty for businesses, financial markets and U.S. households.",
      "For Corry Blanc, the injection of uncertainty around the economy outstrips any potential benefit.",
      "He started his business, Blanc Creatives in Waynesboro, Virginia, in 2012. He makes handcrafted cookware such as skillets and other kitchenware and bakeware with American steel and wood and employs 12 staffers. He gets his steel from a plant in South Carolina and a distributor in Richmond. Wood comes from local regional sawmills near the company\u2019s headquarters in Waynesboro, Virginia.",
      "He said he\u2019s been fielding worried calls from customers in Canada and overseas. And he says the infrastructure isn\u2019t in place to increase production if more people do start buying American-made goods.",
      "Blanc said he survived the pandemic and other tough times, but conditions now are the hardest they\u2019ve ever been.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much uncertainty and not a lot of direction,\u201d he said.",
      "Michael Lyons is the founder of Rogue Industries, a company that makes wallets and other leather goods in a workshop in Standish, Maine, with a staff of nine. He uses leather from Maine and the Midwest. About 80% of his products are made in Maine and 20% are imported.",
      "He said the uncertainty around the tariffs is outweighing any potential long-term benefit. A long-time customer from Canada recently told Lyons that he would no longer be buying from Rogue Industries because of the friction between the two countries.",
      "\u201cHopefully this will pass, and he\u2019ll be able to come back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I did think that was kind of an interesting indicator for him to reach out.\u201d",
      "Lyons would like to expand his business, but says, \u201cat the time being, it\u2019s probably going to be, we hold with what we have.\u201d",
      "American Giant CEO Bayard Winthrop takes a more positive view. He founded his clothing company in 2011 after watching the textile industry go offshore, and seeing a lack of quality, affordable American-made clothing. He started by selling one sweatshirt, and now sells a wider range of clothing, mostly direct-to-consumer, but he also has a contract with Walmart.",
      "He sources cotton from Southeastern states like Georgia, Florida and North Carolina and has a factory in North Carolina and a joint partnership facility in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cPeople forget that in about 1985 that all the clothing that Americans bought was made in America,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is only in the last 40 years that that we really pursued as a country a very aggressive approach to globalization.\u201d",
      "In 1991, more than half of U.S. apparel, about 56%, was made in the U.S., according to statistics from the American Apparel and Footwear Association. By 2023 that number had shrunk to less than 4%.",
      "Winthrop hopes the tariffs will bring about a return to more American-made products.",
      "\u201cThe imbalances between our trading, in particularly with China, particularly the textiles, it\u2019s just shocking, to be honest with you,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes Trump's policies \"put domestic manufacturers on a bit more of a competitive footing.\u201d",
      "Winthrop understands people\u2019s concerns but said it\u2019s important to think longer term.",
      "\u201cAmericans are worried about tariffs, and I think there\u2019s a lot of justification for the worry because I think the administration can be volatile and unpredictable,\u201d he said. But he added that people should put that aside.",
      "\u201cThe idea that we\u2019re going to be more protective of our domestic marketplace and have an industrial policy that includes manufacturing jobs is, an old idea. It\u2019s not a new idea,\u201d he said.",

      "The federal agency tasked with protecting workers\u2019 civil rights is classifying all new gender identity-related discrimination cases as its lowest priority while also placing them on indefinite hold, according to two agency employees",
      "The federal agency tasked with protecting workers\u2019 civil rights is classifying all new gender identity-related discrimination cases as its lowest priority, essentially putting them on indefinite hold, according to two agency employees.",
      "The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission held a meeting on Wednesday clarifying how it would treat new worker complaints of gender-identity discrimination in view of President Donald Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \u201cimmutable\u201d sexes \u2014 male and female.",
      "Staff who handle incoming charges, or intakes, were directed to code them as \u201cC,\u201d the lowest categorization in the EEOC's system that is usually reserved for meritless charges, according to the agency employees who attended the Microsoft Teams meeting for intake supervisors, district directors and support staff that was led by the EEOC's national intake coordinator. The employees asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to reveal the meeting details.",
      "An EEOC spokesman declined to comment on the meeting, saying that \u201cper federal law, we cannot discuss investigatory practices.\u201d",
      "The decision is the latest step by the EEOC to back away from defending the rights of transgender and nonbinary workers in a major shift in civil rights enforcement under the Trump administration. In February, the EEOC moved to drop seven of its own pending lawsuits alleging discrimination against transgender and nonbinary people.",
      "EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, has said one of her priorities will be implementing Trump\u2019s executive order on gender and \u201cdefending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.\u201d She had previously ordered that any worker discrimination charge that \u201cimplicates\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order on gender should be elevated to headquarters for review.",
      "This latest decision to bury gender identity-related complaints leaves transgender and nonbinary people experiencing discrimination at work with limited recourse. U.S. workers must file discrimination complaints through the EEOC in most cases before they can seek other legal avenues.",
      "Giving gender identity-related cases the lowest priority essentially pre-determines that they are meritless, said Chai Feldblum, who was an EEOC commissioner from 2010-2019.",
      "\u201cIf they say they are bringing it to a central location to give them due consideration, they at least have the facade of doing something,\u201d Feldblum said of Lucas\u2019 previous directive on gender identity cases. \u201cIf they are sweeping them out the door as \u201cC\u201d charges, they are not doing their job.\u201d",
      "The EEOC has said that it will still issue \u201cright to sue\u201d notices in gender-identity related cases upon request, meaning workers can decide to pursue a lawsuit on their own. The agency will also honor requests for mediation, according to the employees who attended Wednesday's meeting. But if mediation fails, the EEOC will take no further action on the case, the employees said.",
      "The EEOC\u2019s new approach to gender-identity related discrimination has raised a debate over whether the agency is acting in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, a landmark case that established that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits workplace discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Civil rights activists have accused the EEOC of illegally defying the Supreme Court and abdicating its duty to enforce anti-discrimination laws by abandoning gender-identity related lawsuits. Lucas has previously told The AP that the EEOC has a duty to comply with Trump\u2019s executive orders but she has not directly addressed the criticism that the agency\u2019s handling of gender-identity cases are in tension with the Supreme Court.",
      "The EEOC in fiscal year 2024 received more than 3,000 charges alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and 3,000-plus in 2023, according to the agency\u2019s website.",

      "Cambodia and China have signed a $1.2 billion deal to finance an ambitious canal project that aims to boost trade efficiency by linking a branch of the Mekong River near Phnom Penh to a port on the Gulf of Thailand",
      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Cambodia and China have signed a $1.2 billion deal to finance an ambitious canal project that aims to boost trade efficiency by linking a branch of the Mekong River near Phnom Penh to a port on the Gulf of Thailand, the Cambodian government agency heading the project announced Friday.",
      "The deal to fund the Funan Techo Canal was signed Thursday during the state visit to Cambodia of Chinese President Xi Jinping, the agency said in a news release. Xi returned home Friday after a three-nation Southeast Asian tour that also included Vietnam and Malaysia.",
      "Construction of the 151.6-kilometer (94-mile) canal began last year but was halted shortly after the Aug. 5 groundbreaking ceremony for reasons that were not made clear. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said at the time that the canal will be built \u201cno matter what the cost,\u201d emphasizing that the project promotes \u201cnational prestige, the territorial integrity and the development of Cambodia.\u201d",
      "Described as a public-private partnership contract, the deal was signed by Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol on behalf of Cambodia\u2019s government, and by Ieng Sunly of the Funan Techo Coastal-Inland Waterways Company Ltd., the private sector partner. The project is being developed on a build-operate-transfer basis, with Cambodian investors holding a 51% stake, and Chinese investors holding 49%.",
      "\u201cThe canal will create a new inland waterway-maritime corridor capable of handling vessels up to 3,000 deadweight tons,\u201d according to Friday\u2019s announcement. It will encompass canal excavation and the construction of ship locks, navigation and logistics infrastructure.",
      "\u201cAs an inland waterway and important transport infrastructure in Cambodia, the FTC Project will become a new engine driving national economic growth,\" said Wang Tongzhou, chairman of China Communications Construction Company, in the announcement. He added that \"after completion, it will significantly reduce the comprehensive logistics costs in Cambodia, and promote Cambodia\u2019s industry to the middle-to-high end of the value chain.\u201d",
      "China Communications Construction Company is the parent company of China Road and Bridge Corporation, the contractor for the project's construction from the Bassac River to the coastal province of Kep. The massive state-owned firm has faced scrutiny for its alleged involvement in financial scandals. It is also blacklisted by the United States for its role in helping the Chinese military construct and militarize artificial islands in the South China Sea.",
      "According to Friday's announcement, the canal is expected to create \"up to 50,000 direct and indirect jobs in Cambodia.\u201d",
      "Critics have raised concerns that the canal could severely disrupt the Mekong Rive r\u2019s natural flood patterns. These disruptions could lead to worsening droughts and a reduction in the nutrient-rich silt essential for Vietnam\u2019s vital rice production in the Mekong Delta, a region that sustains millions and is a major global rice exporter.",
      "The signing announcement, however, stated that \u201cA rigorous Environmental Impact Assessment, conducted by 48 specialists, confirmed minimal environmental impact.\u201d",
      "It added that the Cambodian government has led efforts to minimize resettlement \u201cwith a route designed to avoid dense communities and cultural sites\" and that \"a responsible compensation and consultation process is underway.\u201d",

      "VENICE, Italy -- Venice is charging day-trippers to the famed canal city an arrivals tax for the second year starting Friday, a measure aimed at combating the kind of overtourism that put the city's UNESCO World Cultural Heritage status at risk.",
      "A UNESCO body decided against putting Venice on its list of cultural heritage sites deemed in danger after the tax was announced. But opponents of the day-tripper fee say it has done nothing to discourage tourists from visiting Venice even on high-traffic days.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at Venice\u2019s battle with overtourism by the numbers:",
      "The fee charged to visitors who are not overnighting in Venice to enter its historic center during the second year of the day-tripper tax. Visitors who download a QR code at least three days in advance will pay 5 euros ($5.69) \u2014 the same amount charged last year throughout the pilot program. But those who make last-minute plans pay double. The QR code is required from 8:30 a.m. until 4 p.m. and is checked at entry points to the city, including the Santa Lucia train station, the Piazzale Roma bus depot and the Tronchetto parking garage.",
      "The number of days this year that day visitors to Venice will be charged a fee to enter the historic center. They include mostly weekends and holidays from April 18 to July 27. That is up from 29 last year. The new calendar covers entire weeks over key holidays and extends the weekend period to include Fridays.",
      "That is the amount Venice took in during a 2024 pilot program for the tax. The city's top budget official, Michele Zuin, said last year the running costs for the new system ran to 2.7 million euros, overshooting the total fees collected. This year, Zuin projects a surplus of about 1 million euros to 1.5 million euros, which will be used to offset the cost of trash collection and other services for residents.",
      "The number of day-trippers who paid the tax in 2024. Officials said that 12,744 day-trippers paid to enter the city on Friday \u2014 7,173 at the higher 10-euro rate. They were among the 77,000 who have registered so far to enter the city this year. Another 117,000 have registered for exemptions, which apply to anyone born in Venice, those paying property taxes in the city, studying or working in the historic center, or living in the wider Veneto region, among others.",
      "The average number of daily visitors on the first 11 days of 2024 that Venice charged day-trippers. That's about 10,000 people more than the number of tourists recorded on each of the three important holidays during the previous year. City council member Giovanni Andrea Martini, an opponent of the measure, said the figures show the project has not deterred visitors.",
      "The number of official residents in Venice\u2019s historic center composed of over 100 islands connected by footbridges and traversed by its famed canals. The population peaked at 174,000 in 1951, when Venice was home to thriving industries. The number shrank during Italy's postwar economic boom as residents moved to the mainland for more modern housing \u2014 including indoor plumbing which was lacking in Venice. It has been shrinking dramatically over recent decades as local industry lost traction, families sought mainland conveniences and housing prices rose. Activists also blame the \u201cmono-culture\u201d of tourism, which they say has emptied the city of basic services like shops for everyday goods and medical care.",
      "The number of beds for tourists in Venice\u2019s historic center, including 12,627 in the less regulated short-term rental market, according to April data from the Ocio housing activist group. The number of tourist beds surpassed the number of permanent residents in 2023, according to Ocio's monitor. Anyone staying in a hotel within the city limits, including on the mainland districts of Mestre and Marghera, pays a lodging tax and is therefore exempt from the day-tripper tax.",
      "The number of annual arrivals of both day-trippers and overnight guests roughly confirmed by cellphone data tracked from a Smart Control Room since 2020, according to city officials.",

      "Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels say U.S. airstrikes targeting oil port killed at least 74 people and injured at least 171 others",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- U.S. airstrikes targeting an oil port held by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels killed 74 people and wounded 171 others, the group said Friday, in the deadliest known attack under President Donald Trump\u2019s new military campaign against the Iranian-backed faction.",
      "The strike on the Ras Isa port, which sent massive fireballs shooting into the night sky, represented a major escalation in the American effort by hitting oil facilities for the first time.",
      "Assessing the toll of Trump\u2019s campaign, which began March 15, has been difficult, as the U.S. military's Central Command hasn't released any information, including its attacks' targets and how many people have been killed. The Houthis, meanwhile, strictly control access to attacked areas and don\u2019t publish complete information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites.",
      "In a statement, Central Command said \u201cU.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully,\u201d it added. It did not acknowledge any casualties from the attack or offer any damage assessment.",
      "Hours after the strike, the Houthis launched a missile toward Israel that was intercepted, the Israeli military said. Sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and elsewhere.",
      "Yemen's civil war, meanwhile, further internationalized, as the U.S. alleged a Chinese satellite company was \u201cdirectly supporting\u201d Houthi attacks \u2014 a claim Beijing declined to directly comment on. And a second round of negotiations between Iran and the U.S. over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, which America has linked to the Yemen campaign, is due to happen Saturday in Rome.",
      "The Ras Isa port, a collection of oil tanks and refining equipment, sits in Yemen's Hodeida governorate along the Red Sea. It is just off Kamaran Island, which has been targeted by intense U.S. airstrikes over the past few days.",
      "The Houthis\u2019 al-Masirah satellite news channel aired graphic footage of the aftermath, showing corpses strewn across the site and smashed tanker trucks ablaze.",
      "Satellite images of the port from Planet Labs PBC and analyzed by The Associated Press showed destroyed oil tanks and vehicles. Oil also appeared to be leaking into the Red Sea. Wim Zwijnenburg, an analyst with Dutch peace organization PAX, said it appeared at least three fuel storage tanks had been destroyed and that oil had leaked from mooring pipelines.",
      "The port also is the terminus of an oil pipeline stretching to Yemen's energy-rich Marib governorate, which is held by allies of Yemen's exiled government. The Houthis expelled that government from Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in 2014. However, oil exports have been halted by the decadelong war and the Houthis have used Ras Isa to bring in oil.",
      "Ras Isa takes in gasoline, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas for the Houthis. The damage from the airstrikes could seriously affect life in Houthi-held areas of Yemen.",
      "The Houthis denounced the U.S. attack as a \u201ccompletely unjustified aggression.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades,\" the Houthis said in a statement.",
      "On April 9, the U.S. State Department issued a warning about oil shipments to Yemen, saying it would \u201cnot tolerate any country or commercial entity providing support to foreign terrorist organizations, such as the Houthis.\u201d",
      "The attack follows Israeli airstrikes on the Houthis that hit port and oil infrastructure used by the rebels after their attacks on Israel, including Ras Isa.",
      "The airstrike on the port is the deadliest known attack yet in Trump's campaign against the Houthis. The actual cost in lives is hard to assess, said Luca Nevola, the senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a think tank.",
      "\u201cSince they are targeting civilian areas, there\u2019s a lot more victims. But it\u2019s also difficult to assess how many because the Houthis are releasing these umbrella statements that cover all the victims ... or tend to stress only the civilian victims,\u201d Nevola said.",
      "Further complicating the situation is the U.S. strikes hitting military targets, said Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert at the Basha Report risk advisory firm. He pointed to an American attack that Trump highlighted online with black-and-white strike footage, which might have killed about 70 fighters.",
      "\u201cAlthough the Houthis claimed it was a tribal gathering, they neither released any footage nor named a single casualty, strongly suggesting the victims were not civilians but affiliated fighters,\u201d al-Basha said. \u201cHowever, the overnight strike on the Ras Isa Fuel Port marks the first mass-casualty incident the Houthis have openly acknowledged and publicized.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce in a briefing with journalists accused Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. Ltd., a commercial satellite image provider, of \u201cdirectly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Bruce did not elaborate in detail, but acknowledged a report by The Financial Times that quoted anonymous American officials saying the firm linked to the People\u2019s Liberation Army has provided images allowing the rebels to target U.S. warships and commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea corridor.",
      "Bruce said \u201cBeijing's support ... of the satellite company\u201d \u201ccontradicts their claims of being peace supporters.\u201d",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian, responding to a question about the allegation, said Friday: \u201cI am not familiar with the situation you mentioned.\" However, he insisted China is seen as urging countries \u201cto make more efforts conducive to regional peace and stability.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince the escalations in the Red Sea situation, China has been playing a positive role in de-escalating the situation,\u201d Lin said. \u201cWho is promoting talks for peace and de-escalating the tensions, and who is imposing sanctions and pressure?\u201d",
      "Chang Guang did not respond to request for comment. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned the company in 2023 for allegedly providing satellite images to the Russian mercenary force the Wagner Group as it fought in Ukraine.",
      "It remains unclear whether Chang Guang is linked to the Chinese government. The U.S. government in the past has used images taken by American commercial satellite companies to share with allies, like Ukraine, to avoid releasing its own top-secret pictures.",
      "An AP review has found the new U.S. operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than that under former President Joe Biden. The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it. The Houthis also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.",

    "story": [
      "The chairman and CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH has called for a free trade zone between the European Union and the United States, saying that unresolved trade tensions could seriously hurt European industries",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH, called on Thursday for a free trade zone between the European Union and the United States and said that unresolved trade tensions could seriously hurt European industries.",
      "His remarks, in the wake of the tariffs announced by President Donald Trump, appeared to echo a similar call by Elon Musk on April 5 for a zero-tariff zone between the U.S. and EU. The EU has long pushed for a \u201czero-for-zero\u201d trade agreement \u2014 with both sides dropping tariffs \u2014 but Trump has rejected the offer.",
      "Speaking at LVMH\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, Arnault said European leaders should negotiate \u201ccleverly\u201d with the U.S. administration and that national governments should take a more prominent role instead of than leaving negotiations solely in the hands of Brussels, the center of EU\u2019s \u201cbureaucratic power.\u201d",
      "France\u2019s LVMH has for decades been the world\u2019s dominant luxury group \u2014 known for products such as Mo\u00ebt & Chandon Champagne, Hennessy Cognac, Louis Vuitton handbags and Dior perfumes \u2014 but this week lost its title as the world\u2019s largest luxury company to rival Herm\u00e8s.",
      "\u201cEurope is not run by a political power, but by a bureaucratic power that spends its time issuing regulations that are unfortunately imposed on all member states and that penalize our business sectors,\u201d the 76-year-old CEO said.",
      "The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive branch, negotiates trade deals on behalf of all 27 member states. The bloc is the largest trading entity in the world.",
      "LVMH shares fell 7.8% earlier this week, following an unexpected drop in first-quarter sales.",
      "Arnault said the company may be forced to expand U.S. operations. \"We would be forced to increase our American production to avoid tariffs if Europe failed to negotiate with intelligence,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2019, LVMH shifted part of its production to the U.S. by opening a Louis Vuitton workshop in Alvarado, Texas, during Trump\u2019s first term. Trump and Arnault toured the facility together, promoting it as a symbol of U.S. manufacturing revival.",
      "But on Thursday, Arnault admitted the Texas site has underperformed so far. According to documents presented at the meeting, the U.S. accounts for 25% of LVMH\u2019s total sales.",
      "Arnault also criticized France\u2019s proposed corporate tax increases, calling them a \u201ctax on \u2018Made in France\u2019\u201d and warned they could push companies to relocate abroad.",
      "He praised the U.S. model, citing lower taxes and state-backed industrial investment. \u201cWhen you come back to France after spending a few days in the U.S., it\u2019s a bit of a cold shower,\u201d he said.",
      "Outside the Louvre Museum conference hall, where the meeting took place, dozens of protesters demanded higher taxes on the wealthy, carrying a \u201cTax the rich\u201d sign alongside and a large puppet of Arnault depicted as a thief, a rope around his chest and hands tied behind his back.",
      "\u201cA tax of 2% on the wealth of France\u2019s ultra-rich could bring in up to \u20ac25 billion a year,\u201d said Fanny Petitbon, a spokesperson for the group 350.org. \u201cThat would be enough to invest in public services and accelerate an energy transition that benefits everyone.\u201d",

      "The IMF\u2019s Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, said Thursday that the Trump administration\u2019s sharp increases in duties have caused global uncertainty to spike. The import taxes will slow global growth, but not cause a worldwide recession, she added. The details of the IMF\u2019s outlook will be issued Tuesday.",
      "The world economy\u2019s resilience is being tested \u201cby the reboot of the global trading system\u201d that threatens to cause turbulence in financial markets, Georgieva said.",
      "That turbulence has been playing out in financial markets for weeks now, especially on Wall Street, which has experienced wild swings from day-to-day and often times even hour-to-hour.",
      "The IMF chief also echoed some Trump administration concerns. She called on countries to reduce their tariffs and lower other barriers to trade, a process that she said had stalled out in the past decade after making steady progress for many years after World War II.",
      "\u201cTrade distortions \u2014 tariff and nontariff barriers \u2014 have fed negative perceptions of a multilateral system seen to have failed to deliver a level playing field,\u201d she said. \u201cThis feeling of unfairness in some places feeds the narrative: we play by the rules while others game the system without penalty.\u201d",
      "Georgieva added that tariffs cause uncertainty, which can be costly. Due to the complexity of supply chains, the cost of a single item can be affected by tariffs in dozens of countries, she said.",
      "Increased trade barriers also tend to immediately impact growth, and while it can lead to more domestic production, that takes time to implement, she added.",
      "In its most recent projections issued in January, the IMF forecast the world economy to grow nominally faster and for inflation to come down, though it warned that outlook was clouded by President Donald Trump's policies, including tax cuts and increased tariffs on foreign imports.",
      "The Washington-based lending agency said at the time that it expected the world economy to grow 3.3% this year and next, up from 3.2% in 2024.",
      "Global inflation, which had surged after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains and caused shortages and higher prices, was forecast to fall from 5.7% in 2024 to 4.2% this year and 3.5% in 2026.",
      "However, in a blog post that accompanied those projections, the fund\u2019s chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, wrote that the policies Trump has promised to introduce \u201care likely to push inflation higher in the near term.\u2019\u2019",
      "Those forecasts from January are expected to change \u2014 possibly significantly \u2014 as Trump's trade war has escalated in recent months, particularly with the U.S.'s biggest trade partner, China.",
      "Trump has paused or pulled back on many of his tariff threats \u2014 leading to more volatility in the stock market \u2014 but has been in a tit-for-tat tariff battle with China and has shown no sign of backing down. Each time Trump has raised tariffs on China, Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. imports.",

      "Mike Summers was eager to install solar at his home in Ohio for years, and after he finally replaced his aging roof this year, his solar contractor swung into action. His system \u2014 including 19 panels and a battery backup \u2014 went up this week, and Summers considers himself lucky.",
      "\u201cI'm glad to have done it when I did,\u201d said Summers, a former mayor in his city of Lakewood just west of Cleveland. He'll get about $10,000 in tax credits on his $39,000 investment, but nearly as important is that all the equipment was readily available.",
      "Other hopeful solar buyers may have a much harder time in coming months. President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China threatens to crimp a massive source of solar panels and parts, with experts saying the cost of projects will certainly rise as China retaliates.",
      "China accounted for at least 80% of the components of solar panels as recently as 2022, according to an International Energy Agency report, especially polysilicon, glass and solar cells. Solar also demands increasing critical mineral supplies, of which China is a key player across the globe, and electronics.",
      "In the U.S., private industry has poured $18.2 billion into developing a domestic supply chain in recent years, according to Atlas Public Policy, that includes everything from the ingots and wafers that make up panels to electrical and structural components to assembly of the panels themselves. Most of that came from the Inflation Reduction Act passed during former President Joe Biden's administration, with massive funding for clean energy investment.",
      "But that won\u2019t come close to replacing what China produces.",
      "\u201cReally everybody\u2019s losing when you think about it, because the systems are costing more for the customers and it\u2019s also just making it more difficult, in some ways, for us to do business,\u201d said Brian DiPaolo, assistant sales manager at Cleveland-based solar installer YellowLite, which is doing Summers\u2019 project. DiPaolo said some customers are holding off on plans until there is more clarity. The company still stocked up on solar panels, made in North America, a month ago to stay competitive in coming months.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing both international as well as domestic manufacturers of the equipment increasing their costs to prepare for the tariffs,\" DiPaolo said. \u201cYou think that the domestic manufacturers would keep their prices down because they don\u2019t get hit by the tariffs, but they\u2019re seeing this added demand for their equipment.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s supply and demand, said Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of Heliene, which focuses on large-scale solar projects. He described the price of a necessary glass component from China going up in February due to a tariff hike. Suppliers in other countries matched the higher price, meaning higher costs no matter the source.",
      "Alexis Abramson, dean of Columbia University's Climate School, said there's no doubt that residential solar is going to be more expensive. That will cut solar adoption, and small and mid-size installers will go under, she said.",
      "It\u2019s just \u201cextremely difficult to offer current and future customers pricing certainty\u201d when trade policy is changing so much, said James Hasselbeck, chief operating officer at New England-based solar company ReVision Energy.",
      "Solar has gotten significantly more affordable in recent years as the technology scales up, improves and gets cheaper to install. Systems can still cost thousands of dollars on average, but the average cost for a residential system is down more than 70% from 2010, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. American consumers have also had a shot at credits that bring the cost down still further, although the future of those is uncertain under the Trump administration.",
      "Commercial and utility-scale project costs have also dropped dramatically.",
      "That's fed rapid growth across the U.S. over the past two decades. In 2024, the commercial segment grew 8% and utility grew 33%, according to an annual report from the association and consultancy Wood Mackenzie. The residential segment fell 32% last year, but experts attribute that to high interest rates and election uncertainty, and said they had expected continued growth before the tariffs hit.",
      "Solar is an important source of clean energy because it doesn't emit the harmful greenhouse gases that coal, natural gas and oil do. Those are massive contributors to Earth's warming.",
      "Trump imposed tariffs during his first term on imported solar cells and modules in 2018 in hopes of slashing reliance on China.",
      "But China subsidized its own domestic overproduction and some U.S. manufacturers accused it of essentially moving operations to four Southeast Asian countries that had a temporary exemption from tariffs.",
      "Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the U.S. is \u201cquickly taking back control of the supply chain from China to build the strongest solar manufacturing base in the world.\u201d The group reported that in 2024, module manufacturing capacity, largely concentrated in the South, grew 190%, and said cell manufacturing \u201cwas reshored for the first time in five years\u201d with company Suniva restarting production.",
      "But Hopper also said sudden changes in policy risk chilling investment and slowing job creation, especially for manufacturers. The group said during the first Trump administration that tariffs issued then were harmful to the industry.",
      "Ultimately, Abramson said she \u201cwould encourage anybody who has been really thinking about putting solar on their roof to really look into locking that in sooner rather than later.\u201d",

      "The bank\u2019s rate-setting council decided at a meeting in Frankfurt to lower its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.25%. The bank has been steadily cutting rates after raising them sharply to combat an outbreak of inflation from 2022 to 2023.",
      "Now that inflation has fallen, growth worries have taken center stage. The economy in the 20 countries that use the euro grew a modest 0.2% in the last three months of 2024. Inflation was 2.2% in March, close to the bank\u2019s target of 2%.",
      "The cut was widely expected by analysts given the sudden shadow cast over the eurozone\u2019s growth outlook by Trump\u2019s April 2 announcement of unexpectedly high tariffs, or import tax, on goods from other countries starting at 10% and ranging as high as 49%. The European Union faces a 20% tariff.",

      "MILAN -- Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni will test her mettle as a bridge between the EU and the United States when she meets with U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House on Thursday, the first European leader to have a face-to-face with Trump since he announced, and then suspended, 20% tariffs on European exports.",
      "Meloni secured the meeting at a critical juncture in the trade war as Italy\u2019s leader, but she also has, in a sense, been \u201cknighted\u201d to represent the European Union. She has been in close contact with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ahead of the trip, and \"the outreach is \u2026 closely coordinated,\" a commission spokeswoman said this week.",
      "\u201cWe know we are in a difficult moment,\" Meloni said this week in Rome. \"Most certainly, I am well aware of what I represent, and what I am defending.\"",

      "Trade negotiations fall under the European Commission\u2019s authority, which is pushing for a zero-for-zero tariff deal with the U.S. However, Trump administration officials in talks with the EU have yet to publicly show signs of relenting on Trump\u2019s insistence that a baseline 10% tariff be charged on all foreign imports. He paused for 90 days a retaliatory increase to 20%.",
      "The pause has raised some hopes for negotiations, and Meloni\u2019s margins for progress are more in gaining clarity on Trump's goals rather than outright concessions, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt is a very delicate mission,\u201d said Fabian Zuleeg, chief economist at the European Policy Center think tank in Brussels. \u201cThere is the whole trade agenda, and while she\u2019s not officially negotiating, we know that Trump likes to have this kind of informal exchange, which in a sense is a negotiation. So it\u2019s a lot on her plate.\"",
      "As the leader of a far-right party, Meloni is ideologically aligned with Trump on issues including curbing migration, promoting traditional values and skepticism toward multilateral institutions. But stark differences have emerged in Meloni\u2019s unwavering support for Ukraine.",
      "After being the only European leader to attend the Jan. 20 inauguration, Meloni has responded with studied restraint as abrupt shifts in U.S. policy under Trump have frayed the trans-Atlantic alliance. She has denounced the tariffs as \"wrong\" and warned that \u201cdividing the West would be disastrous for everyone,\u201d after Trump\u2019s heated White House exchange with Ukraine\u2019s president.",
      "\u201cShe has been very cautious,\u2019\u2019 said Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst at the London-based Teneo consultancy. \u201cIt is what we need when we have a counterpart that is changing every day.\u2019\u2019",
      "Italy maintains a 40 billion euro trade surplus with the United States, its largest with any country, fueled by Americans\u2019 appetite for Italian sparkling wine, foodstuffs like Parmigiano Reggiano hard cheese and Parma ham, and Italian luxury fashion. These are all sectors critical to the Italian economy, and mostly supported by small- and medium-sized producers who are core center-right voters.",
      "\u201cAll in all, I think she will focus on the very strong economic and trade relations that Italy has with the United States, not just in terms of exports, but also services and energy,\" said Antonio Villafranca, vice president of the ISPI think tank in Milan. \u201cFor example, Italy could even consider importing more gas from the U.S.\u201d",
      "The meeting comes against the backdrop of growing concerns over global uncertainty generated by the escalating tariff wars. Italy\u2019s growth forecast for this year has already been slashed from 1% to 0.5% as a result.",
      "Meloni is also expected to address Trump's demand for NATO partners to increase military spending to 2% of gross domestic product. Italy\u2019s spending, at 1.49% of GDP, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "Experts cautioned, however, against raising expectations over any concrete progress.",
      "\u201cThe best strategy has been to be very circumspect: Get there, get the meeting, get the photo opportunity,\u201d Piccoli said. \u201cIf she is able to come back, and give a sense of how Washington wants to frame future relations on trade, defense and Ukraine policy, that would be a huge win.\"",

      "Alico, Inc. said it has filed a development application for the first of two villages near the intersection of Collier, Lee and Hendry counties. Each village will have about 4,500 homes and will be integrated with 6,000 acres (2,400 hectares) of protected conservation land, the company said.",
      "The Fort Myers-based company owns 53,371 acres (21,600 hectares) across eight counties in Florida and 48,700 acres (19,700 hectares) of oil, gas and mineral rights in the state.

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump joined his economic advisers for White House negotiations Wednesday over tariffs and trade with a Japanese official",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday inserted himself directly into trade talks with Japanese officials, a sign of the high stakes for the United States after its tariffs rattled the economy and caused the administration to assure the public that it would quickly reach deals.",
      "The Republican president attended the meeting alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, top economic advisers with a central role in his trade and tariff policies.",
      "\u201cHopefully something can be worked out which is good (GREAT!) for Japan and the USA!\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post ahead of the meeting.",
      "Afterward, he posted: \u201cA Great Honor to have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade. Big Progress!\u201d",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters Thursday in Tokyo that his chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, told him from Washington that the talks were \u201cvery candid and constructive.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course the talks are not easy, but President Trump stated his intention to make this negotiation a top priority,\u201d Ishiba said. \u201cI believe we had talks that lead to a next step.\u201d",
      "Ishiba said he will closely watch how ministerial talks go and plans to visit Washington to meet with Trump at an appropriate time.",
      "Trump's choice to get directly involved in negotiations points to his desire to quickly finalize a slew of trade deals as China is pursuing its own set of agreements. It's an open test of Trump's reputation as a dealmaker as countries around the world seek to limit the potential damage unleashed by his import taxes.",
      "The sweeping tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 triggered panic in the financial markets and generated recession fears, causing the U.S. president to quickly put a partial 90-day hold on the import taxes and increase his already steep tariffs against China to as much as 145%.",
      "The pause temporarily spared Japan from 24% across-the-board tariffs, but there continues to be a 10% baseline tariff and a 25% tax on imported cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports.",
      "With Japan charging an average tax rate of 1.9% on other countries' goods and having a longstanding alliance with the U.S., the talks on Wednesday are a crucial indicator of whether the Trump administration can achieve a meaningful deal that reassures the markets, American voters and foreign allies.",
      "U.S. economic rival China, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on the turmoil around Trump's announcements, with its leader, President Xi Jinping, touring nations of Southeast Asia and promoting his country as a more reliable trade partner.",
      "Japan is among the first countries to start open negotiations with the U.S. Trump and other administration officials have said the phones have been \u201cringing off the hook\u201d with dozens of countries calling, eager to strike deals with a president who views himself as a master negotiator to avoid tariffs when the 90-day pause ends. Israel and Vietnam have offered to zero out their tariff rates, but Trump has been noncommittal as to whether that would be sufficient.",
      "On Thursday, Trump is scheduled to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who will likely be carrying messages on behalf of the European Union about how to resolve the tariffs Trump placed on the 27-state group.",
      "Still, the U.S. president may also be feeling increased domestic pressures to settle any tariffs as many voters say they returned Trump to the White House with the specific goal of improving the economy. California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit Wednesday that argues that Trump overstepped his authority by declaring an economic emergency to levy his tariffs, with the Democrat saying in a statement that the tariffs have caused economic chaos.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that Trump's tariff policies would hurt the U.S. economy, a direct warning to a White House trying to sell the import taxes as a long-term positive for the country.",
      "\u201cThe level of tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\u201d Powell said at the Economic Club of Chicago.",
      "Japan, like many other nations trying to minimize the possible economic fallout from Trump's tariffs, has been scrambling to respond. It has set up a special task force to assess the impact of the tariffs and offer loans to anxious companies.",
      "Although Ishiba has been working hard to coax exemptions out of Trump, the government has said little officially on what concessions it might offer during these talks.",
      "Nor has the administration been transparent about its asks. The Trump administration is seeking to close the $68.5 billion trade deficit with Japan and seeking greater access for U.S. goods in foreign markets, yet the president has also insisted that tariff revenues can be used to pay down the federal budget deficit.",
      "\u201cJapan is coming in today to negotiate Tariffs, the cost of military support, and \u2018TRADE FAIRNESS,\u2019\u201d Trump posted Wednesday.",
      "Japan has contended that Trump's tariff measures are likely to violate bilateral trade agreements or World Trade Organization rules. While Ishiba has said he opposes retaliatory tariffs, he also has said he is in no rush to push for a settlement because he doesn't want concessions.",
      "Xi, meanwhile, stopped in Malaysia on Wednesday and told its leader that China will be a collaborative partner and stand with its Southeast Asian neighbors after the global economic shocks.",
      "Xi is touring Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week on a trip that likely was planned before the tariffs' uncertainty but that he's also using to promote Beijing as a source of stability in the region and shore up relationships in that part of the world as he looks for ways to mitigate the 145% tariffs that Trump is keeping on China.",
      "\u201cIn the face of shocks to global order and economic globalization, China and Malaysia will stand with countries in the region to combat the undercurrents of geopolitical ... confrontation, as well as the counter-currents of unilateralism and protectionism,\u201d Xi said in remarks at a dinner with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.",
      "\u201cTogether, we will safeguard the bright prospects of our Asian family,\u201d he added.",
      "Xi has promised Malaysia and Vietnam greater access to Chinese markets on his visits, although few details were shared.",
      "In Washington, Trump has indicated that he also wants to discuss how much the Japanese contribute to the cost of U.S. troops stationed there, largely as a deterrent to China.",
      "Trump\u2019s demand for more defense spending concerns the Japanese government.",
      "Under its national security strategy, Japan aims to double annual defense spending to nearly $10 trillion, or 2% of GDP, in 2027, while there is a concern that Trump may ask for that to be increased to 3% of GDP. Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Tuesday that the military budget for this year is about 1.8% of Japan\u2019s GDP.",

      "The days of running backs being the headliners at the NFL draft are long in the past with the league\u2019s shift to more passing leading to quarterbacks, pass rushers and pass blockers dominating the top of the draft each year",
      "The days of running backs being the headliners at the NFL draft are long in the past with the league's shift to more passing leading to quarterbacks, pass rushers and pass blockers dominating the top of the draft each year.",
      "The ingredients could be in place for a bit of a change this year thanks to one of the deepest classes of running backs in years following a season when game-changing backs such as Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry became the biggest free agent hits.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a kid, running back was arguably the most important position on the field,\" Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said at the scouting combine. \u201cI grew up a Cowboys fan \u2014 Tony Dorsett, Emmitt Smith, guys like that were my idols. Then we went through this period over the last five, 10 years, where the analytics certainly de-emphasized the position. I think last year, you saw the impact that some of these guys had. ... I think (running backs) are looked at as probably replaceable by some people, but if you have a great one, you've got a historic one, you just can't replace those guys.\"",
      "The big question headed into the draft Thursday is whether teams view prospects such as Boise State's Ashton Jeanty and North Carolina's Omarion Hampton as those types of backs worthy of being taken with a premium pick.",
      "Jeanty was projected in the final AP mock draft to go sixth to Las Vegas, which would be the highest pick for a running back since Barkley was taken second overall in 2018 by the New York Giants.",
      "\u201cWe just saw Saquon Barkley just change the Eagles in one year,\u201d Raiders GM John Spytek said. \"Now they had a great team around him and it was adding an elite player. I think when you sit where we sit, I mean the idea is to add elite players at any position. I don\u2019t try to devalue any certain position. ... There\u2019s certain ways to build a team, and I don\u2019t know where we got to a place where we don\u2019t feel like running backs are valued. I come from the University of Michigan to my core, and those guys were certainly really valued there. So, it\u2019s hard for me to get away from that.\u201d",
      "Only one running back in the past six drafts was taken in the top 10 with Bijan Robinson going eighth to Atlanta in 2023. Five running backs were top-10 picks from 2015-18 with two being taken that high in 2017 when Leonard Fournette went fourth and Christian McCaffrey went eighth.",
      "It's a far cry from earlier eras when running backs were often the top overall pick, including four times in five seasons from 1977-81. No running back has gone first overall since Ki-Jana Carter in 1995.",
      "Teams have been waiting later and later to take running backs with Jonathan Brooks the first to go last year at No. 46 to Carolina. There has been just an average of two running backs taken in the top 50 in the past six drafts, down from a peak of 12 in 1990.",
      "This year's class of running backs is one of the deepest in recent memory with several players after Jeanty and Hampton projected to be picked either late in the first round or on day two of the draft including Ohio State's duo of TreVeyon Henderson and Quinshon Judkins; Iowa's Kaleb Johnson; Arizona State's Cam Skattebo, Tennessee's Dylan Sampson; Virginia Tech's Bhayshul Tuten; and Central Florida's RJ Harvey.",
      "The shift from a running to a passing league began with rule changes in 1978 that made passing easier and has continued for more than four decades.",
      "The rate of running dropped from a post-merger high of nearly 58% in 1977 to a low of just more than 40% in 2014 before undergoing a slight increase in recent years to 43.4% last season.",
      "But the bell-cow back had mostly disappeared as teams went to a backfield by committee. The league featured 13 players in 2003 who had at least 300 carries in a season \u2014 matching the nine-year combined total from 2015-23.",
      "Six players hit the 300-carry mark last season led by Barkley and Henry for the most in a season since 2010.",
      "\u201cFor a while, the market maybe was suppressed. People were not looking at them as weapons,\" Bills GM Brandon Beane said. \"I kind of look for them as anyone you add to your offense, what do they bring? What is their skill set? Is it a mismatched player? ... Someone asked, I think a year or two ago, what is your philosophy? Would you draft a running back in the first round? I probably wouldn\u2019t draft a running back that is 3 yards and a cloud of dust, but if it\u2019s a weapon like some of these guys were talking about, heck yeah I would.\u201d",
      "With the diminished role of the featured back, the pay at the position has also suffered with Josh Jacobs\u2019 running back-leading $48 million deal with Green Bay ranking tied for 159th among all players. The $13.6 million franchise tag number for running backs \u2014 determined by the highest-paid players at each position \u2014 is the lowest of any position outside of specialists.",
      "The rookie wage scale put in place in the 2011 collective bargaining agreement determines salaries for the first four seasons solely on draft position, leading teams to use premium picks on high-value positions such as quarterback, tackle, pass rushers and receivers in order to save money compared to veteran contracts.",
      "That\u2019s a big factor that is hard for some teams to overcome.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting conversation, because the draft pick is about potential ceiling, ability to play at a certain level, while you have those years under contract below free agency market level, your ability to sustain a second contract,\u201d Vikings general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah said. \u201cThere\u2019s all these questions that come into that answer before you pull the card.\u201d",

      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Two-way star Shohei Ohtani returned to the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 lineup Sunday for the series finale against the Texas Rangers, activated off the paternity list after his wife gave birth to the couple\u2019s first child in Southern California.",
      "The 30-year-old Ohtani, who didn\u2019t address the media before the game, will be in his accustomed leadoff spot.",
      "Manager Dave Roberts said Ohtani arrived in Texas late Saturday night.",
      "\u201cTo get back here and to be a part of this certainly shows his ability to balance life and work,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cGood to have him back and most importantly I\u2019m happy he and Mamiko have a healthy baby girl.\u201d",
      "Roberts said now that his star is a father, expect some \u201cdad strength\u201d exit velocities.",
      "\u201cDad strength is real,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how hard Shohei hits the ball now. So now that he is a father, you might see some 120 exit velos.\u201d",
      "Ohtani missed the series\u2019 first two games, which the Dodgers split, matching the previous two World Series winners. He appeared in all of Los Angeles\u2019 previous 20 games, hitting .288 with six home runs and 21 runs scored (one off major league lead).",
      "\u201cI am so grateful to my loving wife (28-year-old former professional basketball player Mamiko Tanaka) who gave birth to our healthy, beautiful daughter,\u201d Ohtani wrote on Instagram on Saturday. \u201cTo my daughter, thank you for making us very nervous yet super anxious parents.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- When Luka Doncic scored 16 points in the first quarter of his playoff debut with his new team, the Los Angeles Lakers' downtown arena crackled with excitement from fans probably imagining dream scenarios for their team and its new superstar this spring.",
      "The Timberwolves made sure that dream got ugly quite quickly in Game 1. They also left the Lakers looking for ways to help Doncic before Minnesota runs away with this first-round series.",
      "Doncic scored 37 points and eight rebounds, but it wasn't nearly enough to counter the Wolves' balanced scoring in their 117-95 victory Saturday night.",
      "After an impressive start by their Slovenian superstar, the Lakers were comprehensively embarrassed during their first postseason Game 1 in front of a full home arena since 2012. Los Angeles didn't demonstrate the toughness necessary to hang with the physical, veteran Wolves on defense \u2014 and only Doncic produced an impressive game on offense.",
      "The combination led to a 27-point deficit in the second half and a laugher of a victory for the Wolves, who immediately seized homecourt advantage in the series after finishing just one win behind the Lakers in the regular season.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a great opponent,\u201d JJ Redick said after losing his playoff coaching debut. \u201cThey\u2019re one of the best teams in basketball. It\u2019s not to say our guys weren\u2019t ready to withstand playoff-level basketball. We were mentally ready, and I thought our spirit was right. ... I\u2019m not sure physically we were ready, if that makes sense. When they start playing with a lot of thrust and physicality, we really just couldn\u2019t respond to that.\u201d",
      "Minnesota's superior physicality was obvious for long stretches, even with Rudy Gobert playing only 24 minutes. But the Wolves took control and kept it largely because they hit 21 3-pointers on only 42 attempts.",
      "The Lakers lack a dominant big man after trading Anthony Davis, and Jaden McDaniels took advantage of that while scoring 25 points. But that doesn't explain the Lakers' poor effort on the perimeter, where they have enough athletes to guard most teams competently when they make the effort.",
      "\u201cI think it was physical, (and) they were hitting a lot of 3s,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cWe have to limit their 3s, especially their lasers. We weren\u2019t physical. They were running. They were getting anything they want, and we have to be better.\u201d",
      "Doncic knew that applied to him personally on the offensive end despite his gaudy point total: The gifted passer had just one assist, his lowest total since Game 1 of last season's NBA Finals.",
      "LeBron James also got off to an unimpressive start to his 18th NBA postseason, scoring 19 points and going 1 for 5 on 3-point attempts while producing only three assists and five rebounds in 36 minutes.",
      "The 40-year-old James can't be shaken by one loss, and he focused on clear areas for improvement in Game 2 on Tuesday. He particularly lamented the Lakers' transition defense, which allowed 25 fast-break points.",
      "\u201cThroughout the whole season we did a great job of not allowing teams to get fast break point after fast break point,\u201d James said. \u201cWe already know offensively how dangerous they are, so in giving teams an opportunity to get those easy points, it\u2019s gonna be hard to make that up.\u201d",
      "The Lakers' crowd stayed in the game throughout the night, but the huge second-half deficit obviously dampened the excitement. Minnesota star Anthony Edwards wasn't exactly complimentary about that crowd after the Wolves cruised to victory, either",
      "\u201cAn atmosphere like this, it\u2019s easy for me, man,\" Edwards said. \"I\u2019ve played in Denver, man. Denver is a tough place to play on the road. So I mean, it was nothing.\u201d",

      "\u201cObviously they\u2019re going to key on him like we do on some of their players,\u201d coach Jared Bednar said of last season's NHL MVP. \u201cBut really strong defensive game from him, and obviously get-up and go on the offensive side, he was making plays all night.\u201d",
      "Blackwood stopped four shots in a span of 11 seconds midway through the second period just before MacKinnon assisted on Artturi Lehkonen's goal.",
      "Lehkonen was following his initial shot and falling down after a collision in front of the net when the puck ricocheted off his lower left leg into the top corner of the net. The play was reviewed and officials ruled that there was no kicking motion by Lehkonen while tumbling to the ice with Mavrik Bourque.",
      "There wasn't much Oettinger could do on either of those goals as the Stars lost Game 1 in their eighth consecutive series in the NHL playoffs since 2022. They are 0-7 in series openers under coach Pete DeBoer, six of those coming at home.",
      "\u201cI guess the good news is we\u2019ve come back and won more than our share of those series where we have (lost Game 1),\u201d said DeBoer, whose teams made it to the West final each of the past two seasons. \u201cSo I think we got to concentrate on that.\u201d",
      "Game 2 is Monday night in Dallas, before the series shifts to Denver.",
      "Devon Toews gave Colorado a 3-1 lead with 7:04 left. MacKinnon had an empty-net tally with 3:08 left, 11 seconds before Charlie Coyle scored.",
      "This series-opening loss for the Stars came after they finished the regular season on an 0-5-2 stretch that included four losses at home after being 28-5-3 before that.",
      "Blackwood is one of 11 players who have seen action since being acquired through Colorado's eight in-season trades. He came from San Jose in December and played in 37 games for the Avs.",
      "Those deals included the Avalanche trading Mikko Rantanen on Jan. 24 to Carolina in the East, He played only 13 games before a deadline deal March 7 sent him back to the Central Division with the Stars and included a $96 million, eight-year contract extension.",
      "Rantanen, who had 101 points (34 goals, 67 assists) in 81 playoff games for the Avalanche had three shots and one block over 18 minutes in his postseason debut with the Stars.",
      "Oettinger had 19 saves, three when Colorado had a two-man advantage in the first period when Cale Makar drew two tripping penalties only 36 seconds apart from each other.",
      "Roope Hintz, called for penalty against MacKinnon, got the Stars to 2-1 on his goal with 13:15 left in the game, just before the end of a power play and about a minute after DeBoer called a timeout.",
      "Bednar got his 50th playoff win with the Avs \u2014 in his 82nd postseason game, equal to a full regular season. That broke a tie with Bob Hartley for the most wins by a coach in franchise history. Both won Stanley Cups \u2014 Bednar in 2022, and Hartley in 2001.",

    "story": [
      "Nobody knows where whale sharks, the biggest fish in the sea, are mating",
      "JAMESTOWN, St. Helena -- Whale sharks shouldn't be hard for scientists to find. They are enormous \u2014 they are the biggest fish in the sea and perhaps the biggest fish to have ever lived. They are found in warm oceans all around the world. By shark standards, they are slow swimmers.",
      "But they somehow manage to also be very private: Scientists don't know where they mate, and they've never observed it before.",
      "They do finally have some clues, though. Scientists suspect the magic may be happening in the waters around St. Helena, a remote volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean where Napoleon Bonaparte was once exiled and died. It's the only place in the world where adult male and female whale sharks are known to regularly gather in roughly equal numbers \u2014 and food doesn\u2019t seem to be the main attraction.",
      "Kenickie Andrews, the marine conservation project manager at the St. Helena Trust says he\u2019s seen male sharks chasing females, nibbling on their pectoral fins and \u201cdisplaying themselves\u201d to the female sharks, akin to mating rituals observed in other sharks including great whites.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen here is classic shark courtship behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cTo this day we haven\u2019t seen successful copulation, but it is proof (whale sharks) are in our waters trying out these behaviors.\u201d",
      "Whale sharks typically measure from 12 to 18 meters (39 to 59 feet), weigh up to 14 tons and are plankton eaters; all sharks have a unique pattern of white spots on their upper side.",
      "Scientists say they need to know where the sharks are mating and giving birth so they can protect those areas, possibly by creating marine reserves where threats like fishing are banned. Whale sharks are designated as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; the group says their population has been \u201clargely depleted.\u201d",
      "Simon Pierce, who has studied whale sharks globally, said he has photographed suspected mating scars on female sharks in St. Helena, probably from when male sharks bit their pectoral fins to hold onto them and get into mating position.",
      "Suspected whale shark mating behavior has also been reported in Australia and the sharks also gather in places like Mexico, the Arabian Sea and the Maldives, but that seems to amount to male harassment of immature females, explains Pierce, executive director and co-founder of the charity Marine Megafauna Foundation. That's not the case in St. Helena, where adult males and adult females are present.",
      "Fisheries experts in St. Helena have also provided eyewitness accounts of what they said were instances of whale sharks mating. Officials described a lot of thrashing at the water's surface by two enormous sharks touching belly to belly, but those sightings were not captured on video and are not considered sufficient proof by scientists.",
      "Cameron Perry, a research scientist at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, has been working with colleagues on the island to attach camera tags to investigate what the whale sharks are doing, but have run into some technical difficulties: the sharks dive deeper than 2,000 meters (6,561 feet) and the tags can\u2019t withstand the pressure.",
      "\u201cWe have some very tantalizing and teasing video,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWe have two sharks about to make contact, and then our camera falls off.\u201d",
      "Perry isn\u2019t sure what the sharks might be doing far below the surface, but hopes new technology being developed will help answer that question. \u201cIt\u2019s just a numbers game in terms of how often we can get in the water.\u201d",
      "Alistair Dove, who has previously conducted research in St. Helena, said he\u2019s seen male whale sharks soliciting contact from adult female sharks, including rotating their claspers, or sexual organs, in what he said was \u201cthe sharky equivalent of an erection.\u201d",
      "\"These sexual behaviors are very, very rare in whale sharks,\u201d said Dove, now CEO of the Museum of Science & History in Jacksonville, Florida.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the huge, unanswered questions about the biggest fish in the world,\u201d Dove said.",
      "Andrews, of the St. Helena Trust, said he was hopeful someone might be able to capture video evidence of whale shark mating, but acknowledged the researchers\u2019 presence and tagging efforts might inadvertently alter the sharks\u2019 mating practices.",
      "\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t want to be seen,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe, like everyone else, they need privacy.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "America\u2019s only rare earths mine has fielded calls from anxious companies since China responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs by limiting exports of seven heavy metals",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- America\u2019s only rare earths mine heard from anxious companies soon after China responded to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs this month by limiting exports of those minerals used for military applications and in many high-tech devices.",
      "\u201cBased on the number of phone calls we\u2019re receiving, the effects have been immediate,\u201d said Matt Sloustcher, a spokesperson for MP Materials, the company that runs the Mountain Pass mine in California's Mojave Desert.",
      "The trade war between the world's two biggest economies could lead to a critical shortage of rare earth elements if China maintains its export controls long-term or expands them to seek an advantage in any trade negotiations. The California mine can\u2019t meet all of the U.S. demand for rare earths, which is why Trump is trying to clear the way for new mines.",
      "Rare earth elements are important ingredients in electric vehicles, powerful magnets, advanced fighter jets, submarines, smartphones, television screens and many other products. Despite their name, the 17 elements aren't actually rare, but it's hard to find them in a high enough concentration to make a mine worth the investment.",
      "MP Materials, which acquired the idle Mountain Pass site in 2017, said Thursday it would stop sending its ore to China for processing because of the export restrictions and 125% tariffs on U.S. imports China imposed. The company said it would continue processing nearly half of what it mines on site and store the rest while it works to expand its processing capability.",
      "\u201cSelling our valuable critical minerals under 125% tariffs is neither commercially rational nor aligned with America's national interests,\u201d MP Materials said in a statement.",
      "Experts say the manufacturers that rely on rare earth elements and other critical minerals will see price increases, but there is likely enough of a global supply available to keep factories operating for now.",
      "The California mine yields neodymium and praseodymium, the light rare earths that are the main components of the permanent rare earth magnets in EVs and wind turbines. But small amounts of some of the heavy rare earths that China has restricted, such as terbium and dysprosium are key to helping the magnets withstand high temperatures.",
      "Already, the price of terbium has jumped 24% since the end of March to reach $933 per kilogram.",
      "\u201cOur estimate suggests that there is enough stockpile in the market to sustain demand for now,\u201d Benchmark Mineral Intelligence rare earths analyst Neha Mukherjee said, adding that shortages may emerge later this year.",
      "China has tremendous power over the rare earths market. The country has the biggest mines, producing 270,000 metric tons (297,624 tons) of minerals last year compared to the 45,000 tons (40,823 metric tons) mined in the U.S. China supplies nearly 90% of the world\u2019s rare earths because it also is home to most of the processing capacity.",
      "The restrictions Beijing put in place on April 4 require Chinese exporters of seven heavy rare earths and some magnets to obtain special licenses. The retaliatory controls reinforced what the Trump administration and manufacturers see as a dire need to build additional U.S. mines and reduce the nation's dependence on China.",
      "Trump has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to strong-arm Greenland and Ukraine into providing more of their rare earths and other critical materials to the United States. Last month, he signed an executive order calling for the federal government to streamline permit approvals for new mines and encourage investments in the projects.",
      "Two companies are trying to develop mines in Nebraska and Montana. Officials at NioCorp and U.S. Critical Minerals said they hoped the push from the White House would help them raise money and obtain the necessary approvals to start digging. NioCorp has worked for years to raise $1.1 billion to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.",
      "\u201cAs I sit and I think about how can we deal with this enormous leverage that China has over these minerals that nobody even knows how to pronounce for the most part, we have to deal with this leverage situation,\" NioCorp CEO Mark Smith said. \"And the best way, I think, is that we need to make our own heavy rare earths here in the United States. And we can do that.\"",
      "MP Materials is working to quickly expand its processing capability, partly with the help of some $45 million the company received coming out of the first Trump administration. But after investing nearly $1 billion since 2020, the company doesn't currently have the ability to process the heavy rare earths that China is restricting. MP Materials said it was working expeditiously to change that.",
      "Big U.S. automakers declined to comment about how dependent they are on rare earths and the impact of China's export curbs. Major defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which were specifically targeted in China's restrictions along with more than a dozen other defense and aerospace companies, also remained circumspect.",
      "Military technology is a smaller but important user of rare earths. Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday calling for an investigation into the national security implications of being so reliant on China for the elements.",
      "A spokesperson for Lockheed, which makes the F-22 fighter jet, said the company continuously assesses \u201cthe global rare earth supply chain to ensure access to critical materials that support our customers\u2019 missions.\u201d",
      "Some battery makers could start to run short of key elements within weeks, according to Steve Christensen, executive director of the Responsible Battery Coalition, an association representing battery and automakers and battery sellers.",
      "Already, manufacturers have seen the price of antimony, an element used to extend the life of traditional lead-acid batteries, more than double since China restricted exports of it last year. The element isn't one of the 17 rare earths but is among the critical minerals that Trump wants to see produced domestically.",
      "Initially, automakers will likely try to absorb any increase in the cost of their batteries without raising vehicle prices, but that may not be sustainable if China's restrictions remain in place, Christensen said. A 25% tariff Trump put on all imported automobiles and auto parts cars already was expected to increase costs, although the president hinted this week that he might give the industry a temporary reprieve.",
      "The U.S. fulfilled its rare earths needs with domestic sources until the late 1990s. Production largely ended after low-cost Chinese ores flooded global markets. Robots, drones and other new technologies have rapidly increased demand for the raw materials.",
      "NioCorp recently signed a contract to do more exploratory drilling on its site this summer to help prove to the Export-Import Bank that enough rare earth minerals rest underground near Elk Creek, Nebraska, to justify an $800 million loan to help finance the project.",
      "But a new rare earths mine is years away from operating in the U.S. NioCorp estimates if all goes well with its fundraising, the site where it hopes to mine and process niobium, scandium, titanium and an assortment of rare earths possibly might be running by the end of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "U.S. Critical Minerals plans to dig up several tons of ore in Montana this summer so it can test out processing methods it has been developing. The Sheep Creek project isn't as far along as the Nebraska project, but U.S. Critical Minerals Director Harvey Kaye said the site has promising ore deposits with high concentrations of rare earths.",

      "By analyzing data from NASA and the European Space Agency's Webb Space Telescope, the researchers found evidence of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in the atmosphere of the planet known as K2-18b. The planet is 124 light-years away; one light-year is equivalent to nearly 6 trillion miles.",
      "On Earth, those two compounds are produced primarily by microbial life, such as marine phytoplankton.",
      "The planet is more than double Earth\u2019s size and more than 8 times more massive. It's in the so-called habitable zone of its star. The study appeared in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Endangered sea turtles show signs of recovery in a majority of places where they\u2019re found worldwide, according to a new global survey released Thursday.",
      "\u201cMany of the turtle populations have come back, though some haven\u2019t,\u201d said Duke ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved with the research. \u201cOverall, the sea turtle story is one of the real conservation success stories.\"",
      "The study looked at 48 populations of sea turtles around the world. Scientists measured the impacts of threats such as hunting, pollution, coastal development and climate change to the marine animals. In more than half of the areas studied, threats are declining overall, the study found.",
      "But there are some exceptions. Sea turtle populations in the Atlantic Ocean are more likely to be recovering than those in Pacific waters. And leatherback turtles are not faring as well as other species.",
      "Globally, leatherbacks are considered vulnerable to extinction, but many groups are critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "All seven of the regions where leatherbacks are found face high environmental risks, said study co-author Bryan Wallace, a wildlife ecologist at Ecolibrium in Colorado.",
      "Leatherback turtles are famous for making the longest known marine migrations of any animal \u2013 with some individuals swimming as many as 3,700 miles (5,955 kilometers) each way. That feat moves them through a wide swath of regions and may expose them to unique risks, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, green turtles are still considered endangered globally, but their populations show signs of recovery in many regions of the world, researchers found.",
      "\u201cBy ending commercial harvests and allowing them time to rebound, their populations are now doing really well\u201d in coastal waters off many regions of Mexico and the U.S., said co-author Michelle Mar\u00eda Early Capistr\u00e1n, a Stanford University researcher who has conducted fieldwork in both countries.",

      "For Sonia P\u00e9rez, stepping into Havana\u2019s Do\u00f1a Alicia restaurant felt like entering a movie",
      "HAVANA -- For Sonia P\u00e9rez, stepping into Havana\u2019s Do\u00f1a Alicia restaurant felt like entering a movie. Even as Cuba struggles with power outages and technological scarcity, this eatery has leaped into the 21st century with digital menus, Alexa-enabled assistance, touchless bathrooms and even a food-delivering robot.",
      "\u201cI thought I was in a cartoon movie!\u201d said the 64-year-old government employee, marvelling at the contrast with the technological realities outside. \u201cI wish there were more of these in Cuba... We are really very behind in technology.\u201d",
      "While commonplace globally, such automation is a complex feat in Cuba due to the island\u2019s frequent power cuts and a lack of modern technology.",
      "Opened seven years ago, the restaurant gradually embraced technology, starting with tablets at tables, followed by Alexa services and culminating in the arrival of Do\u00f1a Alicia \u2014 a food-delivering robot named after the owner\u2019s grandmother \u2014 who now assists human waiters in the dining room.",
      "Guests are greeted with digital menus on screens at their tables, allowing them to browse and order traditional Cuban dishes such as savory pork steak, pasta and sweet desserts. The bar further enhances the experience offering drinks such as mojitos or freshly made daiquiris. Human servers are on hand for those less tech-savvy.",
      "The prices align with those of other private restaurants, making them unaffordable for the average Cuban and reflecting the island's inflation.",
      "Despite the challenges of limited and often unreliable internet access in Cuba (mobile internet only became widespread in 2018, and outages are frequent due to the energy crisis), Do\u00f1a Alicia appears to be navigating these obstacles.",
      "Manager Yadiel Hern\u00e1ndez believes the technological advancements help attract customers by creating a unique and appealing dining experience in Havana.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed a change,\u201d said Hern\u00e1ndez. \u201cBoth children and adults find it interesting to have a robotic assistant bring food to the table...it's a novel experience.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration plans to rewrite part of the Endangered Species Act that prohibits harming the habitats of endangered and threatened species",
      "The Trump administration plans to eliminate habitat protections for endangered and threatened species in a move environmentalists say would lead to the extinction of critically endangered species due to logging, mining, development and other activities.",
      "At issue is a longstanding definition of \u201charm\u201d in the Endangered Species Act, which has included altering or destroying the places those species live. Habitat destruction is the biggest cause of extinction, said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service said in a proposed rule issued Wednesday that habitat modification should not be considered harm because it's not the same as intentionally targeting a species, called \u201ctake.\u201d Environmentalists argue that the definition of \u201ctake,\u201d though, has always included actions that harm species, and the definition of \u201charm\u201d has been upheld by the Supreme Court.",
      "The proposed rule \u201ccuts the heart out of the Endangered Species Act,\u201d said Greenwald. \u201cIf (you) say harm doesn\u2019t mean significant habitat degradation or modification, then it really leaves endangered species out in the cold.\u201d",
      "For example, he said spotted owls and Florida panthers both are protected because the current rule forbids habitat destruction. But if the new rule is adopted, someone who logs in a forest or builds a development would be unimpeded as long as they could say they didn't intend to harm an endangered species, he said.",
      "The proposed rule was expected to be published in the Federal Register on Thursday, kicking off a 30-day public comment period.",
      "A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman referred The Associated Press to the Department of Interior, which declined to comment.",
      "Environmental groups will challenge the rule in court if it is adopted, said Drew Caputo, an attorney at Earthjustice.",
      "He said the proposal \u201cthreatens a half-century of progress in protecting and restoring endangered species,\u201d including bald eagles, gray wolves, Florida manatees and humpback whales. He said that's because the current rule \u201crecognizes the common-sense concept that destroying a forest, beach, river, or wetland that a species relies on for survival constitutes harm to that species.\u201d",
      "The question is whether the Trump administration is entitled to repeal a rule that was upheld specifically by the Supreme Court and therefore subject to precedent, said Patrick Parenteau, an emeritus professor at the Vermont Law and Graduate School who has handled endangered species cases.",
      "Because of the current definition of harm, \u201cmany, many millions of acres of land has been conserved\u201d to help keep species alive, he said.",
      "The issue is of particular concern in Hawaii, which has more endangered species than any other state \u2014 40% of the nation\u2019s federally listed threatened and endangered species \u2014 even though it has less than 1% of the land area, according to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.",
      "Birds are among the most vulnerable. Since humans arrived, 71 birds have gone extinct, according to the state Department of Land and Natural Resources. Thirty-one of the 42 remaining endemic birds are listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, the department said and ten of these haven\u2019t been seen in decades.",

      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is emphasizing that he bought Instagram and WhatsApp because he liked the companies \u2014 not to cut competition as the Federal Trade Commission alleges in a historic antitrust trial",
      "WASHINGTON -- Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized in federal court on Wednesday that he bought Instagram and WhatsApp because he saw value in the companies \u2014 not to take out competitors, as the Federal Trade Commission alleges in a historic antitrust trial.",
      "Zuckerberg took the stand for the third day in the trial, wrapping up his testimony as the first witness Wednesday afternoon. He took questions from Meta attorney Mark Hansen, who has argued that his client hardly has a monopoly in social media, as the FTC claims, and still faces stiff global competition.",
      "Hansen focused some of his questioning on emails sent by Zuckerberg and his associates that the FTC cited in earlier testimony to illustrate the Facebook founder's alarm over the growth of Instagram and his sense that he needed to neutralize its threat.",
      "Zuckerberg said he\u2019s very focused on inventing new things, and understanding what other people are creating is a big part of the process. At any given point in his company\u2019s history, he said, similar tones of concern could be found in emails about what other companies were doing better than his.",
      "\u201cThis is my job,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I need to understand what is going on, and I need to push our teams to move quickly\u201d to learn about what is going on in a very competitive market.",
      "Hansen questioned Zuckerberg about competition, particularly from TikTok, the popular social media site owned by Beijing-based company ByteDance, and the the growth of the video-sharing platform YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet.",
      "Zuckerberg testified that people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined.",
      "While Hansen noted that the FTC doesn't consider YouTube to be a Meta competitor \u2014 because it doesn't have the same friend-sharing technology as Facebook \u2014 Zuckerberg said YouTube has built in ways to share videos.",
      "The FTC contends Meta has used a monopoly in its technology that facilitates connecting with friends and family to generate enormous profits as consumer satisfaction has dropped. The case could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, the FTC's attorney who questioned Zuckerberg, has repeatedly brought up his own words in emails to associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram to try to show Zuckerberg was more interested halting Instagram's alarming growth than improving the product.",
      "Under questioning by Hansen, Zuckerberg insisted that he had no intention of acquiring Instagram only to slow its development and end a threat. He said the focus was on \"having it run as an independent brand.\u201d",
      "Hansen noted that the FTC is making similar claims about the acquisition of the messaging app WhatsApp: that Zuckerberg was afraid of the company's potential.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something I thought about,\" Zuckerberg said, noting the app's formidable capabilities, but he added that he later learned not to be worried because the owners didn't share the same vision or direction.",
      "He said his interest in buying it was \u201cthe usage of it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought the app was important and valuable,\u201d Zuckerberg said.",
      "The trial, which is slated to last weeks, will feature other Big-Tech figures. After Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's former chief operating officer, took the stand.",
      "The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump\u2019s FTC\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump\u2019s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \u201cacqui-hires\u201d \u2014 a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is presiding over the case. Late last year, he denied Meta\u2019s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.",

      "The speed and scope of the federal government\u2019s efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges and universities across the country",
      "WASHINGTON -- At first, the bar association for immigration attorneys began receiving inquiries from a couple students a day. These were foreigners studying in the U.S., and they'd discovered in early April their legal status had been terminated with little notice. To their knowledge, none of the students had committed a deportable offense.",
      "In recent days, the calls have begun flooding in. Hundreds of students have been calling to say they have lost legal status, seeking advice on what to do next.",
      "\u201cWe thought it was going to be something that was unusual,\u201d said Matthew Maiona, a Boston-based immigration attorney who is getting about six calls a day from panicked international students. \u201cBut it seems now like it\u2019s coming pretty fast and furious.\u201d",
      "The speed and scope of the federal government's efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges across the country. Few corners of higher education have been untouched, as schools ranging from prestigious private universities, large public research institutions and tiny liberal arts colleges discover status terminations one after another among their students.",
      "At least 600 students at more than 90 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated in recent weeks, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials. Advocacy groups collecting reports from colleges say hundreds more students could be caught up in the crackdown.",
      "Around 1.1 million international students were in the United States last year \u2014 a source of essential revenue for tuition-driven colleges. International students are not eligible for federal financial aid, and their ability to pay tuition often factors into whether they will be admitted to American schools. Often, they pay full price.",
      "Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said.",
      "Four students from two Michigan universities are suing Trump administration officials after their F-1 student status was terminated last week. Their attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, Ramis Wadood, said the students never received a clear reason why.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s the scary part,\u201d he said.",
      "The students were informed of the terminations by their universities via email, which came as a shock, Wadood said. The reason given was that there was a \u201ccriminal records check and/or that their visa was revoked,\u201d Wadood said, but none of them were charged or convicted of crimes. Some had either speeding or parking tickets, but one didn\u2019t have any, he said. Only one of the students had known their entry visa was revoked, Wadood said.",
      "Students have filed similar lawsuits in several other states, arguing they were denied due process.",
      "In New Hampshire, a federal judge last week granted a temporary restraining order to restore the status of a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, Xiaotian Liu, while he challenges the revocation of his visa.",
      "At many colleges, officials learned the legal immigration status of some international students had been terminated when staff checked a database managed by the Department of Homeland Security. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.",
      "The system to track enrollment and movements of international students came under the control of Immigration and Customs Enforcement after 9/11, said Fanta Aw, CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators. She said recent developments have left students fearful of how quickly they can be on the wrong side of enforcement.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need more than a small number to create fear,\u201d Aw said. \u201cThere\u2019s no clarity of what are the reasons and how far the reach of this is.\u201d",
      "Her group says as many as 1,300 students have lost visas or had their status terminated, based on reports from colleges.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security and State Department did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "Foreigners who are subject to removal proceedings are usually sent a notice to appear in immigration court on a certain date, but lawyers say affected students have not received any notices, leaving them unsure of next steps to take.",
      "Some schools have told students to leave the country to avoid the risk of being detained or deported. But some students have appealed the terminations and stayed in the United States while those are processed.",
      "Still others caught in legal limbo aren't students at all. They had remained in the U.S. post-graduation on \u201coptional practical training,\u201d a one-year period \u2014 or up to three for science and technology graduates \u2014 that allows employment in the U.S. after completing an academic degree. During that time, a graduate works in their field and waits to receive their H-1B or other employment visas if they wish to keep working in the U.S.",
      "Around 242,000 foreigners in the U.S. are employed through this \u201coptional practical training.\u201d About 500,000 are pursuing graduate degrees, and another 342,000 are undergraduate students.",
      "Among the students who have filed lawsuits is a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student who is supposed to graduate on May 5, with a job offer to join the faculty. His attorney Charles Kuck said the student was likely targeted for termination because of an unpaid traffic fine from when the student lent his car to a friend. Ultimately, the violation was dismissed.",
      "\u201cWe have case after case after case exactly like that, where there is no underlying crime,\u201d said Kuck, who is representing 17 students in the federal lawsuit. He said his law firm has heard from hundreds of students.",
      "\u201cThese are kids who now, under the Trump administration, realize their position is fragile,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve preyed on a very vulnerable population. These kids aren\u2019t hiding. They\u2019re in school.\u201d",

They told the magistrate they were collecting the ants for fun and did not know that it was illegal.",

      "The illegal export of the ants \"not only undermines Kenya\u2019s sovereign rights over its biodiversity but also deprives local communities and research institutions of potential ecological and economic benefits,\u201d KWS said in a statement.",
      "Kenya has in the past fought against the trafficking of body parts of larger species of wild animals such as elephants, rhinos and pangolins among others. But the cases against the four men represent \"a shift in trafficking trends \u2014 from iconic large mammals to lesser-known yet ecologically critical species,\u201d KWS said.",
      "The two Belgians were arrested in Kenya\u2019s Nakuru county, which is home to various national parks. The 5,000 ants were found in a guest house where they were staying, and were packed in 2,244 test tubes that had been filled with cotton wool to enable the ants to survive for months.",

      "LONDON -- Sony said it will raise prices starting Monday for some PlayStation 5 video game consoles in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, citing global economic turmoil.",
      "The company unveiled the price hikes of at least 10%, saying it was a \u201ctough decision\u201d amid the \u201cbackdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates.\u201d",

      "Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump\u2019s Federal Trade Commission\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: \u2018It is better to buy than compete.\u2019 True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \u201cneutralize perceived competitive threats,\u201d the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "\u201cUnable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company\u2019s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,\u201d the FTC says.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \u201cacqui-hires\u201d \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "\u201cThe FTC already has the difficult task, whether it\u2019s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we\u2019re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,\u201d said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cAnd I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.\u201d",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC\u2019s lawsuit \u201cdefies reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission\u2019s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC \u201cmust prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.\" This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram.",
      "Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.",
      "Boasberg \u201cseems to be skeptical\u201d of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a \u201cfact question,\" which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market.",
      "While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram.",
      "\u201cInstagram is now Meta\u2019s biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company\u2019s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. \u201cThe trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn\u2019t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.\u201d",
      "But Meta isn't the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google's case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August.",
      "\u201cA big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it\u2019s an open question whether the judgment developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing \u2014 these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cAnd this will be a case that speaks directly to that.\u201d",

    "summary": "On \"This Week,\" border czar Tom Homan defended the use of the Alien Enemies Act and Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2019s wrongful deportation.",
    "story": [
      "'We have followed the Constitution. We have followed the law,' border czar says.",
      "Trump administration border czar Tom Homan criticized Sen. Chris Van Hollen\u2019s trip to El Salvador to visit deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, accusing the Democrat of traveling \"on the taxpayer dime to meet with an MS-13 gang member, public safety threat, [and] terrorist.\"",
      "\"What concerns me is Van Hollen never went to the border the last four years under Joe Biden,\u201d Homan said in a Friday interview with \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl that aired Sunday. \u201cWhat shocks me is he's remained silent on the travesty that happened on the southern border. Many people died, thousands of people died.\"",
      "In a separate interview on \"This Week,\" Van Hollen, D-Md., responded to Homan\u2019s criticism, saying that he has long supported fighting gang violence.",
      "\u201c[Homan] is lying through his teeth on many places in that -- in that record. And I have been actually fighting MS-13, probably longer than Donald Trump ever uttered the name MS-13. For 20 years in this region, I helped stand up the anti -- you know, gang -- anti-gang task force. But the idea that you can't defend people's rights under the Constitution and fight MS-13 and gang violence is a very dangerous idea. That's the idea the president wants to put out. That's why they're spreading all these lies.\u201d",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who was residing in Maryland, was deported to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison in March. The White House alleges he is member of the MS-13 gang, which was designated as a \"foreign terrorist organization\" by the administration; his attorneys and family deny he's affiliated with the gang.",
      "Abrego Garcia received a protective court order in 2019 barring him from being deported to El Salvador due to fear for his safety. In a court filing, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has acknowledged he should not have been sent to El Salvador, calling it an \"administrative error.\" The Supreme Court has upheld an order saying the administration must \"facilitate\" his return to the U.S.",
      "Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week and met with Abrego Garcia, whose wife is a U.S. citizen and constituent of Van Hollen's, on Thursday after initially being denied access to him.",
      "Van Hollen stressed that for him, this case is about protecting constitutional rights, telling Karl, \"I am not defending the man. I'm defending the rights of this man to due process.\"",
      "But Homan defended the administration's actions so far, arguing that under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which the administration invoked to deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants including Abrego Garcia, due process rights are more limited.",
      "\u201cI stand by the fact I think we did the right thing here. We removed a public safety threat, a national security threat, a violent gang member from the United States,\u201d Homan said. \"We have followed the Constitution. We have followed the law. I am confident that everything we've done is follow laws within the constitutional constructs, absolutely.\"",
      "He continued, \"The length of due process is not the same under the Alien Enemies Act. That's why the Alien Enemies Act was created. President Trump invoked the authorities he had under the Alien Enemies Act, an act written and passed by Congress and signed by a President. We're using the laws on the books.\"",
      "Homan\u2019s defense of the centuries-old law in his Friday interview came just hours before the Supreme Court temporarily halted its use to deport any Venezuelans being held at a facility in northern Texas.",
      "Karl pressed Homan on the due process rights of the deported undocumented immigrants, citing the 1993 Flores v. Reno Supreme Court opinion authored by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia that noted, \"It is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.\"",
      "\"Are you saying that by invoking the Alien Enemies Act that undocumented immigrants are not entitled to those due process rights under the Fifth Amendment?\" Karl asked.",
      "\"We're following the rules of the Alien Enemies Act. Again, I think this administration has followed the law. They're using statutes enacted by Congress, signed by a president, to remove terrorists from this country. I'm not saying, you know -- I'm not saying, I'm not arguing right here that nobody should get due process. I'm just saying there's a different process under the Alien Enemies Act, and less of a process than you see through Title 8,\" Homan said, referring to the immigration statute typically used to deport undocumented immigrants.",
      "Homan also denied that any migrant is being labeled a gang member solely because of tattoos. On Friday, Trump posted a photo on social media of what he says is Abrego Gracia\u2019s hand. The MS-13 symbols appear to be superimposed and it\u2019s not clear if the other tattoos have any link to the gang.",
      "\"Tattoos are one of many factors that's going to determine someone\u2019s in a gang. That's not the only one,\" Homan said. \"What I'm saying is you can't ignore a tattoo. That's, that's one more factor that leads you to believe maybe it's a gang member. It's just not based on tattoos. It's based on a lot of other things, but tattoos, one of many. But no one's removed just because of a tattoo.\"",

      "But Hassett repeatedly declined to clarify where talks with China stand and whether President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump have actually spoken. On Thursday, Trump said American and Chinese teams are in discussion for a deal on tariffs.",

      "US port fees receive a 6-month reprieve",
      "United States businesses, importers, retailers and farmers are breathing a sigh of relief as President Donald Trump's administration announced a phased-in implementation of port fees on \"Chinese\" vessels, starting with $0 for the first 180 days, rather than the previously announced $1 million to $1.5 million per port of call.",
      "The fees, which initially had the potential to be cumulative, or more than $3 million for the affected ships for vessels that are made in China \u2014 or operated or owned by a company with any Chinese vessels in its fleet or on order \u2014 had drawn unprecedented outcry from the people and companies whom it would affect, since they are already facing increased costs because of tariffs.",
      "Had the fees been issued starting Thursday, as was initially expected, experts predicted that most ships would skip smaller ports for larger ones, creating supply chain and labor issues.",
      "\u201cCurrently, ships visit an average of three to four U.S. ports, both large and small, to move American cargo,\u201d Nate Herman, senior vice president of policy for American Apparel & Footwear Association testified before the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in March. \"The United States has more than 300 ports \u2014 but only 10 major ports.\"",
      "\"If the proposed fees are implemented in every port call, shippers will likely reduce their port visits to just one U.S. port to minimize costs. As a result, calls to secondary ports would largely cease. These secondary ports would face a significant decline in business, leading to potential closures and significant job losses for American longshoremen,\" Herman told the USTR.",

      "\"I don't really have an emergency. I would like to apologize,\" the suspect, 38-year-old Cody Balmer, is heard telling the operator in a recording of the call obtained by ABC News through a public records request.",

    "story": [
      "The website once had resources for vaccines, testing and treatment for COVID-19.",
      "The White House has redirected COVID.gov to a new landing page called \"Lab Leak: True Origins of COVID-19,\" which makes a five-point argument for\u00a0the theory that COVID-19 originated from a mistaken lab leak in Wuhan, China.",
      "The new site appears to use theories from the final report of the Republican-led\u00a0Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic,\u00a0released in December 2024.\u00a0There has never been a consensus or a \"smoking gun\" to explain what started the pandemic.",
      "The COVID.gov page, as recently as last week, listed resources for testing, treatment, and vaccination against COVID-19, as well as information for Long COVID.",
      "The five pieces of evidence put forth by the White House\u00a0for the theory include the following assertions: that the \"virus possesses a biological characteristic that is\u00a0not found in nature,\" that data shows all cases \"stem from\u00a0a single introduction into humans,\" that \"Wuhan is home to China's foremost SARS research lab,\" that researchers at that research lab \"were\u00a0sick with COVID-like symptoms\u00a0in the fall of 2019,\" and that \"if there was evidence of a natural origin it would have\u00a0already surfaced.\"",
      "The page includes claims that government officials, including former NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, helped edit and then amplify\u00a0a research paper\u00a0on the origins of COVID-19 published in 2020 that supported natural origin theory.",
      "The current page suggests this paper's explicit intention was to discredit the lab leak theory and remove any doubt that the origins were of natural origin. This is not a new accusation and in the past\u00a0 Fauci\u00a0and the paper authors disagreed with the accusations that the paper was manipulated or had any specific goal.",
      "The origins of the pandemic have been hotly debated since its start.",
      "The prevailing theories always seemed to focus on two scenarios: either natural exposure to an infected animal or an accidental lab leak.",
      "With no \"smoking gun\" and limited access to raw data, discussion of the science has played out in a haze of circumstantial evidence.",
      "In October 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence\u00a0released\u00a0a declassified report on the intelligence community's views on the origin conundrum, which also leaned toward a natural spillover, but represented divided views. A subsequent\u00a0declassified report\u00a0released in 2023 also noted that most of the intelligence community was split on the origins of the pandemic.\u00a0In reports, US agencies generally agreed that the virus was most likely not developed as a biological weapon and that China's leaders did not know about the virus before the start of the global pandemic.",
      "The new\u00a0splash page features a photo of Fauci and the pardon that former President Joe Biden granted him, highlighting that it was for \"any offenses.\" The page also accuses federal agencies, including NIH and HHS, of breaking laws and violating rules about transparency and cooperation with Congressional investigation.\u00a0The agencies complied with FOIA requests and other regulatory requests from the committee and also appeared before lawmakers when asked to testify.",
      "The web page also calls into question the efficacy of social distancing, masking and lockdown. The White House also criticized the response from New York officials.",
      "Fauci testified about the accusations before lawmakers in 2024, saying that accusations about him covering up or influencing research about the lab leak theory are untrue.",
      "\"The accusation being circulated that I influenced the scientists to change their minds by bribing them with millions of dollars in grant money is absolutely false, and simply preposterous. I had no input into the content of the published paper,\" Fauci said in June of 2024.",
      "\"The second issue is a false accusation that I tried to cover up the possibility that the virus originated from a lab. In fact, the truth is exactly the opposite,\" Fauci said during that 2024 hearing.",
      "This is not the first time that the White House has made clear its position on the origins of COVID-19. In January, President Trump said that COVID-19 had \"strained\" his relationship with President Xi Jinping of China.",
      "\"But, I like President Xi very much. I've always liked him.\u00a0We always had a very good relationship. It was very strained with COVID coming out of Wuhan. Obviously, that strained it.\u00a0I'm sure it strained it with a lot of people, but that strained our relationship,\" Trump said in remarks to the World Economic Forum.",

      "NEW YORK -- Opponents of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration took to the streets of communities large and small across the U.S. on Saturday, decrying what they see as threats to the nation\u2019s democratic ideals.",
      "The disparate events ranged from a march through midtown Manhattan and a rally in front of the White House to a demonstration at a Massachusetts commemoration marking the start of the American Revolutionary War 250 years ago. In San Francisco, protesters formed a human banner reading \u201cImpeach & Remove\u201d on the sands of Ocean Beach overlooking the Pacific Ocean.",
      "Thomas Bassford was among those who joined demonstrators at the reenactment of the Battles of Lexington and Concord outside of Boston. \u201cThe shot heard \u2019round the world\u201d on April 19, 1775, heralded the start of the nation\u2019s war for independence from Britain.",

      "Elsewhere, protests were planned outside Tesla car dealerships against billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk and his role in downsizing the federal government. Others organized more community-service events, such as food drives, teach-ins and volunteering at local shelters.",
      "The protests come just two weeks after similar nationwide protests against the Trump administration drew thousands to the streets across the country.",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s defying the courts. He\u2019s kidnapping students. He\u2019s eviscerating the checks and balances,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cThis is fascism.\u201d",

      "\u201cI cannot sit still knowing that if I don\u2019t do anything and everybody doesn\u2019t do something to change this, that the world that we collectively are leaving for the little children, for our neighbors is simply not one that I would want to live,\u201d said the 76-year-old retired federal employee from Springfield, Virginia.",
      "In Columbia, South Carolina, several hundred people protested at the statehouse. They held signs that said \u201cFight Fiercely, Harvard, Fight\u201d and \u201cSave SSA,\u201d in reference to the Social Security Administration.",

      "\u201cNo fear, no hate, no ICE in our state,\u201d they chanted to the steady beat of drums, referring to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Marshall Green, who was among the protesters, said he was most concerned that Trump has invoked the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 by claiming the country is at war with Venezuelan gangs linked to the South American nation\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cCongress should be stepping up and saying no, we are not at war. You cannot use that,\u201d said the 61-year-old from Morristown, New Jersey. \u201cYou cannot deport people without due process, and everyone in this country has the right to due process no matter what.\u201d",

      "When ABC News reached out to Van Hollen's office for comment on how the trip was funded, his office replied, \"the Senator traveled in his official capacity with bipartisan approval to follow up on the case of a constituent and conduct oversight of U.S. foreign assistance programs.

      "The Trump administration had begun the process this week of firing 1,474 employees at the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, according to a sworn declaration from Paoletta, the agency's chief legal officer.",
      "The administration plans to run the agency with a 206-person staff, according to court filings Friday morning, a steep decrease from the 1,680 employees who previously worked for the consumer-protection agency. Some departments within the CFPB were cut entirely or reduced to a single employee, according to Paoletta.",
      "\"An approximately 200-person agency allows the Bureau to fulfill its statutory duties and better aligns with the new leadership's priorities and management philosophy,\" Paoletta wrote.",
      "According to Paoletta, agency leadership conducted a \"particularized assessment\" of each department to determine how to run the CFPB with the \"smaller, more efficient operation.\"",
      "\"Leadership has discovered many instances in which the Bureau's activities have pushed well beyond the limits of the law,\" he wrote.",
      "The CFPB, created by Congress to safeguard Americans against unfair business practices in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, has been targeted for elimination by President Donald Trump as part of his efforts to slash the federal government.",
      "Trump has said the CFPB is \"very important to get rid of\" and that the organization was \"set up to destroy some very good people.\"",
      "Its oversight applies to everything from mortgages to credit cards to bank fees to student loans to data collection. By law, the CFPB has the rare ability to issue new rules and to impose fines against companies who break them.",
      "Since its establishment in 2011 through last June, the CFPB said it has clawed back $20.7 billion for American consumers.",

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- In her 28 years working for the federal government, Shea Giagnorio provided day care for the children of U.S. soldiers, training for employees and oversight for safety net programs.",
      "Public service took her from Germany to Alaska to Kansas City, Missouri, where she moved last year for a long-sought promotion.",
      "But when she reported to a downtown federal building for work one day last month, her access card did not work. After a co-worker let her into the building, she checked her email: Her entire office had been let go in the latest mass firing ordered by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "The 46-year-old single mom has canceled her apartment lease, is selling her new furniture and may have to pull her daughter of college. She wonders what will happen to the at-risk populations her team helped serve at the Administration for Children and Families, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "\u201cNot only me, but all these peoples\u2019 lives are turned upside down,\u201d Giagnorio said.",
      "The impact of the cuts by Trump appointees and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency can be found everywhere in the Kansas City metropolitan area, which has long been a major hub for federal agencies about 1,000 miles away from Washington, D.C. Money once promised to the region for public health, environmental, diversity, food aid and an array of other programs has been axed, and thousands of local jobs are in jeopardy.",
      "With nearly 30,000 workers, the federal government is the largest employer in the region. One longtime Kansas City economic researcher said he believes the region could lose 6,000 good-paying federal jobs, which in turn would wipe out thousands of others in service industries.",
      "An IRS worker said thousands of her coworkers fear they will lose their jobs, even as they put in overtime processing tax refunds in a building so crowded that they struggle to find desks. Under pressure, hundreds more agreed this week to retire early or take a buyout.",

      "And the city's Tesla showroom has become a spot of weekly protest. Activists are seeking to have it closed by pushing a referendum intended to drive Musk\u2019s electric car company out of Missouri.",
      "The nation's health department is slashing its full-time national workforce from 82,000 to 62,000. Among them were Giagnorio and her colleagues in her agency's 10 regional offices around the country that helped deliver services through programs such as Head Start and emergency assistance for low-income families.",
      "\u201cThe poor will become even more poor now,\u201d Giagnorio said. \u201cIf we\u2019re taking away social safety nets, what is the end result? If we\u2019re not helping homeless people anymore, will they freeze to death in the winter? Is that what we want?\u201d",
      "Giagnorio, who spent most of her career as a U.S. Department of Defense civilian employee at bases in Germany and Alaska, is on paid leave until her June 2 termination. She wasted no time looking for another position after being locked out of her office, visiting a job fair hours later that Kansas City hosted for displaced federal workers.",
      "But she doubts she will be able to find a public sector salary anywhere near the $117,000 she made and doesn\u2019t know how her skills translate to the private sector. She worries about losing the health insurance that covers her family and having to pull her daughter out of Maastricht University in the Netherlands after her first year.",
      "For now, she can\u2019t get any answers from the agency to basic questions about her financial future. Does she still qualify for an early retirement buyout offer that had been extended? How much would she receive and when?",
      "The days leading up to the April 15 tax filing deadline were always going to be busy for workers at the IRS processing center near Union Station, but this year, they were particularly stressful.",
      "The IRS is considering a downsizing that could cut as many as 20,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce, in the coming weeks. The roughly 6,000 employees in Kansas City faced agonizing choices: decide whether to accept resignation or early retirement offers by April 14 or risk losing their jobs later.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a kick in the stomach to people that are doing everything they can to meet what\u2019s required of them,\u201d said Shannon Ellis, a longtime IRS customer service representative and president of the union representing local workers.",
      "By Thursday, at least 238 Kansas City workers had taken the buyout offers and were expected to leave the agency in coming weeks. Ellis noted many of those same workers had been told they were essential and required to work overtime during tax season, some seven days per week.",
      "Their building has been overcrowded since the IRS ordered remote employees back to the office in March. Workers sometimes struggle to find open desks. Some have to bring their own ink pens and share date stamps to perform basic job functions after budget cuts have depleted supplies.",
      "Ellis said IRS workers share the public\u2019s disdain for taxes but understand that collecting them is necessary to support important programs like Social Security. She said she\u2019s decided to take a \u201croll of the dice\u201d and stay in her job, spurning an early retirement offer.",
      "\u201cI love my job,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let the bully force me out.\u201d",
      "Urban farmer Rosie Warren grew 2,500 pounds of fruits and vegetables last year in community gardens to help feed the Ivanhoe neighborhood, where many Black families were concentrated under housing segregation policies of much of the 20th century.",
      "Warren harvested greens, potatoes and watermelons as part of an effort to address food insecurity and health concerns in a neighborhood challenged by blight, crime and poverty. She was ecstatic last fall when the USDA awarded the neighborhood council a three-year, $130,000 grant to expand the gardens and farmers\u2019 market serving the area.",
      "Plans called for hiring an assistant to help Warren with growing more food and to add another market day aimed at serving more low-income older adults, mothers and children.",
      "In February, the council received a notice terminating the grant. The USDA had determined the award \u201cno longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d",
      "On a recent morning, Warren took a break from preparing the soil for planting to ponder the USDA\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cWhat do you do if you don\u2019t support providing access to food to people who don\u2019t have it? Wouldn\u2019t this make your job easier?\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s absurd. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d",
      "Other food aid in the neighborhood has taken a hit at a time when demand is rising.",
      "At the Bishop Sullivan Center food pantry, hundreds of low-income families are getting fewer groceries in their monthly pickups after USDA halted $500 million worth of deliveries to food banks. That included a planned order for 41,000 cases of meat, dairy and other commodities to a bank serving Kansas City.",
      "\u201cIt just means giving families less food,\u201d said pantry director Christopher Lowrance, who said he\u2019s able to provide less chicken and other meat products. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",
      "The Kansas City Health Department\u2019s laboratory is badly in need of an upgrade, with equipment dating to when the building opened in the 1990s.",
      "One basement space is water damaged and rarely used. Another has equipment that is so inadequate that the city has to ship samples to a state laboratory 150 miles away, causing inefficiencies, agonizing waits for results and delayed response times.",
      "Kansas City\u2019s health director, Dr. Marvia Jones, made it a top priority to modernize the labs this year after studying their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her agency planned to use federal funding to purchase new microscopes and testing equipment.",
      "\u201cThat early disease detection allows you to do more rapid intervention, more rapid treatment, more rapid isolation,\u201d she said.",
      "But the funding for lab upgrades was abruptly eliminated last month as part of the Trump administration's $11.4 billion cancellation of federal grants to states for public health. That news \u201ccrushed\u201d the department's carefully laid plans, Jones said.",
      "Jones said the cuts, $3 million and counting for her department, mean the city will also have fewer vaccines to administer to low-income residents.",
      "\u201cIt would be a sad shame for us to be in a worse position than we were before the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had processed all of our lessons learned, and then now this happens.\u201d",
      "Amir Minoofar was surprised when two federal agencies notified him that they planned to vacate the office building he\u2019s owned for a decade in Overland Park, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City.",
      "Minoofar said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had recently agreed to extend its lease until 2029. The National Labor Relations Board, meanwhile, was paying month to month.",
      "Minoofar said the government initially notified him the agencies would be out of the building in August, part of a DOGE-led blitz of hundreds of lease cancellations that has been marked by errors and subsequent reversals.",
      "In the Kansas City metropolitan area, the government is moving to cancel 10 leases totaling 219,000 square feet that cost more than $4 million in annual rent, according to DOGE\u2019s online \u201cWall of Receipts.\u201d",
      "Minoofar said he was more recently told the agencies will likely have to stay past August and their departure date is now unclear. He said he may have to sell the building, which has an appraised value of $2.9 million, and take a loss because of the difficult office market.",
      "But he said he understands why the government would unload the space, which he said has often been sparsely used since the rise of telework during the pandemic.",
      "\u201cBusinesswise, it makes sense for government to cut costs,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people are going to be unhappy but it\u2019s a huge gigantic family and they need to take care of it. You cannot keep everybody happy.\u201d",
      "With liberal anger growing at Musk\u2019s role in the government, protesters have gathered Saturdays outside his Tesla dealership in Kansas City to denounce the cuts.",
      "State records show Tesla sales there have dropped amid calls for a boycott. Now, enough voter anger could even force the business to close.",
      "Organizers of a newly launched \u201cUnplug Musk\u201d initiative are seeking to use democracy to strike at the world\u2019s richest man by changing state law to ban car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers.",
      "They say they plan to soon begin gathering the 111,000 signatures of registered voters that they would need to put the change on the statewide ballot in November 2026. If approved by voters, it would force the closure of the Tesla showrooms in Kansas City and St. Louis.",
      "Missouri\u2019s governor, Republican Mike Kehoe, a former auto dealer himself, sponsored a 2014 bill when he was a state senator aimed at requiring manufacturers like Tesla to sell through local dealers. The bill passed the Senate but died in the House after Tesla lobbied against it. The referendum revives that plan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a soul in this country who\u2019s against trying to weed out government inefficiency but just taking a chain saw to people\u2019s lives and their health care is a ridiculous way to achieve that. And it is going to cause some devastating impacts,\u201d said organizer Brad Ketcher, a prominent Democrat and lawyer who helped draft the state\u2019s 2022 marijuana legalization referendum.",
      "An HHS spokesperson said the agency's downsizing, including cutting jobs and consolidating divisions, would save money and make the organization more efficient. As for the $11.4 billion in grant funding cuts, the spokesperson said, \u201cHHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a nonexistent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "The IRS has offered a similar rationale for its downsizing, saying it is making process improvements that will ultimately more efficiently serve the public.",
      "Musk said last year that Trump\u2019s budget cuts would cause a \u201ctemporary hardship\u201d that would soon put the economy on stronger footing.",
      "One local economic researcher said it remained unclear just how deep that hardship will be in Kansas City, including whether it will just slow growth or cause population losses.",
      "\u201cIt's a big burden that\u2019s being placed on a narrow group of people,\u201d said Frank Lenk, director of the Office of Economic Development at the Mid-America Regional Council, a nonprofit of city and county governments in the Kansas City region. \u201cIt will definitely take some of the steam out of the local economy.\"",
      "Trump has credited DOGE with helping end \u201cthe flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars,\u201d saving billions to help improve the nation\u2019s finances.",
      "The White House didn't respond to questions about Kansas City. But Trump said recently he would invite the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House to make up for a 2020 Super Bowl victory celebration that was canceled during the pandemic.",

      "VENICE, Italy -- Venice is charging day-trippers to the famed canal city an arrivals tax for the second year starting Friday, a measure to combat the overtourism that officials say is putting the city's UNESCO World Cultural Heritage status at risk.",
      "A UNESCO body decided against putting Venice on its list of cultural heritage sites deemed in danger after the tax was announced. But opponents of the day-tripper fee say it has done nothing to discourage visits.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at Venice\u2019s battle with overtourism by the numbers:",
      "The tax charged to visitors who are not overnighting in Venice to enter its historic center during the second year of the day-tripper tax. Visitors who download a QR code at least three days in advance will pay 5 euros \u2014 the same amount charged last year throughout the pilot program. But those who make last-minute plans will pay double. The QR code is required from 8:30 a.m. until 4 p.m. and is checked at entry points to the city, including the Santa Lucia train station, the Piazzale Roma bus depot and near St. Mark\u2019s Square.",
      "The number of days this year that day visitors to Venice will be charged a fee to enter the historic center. They include mostly weekends and holidays from April 18 to July 27. That is up from 29 last year. The new calendar covers entire weeks over key holidays and extends the weekend period to include Fridays.",
      "The amount in euros that the city of Venice took in during a 2024 pilot program for the tax. The city's top budget official, Michele Zuin, said last year the running costs for the new system ran to 2.7 million euros, overshooting the total fees collected. This year, Zuin projects a surplus of about 1 million euros to 1.5 million euros, which will be used to offset the cost of trash collection and other services for residents.",
      "The number of day-trippers who paid the tax in 2024. Officials say 8,000 day-trippers paid in advance to enter the city on Friday, among the 77,000 who have already registered so far to enter the city this year. Another 117,000 have registered for exemptions, which apply to anyone born in Venice, those paying property taxes in the city, studying or working in the historic center, or living in the wider Veneto region, among others.",
      "The average number of daily visitors on the first 11 days of 2024 that Venice charged day-trippers. That's about 10,000 people more than the number of tourists recorded on each of the three important holidays during the previous year. City council member Giovanni Andrea Martini, an opponent of the measure, said the figures show the project has not deterred visitors.",
      "The number of official residents in Venice\u2019s historic center composed of over 100 islands connected by footbridges and traversed by its famed canals. The population peaked at 174,000 in 1951, when Venice was home to thriving industries. The number shrank during Italy's postwar economic boom as residents moved to the mainland for more modern housing \u2014 including indoor plumbing which was lacking in Venice. It has been shrinking dramatically over recent decades as local industry lost traction, families sought mainland conveniences and housing prices rose. Activists also blame the \u201cmono-culture\u201d of tourism, which they say has emptied the city of basic services like shops for everyday goods and medical care.",
      "The number of beds for tourists in Venice\u2019s historic center, including 12,627 in the less regulated short-term rental market, according to April data from the Ocio housing activist group. The number of tourist beds surpassed the number of permanent residents in 2023, according to Ocio's monitor. Anyone staying in a hotel within the city limits, including on the mainland districts of Mestre and Marghera, pays a lodging tax and is therefore exempt from the day-tripper tax.",
      "The number of annual arrivals of both day-trippers and overnight guests roughly confirmed by cellphone data tracked from a Smart Control Room since 2020, according to city officials.",

      "\u201cWhat do you do if you don\u2019t support providing access to food to people who don\u2019t have it? Wouldn\u2019t this make your job easier?\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s absurd. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d",
      "Other food aid in the neighborhood has taken a hit at a time when demand is rising.",
      "At the Bishop Sullivan Center food pantry, hundreds of low-income families are getting fewer groceries in their monthly pickups after USDA halted $500 million worth of deliveries to food banks. That included a planned order for 41,000 cases of meat, dairy and other commodities to a bank serving Kansas City.",
      "\u201cIt just means giving families less food,\u201d said pantry director Christopher Lowrance, who said he\u2019s able to provide less chicken and other meat products. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",
      "The Kansas City Health Department\u2019s laboratory is badly in need of an upgrade, with equipment dating to when the building opened in the 1990s.",
      "One basement space is water damaged and rarely used. Another has equipment that is so inadequate that the city has to ship samples to a state laboratory 150 miles away, causing inefficiencies, agonizing waits for results and delayed response times.",
      "Kansas City\u2019s health director, Dr. Marvia Jones, made it a top priority to modernize the labs this year after studying their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her agency planned to use federal funding to purchase new microscopes and testing equipment.",
      "\u201cThat early disease detection allows you to do more rapid intervention, more rapid treatment, more rapid isolation,\u201d she said.",
      "But the funding for lab upgrades was abruptly eliminated last month as part of the Trump administration's $11.4 billion cancellation of federal grants to states for public health. That news \u201ccrushed\u201d the department's carefully laid plans, Jones said.",
      "Jones said the cuts, $3 million and counting for her department, mean the city will also have fewer vaccines to administer to low-income residents.",
      "\u201cIt would be a sad shame for us to be in a worse position than we were before the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had processed all of our lessons learned, and then now this happens.\u201d",
      "Amir Minoofar was surprised when two federal agencies notified him that they planned to vacate the office building he\u2019s owned for a decade in Overland Park, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City.",
      "Minoofar said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had recently agreed to extend its lease until 2029. The National Labor Relations Board, meanwhile, was paying month to month.",
      "Minoofar said the government initially notified him the agencies would be out of the building in August, part of a DOGE-led blitz of hundreds of lease cancellations that has been marked by errors and subsequent reversals.",
      "In the Kansas City metropolitan area, the government is moving to cancel 10 leases totaling 219,000 square feet that cost more than $4 million in annual rent, according to DOGE\u2019s online \u201cWall of Receipts.\u201d",
      "Minoofar said he was more recently told the agencies will likely have to stay past August and their departure date is now unclear. He said he may have to sell the building, which has an appraised value of $2.9 million, and take a loss because of the difficult office market.",
      "But he said he understands why the government would unload the space, which he said has often been sparsely used since the rise of telework during the pandemic.",
      "\u201cBusinesswise, it makes sense for government to cut costs,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people are going to be unhappy but it\u2019s a huge gigantic family and they need to take care of it. You cannot keep everybody happy.\u201d",
      "With liberal anger growing at Musk\u2019s role in the government, protesters have gathered Saturdays outside his Tesla dealership in Kansas City to denounce the cuts.",
      "State records show Tesla sales there have dropped amid calls for a boycott. Now, enough voter anger could even force the business to close.",
      "Organizers of a newly launched \u201cUnplug Musk\u201d initiative are seeking to use democracy to strike at the world\u2019s richest man by changing state law to ban car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers.",
      "They say they plan to soon begin gathering the 111,000 signatures of registered voters that they would need to put the change on the statewide ballot in November 2026. If approved by voters, it would force the closure of the Tesla showrooms in Kansas City and St. Louis.",
      "Missouri\u2019s governor, Republican Mike Kehoe, a former auto dealer himself, sponsored a 2014 bill when he was a state senator aimed at requiring manufacturers like Tesla to sell through local dealers. The bill passed the Senate but died in the House after Tesla lobbied against it. The referendum revives that plan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a soul in this country who\u2019s against trying to weed out government inefficiency but just taking a chain saw to people\u2019s lives and their health care is a ridiculous way to achieve that.

      "An HHS spokesperson said the agency's downsizing, including cutting jobs and consolidating divisions, would save money and make the organization more efficient. As for the $11.4 billion in grant funding cuts, the spokesperson said, \u201cHHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a nonexistent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",

      "Fifteen years after the Deepwater Horizon disaster off the Gulf Coast, the effects of the largest oil spill in U.S. history are still being felt",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Fifteen years after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded off the Gulf Coast, killing 11 and sending 134 million gallons (507.2 million liters) of crude gushing into the ocean, the effects of the nation's worst offshore oil spill are still being felt.",
      "Oil company BP paid billions of dollars in damages, propelling ambitious coastal restoration projects across five states. Yet cleanup workers and local residents who suffered health impacts they attribute to the oil spill have struggled to have their cases heard in court and few have received significant compensation.",
      "Conservation groups say the spill catalyzed innovative restoration work across the Gulf Coast, but are alarmed at the recent halt of a flagship land-creation project in Louisiana. As the Trump administration expands offshore oil and gas, they are concerned the best opportunities for rebuilding the Gulf Coast are slipping away.",
      "In the coastal community of Lafitte in southeast Louisiana, Tammy Gremillion is celebrating Easter Sunday, the anniversary of the April 20 spill, without her daughter. She remembers warning Jennifer against joining a cleanup crew tasked with containing the spill for BP.",
      "\"But I couldn\u2019t stop her \u2014 they were offering these kids lots of money,\u201d Gremillion said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know the dangers. They didn\u2019t do what they should have to protect these young people.\u201d",
      "Jennifer worked knee-deep in oil for months, returning home reeking of fumes, covered in black splotches and breaking out in rashes and suffering headaches. She also was exposed to Corexit, an EPA-approved chemical applied on and below the water to disperse oil, which has been linked to health problems.",
      "In 2020, Jennifer died of leukemia, a blood cancer that can be caused by exposure to oil.",
      "Gremillion, who broke down in tears as she recounted her daughter's death, is \u201c1,000% confident\u201d that exposure to toxins during the cleanup caused the cancer.",
      "She filed a lawsuit against BP in 2022, although the allegations have been difficult to establish in court. Gremillion's suit is one of a small number of cases still pending.",
      "An investigation by The Associated Press previously found all but a handful of roughly 4,800 lawsuits seeking compensation for health problems linked to the oil spill have been dismissed and only one has been settled.",
      "In a 2012 settlement, BP paid ill workers and coastal residents $67 million, but this amounted to no more than $1,300 each for nearly 80% of those seeking compensation.",
      "Attorneys from the Downs Law Group, representing Gremillion and around 100 others in cases against BP, say the company leveraged procedural technicalities to block victims from getting their day in court.",
      "BP declined to comment on pending litigation. In court filings, BP denied allegations that oil exposure caused health problems and attacked the credibility of medical experts brought by plaintiffs.",
      "The environmental impact was devastating, recalled PJ Hahn, who served on the frontlines as a southeast Louisiana coastal management official. He watched the oil eat away at barrier islands and marsh around his community in Plaquemines Parish until \u201cit would just crumble like a cookie in hot coffee, just break apart.\u201d",
      "Oyster beds suffocated, reefs were blanketed in chemicals and the fishing industry tanked. Pelicans diving for dead fish emerged from the contaminated waters smeared in a black sheen. Tens of thousands of seabirds and sea turtles were killed, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Since then, \u201csignificant progress\u201d has been made restoring Gulf habitats and ecosystems, according to The\u200b Natural Resource Damage Assessment Trustee Council, a group of state and federal agencies tasked with managing restoration funded by penalties levied against BP.",
      "The council says more than 300 restoration projects worth $5.38 billion have been approved in the Gulf of Mexico, which President Donald Trump renamed the Gulf of America. The projects include acquiring wetlands in Mississippi to protect nesting areas for birds, rebuilding reefs along Pensacola Bay in Florida and restoring around 4 square miles (11 square kilometers) of marsh in Lake Borgne near New Orleans.",
      "While a tragedy, the spill \"galvanized a movement \u2014 one that continues to push for a healthier, more resilient coast,\u201d said Simone Maloz, campaign director for Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a conservation coalition.",
      "The influx of billions of dollars in penalties paid by BP \"allowed us to think bigger, act faster and rely on science to guide large-scale solutions,\u201d she added.",
      "Yet what many conservationists see as the flagship of the restoration projects funded by the Deepwater Horizon disaster payout \u2014 an approximately $3 billion effort to divert sediment from the Mississippi River to rebuild 21 square miles (54 square kilometers) of land in southeast Louisiana \u2014 has stalled over concerns of its impact on the livelihoods of local communities and dolphin populations.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has said the project would \u201cbreak our culture\" by harming local oyster and shrimp fisheries due to the influx of freshwater. Earlier this month, his administration paused the project for 90 days, citing its high costs, and its future remains uncertain.",
      "The Trump administration is seeking to sell more offshore oil and gas leases, which the industry trade group American Petroleum Institute called \u201ca big step forward for American energy dominance.\u201d",
      "BP announced an oil discovery in the Gulf last week and plans more than 40 new wells in the next three years. The company told the AP it has improved safety standards and oversight.",
      "\u201cWe remain keenly aware that we must always put safety first,\u201d BP said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe have made many changes so that such an event should never happen again.\"",

      "Marijuana culture\u2019s high holiday known as 4/20 falls this year on Easter, as well as the last day of Passover",
      "Marijuana culture's high holiday, known as 4/20, falls this year on Easter Sunday, as well as the last day of Passover, meaning cannabis fans can celebrate in some unusual ways, including an \u201cEaster nug hunt\u201d in Los Angeles, kosher-style THC gummies in New York and a \u201cblaze and praise\u201d drag brunch in Portland, Oregon.",
      "\u201cIt seemed appropriate with egg prices today that we'd be searching for something else,\u201d said Brett Davis, who runs the marijuana tour company Weed Bus Los Angeles and organized the \u201cEaster nug hunt.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a look at 4/20\u2019s history and how it's being celebrated this year:",
      "The origins of the date, and the term \u201c420\u201d generally, were long murky.",
      "Some claimed it referred to a police code for marijuana possession or was derived from Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cRainy Day Women No. 12 & 35,\u201d with its refrain of \u201cEverybody must get stoned,\u201d 420 being the product of 12 times 35.",
      "But the prevailing explanation is that it started in the 1970s with a group of bell-bottomed buddies from San Rafael High School, in California\u2019s Marin County north of San Francisco, who called themselves \u201cthe Waldos.\u201d",
      "A friend\u2019s brother was afraid of getting busted for a patch of cannabis he was growing in the woods at nearby Point Reyes, so he drew a map and gave the teens permission to harvest the crop, the story goes.",
      "During fall 1971, at 4:20 p.m., just after classes and football practice, the group would meet up at the school\u2019s statue of chemist Louis Pasteur, smoke a joint and head out to search for the weed patch. They never did find it, but their private lexicon \u2014 \u201c420 Louie\u201d and later just \u201c420\u201d \u2014 would take on a life of its own.",
      "The Waldos saved postmarked letters and other artifacts from the 1970s referencing \u201c420,\u201d which they now keep in a bank vault, and when the Oxford English Dictionary added the term in 2017, it cited some of those documents as the earliest recorded uses.",
      "A brother of one of the Waldos was a close friend of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh, as Lesh once confirmed in an interview with the Huffington Post, now HuffPost. The Waldos began hanging out in the band\u2019s circle, and the slang term spread.",
      "Fast-forward to the early 1990s: Steve Bloom, a reporter for the cannabis magazine High Times, was at a Dead show when he was handed a flyer urging people to \u201cmeet at 4:20 on 4/20 for 420-ing in Marin County at the Bolinas Ridge sunset spot on Mt. Tamalpais.\u201d High Times published it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenon,\u201d one of the Waldos, Steve Capper, now 69, once told The Associated Press. \u201cMost things die within a couple years, but this just goes on and on. It\u2019s not like someday somebody\u2019s going to say, \u2018OK, Cannabis New Year\u2019s is on June 23rd now.\u2019\u201d",
      "While the Waldos came up with the term, the people who made the flier that was distributed at the Dead show \u2014 effectively turning 4/20 into a holiday \u2014 remain unknown.",
      "With weed, naturally.",
      "In New York City, the cannabis brand Tokin' Jew is advertising a kosher-style THC gummy line, \u201cTokin' Chews,\u201d designed to meet dietary restrictions for Passover.",
      "Davis said he expected 300 people to partake in the West Hollywood Easter nug scavenger hunt this weekend, aided by a mobile app leading them through participating dispensaries, trivia challenges and \u201cstoner activities.\u201d There is a $500 cash prize.",
      "In Portland, Bar Carlo is hosting the \u201cblaze and praise\u201d drag brunch. Cannabis consumption isn't allowed onsite \u2014 \"Please blaze before you arrive or go for a walk in the neighborhood in between performances,\" the event listing reads \u2014 but there will be a door-prize gift basket from a local dispensary.",
      "Bar owner Melinda Archuleta said the brunch is a dry run for hosting Pride month events in June. She herself doesn't care much for marijuana, but as a Mexican American who has been influenced by Catholicism, she is interested in seeing the two cultures melded \u201cin a cheeky way.\u201d",
      "\"I'm really looking forward to seeing how the queens do it,\" Archuleta said. \u201cWe\u2019ve obviously given them carte blanche to do whatever they want \u2014 it's 21 and up \u2014 so it doesn't matter if it's sacrilegious or borderline offensive.\"",
      "There are bigger celebrations, too, including the Mile High 420 Festival in Denver and one put on by SweetWater Brewing in Atlanta. Hippie Hill in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park historically has attracted massive crowds, but the gathering was canceled for a second straight year, with organizers citing a lack of financial sponsorship and city budget cuts.",
      "Just north of the Bay Area, Lagunitas Brewing in Petaluma, California, releases its \u201cWaldos\u2019 Special Ale\u201d every year on 4/20 in partnership with the term\u2019s coiners.",
      "4/20 also has become a big industry event, with vendors gathering to try each other\u2019s wares.",
      "There are 24 states that allow recreational marijuana and 14 others allowing it for medical purposes. But the movement recently has suffered some setbacks, with voters in Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota deciding not to adopt legalization measures last November.",
      "Several states also have cracked down on intoxicating products derived from hemp, which have been widely sold even in prohibition states thanks to a loophole in the federal Farm Bill.",
      "Marijuana remains illegal under federal law. As a candidate, President Donald Trump said he would vote for Florida\u2019s amendment and signaled support for reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a process started by the Biden administration.",
      "But his administration has not indicated cannabis policy is a priority. A fact sheet released by the White House last month complained that marijuana decriminalization in Washington, D.C., was an example of \u201cfailed policies\u201d that \u201copened the door to disorder.\u201d",
      "A bipartisan group of senators last week reintroduced legislation that would ensure states can adopt their own cannabis policies and remove certain financial hurdles for the industry, such as letting entities deduct business expenses on their taxes.",
      "Charles Alovisetti, a lawyer with the cannabis industry law firm Vicente LLP, said he hopes the administration will push forward with marijuana reform at the federal level, saying \u201cit does align with some of their policy objectives \u2014 namely reducing criminal activity, or cartel activity.\u201d",
      "He also encouraged advocates to keep pushing, noting some measures such as improving banking access for marijuana businesses might pass as part of larger legislative packages.",
      "\u201cYou continue speaking up, even if the political momentum isn't there,\u201d Alovisetti said. \u201cIt's only possible if you stay in everyone's ear.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Everglades is more than just swamps, fan boats and alligators and restoration efforts impact more than the land between Florida\u2019s east and west coasts",
      "ISLAMORADA, Fla. -- The Everglades is more than just swamps, fan boats and alligators and restoration efforts impact more than the land between Florida's east and west coasts.",
      "Florida Bay, a body of water located between the southern end of mainland Florida and the Florida Keys, makes up about a third of Everglades National Park.",
      "High salt levels during dry periods can have fatal consequences for the plants and animals living in the region, though experts are hopeful an early rain season this year will prevent a massive sea grass die-off like those experienced in the past.",
      "Steve Davis, chief science officer with The Everglades Foundation, called Florida Bay the estuary of the Everglades, which is actually a giant, slow-moving river starting around Orlando and running toward the southern end of the Florida peninsula.",
      "\u201cWhat that meant for Florida Bay was that during wet years, there\u2019s enough water getting into the bay to keep the salinities within that optimal salinity range,\" Davis said. \u201cBut when we run into an average-to-dry year or a drought year, it meant that salinity levels in the bay would get so high that it could be detrimental to the health of the seagrasses and the other species that depend on that habitat.\u201d",
      "Florida Bay doesn\u2019t have particularly strong tides, meaning water can sit in the bay for up to a year. When evaporating seawater isn't replaced by water from the Everglades, bay salinity levels can double normal ocean salinity, Davis explained.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s when we really run into some problems with the health of the habitats down here in the bay,\u201d he said.",
      "The last major sea grass die-off occurred in 2015. Xavier Figueredo, a recreational boat captain with Bay and Reef Company, said he was working in the area when the massive die-off hit about 40,000 acres (16,000 hectares).",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t see the water. All you see is dead grass floating on top,\u201d Figueredo said. \u201cAnd it smells like sulfur, like rotting eggs. As the die-off continued, more of the ecosystem was affected, the fish were affected.\u201d",
      "Even with more than 40% of Florida under drought conditions, Davis said he is not especially worried yet about another sea-grass die-off. Salt levels in the bay are already comparatively lower this year than they were in 2015.",
      "Davis said that is at least partially thanks to a massive project that elevated more than 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) of the Tamiami Trail, a roadway built in 1928 that runs through the Everglades from Miami to Naples before heading north to Tampa.",
      "The route was essentially a giant dam preventing water from flowing south, but replacing the roadway with two long bridges, completed in 2013 and 2019, unblocked the so-called river of grass.",
      "\u201cMonths of inflow across Tamiami Trail have helped to moderate salinities,\" Davis said.",
      "The other significant advantage Florida Bay has this year compared to 2015 is the forecast of an early wet season rather than a delayed wet season, Davis said.",
      "While elevating Tamiami Trail already has created significant benefit for the Everglades and Florida Bay, scientists are counting on a massive restoration project, the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir, to address decades-old water problems throughout Florida.",
      "The $3.9 billion project will create a reservoir and wetland to store and clean polluted water from Lake Okeechobee in central Florida before it\u2019s discharged into the southern Everglades. This also should decrease the amount of polluted water being sent to Florida\u2019s east and west coasts.",
      "Davis called the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir \u201cthe game changer for freshwater flow restoration.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now are just the benefits of the plumbing, the infrastructure that helps to get all that water into the park,\u201d he said. \"But once we\u2019re able to flow those larger volumes of water south, we\u2019re going to see system-wide improvement all the way down into Florida Bay.\u201d",
      "Everglades restoration is not only tied to Florida's ecological future but its economic future, said Paul Hindsley, the Everglades Foundation chief economist.",
      "\u201cFor every dollar of investment in restoration, we\u2019re receiving $4 in economic benefits,\" Hindsley said.",
      "Economic benefits include adding to the residential and industrial water supply, reducing extreme events from drought such as fires and reducing the risk of flooding from heavy precipitation, Hindsley said.",
      "The Everglades also provide over $5 billion a year in reduced risk for costs associated with National Flood Insurance Program claims. Meanwhile, South Florida\u2019s mangroves and reefs play an important role in reducing the impacts of storm surge.",
      "\u201cProtecting the environment is protecting the wealth of Floridians,\" Hindsley said.",

      "Nearly six years after a man fatally shot 23 people in a racist attack targeting Hispanic shoppers at a Walmart in Texas near the U.S.-Mexico border, the gunman's criminal case is set to come to a close",
      "DALLAS -- The long-running criminal case against a Texas gunman who killed 23 people in a racist attack targeting Hispanic shoppers at a Walmart in El Paso in 2019 is on the verge of coming to a close.",
      "Patrick Crusius, 26, is expected to plead guilty Monday to capital murder and receive a sentence of life in prison with no possibility of parole for the massacre near the U.S.-Mexico border. El Paso County District Attorney James Montoya said last month he was offering Crusius a plea deal and that he wouldn't face the death penalty on the state charge.",
      "Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life sentences in federal court after pleading guilty in 2023 to hate crime and weapons charges. Under the Biden administration, federal prosecutors also took the death penalty off the table.",
      "Crusius is expected to serve his time in a state prison. Crusius initially was arrested by local authorities and will enter the custody of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice if he is sentenced on the state charges, a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons said.",
      "Here's what to know about the deadly attack on Aug. 3, 2019, and its aftermath:",
      "Crusius was 21 years old when authorities say he drove for more than 10 hours from his home in suburban Dallas to El Paso and opened fire at the Walmart, which is popular with shoppers from Mexico and the U.S.",
      "Prosecutors have said Crusius was wearing earmuffs that muted the sound of gunfire when he began shooting people in the parking lot.",
      "He then moved inside the store and continued firing an AK-style rifle, cornering shoppers at a bank near the entrance where nine were killed before shooting at the checkout area and people in aisles.",
      "Exiting Walmart, he fired on a passing car, killing an elderly man and wounding his wife.",
      "Crusius was apprehended shortly after and confessed to officers who stopped him at an intersection, according to police.",
      "In a posting to an online message board just before the massacre, Crusius, a white, community-college dropout, said the shooting was \u201cin response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d He said Hispanics were going to take over the government and economy.",
      "On social media, he appeared consumed by the nation\u2019s immigration debate, tweeting #BuildtheWall and posts praising the hard-line border policies of Republican President Donald Trump, who was in his first term at the time.",
      "After the shooting, Crusius told officers that he had targeted Mexicans.",
      "Joe Spencer, one of Crusius\u2019 attorneys, on Thursday described Crusius as \u201can individual with a broken brain.\u201d Spencer said Crusius has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, which can be marked by hallucinations, delusions and mood swings.",
      "The people who were killed ranged in age from a 15-year-old high school athlete to grandparents. They included immigrants and Mexican nationals who had crossed the U.S. border on routine shopping trips.",
      "They included Jordan Anchondo and Andre Anchondo, who were killed while shopping with their 2-month-old child, Paul, who survived. Authorities have said Jordan Anchondo shielded the baby from gunfire while her husband shielded them both.",
      "Guillermo \u201cMemo\u201d Garcia and his wife Jessica Coca Garcia were fundraising for their daughter's soccer team in the parking lot when they were both shot. She suffered leg wounds but recovered. He died from his injuries nearly nine months after the shooting, raising the death toll to 23.",
      "A week after the shooting, Coca Garcia rose from her wheelchair to give a speech across the road from the county jail where Crusius was being held.",
      "\u201cRacism is something I always wanted to think didn\u2019t exist,\" she said. \"Obviously, it does.\u201d",
      "Montoya said he decided to offer the plea deal because a majority of victims' relatives were eager for the case to be resolved. He acknowledged not all the families agreed.",
      "Montoya, a Democrat, said he supports the death penalty and believes Crusius deserves it, but the case might not have gone to trial until 2028 if his office had continued seeking the death penalty.",
      "When Montoya took office in January, he became the fourth district attorney to oversee the case in nearly six years. One of his predecessors resigned in 2022 under pressure over her handling of the case. He said the pandemic also caused delays.",
      "Stephanie Melendez, whose father, David Johnson, died shielding his wife and granddaughter, said she initially wanted Crusius to get the death penalty but as the case dragged on she wanted it to end.",
      "\u201cI just wanted it to be over,\" Melendez said. \"I was done reliving everything. I was done going to court for hours. I was done with the briefings that happened after that would last hours and it was just the same talk over and over again. We were just ready to be done with it all because, honestly, it\u2019s like reliving the trauma over and over again.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Three former senior advisers to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth decried on Saturday what they called \u201cbaseless attacks\u201d after each was escorted from the Pentagon in an expanding probe on information leaks.",
      "Dan Caldwell, a Hegseth aide; Colin Carroll, chief of staff to Deputy Defense Secretary Stephen Feinberg; and Darin Selnick, Hegseth\u2019s deputy chief of staff were among four officials in Hegseth\u2019s inner circle who were ousted this past week.",
      "While the three initially had been placed on leave pending the investigation, a joint statement shared by Caldwell on X said the three were \u201cincredibly disappointed by the manner in which our service at the Department of Defense ended. Unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door.\u201d",

      "Former Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot also announced he was resigning this week. The Pentagon said, however, that Ullyot was asked to resign.",
      "The upheaval comes less than 100 days into the Trump administration where the Pentagon has found itself frequently in the epicenter of controversial moves \u2014 from firings of senior military and civilian staff to broad edicts to purge content that promoted diversity, equity or inclusion. That led to images or other online content of heroes like the Tuskegee Airmen and Jackie Robinson being temporarily removed from the military's websites, causing public uproar.",
      "Last month, Hegseth announced that the Pentagon\u2019s intelligence and law enforcement arms were investigating what it says are leaks of national security information following reports that Elon Musk was set to receive a classified briefing on potential war plans with China.",

CQ Brown; Chief of Naval Operations Lisa Franchetti; National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command director Gen. Tim Haugh; and Vice Adm.

    "story": [
      "Ten years ago Saturday, Freddie Gray died from spinal injuries sustained during transport in a Baltimore police van and the city was thrust into a national debate over police brutality against Black Americans",
      "BALTIMORE -- It was almost instinctual for Ray Kelly to jump into action when he heard about a group of high school students clashing with police. He wanted to help protect the kids and de-escalate things, but instead, he watched his neighborhood burn.",
      "Unrest broke out after Freddie Gray died from spinal injuries sustained during transport in a police van in April 2015. The protesters stormed through majority-Black west Baltimore, setting police cars ablaze and looting businesses. They were fighting the generations of oppression experienced by Black Americans, from racist housing policies and crumbling schools to limited job opportunities, rampant gun violence and poor living conditions.",
      "A community activist from Gray\u2019s neighborhood, Kelly had focused on police accountability for years. As federal investigators launched a probe into the Baltimore Police Department and local prosecutors charged the officers involved, he doubled down in calling for stronger oversight at a time of growing national outrage over police brutality.",
      "Ten years later, his ongoing efforts illustrate Baltimore\u2019s progress \u2014 and lack thereof.",
      "Among the positive changes, Kelly said, there are more mechanisms to address police misconduct and hold officers accountable. Homicides and shootings are trending downward after a prolonged surge that began in the wake of Gray\u2019s death. And while west Baltimore still faces widespread poverty and neglect, he said, at least elected officials are paying more attention.",
      "\u201cPeople have to hear us out, because there is now this possibility that we can organize and elevate our voices,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI think Freddie Gray\u2019s death put that in motion.\u201d",
      "But progress is often painfully slow and woefully insufficient. Meanwhile city leaders face new obstacles from the Trump administration\u2019s escalating attacks on civil rights and diversity initiatives.",
      "For Gray\u2019s family, a decade has passed since their private loss played out on national news.",
      "Joined by the mayor and other dignitaries Saturday morning, his twin sister Fredricka laid a wreath of flowers near the site of his arrest, marking the anniversary of when he died in the hospital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still justice for Freddie Gray,\u201d she said, repeating what became a rallying cry in 2015. \u201cTen years now.\u201d",
      "Baltimore has a long history of mistreating its Black residents. In 1910, city leaders enacted the country\u2019s first residential segregation ordinance restricting African American homeowners to certain blocks.",
      "Kelly grew up during the height of the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and the national war on drugs, when police routinely conducted \u201cstreet sweeps\u201d or mass arrests in west Baltimore. When he started selling drugs to support himself during high school, the police were just another obstacle in an already uphill battle. He later struggled with addiction and served time in prison.",
      "After coming home in the early 2000s, Kelly started working with a neighborhood advocacy group to improve public safety. That put him in a unique position when the U.S. Department of Justice launched its probe of city police: Knowing residents would be wary about cooperating with federal investigators, Kelly helped make introductions and encouraged people to participate.",
      "\u201cIt was a gamble,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really what this community does.\u201d",
      "But the gamble paid off. The investigation uncovered longstanding patterns of excessive force, unlawful arrests and discriminatory policing practices, especially against Black people.",
      "The findings resulted in a 2017 consent decree mandating a series of reforms for the department, which promised to overhaul its policies and training.",
      "Since then, progress is inching along.",
      "The agency celebrated a milestone this week when a federal judge terminated two of the consent decree\u2019s 17 sections after finding full and sustained compliance \u2014 including with rules for transporting people in police vans. Gray was handcuffed, shackled and transported without a seatbelt as officers repeatedly ignored his calls for medical attention.",
      "Department leaders say large-scale change is happening, though not overnight. Officers have increased foot patrols, decreased low-level arrests and even undergone training on emotional regulation. They\u2019re less likely to use force when taking people into custody, and they\u2019ve contributed to historic reductions in homicides by partnering with service providers to address the root causes of gun violence.",
      "Police Commissioner Richard Worley said that over the course of his career, he\u2019s watched the culture of policing shift from \u201cwarriors to guardians.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, many Baltimore residents still don\u2019t trust the police to act with compassion and integrity. They don\u2019t believe the department has undergone a significant cultural change.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to take years and years to redefine the police department in the eyes of the community,\u201d U.S. District Judge James Bredar said during Thursday\u2019s consent decree hearing. \u201cThis work is critical, even if it doesn\u2019t bear fruit immediately.\u201d",
      "Gray, 25, was arrested near his home in west Baltimore\u2019s Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood, a once-thriving community that had fallen into disrepair.",
      "In its heyday, nearby Pennsylvania Avenue was a Black entertainment district with renowned jazz clubs, upscale shops and vibrant nightlife. Its cultural artifacts include the childhood home of Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the Supreme Court, and a bronze statue of jazz legend Billie Holiday, who also had roots in west Baltimore.",
      "A confluence of factors contributed to its decline, including urban flight and chronic disinvestment. Some businesses left after unrest following the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "Open-air drug markets moved in, and over-policing became a common complaint from residents. So when Gray was violently taken into custody after making eye contact with officers and running away, that longstanding frustration boiled over. Officials responded to the 2015 protests by bringing in the Maryland National Guard and imposing a citywide curfew.",
      "Many residents celebrated when prosecutors later announced criminal charges against the six officers involved, but none were convicted.",
      "In the meantime, political leaders visited Sandtown and pledged to invest in housing, youth programs and more. Those big promises have largely failed to materialize.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still the same damn place with the same damn issues,\u201d Kelly said, gazing down the street outside the former church rectory that houses his advocacy organization, the Citizens Policing Project. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot of talk, but this is what we see.\u201d",
      "When the city closed the neighborhood\u2019s recreation center in 2021, Sandtown youth were basically left with nowhere to go, said 17-year-old Ryeheen Watson, whose childhood unfolded in the shadow of Gray\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cIt was like, nothing good comes for our community,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re starting as an underdog, there\u2019s nowhere to go but up.\u201d",
      "The second Trump administration will likely create even more challenges for communities like Sandtown as the White House slashes federal initiatives aimed at advancing racial equity.",
      "Baltimore attorney Billy Murphy, who represented the Gray family, said that while Black people continue fighting for their collective future, a resurgence of white supremacism is infecting national politics.",
      "\u201cWhere are we today? That\u2019s where we are,\u201d Murphy said at a recent event commemorating Gray\u2019s death. \u201cWe are heading backwards.\u201d",
      "But at least on the local level, political discourse now includes more progressive Black voices, said Dayvon Love, director of public policy for the grassroots think tank Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle. In his view, Gray\u2019s death was a turning point.",
      "\u201cThat has advanced our ability to advocate unapologetically for Black people in ways that before the uprising were shut out,\u201d Love said.",
      "Mayor Brandon Scott says his administration is achieving long-awaited progress by investing in historically neglected neighborhoods, including a $15 million plan to renovate Sandtown\u2019s recreation center and upgrades to Gilmor Homes, the public housing complex where Gray was arrested.",
      "However, Scott said in an interview, \u201cWe\u2019re not celebrating here, because the work is not complete.\u201d",
      "For Kelly, discussions of politics and progress often miss the point by failing to acknowledge Gray himself, the young man from west Baltimore who died after a tragic encounter with police a decade ago.",
      "Instead of marking the anniversary of his death, Kelly suggested, perhaps it\u2019s his birthday that should be celebrated: Aug. 16, 1989.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Campus mentors. Move-in events. Scholarships. Diversity offices that made them feel welcome on predominantly white campuses.",
      "As U.S. colleges pull back on diversity, equity and inclusion practices, students of color say they are starting to lose all of these things and more.",
      "The full scope of campus DEI rollbacks is still emerging as colleges respond to the Trump administration\u2019s orders against diversity practices. But students at some schools said early cuts are chipping away at the sense of community that helped open the door to higher education.",
      "\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re going back. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it,\u201d said Breeana-Iris Rosario, a junior at the University of Michigan, which is closing its DEI office and scrapping a campus-wide inclusion plan. \u201cIt\u2019s like our voices aren\u2019t being heard.\u201d",
      "The retreat from DEI has been building for years, driven by Republican-led states that have ordered public colleges to close DEI offices and eliminate programs. But it has accelerated under President Donald Trump and his threats to cut federal funding.",
      "Trump's administration escalated the battle when it suggested in a letter to Harvard University that the school should lose its nonprofit status for defying federal orders, including a demand to eliminate DEI \u201cto the satisfaction of the federal government.\u201d",
      "At Michigan, students have been told the casualties include orientation events for new Latino, Arab and Asian American students, along with the LEAD Scholars program, a financial aid award for Black, Latino and Native American students.",
      "Coming from a low-income part of Detroit, Rosario said winning the scholarship cemented her decision to attend Michigan. She later met some of her best friends at a move-in event for Latino students called Alma. Losing those programs, she fears, could reinforce a sense of isolation among Hispanic students, who make up 6% of the school's undergraduates.",
      "\u201cIt would be hard to find my community if I didn\u2019t have access to these resources,\" she said.",
      "A February memo from the Education Department directed schools and colleges to eliminate race from any decision-making around hiring, admissions, housing, financial aid and student life. It warned violators could lose access to federal money.",
      "Dozens of universities have since come under investigation, all while the Trump administration freezes billions of dollars at Harvard and other colleges accused of defying orders on campus antisemitism and transgender athletes.",
      "Michigan was among the first to make major DEI rollbacks, and others have followed to avoid federal scrutiny. Others have rebranded DEI offices and scrubbed the term from websites, and others still are standing firm in support of DEI.",
      "At Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, officials cited the federal orders when they moved to close the campus DEI office last month.",
      "\u201cIt is clear we must be in compliance with them to receive the federal funding that is critical to our present and future,\u201d said Eric Kaler, Case\u2019s president, in a campus message.",
      "Kaler said the office will be replaced by an Office for Campus Enrichment and Engagement, though it\u2019s unclear what that will entail. The private university receives about $250 million a year in federal research funding, 16% of its total revenue, according to university data.",
      "Justen Pippens said the DEI office was like a second home on campus. The junior called it a \u201cstress-free zone\u201d where he could get personal and academic guidance. He grew so close with one staff member that he came to know her as Auntie. He said it\u2019s unclear whether those employees will have jobs at the new office.",
      "Case also is halting its Envision Weekend, an orientation event for underrepresented students. Pippens said it\u2019s a setback for him and other Black students, who make up just 6% of undergraduates at Case.",
      "\u201cNow,\" he said, \u201cwe no longer have our central support systems on campus.\u201d",

      "\u201cDEI is done at the University of Virginia,\u201d Youngkin said in a statement, calling it a shift toward \u201cmerit-based opportunity.\u201d",
      "Tyler English, a senior at UVA, said students have been told scholarships and graduate programs focused on minority students are being scaled back or eliminated. Among other changes, a student group called Men of Color, Honor and Ambition is replacing the word \u201ccolor\u201d with \u201ccharacter,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor a portion of us, we now question whether our identities and voices are truly valued in this space,\u201d said English, a member of the campus\u2019 Black Student Alliance.",
      "University spokesperson Brian Coy wouldn't provide details on DEI rollbacks and said he couldn't confirm changes to scholarships.",
      "The government\u2019s anti-DEI campaign is being challenged in court by opponents who say it offers little clarity on exactly which practices are outlawed, leaving schools to weed out anything that could be construed as DEI.",
      "As a result of the vague directives, \"those who are advocating against this work are getting a higher return on their investment than they should,\u201d said Paulette Granberry Russell, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education.",
      "Yet opponents are pressing the White House to go further. Christopher Rufo, a conservative strategist who has fought DEI, said the government should root out DEI using tools that forced desegregation during the Civil Rights Movement.",
      "\u201cDEI is a violation of the Civil Rights Act,\u201d Rufo said on X. \u201cAny publicly funded institution that continues to practice DEI should face a federal investigation, consent decree, termination of funds, and loss of nonprofit status. If that doesn\u2019t work, send in the 101st Airborne.\u201d",
      "In Michigan, the rollbacks are targeting programs that aimed to preserve racial diversity after the state banned affirmative action in 2006, including the LEAD program.",
      "University of Michigan officials declined to discuss changes, but a campus message from President Santa Ono said the school will find other ways to support students, including an expansion of scholarships for low-income students.",

      "At least $1.6 million in federal funds for projects meant to capture and digitize stories of the systemic abuse of generations of Indigenous children in boarding schools at the hands of the U.S. government have been slashed due to federal funding cuts under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "The cuts are just a fraction of the grants canceled by the National Endowment for the Humanities in recent weeks as part of the Trump administration\u2019s deep cost-cutting effort across the federal government. But coming on the heels of a major federal boarding school investigation by the previous administration and an apology by then-President Joe Biden, they illustrate a seismic shift.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re looking to \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 then I think it should start with the truth about the true American history,\u201d said Deborah Parker, CEO of the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.",
      "The coalition lost more than $282,000 as a result of the cuts, halting its work to digitize more than 100,000 pages of boarding school records for its database. Parker, a citizen of the Tulalip Tribes in Washington state, said Native Americans nationwide depend on the site to find loved ones who were taken or sent to these boarding schools.",
      "Searching that database last year, Roberta \u201cBirdie\u201d Sam, a member of Tlingit & Haida, was able to confirm that her grandmother had been at a boarding school in Alaska. She also discovered that around a dozen cousins, aunts and uncles had also been at a boarding school in Oregon, including one who died there. She said the knowledge has helped her with healing.",
      "\u201cI understand why our relationship has been the way it has been. And that\u2019s been a great relief for myself,\" she said. \"I\u2019ve spent a lot of years very disconnected from my family, wondering what happened. And now I know \u2014 some of it anyways.\u201d",
      "An April 2 letter to the healing coalition that was signed by Michael McDonald, acting chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, says the \u201cgrant no longer effectuates the agency\u2019s needs and priorities.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press left messages by phone and email for the National Endowment for the Humanities. White House officials and the Office of Management and Budget also did not respond Friday to an email requesting comment.",
      "For 150 years the U.S. removed Indigenous children from their homes and sent them away to the schools, where they were stripped of their cultures, histories and religions, and beaten for speaking their native languages.",
      "At least 973 Native American children died at government-funded boarding schools, according to an Interior Department investigation launched by former Interior Secretary Deb Haaland. Both the report and independent researchers say the actual number was much higher.",
      "The forced assimilation policy officially ended with the enactment of the Indian Child Welfare Act in 1978. But the government never fully investigated the boarding school system until the Biden administration.",
      "In October, Biden apologized for the government's creation of the schools and the policies that supported them.",
      "Haaland, a Laguna Pueblo citizen who's running for governor in New Mexico, described the recent cuts as the latest step in the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cpattern of hiding the full story of our country.\u201d But she said they can't erase the extensive work already done.",
      "\u201cThey cannot undo the healing communities felt as they told their stories at our events to hear from survivors and descendants,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThey cannot undo the investigation that brings this dark chapter of our history to light. They cannot undo the relief Native people felt when President Biden apologized on behalf of the United States.\u201d",
      "Among the grants terminated earlier this month was $30,000 for a project between the Koahnic Broadcast Corporation and Alaska Native Heritage Center to record and broadcast oral histories of elders in Alaska. Koahnic received an identical letter from McDonald.",
      "Benjamin Jacuk, the Alaska Native Heritage Center\u2019s director of Indigenous research, said the news came around the same time they lost about $100,000 through a Institute of Museum and Library Services grant for curating a boarding school exhibit.",
      "\u201cThis is a story that for all of us, we weren\u2019t able to really hear because it was so painful or for multitudes of reasons,\u201d said Jacuk, a citizen of Kenaitze Indian Tribe. \"And so it\u2019s really important right now to be able to record these stories that our elders at this point are really opening up to being able to tell.\u201d",
      "Former Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs Bryan Newland described the cuts as frustrating, especially given the size of the grants.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not even a drop in the ocean when it comes to the federal budget,\u201d said Newland, a citizen of the Bay Mills Indian Community (Ojibwe). \u201cAnd so it\u2019s hard to argue that this is something that\u2019s really promoting government efficiency or saving taxpayer funds.\u201d",
      "In April 2024, the National Endowment for the Humanities announced that it was awarding $411,000 to more than a dozen tribal nations and organizations working to illustrate the impact of these boarding schools. More than half of those awards have since been terminated.",
      "The grant cuts were documented by the non-profit organization National Humanities Alliance.",

      "When he was growing up, his mother used to put soap in his mouth when he said a bad word. He said he learned through the site that she experienced that punishment beginning when she was 6-years-old in a boarding school in Washington state when she would speak her language.",
      "\u201cShe didn\u2019t talk about it that much,\" he said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to talk about it either. It was too traumatic.\u201d",

      "It's the first major, traditional theme park to open in Florida since 1999, when Universal Islands of Adventure debuted, though Universal opened a themed Orlando water park, Volcano Bay, in 2017. The addition of Epic Universe brings the total number of parks at the Florida resort to four, including Universal Studios.",
      "The opening also raises the stakes in Universal's competition with crosstown rival Walt Disney World for a greater share of Orlando's annual influx of 74 million tourists.",
      "Universal officials also describe Epic Universe as the company's most technologically advanced theme park. For example, it uses a facial recognition system for ride express lines.",
      "Universal's owner, Comcast NBCUniversal, also announced plans this month for its first Universal-branded theme park and resort in Europe, at a location north of London.

      "Thirty years after the deadliest homegrown attack in U.S. history, former President Bill Clinton has returned to Oklahoma City for a remembrance ceremony",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Thirty years after the deadliest homegrown attack in U.S. history, former President Bill Clinton returned to Oklahoma City on Saturday to remember the people who were killed and comfort those affected by the bombing.",
      "Clinton was president on April 19, 1995, when a truck bomb exploded, destroying a nine-story federal building in downtown Oklahoma City. He delivered the keynote address at a remembrance ceremony near the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum.",
      "Clinton, now 78, was widely praised for how he helped the city grapple with its grief in the wake of the bombing, which killed 168 people, including 19 children. He says it was a day in his presidency that he will never forget.",
      "\u201cI still remember as if it were 30 minutes ago, coming here with Hillary to that memorial service and saying: \u2018You have lost too much, but you have not lost everything. You have certainly not lost America, and we will be with you for as many tomorrows as it takes,\u2019\u201d Clinton said, recalling his first visit to Oklahoma City just days after the bombing, when he spoke at a memorial service for the for the victims. \u201cI do think we've kept that commitment.\u201d",
      "Clinton has visited the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum numerous times in the years since the bombing and delivered speeches on major anniversaries.",
      "On Saturday, Clinton also cautioned about the polarizing nature of modern-day politics and how such divisiveness can lead to violence, as it did 30 years ago. He said there is much the nation can learn from the \u201cOklahoma Standard,\u201d a term coined to reference the city's response to the bombing by uniting in service, honor and kindness.",
      "\u201cToday, Oklahoma City, America needs you,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish to goodness every American could just see life unfold here, hearing these stories.\u201d",
      "Other speakers included former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and former Oklahoma City Mayor Ron Norick, who were in office when the bombing occurred. Family members of some of those killed in the bombing read the 168 names of those killed in the attack.",
      "Saturday's ceremony was originally scheduled to take place on the grounds of the memorial but was moved inside an adjacent church because of heavy rains.",
      "After the ceremony, a procession of bagpipe players from the Oklahoma City Fire Department led many of those in attendance across the street to the outdoor memorial built on the grounds where the federal building once stood. The memorial includes a museum, a reflecting pool and 168 empty chairs of glass, bronze and stone etched with the names of those killed. Nineteen of the chairs are smaller than the others to represent the children killed.",
      "Among the memorial's top missions is to help people understand the senselessness of political violence and teach a new generation about the impact of the bombing, said Kari Watkins, the memorial's president and CEO.",
      "\u201cWe knew when we built this place we would some day reach a generation of people who weren't born or who didn't remember the story,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cI think now, not just kids are coming through more and more, but teachers who are teaching those kids.\u201d",

      "After a deadly shooting at Florida State University, questions are emerging about how the stepson of a beloved sheriff\u2019s deputy tasked with school safety at a middle school became the accused gunman",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Amid the abandoned chemistry notes and other debris left behind after a deadly shooting at Florida State University are lingering questions about how the stepson of a beloved sheriff\u2019s deputy tasked with school safety at a middle school became the accused gunman.",
      "Political science student Phoenix Ikner was a long-standing member of a sheriff\u2019s office youth advisory council and was steeped in the family-like culture of the agency. When officers rushed to the university\u2019s student union on reports of gunfire, authorities say it was the 20-year-old who used his stepmother\u2019s former service weapon to open fire, killing two men and wounding six others.",
      "As people fled in terror, Ikner was shot and taken into custody. He invoked his right not to speak to investigators, and his motive remains unknown as he lies in a hospital bed.",
      "The prosecutor's office is weighing possible charges as stories emerge about a darker side. One classmate recalled him being kicked out of a student club over comments that other members found troubling.",
      "\u201cThis is horrific,\u201d Jimmy Williams, the chief of safety for Leon County Schools, said of the shooting. \u201cThis is a horrible, horrible event.\u201d",
      "Williams, who has known Ikner\u2019s stepmother, Jessica Ikner, for a decade, said the allegations underscore that \u201cnone of us are immune to tragedy.\u201d",
      "His stepmother, whose own alma mater is Florida State, was reassigned from her position as a school resource officer Friday and granted the personal leave she requested, a sheriff\u2019s office spokesperson told The Associated Press.",
      "When the alert went out of an active shooter at Florida State University, Jessica Ikner was on duty around 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) away at Raa Middle School. A sheriff\u2019s office spokesperson said Jessica Ikner worked to secure the campus to prevent anyone from entering as Raa went into \u201clockout mode,\" along with all of the county\u2019s public schools. She was practiced at this work.",
      "Last year, she was named an \u201cemployee of the month\u201d by the sheriff\u2019s office, where she has worked for 18 years.",
      "Police said they believed Phoenix Ikner shot the victims using his stepmother\u2019s former service handgun, which she had kept for personal use after the force upgraded its weapons.",
      "Leon County Sheriff Walter McNeil described Phoenix Ikner on Thursday as having been \u201csteeped in the Leon County Sheriff\u2019s Office family\u201d and engaged in a number of sheriff\u2019s office training programs, adding that it wasn\u2019t a surprise that he would have access to guns.",
      "There was no record of him having a criminal record. And in Florida, training and a background check are not required to carry concealed guns in public.",
      "When Ikner was a child, his parents were involved in several custody disputes with his biological mother, court records show.",
      "In 2015, when he was 10, his biological mother, Anne-Mari Eriksen, said she was taking him to South Florida for spring break in 2015 but instead traveled to Norway. After returning to the U.S., she pleaded no contest to removing a minor from the state against a court order and was sentenced to 200 days in jail. She later moved to vacate her plea, but that was denied.",
      "In the fall of that same year, Eriksen filed a civil libel-slander complaint against Jessica Ikner, along with several other family members. The complaint, which was later dismissed, accused them of harassing Eriksen and abusing Ikner\u2019s position at the sheriff\u2019s office.",
      "In 2020, at age 15, the suspect received court approval to change his name from Christian Eriksen to Phoenix Ikner, court documents show. His old name was a constant reminder of a \u201ctragedy\u201d he suffered, in the words of administrative magistrate James Banks, who approved the request, NBC News reported.",
      "Banks observed that Ikner was a \u201cmentally, emotionally and physically mature young adult who is very articulate\u201d and \u201cvery polite\u201d said he chose the new name as a representation of \u201crising from the ashes anew.\u201d",
      "Reid Seybold and his classmates were working on a group project in a building located a short, three-minute walk from the student union when someone ran in and warned them about the gunfire. They huddled together, the 22-year-old said, frantically firing off what they thought might be their final text messages to loved ones.",
      "When Seybold found out who the suspect in the shooting was \u2014 that it was someone he knows \u2014 he was overcome with anger. Seybold was the president of a club that Phoenix Ikner joined when they were both studying at the local community college, now called Tallahassee State College.",
      "Seybold said Ikner was known for espousing racist and white supremacist views that so alienated other members that the club asked him to leave the group.",
      "\u201cHe made people that uncomfortable,\u201d said Seybold, who now also is studying political science at Florida State. \u201cI personally know him to have complained about how multiculturalism and communism are ruining America.\u201d",
      "Ikner transferred to Florida State after earning an associate degree at the community college, school officials said.",
      "He didn't attract the attention of the school paper, other than commenting in a FSU story about a rally on campus against President Donald Trump.",
      "Ikner, a registered Republican, described the protesters as \u201centertaining\u201d because Trump was already set to be inaugurated. The comments have since been removed from the story, an editor's note saying the move was to \u201cavoid amplifying the voice of an individual responsible for violence.\u201d",
      "Before Ikner\u2019s Instagram was taken down, his bio quoted a verse from the Old Testament book of Jeremiah. \u201cThou art my battle ax and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms,\u201d reads Jeremiah 51:20, which scholars have interpreted to depict God\u2019s judgment on Babylon. The empire is a symbol in the Bible of sinfulness and immorality.",
      "A Tallahassee Police Department patrol car was stationed Thursday evening near the street where the family lives, blocking reporters from approaching the family\u2019s home in a well-kept suburban neighborhood on the city\u2019s east side.",
      "Phone messages left for Jessica Ikner at a number listed for her on a school resource website and another phone connected to her through public records were not immediately returned Friday. And a sheriff\u2019s office spokeswoman said she is not aware of the family putting out a statement or having a family spokesperson.",
      "The only insight comes from the past statements. Nearly a decade ago, Jessica Ikner wrote a story posted on the Tallahassee Family Magazine website about children\u2019s safety while surfing the internet, including tips to strengthen family bonds.",
      "\u201cBuild a trusting relationship with your child,\" she wrote. \"Let them know that if they do make a mistake they can still come to you about anything.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The American Revolution began 250 years ago, in a blast of gunshot and a trail of colonial spin.",
      "Starting with Saturday's anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the country will look back to its war of independence and ask where its legacy stands today.",
      "The semiquincentennial comes as President Donald Trump, the scholarly community and others divide over whether to have a yearlong party leading up to July 4, 2026, as Trump has called for, or to balance any celebrations with questions about women, the enslaved and Indigenous people and what their stories reveal.",
      "The history of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts is half-known, the myth deeply rooted.",
      "Reenactors may with confidence tell us that hundreds of British troops marched from Boston in the early morning of April 19, 1775, and gathered about 14 miles (22.5 kilometers) northwest on Lexington's town green.",
      "Firsthand witnesses remembered some British officers yelled, \u201cThrown down your arms, ye villains, ye rebels!\u201d and that amid the chaos a shot was heard, followed by \u201cscattered fire\u201d from the British. The battle turned so fierce that the area reeked of burning powder. By day's end, the fighting had continued around 7 miles (11 kilometers) west to Concord and some 250 British and 95 colonists were killed or wounded.",
      "But no one has learned who fired first, or why. And the revolution itself was initially less a revolution than a demand for better terms.",
      "Woody Holton, a professor of early American history at the University of South Carolina, says most scholars agree the rebels of April 1775 weren\u2019t looking to leave the empire, but to repair their relationship with King George III and go back to the days preceding the Stamp Act, the Tea Act and other disputes of the previous decade.",
      "\u201cThe colonists only wanted to turn back the clock to 1763,\u201d he said.",
      "Stacy Schiff, a Pulitzer Prize winning historian whose books include biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Samuel Adams, said Lexington and Concord \u201cgalvanized opinion precisely as the Massachusetts men hoped it would, though still it would be a long road to a vote for independence, which Adams felt should have been declared on 20 April 1775.\u201d",
      "But at the time, Schiff added, \u201cIt did not seem possible that a mother country and her colony had actually come to blows.\u201d",
      "The rebels had already believed their cause greater than a disagreement between subjects and rulers. Well before the turning points of 1776, before the Declaration of Independence or Thomas Paine\u2019s boast that \u201cWe have it in our power to begin the world over again,\u201d they cast themselves in a drama for the ages.",
      "The so-called Suffolk Resolves of 1774, drafted by civic leaders of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, prayed for a life \u201cunfettered by power, unclogged with shackles,\u201d a fight that would determine the \u201cfate of this new world, and of unborn millions.\u201d",
      "The revolution was an ongoing story of surprise and improvisation. Military historian Rick Atkinson, whose \u201cThe Fate of the Day\u201d is the second of a planned trilogy on the war, called Lexington and Concord \u201ca clear win for the home team,\u201d if only because the British hadn't expected such impassioned resistance from the colony's militia.",
      "The British, ever underestimating those whom King George regarded as a \u201cdeluded and unhappy multitude,\u201d would be knocked back again when the rebels promptly framed and transmitted a narrative blaming the royal forces.",
      "\u201cOnce shots were fired in Lexington, Samuel Adams and Joseph Warren did all in their power to collect statements from witnesses and to circulate them quickly; it was essential that the colonies, and the world, understand who had fired first,\u201d Schiff said. \"Adams was convinced that the Lexington skirmish would be \u2018famed in the history of this country.' He knocked himself out to make clear who the aggressors had been.\u201d",
      "Neither side imagined a war lasting eight years, or had confidence in what kind of country would be born out of it. The founders united in their quest for self-government but differed how to actually govern, and whether self-government could even last.",
      "Americans have never stopped debating the balance of powers, the rules of enfranchisement or how widely to apply the exhortation, \u201cAll men are created equal.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it's important to remember that the language of the founders was aspirational. The idea that it was self-evident all men were created equal was preposterous at a time when hundreds of thousands were enslaved,\" said Atkinson, who cites the 20th-century poet Archibald MacLeish's contention that \u201cdemocracy is never a thing done.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't think the founders had any sense of a country that some day would have 330 million people,\" Atkinson said. \u201cOur country is an unfinished project and likely always will be.\u201d",

      "As various U.S. emissaries have held talks looking for an end to the war, both Trump and his top officials have become more reserved about the prospects of a peace deal. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday suggested the U.S. might soon back away from negotiations altogether without more progress, adding a comment that sounded like a repudiation of the president's old comments.",
      "\u201cNo one\u2019s saying this can be done in 12 hours,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "The promises made by presidential candidates are often felled by the realities of governing. But Trump's shift is noteworthy given his prior term as president and his long histories with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "The White House on Friday did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Trump's evolving deadline comments.",
      "Here's a look at Trump's evolution on the way he talks about the Russia-Ukraine war:",
      "MARCH 2023: \u201cThere\u2019s a very easy negotiation to take place. But I don\u2019t want to tell you what it is because then I can\u2019t use that negotiation; it\u2019ll never work,\u201d Trump told Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity, claiming that he could \u201csolve\u201d the war \u201cin 24 hours\u201d if he were back in the White House.",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s a very easy negotiation to take place. I will have it solved within one day, a peace between them,\" Trump said of the war, which at that point had been ongoing for more than a year since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "MAY 2023: \u201cThey\u2019re dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I\u2019ll have that done \u2014 I\u2019ll have that done in 24 hours,\" Trump said during a town hall on CNN.",
      "JULY 2024: When asked to respond to Trump's one-day claim, Russia\u2019s United Nations Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters that \u201cthe Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\u201d Afterward, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said that \u201ca top priority in his second term will be to quickly negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\"",
      "AUGUST 2024: \u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\u201d Trump told a National Guard Conference. \u201cI\u2019ll get it settled very fast. I don\u2019t want you guys going over there. I don\u2019t want you going over there.\u201d",
      "DEC. 16, 2024: \u201cI\u2019m going to try,\u201d Trump said during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club, asked if he thought he could still make a deal with Putin and Zelenskyy to end the war.",
      "JAN. 8, 2025: In a Fox News Channel interview, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg \u2014 now serving as Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia \u2014 proposed a 100-day deadline to end the war. Friday marked 100 days since that interview. The 100th day of Trump's presidency is April 30.",

      "\u201cWe will be speaking, and I think will perhaps do something that\u2019ll be significant,\u201d Trump said in an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cWe want to end that war. That war would have not started if I was president.\u201d",
      "FEB. 12: Trump and Putin speak for more than an hour and Trump speaks afterward with Zelenskyy. Trump says afterward, \u201cI think we\u2019re on the way to getting peace.\u201d",
      "FEB. 19: Trump posts on his Truth Social site that Zelenskyy is serving as a \u201cdictator without elections.\u201d He adds that \u201cwe are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only \u2018TRUMP,\u2019 and the Trump Administration, can do.\u201d",

      "Declaring himself \u201cin the middle\u201d and not on the side of either Ukraine or Russia in the conflict, Trump went on to deride Zelenskyy\u2019s \u201chatred\u201d for Putin as a roadblock to peace.",
      "\u201cYou see the hatred he\u2019s got for Putin,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate.\u201d",

      "Iran and the United States are preparing for a second round of negotiations over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program in Rome",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Iran and the United States prepared Saturday for a second round of negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program in Rome",
      "The talks in Italy over Easter weekend again will hinge on U.S. billionaire Steve Witkoff, the U.S. Mideast envoy of President Donald Trump, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Whether the two men find common ground in the high-stakes negotiations could mean success or failure in the talks.",
      "That talks are even happening represent a historic moment, given the decades of enmity between the two countries since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and U.S. Embassy hostage crisis. Trump in his first term unilaterally withdrew from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018, setting off years of attacks and negotiations that failed to restore the accord that drastically limited Tehran's enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.",
      "At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue an atomic weapon. Meanwhile, tensions in the Middle East have spiked over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and after U.S. airstrikes on targeting Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels killed more than 70 people and wounded dozens more.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon,\u201d Trump said Friday. \u201cI want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.\u201d",
      "Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei wrote Saturday on the social platform X that Iran \u201calways demonstrated, with good faith and a sense of responsibility, its commitment to diplomacy as a civilized way to resolve issues.\"",
      "\u201cWe are aware that it is not a smooth path but we take every step with open eyes, relying also on the past experiences,\u201d he added.",
      "Both men have been traveling in recent days. Witkoff had been in Paris for talks about Ukraine as Russia's full-scale war there grinds on. Araghchi will be coming from Tehran, Iran, after a visit to Moscow where he met with officials including Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Russia, a member of the world powers involved in Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal, could be a key participant in any future deal reached between Tehran and Washington. Analysts suggest Moscow could potentially take custody of Iran's uranium enriched to 60% purity \u2014 a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.",
      "Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who mediated the first round, already has arrived in Rome and met with his Italian counterpart on Friday. Baghaei said al-Busaidi again mediate between the countries.",
      "Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, has long served as an interlocutor between Iran and the West. Muscat hosted the first round of negotiations between Araghchi and Witkoff last weekend, which saw the two men meet face to face after indirect talks.",
      "Iran's internal politics are still inflamed over the mandatory hijab, or headscarf, with women still ignoring the law on the streets of Tehran. Rumors also persist over the government potentially increasing the cost of subsidized gasoline in the country, which has sparked nationwide protests in the past",
      "Iran's rial currency plunged to over 1 million to a U.S. dollar earlier this month. The currency has improved with the talks, however, something Tehran hopes will continue.",
      "Meanwhile, two used Airbus A330-200 long sought by Iran's flag carrier, Iran Air, arrived to Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport on Thursday, flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed. The planes, formerly of China's Hainan Airlines, had been in Muscat and re-registered to Iran.",
      "The aircraft had Rolls-Royce engines, which include significant American parts and servicing. Such a transaction would need approval from the U.S. Treasury given sanctions on Iran. The State Department and Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Under the 2015 deal, Iran could purchase new aircraft and had lined up tens of billions of dollars in deals with Airbus and Boeing Co. However, the manufacturers backed away from the deals over Trump's threats to the nuclear accord.",

      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs has vetoed a Republican-backed bill intended to support the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown",
      "PHOENIX -- Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs on Friday vetoed a Republican-backed bill intended to support the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown by requiring local and state officials in Arizona to cooperate with federal enforcement efforts.",
      "Under the proposal, local and state officials couldn\u2019t prohibit or restrict cooperation with federal immigration efforts or block the use of federal databases and grant funds related to immigration enforcement.",
      "It also would force cooperation on immigration detainers \u2014 requests from the federal government to hold onto people already in state custody until immigration authorities could pick them up.",
      "Supporters say the measure is needed to ensure federal authorities can safely and more easily take custody of immigrants, rather than having to track them down later after they have already been released from state prisons or county jails.",
      "Opponents say the state should leave immigration enforcement to the federal government and that the cooperation required in the bill would be expensive for local governments to carry out and would harm the cooperation local police get from people in immigrant communities.",
      "They also point out that immigration laws passed by the Arizona Legislature in the past have led to legal problems, such as a 2013 racial profiling verdict against then-Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio\u2019s office for his signature traffic patrols that targeted immigrants.",
      "Senate President Warren Petersen, a Republican from Gilbert, said his proposal aims to ensure that Arizona is a \u201cpartner and not an obstacle\u201d where President Donald Trump's immigration efforts are concerned.",
      "Under the bill, state prisons and county jails would be required to enter agreements with Washington to temporarily house people with detainers. Local agencies would be required to comply with detainers and tell judges who are determining bail when a given individual has an immigration detainer.",
      "The bill would also require Arizona\u2019s attorney general to investigate alleged violations of the cooperation rules and let the attorney general sue to bring an agency into compliance. Supporters say state-shared revenues to local government could be withheld until compliance is reached. Arizona's landmark 2010 immigration law also addressed the issue of state and local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.",
      "The law bars state and local governments from limiting the enforcement of federal immigration law and lets residents sue over alleged violations.",
      "State officials, immigrant rights advocates and an association representing counties say they are unaware of any such lawsuits being filed in the nearly 15 years since it was signed into law.",
      "A little over a year ago, Hobbs vetoed a bill that would have made it a state crime for noncitizens to enter the state through Mexico at any location other than a port of entry. The Republican-led Legislature then bypassed the governor and voted to put a similar measure on the November 2024 ballot, which then won approval from voters.",
      "Since Trump won a second term, Hobbs promised to work with his administration on issues like combating fentanyl trafficking, but has acknowledged the worries some families feel about the immigration crackdown.",
      "Hobbs has vowed to veto all bills sent to her in a standoff with the Legislature until there is a compromise on funding for a state agency that provides services for people with developmental disabilities.",
      "GOP lawmakers say Hobbs has mismanaged agency funds. Hobbs counters that Republicans are leveraging the crisis for \u201cpolitical warfare.\u201d She has said she is willing to veto even bills that she supports.",

      "The administration has defined performance to account for job indispensability as Trump seeks to drastically reduce the federal workforce.",
      "Lawyers for the administration also say that OPM did not order the firings, but Alsup found it was impossible for federal agencies to assess each worker's performance in only a matter of days.",
      "In Friday's order, Alsup said the fired workers must receive the written statements by May 8.

    "story": [
      "Stock markets around the world have been relatively settled this week after a period of chaos, sparked by US trade tariffs.",
      "But investors are still closely watching a part of the market which rarely moves dramatically - the US bond market.",
      "Governments sell bonds - essentially an IOU - to raise money for public spending and in return they pay interest.",
      "Recently, in an extremely rare move the rate the US government had to pay on its bonds rose sharply, while the price of bonds themselves fell.",
      "The volatility suggests investors were losing confidence in the world's biggest economy.",
      "You may think it's too esoteric to bother you, but here's why it matters and how it may change President Trump's mind on tariffs.",
      "What is a government bond?",
      "When a government wants to borrow money, it usually does so by selling bonds - known as \"Treasuries\" in the US -  to investors on financial markets.",
      "Such payments are made over a number of pre-agreed years before a full and final payment is made when the bond \"matures\" - in other words, expires.",
      "Investors who buy bonds are mainly made up of financial institutions, ranging from pension funds to central banks like the Bank of England.",
      "What is happening with US bonds?",
      "Investors buy government bonds because they are seen as a safe place to invest their money. There is little risk a government will not repay the money, especially an economic superpower like the US.",
      "So when the economy is turbulent and investors want to take money out of volatile stocks and shares markets, they usually place that cash in US bonds.",
      "But recently that hasn't happened.",
      "Initially, following the so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement on 2 April when shares fell, investors did appear to flock to US bonds.",
      "However, when the first of these tariffs kicked in on 5 April and Trump doubled down on his policies that weekend, investors began dumping government bonds, sending the interest rate the US government would have to pay to borrow money up sharply.",
      "The so-called yield for US government borrowing over 10 years shot up from 3.9% to 4.5%, while the 30-year yield spiked at almost 5%. Movements of 0.2% in either direction are considered a big deal.",
      "Why the dramatic sell-off? In short, the uncertainty over the impact of tariffs on the US economy led to investors no longer seeing government bonds as such a safe bet, so demanded bigger returns to buy them.",
      "The higher the perceived risk, the higher the yield investors want to compensate for taking it.",
      "How does this affect ordinary Americans?",
      "If the US government is spending more on debt interest repayments, it can affect budgets and public spending as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself.",
      "But it can also have a direct impact on households and even more so on businesses.",
      "John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, says when investors charge higher rates to lend the government money, other rates for lending that have more risk attached, such as mortgages, credit cards and car loans, also tend to rise.",
      "Businesses, especially small ones, are likely to be hardest hit by any immediate change in borrowing rates, as most homeowners in the US have fixed-rate deals of between 15 and 30 years. If businesses can't get access to credit, that can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time.",
      "Mr Canavan adds that banks can become more cautious in lending money, which could impact the US economy.",
      "First-time buyers and those wishing to move home could also face higher costs, he says, which could impact the housing market in the longer term. It's common in the US for small business owners starting out to use the equity in their home as collateral.",
      "Why does Trump care?",
      "Following the introduction of tariffs, Trump urged his nation to \"hang tough\", but it appears the potential threat to jobs and the US economy stopped the president in his tracks.",
      "Following the ructions in the bond markets, he introduced a 90-day pause for the higher tariffs on every country except China. The 10% blanket tariff, however, on all countries remains.",
      "It proved a pressure point for Trump - and now the world knows it.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market sell-off, once the bond market began to weaken too, it was only a matter of time before he folded,\" says Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "According to US media reports, it was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, inundated with calls from business leaders, who played a key part in swaying Trump.",
      "Is this similar to Liz Truss's mini-Budget?",
      "The bond market reaction has led to comparisons with former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss's infamous mini-Budget of September 2022. The unfunded tax cuts announced then spooked investors, who dumped UK government bonds, resulting in the Bank of England stepping in to buy bonds to save pension funds from collapse.",
      "Some analysts suggested that America's central bank, the US Federal Reserve, might have been forced to step in if the sell-off had worsened.",
      "While bond yields have settled, some might argue the damage has already been done as they remain higher than before the blanket tariffs kicked in.",
      "\"Arguably the most worrying aspect of the [recent] turmoil... is an emerging risk premium in US Treasury bonds and the dollar, akin to what the UK experienced in 2022,\" according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.",
      "But unless you're a first-time buyer or selling your home, Americans are unlikely to be immediately hit by higher mortgage costs, unlike Brits who were securing new shorter-term fixed deals.",
      "How is China being linked to US bonds?",
      "Since 2010, foreign ownership of US bonds has almost doubled, rising by $3 trillion, according to Deutsche Bank.",
      "Japan holds the most US Treasuries, but China, the US's arch enemy in this global trade war, is the second biggest holder of US government debt globally.",
      "Questions were raised about whether it sparked the debt sell-off in response to being hit with huge tariffs.",
      "However, this is unlikely as any fire sale \"would impoverish China more than it would hurt the US\", according to Capital Economics.",

      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",
      "\"But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.\"",

      "But what does that actually mean in practice - and should you be concerned?",
      "What has been banned?",
      "Pork, beef, lamb, mutton, goat, venison and any other products made from these meats - such as sausages - from the EU have been banned. It also applies to pet food.",
      "In addition, milk and dairy products - like butter, cheese and yoghurt - from the EU have also been prohibited.",

      "It affects cattle, sheep, pigs and, according to the government, \"other cloven-hoofed animals such as wild boar, deer, llamas and alpacas\".",
      "Animals that catch it typically come down with a high temperature before developing blisters, usually around the mouth or feet. It can make animals lame and, for the very young, result in fatalities.",
      "How long will the ban last?",
      "The Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs introduced the measure on Saturday, 12 April and did not give an end date.",
      "The BBC understands the ban will stay in place until the government believes there is no significant risk from travellers bringing banned meat and dairy into Great Britain.",

      "Last week, Tesco admitted that it could take a significant hit if it is forced to cut prices after Asda - now under the leadership of industry veteran Allan Leighton - announced it would reduce grocery costs to boost the struggling store.",
      "A race to lower prices could help households who are still struggling with the cost of living at a time when bills, such as energy and water, are increasing.",
      "\"We're in the strongest position we've ever been [on price competition] and we intend to stay there,\" said Sainsbury's chief executive Simon Roberts.",
      "The company expects the impact of lowering prices to be relatively small compared to a potential \u00a3400m hit announced by Tesco.",
      "Sainsbury's predicts underlying retail profit will tick down by around \u00a336m over the year.",
      "This, said Bernstein analyst William Woods, gives the supermarket \"wiggle room\" to fight with Tesco and Asda if needed.",
      "While supermarkets are always competing with each other over price, the threat of a more intensive clash arose in March when Mr Leighton said Asda would take a hit to its profits in order to reduce prices, rebuild market share and win back customers.",
      "At the time, the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury's saw their share prices plunge on speculation they would be forced to fund millions of pounds worth in price cuts to compete with Asda.",
      "Mr Leighton was Asda's chief executive between 1996 and 2001 and returned last year as executive chairman to turn the business around after a period of falling sales and under-investment.",

      "Mr Roberts declined to comment on what effect US President Donald Trump's tariffs could have on the business, which also owns Argos and the Habitat brand.",
      "There has been speculation that China, faced with high tariffs on selling goods to the US, might re-route products to other countries and sell them cheaply to offload them.",
      "Mr Roberts said that Sainsbury's was \"watching developments carefully\".",
      "While revenue at Sainsbury's grew strongly over the 12 months to 1 March, sales continued to fall at Argos although it said that the situation improved as it boosted traffic to the brand's website.",
      "The supermarket also reported an 8.9% drop in fuel sales to \u00a34.7bn. It blamed \"reduced demand\" as well as the lower cost of petrol and diesel due to \"falling commodity prices in a highly competitive market\".",
      "Official data released on Wednesday showed that the falling cost of motor fuel helped drive down the overall rate of inflation.",
      "Inflation eased by more than expected to 2.6% in the year to March, from 2.8% in February."

      "Shares in Nvidia plunged on Wednesday after the computer chip giant said it would be hit by $5.5bn (\u00a34.2bn) in costs due to the US government tightening its export rules to China.",
      "The firm, which has been at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, will require licences to export its H20 AI chip to China, which has been one of its most popular.",

      "The average price of petrol fell by 1.6p per litre between February and March to 137.5p per litre.",
      "The inflation decrease was also driven by a drop in recreation and culture prices, with toys, games, and hobbies falling particularly sharply.",

      "Wages continue to outpace inflation with salary raises for public sector workers growing more than those in the private sector.",

      "The former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting Monetary Policy Committee told Radio 4's Today Programme the effect of Trump's trade wars will also be felt in exports and investment in the UK.",
      "\"We may get a diversion of cheap exports which might have otherwise gone to the US, will start to come to Europe and the UK,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The rate of rising prices - inflation - has eased for the second month in a row, official figures show.",
      "In March, prices rose at an annual rate of 2.6%, far slower than the 11% inflation peak seen in 2022.",
      "Petrol and toy prices have fallen, a relief for drivers and parents, while food prices are unchanged.",
      "However, this data is for last month, and analysts suggest it is the \"calm before a storm\".",
      "Exact predictions are difficult, but here are three key areas where inflation is expected to rise.",
      "1. April's bills and costs",
      "A host of household bills went up at the start of April, on top of continued rent rises.",
      "They included utilities such as domestic energy and water. Council tax also rose significantly for millions of people, and there were hikes for many on phone and broadband contracts, as well as the TV licence.",
      "For businesses, the rise in employer National Insurance contributions in April may have led them to immediately put up their prices.",
      "Some of these increased costs will feed into the next set of inflation data published in May. As a result, analysts think this will see the inflation rate quickly climb over 3% (remember the government and Bank of England's target is 2%).",
      "After that, there's significant uncertainty. Commentators suggest inflation may not stay as high, for as long, as previously thought, for reasons we'll come to next.",
      "2. The Donald Trump tariffs effect",
      "The rollercoaster ride of US tariff policy has dominated the headlines and airwaves in the last few weeks.",
      "The US president announced taxes on goods imported into the US from around the world, then rowed back or delayed many, but doubled down on Chinese imports.",
      "Some countries have hit back with tariffs of their own; others - such as the UK - are trying to negotiate.",
      "We are in relatively unknown territory in modern economics and the picture seems to change almost every day, so predictions have to be taken with a large dose of salt.",
      "In theory, when tariffs are announced, and retaliation comes, then higher taxes all round will make goods more expensive for consumers.",
      "But, particularly for the UK, things are far more nuanced. The 10% tariff on UK goods imported by the US is lower than feared, and retaliation looks unlikely.",
      "Indeed, there are heightened expectations of a UK-US trade deal, rather than a trade war.",
      "So, any price rises would be limited.",
      "China is facing massive 145% tariffs on all its goods bound for the US. If that puts up barriers to the US market, it may find other places to sell its - often cheaply manufactured - products, such as the UK.",
      "A so-called dumping of cheap Chinese products in the UK will increase price competition and could slow the rate of inflation.",
      "3. Performance of the UK economy",
      "Growth in the UK economy has been sluggish for some time, although the latest data was more positive than many had expected.",
      "But, again connected to the issue of tariffs, there are warnings that the improvement in UK economic growth could be short-lived with some even predicting a recession.",
      "That's not good news for the government, which has made economic growth its priority.",
      "Nor is it good news for workers, whose job security becomes less stable if businesses draw back on investment and start to cut costs.",
      "No job means less money to spend. That would bring down the inflation rate, but would be small mercy to anyone who is suddenly unemployed.",
      "Alternatively, the government's drive for growth could successfully propel the economy against these headwinds.",
      "And there is even greater pressure on policymakers at the Bank of England to help boost growth by cutting interest rates, lowering the cost of borrowing for loans and mortgages.",
      "Cutting interest rates usually adds to consumer demand, and risks raising prices and the rate of inflation further from its 2% target.",
      "So the Bank's rate-setters face a delicate balancing act for the rest of the year, starting at their next meeting in May, particularly because nobody is sure how much the tightrope is going to wobble.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9ljwgg9y0o",
    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 23:39:32 GMT",
    "summary": "America is trying to create a chip industry through isolation and protectionism, when what allowed it to emerge in Asia is the opposite: collaboration.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "The US has \"dropped the ball\" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead. So said Gina Raimondo, who at the time was the US Commerce Secretary, in an interview with me back in 2021.",
      "Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.",
      "He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality products in their American factories.",
      "So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale?",
      "Microchips: The secret sauce",
      "Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles. These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale.",
      "Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US.",
      "It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades.",
      "Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US.",
      "With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US.",
      "The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success.",
      "That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden \u2013 an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing.",
      "Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas.",
      "TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island.",
      "But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions.",
      "\"This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,\" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. \"The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.\"",
      "And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips.",
      "Did China try to steal Taiwan's prowess?",
      "Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that \"they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan\".",
      "\"The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,\" he says. \"Today, Taiwan has far more capacity.\"",
      "The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive.",
      "TSMC was the pioneer of the \"foundry model\" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies.",
      "Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing.",
      "\"Could the US make chips and create jobs?\" asks Mr Einstein. \"Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not.\"",
      "One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India.",
      "\"Even Elon Musk has had an immigration problem with Tesla engineers,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to Musk's support for the US's H-1B visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US.",
      "\"That's a bottleneck and there's nothing they can do, unless they change their stance on immigration entirely. You can't just magic PhDs out of nowhere.\"",
      "The global knock-on effect",
      "Even so, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector.",
      "\"It's a wrench in the machine \u2013 a big wrench,\" says Mr Einstein. \"Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan.\"",
      "The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US.",
      "Some companies could look for new markets. Chinese technology giant Huawei, for example, expanded into Europe and emerging markets including Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and many countries in Africa in the face of export controls and tariffs, although the margins in developing nations are small.",
      "\"China ultimately will want to win \u2013 it has to innovate and invest in R&D. Look at what it did with Deepseek,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to the China-built AI chatbot.",
      "\"If they build better chips, everyone is going to go to them. Cost-effectiveness is something they can do now, and looking forward, it's the ultra-high-tech fabrication.\"",
      "In the meantime, new manufacturing hubs may emerge. India has a lot of promise, according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the US \u2013 it's geographically closer, labour is cheap and education is good.",
      "India has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing, but it faces a number of challenges, including land acquisition for factories, and water \u2013 chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it.",
      "Bargaining chips",
      "Chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs. The sheer reliance and demand for chips from major US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Cisco could apply pressure on Trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector.",
      "Some insiders believe intense lobbying by Apple CEO Tim Cook secured the exemptions to smartphone, laptop and electronic tariffs, and Trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips Nvidia can sell to China as a result of lobbying.",
      "Asked specifically about Apple products on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm a very flexible person,\" adding that \"there will be maybe things coming up, I speak to Tim Cook, I helped Tim Cook recently.\"",
      "Mr Einstein thinks it all comes down to Trump ultimately trying to make a deal - he and his administration know they can't just build a bigger building when it comes to chips.",
      "\"I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is what it has done with TikTok's owner Bytedance. He is saying I'm not going to let you operate in the US anymore unless you give Oracle or another US company a stake,\" says Mr Einstein.",
      "\"I think they're trying to fandangle something similar here \u2013 TSMC isn't going anywhere, let's just force them to do a deal with Intel and take a slice of the pie.\"",
      "But the blueprint of the Asia semiconductor ecosystem has a valuable lesson: no one country can operate a chip industry on its own, and if you want to make advanced semiconductors, efficiently and at scale \u2013 it will take time.",
      "Trump is trying to create a chip industry through protectionism and isolation, when what allowed the chip industry to emerge throughout Asia is the opposite: collaboration in a globalised economy.",

      "Ms Deane's UK-based business, which is named after her, sells wedding dresses online, with her biggest market being the US.",
      "On Instagram it now has 59,000 followers, but a few years ago the firm lost control of the account after a member of its social media team received a message suggesting that the business had been selected to get blue-badge verification from Instagram, which is owned by Facebook's Meta.",
      "This was the stamp of authenticity that Ms Deane had long sought. \"We were obviously very excited about that,\" she says.",
      "So her employee opened a link to what turned out to be a fake Instagram verification form that requested log-in credentials. She filled it in, divulging the username and password, and shortly afterwards the account was taken over by hackers.",
      "What added to Ms Deane's anguish was that she says she had to fight with Meta to get her account back, which took four months.",
      "Initially she filled out the admin dispute form and sent it off, but heard nothing. Multiple emails followed but no action was taken.",
      "\"It's so incredibly frustrating when you're dealing with your account being hacked and there is no-one to talk to,\" she says. \"It's almost traumatising because there is no-one who understands and can help escalate it.\"",
      "Eventually an email came from Meta, telling her that the case was closed, even though she was still unable to access her page.",
      "In the end the matter was finally resolved for Ms Deane because someone in the firm had a contact at Facebook, and the team emailed that person daily for the four months.",
      "\"Finally, I think they just needed to get us off their backs and they reinstated the account,\" says Ms Deane.",
      "According to Jonas Borchgrevink, boss of US-based cyber security firm Hacked.com, Ms Deane is far from a unique case among people with business accounts on Instagram and Facebook.",
      "\"I would say that it is a massive problem,\" says Mr Borchgrevink. \"There are probably thousands every day that are losing their business pages.\"",
      "His company helps firms recover their Instagram and Facebook accounts, and he gets \"10 to 15 clients per week\". \"But those are just the ones that know about us and are able to pay the price, because these cases can take up to six months to sort.\"",
      "The BBC asked Meta to provide some numbers that would reveal the extent of the problem, and how it was tackling it, but it declined.",
      "However, it said in a statement, that \"we take the safety and security of our community seriously and encourage everyone to create a strong password, enable two factor authentication and to be suspicious of emails or messages asking for personal details.",
      "\"We also have a feature called Security Check-up to help people keep their Instagram and Facebook accounts secure.\"",
      "Hackers want to take over business social media accounts for a number of reasons. These including using the pages to sell fake products or place scam adverts, harvesting personal information, spreading malware, tricking people into sending money, or blackmailing the company in question to unblock the account.",
      "The final thing in that list happened last year to David Davila, who is part of the marketing team at Quantum Windows & Doors, a small, family-run business based in Washington state in the US.",
      "He got locked out of the firm's social Facebook account when he responded to what turned out to be a fake message purporting to be from Meta.",
      "Because his phone number was linked to the account, that also fell into the hands of the scammers and, soon after the lock-out, he got a WhatsApp message demanding $1,200 (\u00a3900) to unlock the account.",
      "Unable to find a helpline, he searched on Google, but the number he rang put him through to more scammers. That link has since been removed by Google.",
      "Thankfully, Mr Davila was able to get the Facebook account unlocked a few days later.",
      "Mr Borchgrevink believes that Meta is overwhelmed by the scale of the problem.",
      "\"It has implemented different security measures over the years and yet we still receive the same amount of clients, so I don't think there's been a lot of change there,\" he says.",
      "In fact, with scammers now utilising AI to make their messages seem even more believable, Mr Borchgrevink  thinks the situation could get a lot worse.",
      "He tells the BBC that scammers are behind many of these lock-outs and one of their preferred methods of fooling people is to masquerade as customer support agents.",
      "\"They pretend to be Meta Support and send the business an email saying that they have infringed some kind of copyright or broken terms and conditions in some way, and that they need to verify themselves.",
      "\"The messages have the Facebook logo and are very believable. But when you start to verify your business page, they ask for the password and redirect you to a fake Meta site to steal log-ins.\"",
      "He said that the fraudsters often target a personal Facebook page first, because all business accounts need to be linked to one.",
      "\"Your personal account will also have admin rights to your business account. The scammers go into your business account and transfer the admin rights to their own or to fake profiles.",
      "\"Then they go back to your personal account and disable it by posting inappropriate content like terror-related or pornography-related. That disables your account and makes it really hard to recover either that or your business account.\"",
      "The BBC has also learned of businesses losing access to their Facebook and Instagram accounts despite them not being hacked.",
      "One small business which is part of franchise, told the BBC that they lost access to their account when another franchisee gained a blue-tick verification. As a result of that their account was flagged as a clone.",

But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war?",
      "What are rare earths and what are they used for?",
      "\"Rare earths\" are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.",
      "Most are abundant in nature, but they are known as \"rare\" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.",
      "Although you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like Neodymium, Yttrium and Europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.",
      "For instance, Neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.",
      "Yttrium and Europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours.",
      "\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment.",
      "Rare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies.",
      "What does China control?",
      "China has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.",
      "The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.",
      "That means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths.",
      "Both the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting.",
      "All rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them.",
      "\"Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,\" says Mr Kruemmer.",
      "But China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn't take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment.",
      "In a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China's economic reform, famously said: \"The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths\".",
      "\"Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,\" said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets.\"",
      "How has China restricted exports of these minerals?",
      "In response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as \"heavy\" rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector.",
      "These are less common and are harder to process than \"light\" rare earths, which also makes them more valuable.",
      "From 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country.",
      "That is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of \"dual use products\".",
      "According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths.",
      "How could this impact the US?",
      "A US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals.",
      "This means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard.",
      "Heavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets.",
      "A CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.",
      "It adds that this comes as China \"expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States\".",
      "\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,\" said Mr Kroemmer.",
      "And it's not only in the field of defence.",
      "US manufacturing, which Trump has said he hopes to revive through the imposition of his tariffs, stand to be severely impacted.",
      "\"Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,\" he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies.",
      "If such a shortage from China persists in the long-run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require \"substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China\".",
      "And it's clear this is something already on Trump's mind. This week, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US' reliance on such  critical minerals.",
      "\"President Trump recognises that an overreliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,\" said the order.",
      "\"Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic resilience.\"",
      "China's precious metals the US can't do without",
      "What are 'rare earths' used for?",
      "Can't the US produce its own rare earths?",
      "The US has one operational rare earths mine, but it does not have the capacity to separate heavy rare earths and has to send its ore to China for processing.",
      "There used to be US companies that manufactured rare earth magnets - until the 1980s, the US was in fact the largest producer of rare earths.",
      "But these companies exited the market as China began to dominate in terms of scale and cost.",
      "This is largely believed to be part of why US president Donald Trump is so keen to sign a minerals deal with Ukraine - it wants to reduce dependency on China.",
      "Another place Trump has had his eye on is Greenland - which is endowed with the eighth largest reserves of rare earth elements.",
      "Trump has repeatedly showed interest in taking control of the autonomous Danish dependent territory and has refused to rule out economic or military force to take control of it.",
      "These might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers.",
      "\"The challenge the U.S. faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Whether they will still prioritise collaboration with America remains to be seen in the turbulent policy environment of this new administration.\""

    "summary": "A Guyanese political commentator says Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in the country.",
    "story": [
      "The Caribbean nation of Guyana is breathing a sigh of relief after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the introduction of higher tariffs on a number of countries.",
      "Guyana, which is nestled between Venezuela and Suriname on the South American mainland, had been singled out for rates of 38% on many of its exports.",
      "Following Trump's change in policy, it now faces tariffs of only 10% - the same as all countries apart from Canada, China and Mexico.",
      "But why had Guyana been facing a higher levy in the first place?",
      "Guyanese political commentator Francis Bailey says the country is caught in a geopolitical battle between the US and China. Or more specifically - Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in Guyana.",
      "Recent years have seen billions of dollars of investment in Guyana by Chinese entities, in everything from roads and hospitals, to hotels and shopping centres. And a crucial new bridge linking the capital Georgetown to the western region of Demerara-Mahaica is currently under construction by a Beijing-based company.",
      "For its part, the US continues to be happy to buy Guyana's key exports of crude oil, gold and bauxite, which is the ore from which aluminium is extracted. These were all to be exempt from the planned 38% tariff, which instead would have hit Guyana's fishing and sugar industries.",
      "The US also backs Guyana in its territorial dispute with Venezuela over the vast Essequibo region that forms the western two thirds of Guyana. During a visit to Georgetown in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Venezuela of \"consequences\" if it were to use force against Guyana.",
      "But the planned high tariff showed Washington's ire, says Mr Bailey. \"I think the reason we had been given such high tariffs is to apply pressure on Guyana.",
      "\"The US is saying, 'if you want our protection you need to chase the Chinese out of your country'. Trump is a very transactional president \u2013 and Guyana is in a very precarious position against its sabre-rattling adversary Venezuela which has been ramping up acts of aggression.\"",
      "The Guyanese government did not respond to requests for comments. The country, once one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, and a former British colony, has been enjoying a surge in wealth since it first discovered oil in its territorial waters in 2015.",
      "Last year it exported $3.13bn (\u00a32.4bn) of crude oil to the US, according to United Nations figures.",
      "Across the Caribbean all countries now face a 10% tariff on their exports to the US. However, it is the price impact of Trump's global tariffs on what they import from the US that is of most concern.",
      "This is because the Caribbean's love for, and reliance on, US products is immediately apparent when you glance at a High Street or supermarket shelf across the region. In fact, some islands are said to import as much as 70% of their consumer goods from their North American neighbour.",
      "And with American goods that rely on overseas raw materials or components set to go up in price, this will inevitably be passed on to consumers in the Caribbean.",
      "Also, much of what Caribbean nations buy from other countries around the world comes to them via the US.",
      "So with the White House now hitting Chinese goods coming into the US with tariffs of 125%, Chinese items that are then reexported to the Caribbean should see price hikes of a similar amount. And by around 10% for goods from other countries that arrive via the US.",
      "With already ever-increasing shipping costs in the Caribbean, and high local import duties causing exorbitant prices in a region beset by low wages, the impact of Trump's tariffs could be profound and keenly felt.",
      "In Antigua and Barbuda, interior designer Carissa Warner tells the BBC that 70% of her materials are imported from the US, and 20% from China.",
      "\"Some of my projects are on hold while we wait to see what happens,\" she explains. \"I am extremely worried from a business aspect but also just as a local consumer.",
      "\"I'm so worried about the cost of food I have been looking online for pots to start growing fresh produce. I don't think people realise the impact it will have on us.\"",
      "Ms Warner believes one way Caribbean governments could ease the squeeze on their people is by lowering their own import duties, which are partially calculated using a percentage of an item's cost.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's Prime Minister Gaston Browne has dubbed global tariffs \"extremely worrisome\" and is urging citizens to \"buy smarter and buy local\".",
      "Trump's tariffs come as the Caribbean is already grappling with a confluence of harsh economic conditions from the cost of cleaning up after frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, to the aftereffects of the Covid pandemic.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Sanders, says that the US has long enjoyed a trade surplus with most Caribbean countries.",
      "\"For decades, we have helped sustain American prosperity by collectively importing far more from the United States than we export,\" he says.",
      "\"The problem we have created for ourselves is that we have been dependent on the US market for such a long time and have not sought to diversify into other markets.\"",
      "As for the 10% tariff on Caribbean exports to the US, Sir Ronald says: \"Any loss is not a good thing for our small economies, but the 10% that we face is not going to disrupt our goods from going to the US market.\"",
      "The Caribbean islands' small market sizes, high labour costs and remoteness from principle markets has kept their manufacturing sectors relatively modest. Their exports include many niche products like specialist rums and indigenous foods such as ackee, a fruit from Jamaica.",
      "\"These kinds of products are all orientated to a certain kind of market and will not face any competition because the US does not produce them, and the countries that do face their own tariffs,\" Sir Ronald continues.",
      "Exacerbating worries in the Caribbean are potential additional taxes on Chinese-built ships entering US ports of up to $1.5m per docking. This idea was mooted by the White House in February.",
      "Many fear that will aggravate freight costs in the Caribbean, and lead to further hikes in the price of everyday goods, given the large volume of items sold in the region that are manufactured in China.",
      "Sir Ronald adds that tacking the problem of an overreliance on the US \"can only come from diversifying the market, but that's not an overnight achievement\".",
      "He adds: \"It's not as easy to set up new markets as people think. It's not governments who control trade; it's the private sector. And much of what we buy will still come via the US.\"",

    "story": [
      "Sainsbury's has forecast that shop profits will flatline or fall in the coming year as the supermarket sector prepares for a possible price war.",
      "The retailer said it expects income to dip to \u00a31bn as it continues to invest in lowering grocery prices.",
      "Last week, Tesco admitted that it could take a significant hit if it is forced to cut prices after Asda - now under the leadership of industry veteran Allan Leighton - announced it would reduce grocery costs to boost the struggling store.",
      "A race to lower prices could help households who are still struggling with the cost of living at a time when bills, such as energy and water, are increasing.",
      "\"We're in the strongest position we've ever been [on price competition] and we intend to stay there,\" said Sainsbury's chief executive Simon Roberts.",
      "The company expects the impact of lowering prices to be relatively small compared to a potential \u00a3400m hit announced by Tesco.",
      "Sainsbury's predicts underlying retail profit will tick down by around \u00a336m over the year.",
      "This, said Bernstein analyst William Woods, gives the supermarket \"wiggle room\" to fight with Tesco and Asda if needed.",
      "While supermarkets are always competing with each other over price, the threat of a more intensive clash arose in March when Mr Leighton said Asda would take a hit to its profits in order to reduce prices, rebuild market share and win back customers.",
      "At the time, the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury's saw their share prices plunge on speculation they would be forced to fund millions of pounds worth in price cuts to compete with Asda.",
      "Mr Leighton was Asda's chief executive between 1996 and 2001 and returned last year as executive chairman to turn the business around after a period of falling sales and under-investment.",

      "Tesco braces for grocery price war with rivals",
      "Sainsbury's set out its expectations as it revealed that full-year sales rose by 3.1% to \u00a331.5bn. Pre-tax profit jumped from \u00a3277m to \u00a3384m.",
      "Mr Roberts declined to comment on what effect US President Donald Trump's tariffs could have on the business, which also owns Argos and the Habitat brand.",
      "There has been speculation that China, faced with high tariffs on selling goods to the US, might re-route products to other countries and sell them cheaply to offload them.",
      "Mr Roberts said that Sainsbury's was \"watching developments carefully\".",
      "While revenue at Sainsbury's grew strongly over the 12 months to 1 March, sales continued to fall at Argos although it said that the situation improved as it boosted traffic to the brand's website.",
      "The supermarket also reported an 8.9% drop in fuel sales to \u00a34.7bn. It blamed \"reduced demand\" as well as the lower cost of petrol and diesel due to \"falling commodity prices in a highly competitive market\".",
      "Official data released on Wednesday showed that the falling cost of motor fuel helped drive down the overall rate of inflation.",
      "Inflation eased by more than expected to 2.6% in the year to March, from 2.8% in February."

    "published": "Wed, 16 Apr 2025 11:22:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Economic uncertainty globally and in the UK means there are conflicting forces at play with prices.",
    "story": [
      "The rate of rising prices - inflation - has eased for the second month in a row, official figures show.",
      "In March, prices rose at an annual rate of 2.6%, far slower than the 11% inflation peak seen in 2022.",
      "Petrol and toy prices have fallen, a relief for drivers and parents, while food prices are unchanged.",
      "However, this data is for last month, and analysts suggest it is the \"calm before a storm\".",
      "Exact predictions are difficult, but here are three key areas where inflation is expected to rise.",
      "1. April's bills and costs",
      "A host of household bills went up at the start of April, on top of continued rent rises.",
      "They included utilities such as domestic energy and water. Council tax also rose significantly for millions of people, and there were hikes for many on phone and broadband contracts, as well as the TV licence.",
      "For businesses, the rise in employer National Insurance contributions in April may have led them to immediately put up their prices.",
      "Some of these increased costs will feed into the next set of inflation data published in May. As a result, analysts think this will see the inflation rate quickly climb over 3% (remember the government and Bank of England's target is 2%).",
      "After that, there's significant uncertainty. Commentators suggest inflation may not stay as high, for as long, as previously thought, for reasons we'll come to next.",
      "2. The Donald Trump tariffs effect",
      "The rollercoaster ride of US tariff policy has dominated the headlines and airwaves in the last few weeks.",
      "The US president announced taxes on goods imported into the US from around the world, then rowed back or delayed many, but doubled down on Chinese imports.",
      "Some countries have hit back with tariffs of their own; others - such as the UK - are trying to negotiate.",
      "We are in relatively unknown territory in modern economics and the picture seems to change almost every day, so predictions have to be taken with a large dose of salt.",
      "In theory, when tariffs are announced, and retaliation comes, then higher taxes all round will make goods more expensive for consumers.",
      "But, particularly for the UK, things are far more nuanced. The 10% tariff on UK goods imported by the US is lower than feared, and retaliation looks unlikely.",
      "Indeed, there are heightened expectations of a UK-US trade deal, rather than a trade war.",
      "So, any price rises would be limited.",
      "China is facing massive 145% tariffs on all its goods bound for the US. If that puts up barriers to the US market, it may find other places to sell its - often cheaply manufactured - products, such as the UK.",
      "A so-called dumping of cheap Chinese products in the UK will increase price competition and could slow the rate of inflation.",
      "3. Performance of the UK economy",
      "Growth in the UK economy has been sluggish for some time, although the latest data was more positive than many had expected.",
      "But, again connected to the issue of tariffs, there are warnings that the improvement in UK economic growth could be short-lived with some even predicting a recession.",
      "That's not good news for the government, which has made economic growth its priority.",
      "Nor is it good news for workers, whose job security becomes less stable if businesses draw back on investment and start to cut costs.",
      "No job means less money to spend. That would bring down the inflation rate, but would be small mercy to anyone who is suddenly unemployed.",
      "Alternatively, the government's drive for growth could successfully propel the economy against these headwinds.",
      "And there is even greater pressure on policymakers at the Bank of England to help boost growth by cutting interest rates, lowering the cost of borrowing for loans and mortgages.",
      "Cutting interest rates usually adds to consumer demand, and risks raising prices and the rate of inflation further from its 2% target.",
      "So the Bank's rate-setters face a delicate balancing act for the rest of the year, starting at their next meeting in May, particularly because nobody is sure how much the tightrope is going to wobble.",

      "One family, three very different children. So how do they manage exam stress? And does having a teacher as a parent help?",
      "1. Open up the conversation",
      "\"I was very overwhelmed and I didn't want to do it,\" says Emma, thinking back to her A-level revision last year.",
      "She recently got diagnosed with ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder - which has helped her understand why she found her A-level revision period so difficult.",
      "Emma says she sometimes finds it hard to focus until a deadline is drawing closer.",
      "\"I need the pressure - but I also hate it because I get so stressed and so burnt out so easily,\" she says.",
      "Emma also says she sometimes struggled to get started with revision - even though she wanted to do it - because of how her ADHD affects her ability to start tasks, and organise revision sessions into manageable chunks.",
      "\"I think there's a lot of shame and guilt, because I thought I was being lazy,\" she says. \"You feel really rubbish about yourself. Then when I get really overwhelmed I get headaches.\"",
      "Emma says her dad helped her to draw up a study plan, and to keep her on track when she didn't want to revise.",
      "\"I have very strong memories of Emma sitting at this kitchen table crying her eyes out, getting really, really stressed about revision,\" says dad Steve.",
      "\"And us kind of saying: 'OK that's fine, you need to take a break. But tomorrow you need to go again'.\"",
      "Developing resilience, digging deep and trying again after a bad day are things Steve says Emma did brilliantly while finding A-level revision overwhelming.",
      "\"As a parent, you don't want your kids to go through things that upset them,\" he adds. \"But actually where this is concerned, you kind of have to keep going.\"",
      "So what can parents and carers do?",
      "Talking about your feelings can be tough, but parenting expert Stevie Goulding, from the charity Young Minds, suggests keeping the lines of communication open all the way through the exam period, and making sure you're ready to listen when they're ready to talk.",
      "\"Anxiety gets magnified when young people are under further strain and stress,\" she says.",

      "Listen here to 5 Minute On how to deal with revision stress on BBC Sounds",
      "2. Be creative",

      "\"I absolutely hate just sitting down with a laptop or book and just working,\" says Ben. \"But I think it's the best way for information to get into me.\"",

      "\"If I'm not doing questions to apply it, it just doesn't go in,\" Ben says.",
      "But what works for one student may not work for others, and expert Stevie suggests that thinking creatively about how your child can revise is a good idea - think flashcards, mind maps or even YouTube videos.",
      "\"I love flash cards - they're so easy and quick,\" says youngest daughter Jess.",
      "\"It also means we can get involved as well,\" adds dad Steve, explaining that parents can help to test their children on them.",
      "3. Stay connected to what you love",
      "When we're stressed, it can be tempting to push aside time for fun and relaxation - but it's actually really important in helping us to perform well in exams, Stevie says.",
      "\"We really need to look after our brains. It's really important to get the balance.\"",
      "For Emma, reading or walks with her mum, dad and their dog Maisie was important time to carve out during A-levels.",

      "Their brother Ben enjoys playing on his Xbox with friends, but says he drags himself back downstairs to do work when he realises he has been ignoring his revision a little too long.",
      "As a lot of exams rely on memory, expert Stevie says that staying hydrated, eating healthily, exercising, and having time to do the things we love can help us look after our brains.",
      "Time with your favourite TV show or even a scroll through TikTok can also help to find that balance.",
      "4. Avoid distractions",
      "You can't have too much of a good thing.",
      "Phones can help us to stay connected to friends and family during tough times, but they can also be distracting.",
      "\"I have to hide my phone underneath books or behind my laptop,\" says Emma. \"If I see it, I'll just go on it.\"",
      "When asked how she will avoid the distraction of her phone during her GCSE exams, younger sister Jess says she \"hasn't worked that one out yet\".",
      "Dad Steve has offered to take it away - if Jess wants him to - in order to help her focus.",

      "\"We're all guilty of saying it and it comes often from a very good place,\" she says.",

      "Instead, she suggests acknowledging the worry, and saying something like: \"I can absolutely hear that you are worried, and it's completely natural in exams, but you've put so much time and energy into revision.",
      "\"You've worked so hard and whatever happens, we'll be here to support you.\"",
      "What about when it all goes wrong?",
      "\"I think when things are getting tough, just step away from it,\" says teacher and dad Steve.",
      "\"Staying healthy - mentally healthy and physically healthy - has to be the most important thing.\"",
      "When tensions are high at home around revision and exams, arguments may happen. Stevie from Young Minds says that walking away and having a cooling off period is essential.",
      "\"Once people have cooled down, you can reflect, say that you understand why they are feeling so frustrated, and ask if there's anything you can do to support them.\"",
      "And when it's all over?",
      "\"I think something we'd definitely say as teachers is that it's not a good idea to come out of an exam and stand in a big group of people and hear what everyone else wrote,\" says Steve.",
      "And his daughter Emma agrees.",
      "\"I just walked out by myself, got my bag and went home,\" she says. \"I was like, 'I'm not ruining this, goodbye!'\"",
      "\"It's just a great feeling of relief after you've done the exam,\" adds Ben.",
      "With exams around the corner, the Jolleys are also keeping an eye on what they have to look forward to after it's all finished.",

      "Mandatory reporting was one of the 20 recommendations of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) following the grooming gangs scandal.",

      "\"Nor do we want to discourage young people from accessing services that are designed to offer support in addressing their own harmful sexual behaviour.\"",
      "The clause would not apply if either child was aged under 13 years old, if there was suspicion of coercion or abuse, or if there was a significant difference in age or maturity.",
      "Responding in the debate, Conservative MP Harriet Cross backed the clause, which she said recognised that age differences were important in these relationships.",
      "\"For example, if a 14-year-old girl is sexually involved with a 17-year-old boy, even if she says she has consented, a teacher or adult might rightly feel uneasy about the power dynamic and the possible impact of grooming,\" she said. \"The adult might decide that it is appropriate to report in that case.",
      "\"On the other hand, two 14-year-olds would likely fall under the exemption.\"",
      "Cross said it would allow professionals to use their judgement - but stressed the bar for not reporting should be high.",
      "\"It recognises that not all sexual activity involving under-18s is a cause for alarm or state intervention,\" she said.",
      "\"Specifically, it lets professionals refrain from reporting consensual sexual activity between older teenagers when they believe there is no abuse or exploitation at play - it is basically a Romeo and Juliet exemption.",

      "The pair had been accused of breaking the university's student code of conduct by disrupting a business meeting and \"behaving in an intimidating and disorderly manner\" towards staff on 22 May.",

      "But the thing that's arguably generated most excitement is the game's focus on old-school turn-based combat. It was a staple of classic 1990s and early 2000s RPG series such as Final Fantasy that's fallen out of fashion in the blockbuster space of late. If the studio sticks the landing with their debut title, expect to hear about Expedition 33 when Game of the Year season rolls around.",

      "\"The whole experience [on the show] kind of opened my eyes to real travel,\" Watts tells us over a video call from Portugal, while taking a break from refereeing a football match.",
      "\"I think there are definitely two different types of travel that we're used to in the UK; shallow travel, as I'd call it, where you go on holiday and you see what you want to see and you stay within your comfort zone or hotel.",
      "\"And then I'd say there's real authentic travel whereby you see the world as it actually is.",
      "\"And I've just learned that I actually much prefer the authenticity of places... rather than the weather.\"",
      "Watts's main advice for readers with a similar wanderlust is to consider travelling further afield.",
      "\"Flights to Spain in the summer might be \u00a3300 return, but you are going to be paying extremely high prices for food, accommodation and things like that,\" he notes.",
      "\"Whereas, actually, if you go a little bit further afield, if you try Malaysia, Thailand, even Brazil, for sure the flights might be \u00a3600-700 but when you're actually there, you're spending \u00a320-25 a day maximum.\"",
      "He adds: \"You're helping local people and you're trying something new.\"",
      "Since his big TV win, Watts has been to around 30 countries, including five in one day for a Europe-based online challenge.",
      "Another time he found and boarded the cheapest possible flights he could find online for seven days straight.",
      "And he also returned to Japan to pay a bill he felt he owed for some Kobe beef steaks that were kindly donated to him and Wood for free when they were worried about their budget, as fans of the show will remember. \"That was a really nice moment,\" he says.",
      "Watts likes to travel solo as he enjoys his \"own company\" and doing things on his \"own terms\", while also meeting new people.",
      "He acknowledges that it's not for everyone, and that some people prefer to be away with friends and family, but he wants to encourage would-be travellers to \"throw yourself in\".",
      "\"I don't do things that would put me in danger because I think I have a responsibility to the people that follow me,\" he says.",
      "He does admit though that he once ended up in a taxi with an armed government official in Venezuela - a country he travelled to against UK goverment guidance.",
      "\"That was about as wacky as it got.\"",
      "Bucket list",
      "His favourite place he has been on his travels so far is \"without doubt\" Angel Falls in Venezuela, while his favourite country would be a coin flip between Jordan and Malaysia.",
      "One thing he'd still like to tick off his bucket list is visiting the remote island of Tuvalu in the South Pacific Ocean, which sounds like a pitch for a new TV show in itself.",
      "\"It's the least visited country in the world,\" he explains.",
      "\"Only 1,500 people go there every year. It's very difficult to get to, very expensive to get to.\"",
      "As well as becoming far better travelled, the past year has also seen him expand his horizons in other ways, acting as an ambassador for Young Minds UK, a mental health charity for young people, and Winston's Wish, a children and young people's grief charity.",
      "One of the most heart-rending moments of series four was when it was revealed that Watts's mum had died of cancer when he was just a child.",
      "Speaking of his ambassadorial work, he says: \"I love it and I'm so glad that I get to have the opportunity [to help].",
      "\"But internalising it, it can be quite challenging, listening to people's stories.\"",
      "Race Across the World resumes on Wednesday, with a new raft of contestants heading this time from north eastern China to the southernmost tip of India.",

      "Watts thinks it's going to be a \"really tough route\" and a \"topsy-turvy\" series.",
      "\"China is very easy to get around but very hard to communicate,\" he stresses from personal experience. \"And a lot of China doesn't accept cash anymore.\"",
      "His \"number one piece of advice\" for anyone taking part is to learn from his mistakes and take a calculator and a whiteboard. \"We had to borrow notebooks and God knows what else\".",
      "He'd also suggest taking \"little travel placards\" with pictures of buses, trains and people on, for ease of communication.",
      "\"I think now there's more and more series, people are watching it and starting to think, 'actually, this is where they're going wrong. This is how we can be creative around it'.",

      "While it's difficult to pin their recent rise in popularity to one particular ingredient, celebrity endorsement, social media unboxing videos and their ability to stir up nostalgia are all contributing factors.",
      "James Welsh, from Hampshire, sees his Labubu collectable as an investment, which he tells the BBC \"could probably earn a fair bit of money two or three years down the line\".",
      "He has just shy of 30 Labubus which retail at around \u00a325 for an individual toy or \u00a3153 for a box of six.",

      "The company, which started 15 years ago, has been described as \"elevating toy buying to an act of trendy connoisseurship\" and praised for embracing non-traditional designs, which have made them a hit with collectors.",
      "Artist Kasing Lung is behind some of their popular toys including The Monsters series and Labubu.",
      "He credits living in The Netherlands as the inspiration behind the dolls and told Hypbeast \"I liked to read storybooks and was influenced by ancient European elf legends\".",
      "Lung added that during his childhood, \"there were no game consoles or computers, so I had to draw dolls with a pen, so I had the idea of painting fairy tales since I was a child\".",
      "He first came up with the designs in 2015 and signed a licensing agreement with Pop Mart in 2019 to make them into toys.",
      "Labubu as a name has no specific meaning, it is a fictional character based around an elf-like creature.",
      "James says his first thought when he saw the one of the toys was, \"they're creepy but they're also really cute and I need as many of them as I can get, I need them in every colour\".",
      "The 36-year-old adds, \"I think they [provide] some real escapism for millennials as it's like reverting back to your youth with these toys and collectables.\"",
      "A former stylist, he now primarily creates beauty and skincare content, but has recently gained thousands of views on his channel from Labubu unboxing videos.",
      "He tells the BBC: \"there is a strong link between these plush pendants and the fashion community as well.\"",
      "\"They're a way to express who you are, you can show that through the different characters, which add a pop of colour and fashion is fun, it's not serious at the end of the day, it's reflective of who you are.\"",

      "But for collectors such as 22-year-old Chulie, who shares her purchases on TikTok, she says Labubu becoming a \"fashion trend\" misses the point of why they're so loved.",
      "\"For me, it's all about the nostalgia and the surprise aspect,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "One of Pop Mart's biggest selling points for collectors is the way their toys are packaged in what's known as blind boxes, which make the experience of getting one like a lucky dip.",
      "You don't know what character you are getting until you unseal the package, so it's always a gamble for collectors.",
      "\"You know it's fun, it's a dopamine hit\", James says.",
      "\"It's gambling for some of us - kind of like a happy meal, you don't know what toy you're getting until you open it up.\"",
      "It also makes the toy perfect for the world of social media, as creators can catch their genuine surprise on camera and share it with other fans - something James says provides comfort and \"escapism from the real world\".",
      "Chulie says, as a child, she would collect Pokemon trading cards, so collecting another surprise item \"triggered memories for me\".",
      "\"When you're having a rough time, especially for me personally, it's a big serotonin boost to not only buy a collectable and keep it, but share the experience with other people as well,\" she adds.",

      "For some fans, just documenting the experience of getting a Labubu is a talking point, with many showing the long queues and hours of research required to find out where new collections are being stocked.",
      "It's prompted backlash on some social media channels, with users criticising collectors that have bought large numbers of items.",
      "\"Just because you don't understand someone's hobby, doesn't mean it's not valid in any way,\" James says.",

      "British artists are hopeful that'll act as a giddy up to the UK scene and help them replicate some of the success of their US country cousins.",
      "\"It only benefits me and other country music artists in the UK because more people listening to country music just means they're going to take an interest - hopefully - in what we're doing,\" 20-year-old singer Neeve Zahra tells BBC Newsbeat.",

      "Artists and critics predicted last year Cowboy Carter could \"open the floodgates\" for country music fans and Spotify credits \"viral tracks\" from 2024 with the sudden uptick in streams.",

      "\"Please be upstanding for the world's most confusing House of Games contestant and Bake Off failure, Self Esteem!\"",
      "This is how Rebecca Lucy Taylor \u2013 aka celebrated pop singer Self Esteem \u2013 is introduced to the stage at London's Duke of York's Theatre.",
      "It's a typically irreverent comment, an example of the dry wit she uses to sweeten the sincerity and anger of her music.",
      "\"You can take piccies and videos,\" the off-stage voice continues, \"because she needs all the help she can get.\"",
      "That, too, is strictly tongue-in-cheek.",
      "Three years ago, Taylor released her second album, Prioritise Pleasure, a body-shaking manifesto for female self-worth that bristled at society's expectations while acknowledging her own shortcomings (\"Sexting you at the mental health talk seems counterproductive,\" she observed on Moody).",
      "After 10 years in mid-ranking indie band Slow Club, the album propelled her into uncharted realms.",
      "There were magazine covers, nominations for the Mercury Prize and Brit Awards, a starring role on stage in Cabaret, a support slot with Adele and, yes, an appearance on Celebrity Bake Off \u2013 where, unfortunately, she burned her crumpets.",
      "\"The week that Prioritise Pleasure came out, my whole life changed,\" she reflects.",
      "\"Not financially or in terms of fame, but it's like there was a knot in my stomach that untied.",
      "\"Then everyone was like, 'Right, can you do that again, please?'\"",
      "Taylor tore herself in two to make the follow-up, A Complicated Woman, which comes out on Friday.",
      "After playing it live for the first time in the West End on Wednesday, she describes the album's gestation process as \"horrible\", \"lonely\", and \"painful\".",
      "\"It just felt really stressful to execute what was in my head,\" she explains in a phone interview the next morning.",
      "\"I was thinking so big, but I still don't have access to the resources I need to make it as big as I wanted.\"",
      "Part of the problem was a punishing, but self-imposed, time limit.",
      "\"The music industry is like, 'You've got 10 minutes, then you're over and someone else is going to take your place',\" she explains.",
      "\"So I felt like I had no choice [but to commit to another record] if I wanted to build on what I'd done.",
      "\"But as painful as it was and as dark as it got, the second I'm back on stage performing it, I'm like, 'Oh, this is why I love it'.\"",
      "It all unravels",
      "She hasn't just made a new album - she has also created a daring, jaw-dropping theatrical experience to go with it.",
      "It's set in a sparse recreation of the community centre where eight-year-old Becky from Rotherham learned to tap dance.",
      "\"You just wanted to sing / You didn't know what that would bring,\" recalls an older, more cynical version of that child \u2013 as she assesses her life at the age of 38.",
      "\"This really is all there is, and that's what you've got to get comfortable with.\"",
      "As the show opens, 10 dancers line up on either side of her, dressed in austere outfits that recall The Handmaid's Tale.",
      "Initially, their movements are stiff and restricted but, as Taylor describes suffocating relationships with emotionally-stunted men, they start to thrash and jerk their bodies.",
      "\"We start in that world where we're shackled, and then we exorcise it,\" Taylor explains.",
      "\"Over the course of the show, it all unravels and everyone ends up being themselves instead of conforming to these societal norms.\"",
      "A four-night theatre residency is an unusual way to launch an album. The audience is unfamiliar with most of the songs, and no-one's sure whether to absorb the performance attentively, or sing along and dance.",
      "Several times, laughter ripples through the theatre as the singer's more acerbic observations hit home. The following morning, she's not quite sure what to make of the reaction.",
      "\"Every time people laugh, my heart sinks,\" she says. \"But then I'm like, the lyrics are funny, aren't they?",
      "\"And I love changing the laughter into emotion. It feels like people are laughing because it's uncomfortable.\"",
      "In the end, the audience members mirror the on-stage narrative. Shaking off their discomfort, they rise out of their seats and start making an almighty racket.",
      "The music becomes a soundtrack to solidarity - which, it transpires, was Taylor's intention.",
      "A Complicated Woman might be as cutting and powerful as its predecessor, but the melodies were designed for stadiums.",
      "\"Do you remember the Elbow song One Day Like This?\" she asks. \"The one that goes, 'Throw those curtains wii-iide'?",
      "\"I went mad for that song when it came out and, honestly, I played it over and over in the studio and said, 'I want to do this'.\"",
      "\"I was very inspired by trying to make it onto World Cup montages. That's a genre of music that I really, really enjoy.\"",
      "That's only half the story, though. The album is all about capturing the complex and contradictory impulses of a woman in her mid-30s.",
      "Recent single 69, for example, is a thumping house track on which Taylor talks with withering candour about her sex life. Imagine Madonna's Justify My Love, if she was really being honest.",
      "\"It's an idea I had for ages, of listing sex positions and scoring them so that there's no grey area [for prospective partners],\" the singer laughs.",
      "\"But there's a more political element, which is that women still aren't saying what they want in the bedroom. And I'm like, I can't bear this any more. Please let us just enjoy having sex.",
      "\"It's not exactly going to win an Ivor Novello Award for lyrics, but I think it stands on the album with moments that are more emotional and deep.\"",
      "Those moments include The Curse, a rousing ballad about using alcohol to dull her anxiety, which is possibly the best song Self Esteem's ever written.",
      "Her personal favourite, however, is called In Plain Sight. A collaboration with South African musician Moonchild Sanelly, it's a response to the criticism they've both received for speaking their minds.",
      "\"The world is saying who I am, but I thought I knew myself all these years,\" says Sanelly in a semi-improvised rap.",
      "\"I shrink to keep the peace, hoping I don't shake my purpose.\"",
      "It's a feeling Taylor immediately recognised.",
      "As excitement built around Prioritise Pleasure in 2021, she started getting \"nasty messages\" on social media, which shook her up.",
      "\"I was really shocked the first time I got grief, because no-one's ever been that bothered about what I'm doing,\" she says.",
      "\"People say you should ignore it, but if you went to a wedding and had a nice day and one person called you an [expletive], who would you go home thinking about? It's just human nature.\"",
      "Eventually, the criticism took its toll.",
      "\"There were moments where I considered giving up, which shocked me because I've been this defiant, angry thing for so long,\" she says.",
      "\"But over the last few years, especially with the world being like it is, I've definitely had feelings of protecting myself and shutting up.",
      "\"That's the saddest part of the album, really. But I found a way through.",
      "\"And if I can, then I hope the rest of the world can too, you know?\"",
      "That realisation is the connecting tissue of A Complicated Woman.",
      "Life is never easy, she says. No-one is ever truly satisfied. Relationships are hard work. You can't please everyone. But that's OK. You're OK. Trust your gut.",
      "She sums it up on Focus Is Power, held aloft by the sound of a gospel choir: \"And now I see it clear with every passing of each year / I deserve to be here.\"",
      "On stage in London, she sings those final lines a capella with her dancers and backing singers, arms wrapped around each other in a display of female solidarity.",
      "It's a cathartic moment after the bruising process of putting the album together.",
      "\"There's so much joy in being a woman and just being yourself can be beautiful,\" she says. \"You've just got to find a way to do it.\"",
      "With that, she's off to make tweaks for the show's second night. After that, she has to find a way to scale down the West End production for a UK tour.",
      "\"I'll do what I can to make it continue, but it's a huge risk because there's so little revenue from anything else,\" she says.",
      "Ultimately, though, her ambition is undimmed.",
      "\"I want to make 20 albums, I want to do bigger theatre shows,\" she says.",
      "\"Of course it'd be useful if I could 'cross over' because everything gets easier when you've got more resources.",

    "story": [
      "The best thing about Coachella is that it happens twice - so if you missed the first weekend, don't worry!",
      "Lady Gaga, Travis Scott, Charli XCX and everyone else will return to the Colorado Desert on Friday for a second dose of musical mayhem, and punishing gusts of wind.",
      "Better yet, the opening weekend let us know who was worth watching (Lady Gaga), who we can safely avoid (Travis Scott) and who might be this year's breakout star (Benson Boone).",
      "With that in mind, here's a guide to this weekend's sets - and when you can watch them on Coachella's comprehensive YouTube livestream.",
      "1) Lady Gaga confronts her inner demons",
      "Lady Gaga's elaborate stage performances have been known to collapse under the weight of their own ambition. Not this time.",
      "Her second visit to Coachella, after stepping in as a last-minute replacement for Beyonc\u00e9 in 2017, was one of the greatest pop performances ever. Two hours full of energy and presence and pounding synth hooks.",
      "Staged in a crumbling gothic opera house, the two-hour show depicted the star's  inner angels and demons wrestling for her soul.",
      "During Poker Face, the two sides faced off in a deadly game of chess; while Perfect Celebrity - a song about her tabloid commodification in the 2000s - saw her buried in a shallow grave, singing to a skeleton.",
      "It was bold and audacious and over the top, in all the best ways, with celebratory, nine-minute performance of Bad Romance to cap it all off.",
      "If you only watch one performance, make it this one.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 11:10pm on Friday (local time), or 7:10am on Saturday (UK time).",
      "2) Missy Elliot makes up for lost time",
      "Despite a career that's lasted three decades, Missy Elliot only staged her first ever tour last year.",
      "Luckily, tracks like Get Ur Freak On, Lose Control and Pass That Dutch still sound as fresh and futuristic now as they did first time around - and Missy's relative lack of stage experience was never apparent.",
      "She arrived onstage inside a giant car exo-skeleton, like a hip-hop Transformer, and sped through her set with pin-sharp choreography and boundless good humour.",
      "The only downside was that her set had to end after just 55 minutes.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 9:00pm on Friday (local time), or 5:00am on Saturday (UK time).",
      "3) Lola Young fights the flu",
      "\"I'm either going to faint or throw up,\" declared Lola Young near the start of her set last weekend. \"One of the two is about to happen\".",
      "The British singer, whose song Messy has been embraced by fans worldwide, was battling sickness and heatstroke throughout her set. But she powered through, leading a mass singalong to Messy, and debuting a new single called Spiders.",
      "With her health back on track, her second weekend performance should erase any bad memories from her debut.",
      "Watch on the Mojave Stage at 4:50pm on Friday (local time), or 12:50am on Saturday (UK time).",
      "4) Green Day are 'not part of the MAGA agenda'",
      "Although Travis Scott closed the main stage on Saturday, Green Day were technically the headliners - and the California band delivered a thrilling, cathartic set worthy of their billing.",
      "They plunged head-first into a furious rendition of American Idiot, keeping up their recent tradition of changing the lyrics, so that frontman Billie Joe Armstrong sang: \"I'm not part of the MAGA agenda\".",
      "That aside, politics were kept to a minimum, as the group delivered a high-voltage blast of their greatest hits, from the bratty pop-punk of Basket Case to the more reflective Boulevard of Broken Dreams.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 9:05pm on Saturday (local time), or 5:05am on Sunday (UK time).",
      "5) Post Malone's good-time hoedown",
      "\"Post-ee, Post-ee, Post-ee.\"",
      "It might have been the end of the weekend, but fans still had energy to spare for Post Malone's headline slot on Sunday night.",
      "He rewarded them with a laid-back set, that repurposed some of his earlier pop/rap hits with the \"yee-haw\" twang of his recent album F-1 Trillion.",
      "It all worked surprisingly well, although the eight-piece band occasionally overpowered his voice, and some fans were disappointed by the lack of hip-hop beats - saying the show would have been better suited to Coachella's sister festival Stagecoach (which is where Post launched his country phase last year).",
      "Surprisingly, the set was devoid of special guests, leading to speculation that the 29-year-old was holding fire for weekend two.",
      "As someone who's recently collaborated with Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Dolly Parton, that could definitely be worth staying up for.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 10:25pm on Sunday (local time), or 6:25am on Monday (UK time).",
      "6) Back to Black(pink)",
      "In 2019, Blackpink made history by becoming the first Korean group to headline Coachella. This year, two of its members - Lisa and Jennie - were back with dazzling solo sets, before the band reconvenes for a stadium tour in the summer.",
      "Lisa was up first, on Friday night, with a slick, highly-choreographed set that combined hard-edged rap cuts like Money and Lifestyle, with the softer sounds of Moonlit Floor and Dream.",
      "After her appearance in the third series of The White Lotus, she clarified that music is, in fact, her main job. Backstage, she held a post-mortem on the performance with her bandmate Ros\u00e9 (Conclusion: The desert wind makes it hard to sing).",
      "Jennie packed the Outdoor Theater on Sunday evening, for a set of clubby disco anthems that don't sound a million miles away from her friend and collaborator Dua Lipa.",
      "Highlights included the bombastic Like Jennie - produced by Diplo, and boasting it's own viral dance break -  and the swoonsome pop of Love Hangover, which showcased her vocal abilities.",
      "The 29-year-old has never been the most precise performer, but it somehow works to her advantage - making her more \"real\" than the imperious perfection of her peers.",
      "Watch Lisa on the Sahara Stage at 7:45pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45am on Saturday (UK time). Jennie plays the Outdoor Theatre at 7:45pm on Sunday (local time), or 3:45am on Monday (UK time).",
      "7) Brat Summer 2: Electric Boogaloo",
      "Charli XCX drew one of the weekend's biggest crowds, for a sleazy, hedonistic run-through of her sleazy, hedonistic breakout album, Brat.",
      "Performing entirely on her own, the star was in constant motion - a mesmerising blur of hip-rolls, hair tosses, stomach crunches and knee-drops, as she turned Coachella's main stage into sweat-drenched, laser-lit club night.",
      "Compared to the maximalism of other sets, it was a lesson in how one person can hold a stage on their own... Well, almost.",
      "At several points, she brought out her collaborators from Brat's companion album - Troye Sivan, Billie Eilish and Lorde. It was, one excitable fan commented, \"like The Avengers for gay people\".",
      "Whether the guest-list will be the same on Coachella's second weekend remains to be seen. But Charli is worth your time either way.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 7:15pm on Saturday (local time), or 3:15am on Sunday (UK time).",
      "8) Benson Boone vs d4vd",
      "Anyone who's had the pleasure of watching Benson Boone over the last year will know he's fond of performing a front flip off his piano, the big show off.",
      "He didn't let us down at Coachella - bouncing around the stage like a Duracell Bunny attached to a car battery. To cap it all off, he brought out Brian May for a surprisingly successful version of Bohemian Rhapsody.",
      "Less fortunate, however, was Texan singer d4vd, whose attempt at a backflip went disastrously wrong.",
      "Thankfully, he recovered in time to pull off an energetic set that highlighted the life-affirming vibes of his bedroom pop hits Feel It and What Are You Waiting For.",
      "After the set, he swore to practice harder for this weekend's performance. \"Imagine if I fall again,\" he cringed.",

    "published": "Sat, 19 Apr 2025 01:03:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Wrestling's main event is to stream live on Netflix for the first time - here's why it matters.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of wrestling fans across the world are gearing up for this weekend's much-anticipated annual finale - WrestleMania 41.",
      "Just ask seven-year-old Oliver, who's spent the past week of his school holidays waking his dad, Paul, at 6:30 to eagerly count down the days.",
      "He's even being allowed to get up at midnight to watch it, because, as one of the 17 million UK households subscribed to Netflix, the family now has live ringside access to the two-night Las Vegas extravaganza.",
      "It means Oliver will finally get to find out if 16-time champion John Cena, who's recently flipped from hero to villain as part of his farewell tour (leaving Oliver in shock), can defeat Cody Rhodes in a record-breaking win before retirement.",
      "It's all part of a $5bn (\u00a34bn) mega-deal bringing World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) archive and biggest events to the streamer - with WrestleMania now available live on Netflix in many international territories for the very first time. US viewers, however, will still be watching on NBC's Peacock, at least for now.",
      "The 10-year contract, which began earlier this year, connects WWE with a potential global audience of 700 million. It's central to WWE chief content officer Paul 'Triple H' Levesque's vision of making wrestling globally accessible and relevant to a new generation of streaming era fans.",
      "The stakes are high. WrestleMania, which began in 1985, is being treated as a litmus test - not just for WWE's global expansion, but for Netflix's potential move into live sports.",
      "But will this blockbuster tag-team partnership pay off, or will it prove one (very) expensive fight too far?",
      "On-demand chokehold",
      "The Netflix/WWE deal reflects changes in viewing habits, and also speaks to WWE's eagerness to be promoted by the \"winner of the streaming wars\", the Wrestlenomics website editor Brandon Thurston tells the BBC.",
      "After years of relying on cable pay-per-view  - which charged US viewers a hefty $60 (\u00a345) per event - WWE launched its own network in 2014. The company took most of its pay-per-view events in house, aware that half the revenue was being lost to satellite companies.",
      "The move paid off, says Thurston, as prices for pay-per-view events dropped significantly to around $10 (\u00a37.50), creating \"a larger audience than ever\".",
      "The Netflix deal is, according to Thurston, part of WWE's plans to recruit globally, create bigger international stars, and amplify its live tournaments such as Raw, WrestleMania and Smackdown across different markets.",
      "As WWE's Levesque told the Ankler podcast, Netflix's universal \"simplicity\" felt game-changing: \"No matter where you are in the globe, there it is right in front of you. It's one click, and you're on and you're in\".",
      "Good thing too, as Levesque says younger audiences have \"no concept\" of traditional television, and increasingly view on-demand streaming as the norm, alongside video platforms like YouTube and TikTok.",
      "It's certainly made Oliver a megafan, and he is now able to watch the weekly Smackdown and Raw shows with his dad. Previously, without a TNT sport subscription, his options were limited to the monthly events available on the WWE network.",
      "\"Now that WWE is on Netflix, he watches it probably four times a week. It's his go-to programme,\" says Paul.",
      "\"It's really opened up a huge door for him. What's great for me as a dad is I used to be into wrestling when I was his age as well, so it's nice to share that journey with him\".",
      "And he's far from alone. On Thursday, industry magazine Broadcast reported that the move to Netflix had significantly increased UK engagement with both shows, with Raw ranked among the platform's top 10 shows in nine of its first 10 weeks.",
      "The picture is less clear in the US. Back in February, Mark Shapiro, a chief at WWE parent company TKO, told investors that Raw viewership was up 13% for the year to date compared to its previous home on USA Network - rising to 38% if the heavily promoted opening night is included.",
      "However, Thurston's research suggests that Raw and Smackdown viewership has since levelled off to numbers seen on USA.",
      "And figures are continuing to fall, not to an alarming amount, but certainly indicating that, potentially, weekly events on the streamer may not be as much of a growth area as major live events.",
      "Regardless, he sees the trade-off as worth it for Netflix in the long run - particularly looking ahead to WrestleMania's global debut tonight, which is expected to break streaming records.",
      "'Boots on the ground'",
      "When former longtime WWE CEO Vince McMahon dreamt up WrestleMania more than 40 years ago, he envisaged a Superbowl-style set piece event to unite the franchise's commercial partnerships and burrow it deeper within popular culture.",
      "That's why 1985's first WrestleMania was heavily promoted through MTV and held at New York's Madison Square Garden - featuring everyone from wrestler Hulk Hogan to A-team actor Mr T, popstar Cyndi Lauper and Muhammad Ali as a referee.",
      "\"We were trying to make a statement as to what our business is,\" McMahon told Netflix's 2024 docuseries, \"all forms of entertainment rolled into one\".",
      "And yet despite turning WWE into a media empire, McMahon departed in disgrace - first in 2022 and then again in 2024, amid various controversies - including an ongoing sexual harassment lawsuit. McMahon's attorney, Jessica Rosenberg, denied the claims.",
      "Thurston feels McMahon's tight grip on creative business decisions also stifled WWE's storytelling in later years. Under Levesque, Thurston says that's changed in favour of collaboration. He says stories feel fresher, gender representation has improved and US event attendance is up.",
      "For Jonny Pivaral, who grew up watching during what he calls McMahon's \"bra and panties match\" era of the 2000s, the evolution is welcome. \"Back then, women were just eye candy,\" he says. \"Now they're being showcased on the same level as the men.\"",
      "This shift will be on full display when women's wrestling storylines take centre stage at WrestleMania. Top stars Rhea Ripley, Bianca Belair, and IYO SKY are to face off in a triple-threat match, while women's champion Tiffany Stratton will fight the legendary Charlotte Flair - in a battle that underlines the division's growing value.",
      "Attracting new audiences matters, Thurston says, because WWE's global strategy now hinges on fees paid by cities hosting these events (including WrestleMania), both inside and outside the USA.",
      "\"They want WrestleMania to become like the World Cup or Olympics, where there's a bidding war,\" he explains. \"Las Vegas is paying them $5 million for this year's event,\" he adds, noting that London has been heavily touted as a potential WrestleMania host city.",
      "Netflix's 'Sportainment' bet",
      "Finding a home on a streaming giant may be great news for WWE - but what does Netflix stand to gain from the partnership?",
      "According to James English, managing partner at sports and entertainment marketing agency Fuse, Netflix is \"stating loud and clear that it wants to dominate 'sportainment'\".",
      "Netflix has no input into making of WWE, says Triple H",
      "The WWE streaming deal is, he says, a major reason why Netflix beat expectations with its financial figures on Thursday, delivering 13% revenue growth for the first quarter of 2025.",
      "English sees WrestleMania as the natural progression in their drive to use sport to attract viewers to \"cultural moments\".",
      "This began last November with Mike Tyson taking on YouTuber Jake Paul in an influencer-boxing hybrid bout that drew in 60 million households - perhaps benefitting from cross-generational appeal.",
      "This first foray into live sports attracted complaints of crashing and buffering but the issues were largely fixed for Netflix's two NFL matches on Christmas Day a month later, part of a new three-year deal to show Christmas Day fixtures.",
      "English says that unlike Apple or Amazon Prime, which bought packages to the Major League Soccer (MLS) and the Premier League, Netflix's focus on \"event\" viewing allows them to make best use of their personalised advert and interface data.",
      "WrestleMania exemplifies this strategy. As a \"live, global, fan-driven deal that blends sports, entertainment and storytelling\", English says Netflix could stand to make huge profits from its WWE partnership.",
      "The big question, of course, is whether wider Netflix audience interest will last the rounds.",
      "But it may be a gamble worth taking - for all involved. Just ask Oliver and his Dad at midnight."

      "The reboot of the 2017 Fyre Festival - which made international headlines, sparked a hit Netflix documentary and resulted in organiser Billy McFarland going to jail for fraud - was due to take place in Mexico from 30 May to 2 June.",
      "McFarland's second attempt to stage the event was announced not long after he was released from prison, with ticket prices ranging from $1,400 (\u00a31,058) to $1.1m (\u00a3831,534).",
      "But now the organisers are reportedly looking for a new location for the festival, with the scheduled dates uncertain.",

      "The organisers said in a further update reported by NBC and the New York Times that Fyre 2 was \"still on\".",
      "\"We are vetting new locations and will announce our host destination soon. Our priorities remain unchanged: delivering an unforgettable, safe, and transparent experience,\" the update said.",

      "McFarland and Fyre Festival 2 posted documents on Instagram that they said showed approval for the event. One document indicated permission for 250 people at a venue. McFarland had said 1,800 tickets were for sale.",
      "To many, the latest developments will come as little surprise.",
      "The original Fyre was promoted by supermodels and celebrities as an exclusive getaway for the ultra-rich, and the location was hyped as a private island once owned by drug lord Pablo Escobar.",
      "But festival-goers arrived in the Bahamas to find all the talent cancelled, bare mattresses to sleep on in storm-ravaged tents and cheese sandwiches in takeaway containers to eat.",
      "McFarland was sentenced in 2018 to six years in jail for wire fraud, and was also ordered to return $29m to investors.",
      "He was freed in 2022 under an early release programme but remains on probation until August.",

      "He claimed he had spent a year planning it, and had already sold 100 tickets at an \"early bird\" rate of $499. It is unclear how many tickets have been sold to date.",
      "No line-up for the festival has been announced.",
      "Last year, Andy King, an investor in the first Fyre Festival, issued a warning to anyone interested in going to its planned reboot: \"Proceed with caution.\"",

    "story": [
      "After British actress Aimee Lou Wood called a Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that impersonated her using exaggerated prosthetic teeth \"mean and unfunny,\" impressionists have told BBC News how they tread the line between being funny and offensive.",
      "It all began with five minutes on NBC last Saturday night.",
      "Titled The White Potus - a spin on hit HBO dark comedy The White Lotus - a SNL sketch depicted US president Donald Trump, his family and top team spending time at a fictional tropical hotel.",
      "After jokes showing Eric Trump blending a gold Rolex watch and Ivanka Trump rejecting a spiritual call to give up material wealth, Wood's White Lotus character Chelsea is portrayed by cast member Sarah Sherman using a pronounced accent and large teeth.",
      "In response to a comment made by a character playing US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, she asks: \"Fluoride? What's that?\"",
      "The mineral is added to some water supplies and brands of toothpaste to help prevent tooth decay.",
      "'Bit of a cheap shot'",
      "For BBC Radio 4's Dead Ringers star Jan Ravens, the first misstep of the writers behind the SNL sketch was \"not reading the room\".",
      "It was a bad idea to joke about someone's appearance in a sketch about The White Lotus, Ravens says, given Wood's casting has been praised for a character lacking \"those all-American, fake-looking teeth\".",
      "\"In the wake of all that, she's been talking about how she was bullied at school and the butt of jokes. So then you think, 'why would you do that joke'?\"",
      "It meant that in making fun of Wood's appearance, the sketch \"punched down,\" says Ravens.",
      "\"You might make a joke about Donald Trump's appearance because you're definitely not punching down on the most powerful man in the western world.\"",
      "Ronni Ancona, co-writer and star of the early 2000s TV series The Big Impression, said she \"could see\" that the writers were also trying to make a point about US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's pledge to remove fluoride from US drinking water.",
      "But in doing so, \"they would have made this tenuous link between fluoride and Aimee Lou's teeth. It's a bit of a cheap shot,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "After the show aired, Wood, 31, said she was \"not thin skinned\" and understood that SNL was about \"caricature\".",
      "\"But the whole joke was about fluoride,\" she wrote on Sunday. \"I have big gap teeth not bad teeth.\"",
      "Later on, in a post on social media, she said: \"I've had apologies from SNL.\"",
      "However, Francine Lewis, a comedian whose impersonations have earned her a large following on social media, says the whole purpose of the US show is to \"take the mick\".",
      "While she can sympathise with someone being \"embarrassed\" by being the target of a sketch, Lewis adds that she thinks Wood's response was \"too sensitive\".",
      "In her own impressions of celebrities, which include TV stars Gemma Collins and Stacey Solomon, Lewis has stuffed a pillow up her top to appear to be physically larger and put cotton wool on her teeth \"to make them really white and jut out a bit\".",
      "In recent times, both fans and some of her targets have taken offence.",
      "\"I don't know if it's just the new generation of young people that just take offence to every little thing,\" she says.",
      "\"People that say you're a troll, you're a bully... I find myself hiding at celebrity events because I think 'oh I do their impression, they might not like me'.\"",
      "But she believes that being impersonated is actually a marker of someone's popularity and fame, saying that \"it means you've arrived\".",
      "Rather than adapting her impressions, Lewis is steadfast in her belief that \"to make comedy funny, unfortunately you have to overstep the mark.\"",
      "'Got to have the mickey taken'",
      "It's a view shared by Steve Nallon, known for impersonating former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on satirical TV programme Spitting Image.",
      "\"What caricaturists do by nature... is exaggerate the physicality. If a caricaturist is stopped from doing that, there's no point in him being a caricaturist,\" he says.",
      "During the 1980s, one of his targets - former Labour minister Roy Hattersley - was mocked for a slight speech impediment, with water spurting out of his mouth as he spoke.",
      "\"The joke was Roy Hattersley spits,\" says Nallon, who adds that Hattesley allegedly got on board with the joke after initially taking offence.",
      "For Nallon, those in the public eye will always be fair game. \"Maybe it's not a bad lesson to learn that you've got to have the mickey taken out of you occasionally,\" he says.",
      "But times have changed. Ravens says that \"people are much more sensitive\" about targeting certain aspects of people's appearances and mannerisms \"than they used to be earlier on in my career, for example, and I think rightly so\".",
      "This is not the first time SNL has received criticism of their portrayals.",
      "It doesn't mean the comedy is lost, says Ravens. In political satire - which was the main thrust of the SNL sketch - a really good impression satirises what the person is saying, rather than just fixating on how they look or how they deliver it, she adds.",
      "During our phone interview, she seamlessly breaks into an impression of former UK Prime Minister Theresa May, but notes that just speaking in a tense, clipped way, \"is only good for one line really\".",

    "summary": "Portraying some of the most famous people on the planet has its challenges, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Playing any well-known figure from recent history is a challenge, but the challenge of finding four actors to put in convincing portrayals of four of the most famous people in popular culture is one not many directors have attempted.",
      "Earlier this month, director Sam Mendes announced the cast for his four-part Beatles biopic, with each member of the band set to be the subject of their own feature-length films set for release in 2028.",
      "Actors Harris Dickinson, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan will play John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr respectively.",
      "Their performances \u2013 and particularly their efforts at the Beatles' distinctive accents \u2013 will be closely watched by fans the world over. And if previous actors' attempts are anything to go by, they should brace themselves for some serious scrutiny.",
      "'Suspend disbelief'",
      "Perhaps one of the most famous and successful Beatles biopics is 1994's Backbeat, set in the band's 1960-1962 Hamburg era.",
      "On the one hand, it had Liverpool actor Ian Hart turning in a convincing Lennon (even if he was not exactly Lennon's double).",
      "But on the other, Hollywood actor Stephen Dorff, playing the film's lead character of original Beatles bass player and artist Stuart Sutcliffe, who died of a brain haemorrhage aged just 21, provided an uncanny likeness. But his attempt at the Liverpool accent has received, over the years since, reviews from \"decent\" to \"variable\" to \"awful\".",
      "So should any actor taking on a Beatle role be wary?",
      "Beatles historian Paul Du Noyer, who wrote The Beatles: The Complete Illustrated Story and Conversations With Paul McCartney, said: \"The Beatles are so well known to us all, not just their faces but every nuance of the way they talk, every mannerism.",
      "\"Many of us know the Beatles as well as we know our own families. It can be difficult for us to suspend the disbelief.",
      "\"Even when I've seen performances that were very good, for example Ian Hart in Backbeat, that got around the problem of the familiarity by dwelling on a lesser-known period of their story.\"",
      "Du Noyer added that some Beatles might seem easier to take off than others.",
      "\"In some ways, you stick a wig and a beard on someone, little round granny glasses and a white suit and everyone goes, 'It's John Lennon'\"",
      "But he said McCartney was a tougher portrayal to nail \u2013 especially when the man himself is a tough critic.",
      "\"Paul has been very critical of films like [Sam Taylor-Wood's early years biopic of John Lennon] Nowhere Boy, and Backbeat, because they tend to fall into a pastiche of McCartney that he doesn't recognise \u2013 he doesn't like the stereotype of him being the cute one, the manipulative one.\"",
      "So does Sam Mendes have a job on his hands?",
      "Du Noyer added: \"He's got bankable stars, who won't let themselves down. I know there's been some disappointment among Liverpudlians because non-Liverpudlians have been cast in the roles, but even as a loyal Liverpudlian I can't condemn Sam Mendes on the casting, because he is making films for the whole world to watch.",
      "\"I think the accuracy of the Liverpool accent will be pretty low down the list of things he needs to cover.\"",
      "'Don't hear it any more'",
      "Edda Sharpe, a Merseyside-based voice and dialect coach who has worked with actors at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre, said there were some specific challenges to taking on the voice of a Beatle.",
      "Among them is the fact that the accent with which John, Paul, George and Ringo spoke is much less pronounced than the one many might associate with Liverpool today.",
      "Beatles aficionados will know that on the Let It Be album version of the old Liverpool folk tune Maggie May, Lennon deliberately exaggerated the Liverpool accent, elongating his vowels and adding a much more nasal quality to it.",
      "The performance has more in common with today's Scouse accent than it did with the one the Beatles spoke with.",
      "\"And the challenge is, the way the Beatles spoke, you just don't hear that any more. It's a completely different tone to the Liverpool accent we are currently exposed to,\" Sharpe said.",
      "\"And you are not just trying to create the sound of someone from Liverpool in the 1960s, you are trying to create the sound of people that everyone is familiar with.\"",
      "She said there might be advantages for Irish actors Mescal and Keoghan, as there are certain common traits to both Liverpool and Irish accents.",
      "But she said similarities in accent could also prove problematic for actors.",
      "\"The northern Irish accent, particularly, has this sort of down-and-then-up quality, and when you listen to early recordings of the Beatles you hear what sounds like a familiar Irish pattern.",
      "\"But sometimes accents that are closer to your own are harder to do than ones that are completely different.\"",
      "'More Scouse'",
      "Dr Paul Cooper, a senior lecturer in English Language at the University of Liverpool, said there was academic research to back up the idea that \"Scouse was getting more Scouse\" than it used to be in the time of the Beatles.",
      "He said research by linguistics expert Marten Juskan into the changing sound of the Scouse accent supported the claim.",
      "\"Also,\" said Cooper, \"I think younger people are now looking at the accent more favourably than maybe it was looked at 30 or 40 years ago.",
      "\"There's always been a strong sense of pride in the accent, but I think in the 1980s and 1990s you got the Harry Enfield Scousers stuff and it maybe became viewed a bit more negatively.",
      "\"I think now it's viewed a bit more favourably again. Plus, Liverpool is much more of a tourist destination now, and the accent is thought of as very welcoming and very friendly.\"",
      "But what does an actor who has taken on not one but two Beatle roles think the challenge will be for the actors taking on the Fab Four in Mendes' films?",
      "Michael Hawkins played John Lennon in the successful stage show Cilla: The Musical based on the life and career of Liverpool entertainer Cilla Black, and, in his first TV role, George Harrison in the 2014 ITV serial biopic Cilla, with Sheridan Smith taking the title role.",
      "Hawkins said: \"You've got to do your research, watch as much stuff as you can.",
      "\"Obviously in the films like Hard Days Night they're sort of playing a version of themselves, but with the Get Back film, you see more of them as how they were.",
      "\"So many people feel like they know them so well that if you get something a little off, it'll make people wince.",
      "\"It's about getting the authenticity, and not doing a caricature.\"",
      "The 35-year-old, a member of \"parody band\" Ugly Baby, said even as a born-and-bred Scouser he was not immune from scrutiny for his portrayal of Harrison in Cilla.",
      "He added: \"I didn't really change my accent much for playing George. And then one of my mates sent me a review, from the Mirror, I think it was, where they were saying George's accent was just a general northern one, with no hint of the 'Pool.",
      "\"And I was the only Scouser out of the four of us.\"",

      "A statement issued through the star's agent in 2017, when he was aged 60, said he \"will no longer be working as an actor\".",
      "Again, however, that proved not to be permanent. Day-Lewis is soon to star in Anemone, the debut feature film from his son Ronan Day-Lewis. Daniel and Ronan co-wrote the script which \"explores the intricate relationships between fathers, sons and brothers, and the dynamics of familial bonds\".",
      "Whether it's a one-off due to the family connection or the start of a big return to film remains to be seen.",
      "3. Jack Nicholson",
      "Nicholson is one of only three actors (including Day-Lewis, above) to have won three Academy Awards for acting. Two of Nicholson's were for best actor (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets) and another for best supporting actor (Terms of Endearment).",
      "The legendary star's other famous roles include Easy Rider, The Shining, The Departed, A Few Good Men and Batman.",
      "Although he's never formally announced he is quitting or retiring, he previously said his retreat from the spotlight was brought on by a desire to not \"be out there anymore\".",
      "His last film role was in 2010 romcom How Do You Know.",
      "But just last week, that film's director James L Brooks told Hollywood Reporter: \"I wouldn't be surprised to see Jack work again. I mean, it's been a hunk of time but I don't know. Maybe it could be the right thing. He's reading scripts all the time, I think.\"",
      "4. Greta Garbo",
      "Legendary Swedish screen siren Greta Garbo declared in 1941 at the ripe old age of 36 that she would be taking a \"temporary\" retirement.",
      "It proved to be permanent. The Camille and Queen Christina star never appeared on film again.",
      "Always the reluctant celebrity, the reclusive actress never played the Hollywood game, refusing interviews and avoiding film premieres and other public appearances.",
      "The enigmatic star, whose famous line \"I want to be alone\" from Grand Hotel somewhat mirrored her desire in real life as well as on screen, only succeeded in increasing her mystique by stepping away from the spotlight.",
      "However, she later clarified in an interview: \"I never said: 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be let alone! There is all the difference'.\"",
      "One of the few silent movie stars to transition successfully to the \"talkies\", Garbo moved away from Hollywood to New York, where she lived until her death in 1990 at the age of 84.",
      "5. Sean Connery",
      "Synonymous with James Bond, the late Scottish star first found fame through modelling and body-building before landing a few small theatre and TV roles.",
      "He made his film debut in No Road Back in 1957, but playing Secret Intelligence Service agent 007 in Dr No a few years later gave him his big breakthrough. He went on to star in five further Bond movies including From Russia with Love and Goldfinger.",
      "Connery appeared in numerous other films over his long career, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie, The Man Who Would Be King opposite Sir Michael Caine, The Untouchables (for which he won an Oscar) and The Hunt for Red October. But he would forever be wedded to 007.",
      "In 2005, however, he said he was \"fed up with the idiots\" adding there was an \"ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who greenlight the movies.\"",
      "That declaration came a couple of years after he starred in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which many concluded was one of the main reasons for his retirement.",
      "The poorly received comic book caper was to be his final screen appearance.",
      "6. Rick Moranis",
      "Kids of the 80s and 90s: You know. This guy was a huge star back in the day, the comedy backbone of popular films such as Ghostbusters, Honey I Shrunk The Kids and the musical Little Shop of Horrors (Suddenly, Seymour anyone?).",
      "But then he just seemed to disappear off the face of the earth. So what happened?",
      "He began to cut back on work after his wife died of cancer in 1991 to concentrate on raising his children, with his final big screen outing being the 1997 sequel Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves.",
      "\"I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the travelling involved in making movies,\" he told USA Today in 2005.",
      "\"So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it.\"",
      "He did continue to do voiceover work, however, and Moranis was set to make a comeback in a Honey I Shrunk the Kids reboot, which sadly fell through.",
      "7. Gene Hackman",
      "We sadly lost this acting legend earlier this year, along with his second wife Betsy Arakawa, but the star hadn't been seen on screen for years after retiring from the profession on the advice of his heart doctor - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico.",
      "Hackman shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s and was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman.",
      "He chose to bow out from acting in the political satire Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.",
      "Explaining his decision, he told Reuters that he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note.",
      "\"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\"",
      "8. Bridget Fonda",
      "Fonda, from the famous family dynasty, is another star who quit at the height of her fame.",
      "Starring in 80s and 90s hits such as Scandal (about the Profumo Affair), Cameron Crowe's Singles, The Godfather Part III and Single White Female (everyone wanted to copy that elfin crop, not just Jennifer Jason Leigh). And then... nothing.",
      "Fonda never formally retired, she just seemed to retreat. Her last big screen appearance was in The Whole Shebang in 2001.",
      "When asked in 2023 by a reporter if she would return to acting at some point, she replied: \"I don't think so, it's too nice being a civilian.\" Fair enough!",
      "Fonda's aunt Jane also quit acting in 1990 for several years, explaining later in Vogue that \"she wasn't having fun anymore\".",
      "But she later came out of retirement for the romcom movie Monster-in-Law.",
      "\"It was just a gut feeling of, Why the hell not? It'd been 15 years, and I wanted to act again.\"",
      "9. Shelley Duvall",
      "Another star we sadly lost in the last year, Shelley Duval was best known for her roles in film like The Shining, Annie Hall and Nashville.",
      "Her step back from the spotlight wasn't just her choice. Movie roles began to drop off in the 90s and then she decided to move back to Texas after her brother was diagnosed with cancer.",
      "A year before her death, she told People magazine: \"It's the longest sabbatical I ever took but it was for really important reasons - to get in touch with my family again.\"",
      "Duvall did return to acting in horror movie, 2023's The Forest Hills.",
      "\"Acting again - it's so much fun. It enriches your life,\" she told People.",

      "10. Ke Huy Quan",
      "Who could forget 2024 award season's most charming star, Oscar winner and Everything, Everywhere All At Once actor Ke Huy Quan?",
      "He first found fame as a child actor in the 80s when he landed the role of Short Round in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, before taking another starring role in childhood adventure hit The Goonies.",
      "A couple of TV roles followed but then the work largely dried up, and he settled for working behind the scenes as a stunt co-ordinator and assistant director.",
      "\"It's always difficult to make the transition from a child actor to an adult actor,\" he told the Telegraph. \"But when you're Asian, then it's 100 times more difficult.\"",
      "He reluctantly gave up - only due to lack of opportunity - and it took years before he took a punt on inventive, off-the wall movie Everything, Everywhere, All At Once, where his role as Waymond Wang won him an Oscar and made him a Hollywood darling once again.",

    "summary": "The magazine, seen on news stands since 1885, has formally announced it will cease publication.",
    "story": [
      "The Lady, Britain's longest-running women's magazine, has formally announced that it has ceased publication.",
      "The magazine is famed for its etiquette advice and adverts for butlers, nannies and discreet liaisons with well-heeled 60-somethings.",
      "In a statement, the publishers confirmed recent media reports that the April edition of the magazine will be the last, but added that the website with its jobs board and recruitment agency will continue.",
      "Here's a look back at its place in, and impact on, British culture over 140 years.",
      "The 'whole field of womanly action'",
      "The Lady was established in 1885 by Thomas Gibson Bowles, as a magazine for gentlewomen, a weekly guide to navigating the social minefield of well-to-do British life.",
      "Its very distinctive character was affectionately lampooned by PG Wodehouse. In his Jeeves stories, Bertie Wooster is briefly employed by a magazine called Milady's Boudoir, which was housed \"in one of those rummy streets in the Covent Garden neighbourhood\".",
      "The real Lady Magazine just happened to be in Bedford Street in Covent Garden.",
      "The Lady's fame owed much to its advice to women on the mysteries of the British class system. In 1936, for instance, its readers were given an update on the acceptability of novels.",
      "\"The reading of fiction, not long ago thought deplorable by nearly all social workers, is now becoming almost a virtue,\" it noted.",
      "Its first edition began with an explanation that its objective was to cover \"the whole field of womanly action\".",
      "Almost all of it was written by a man - Bowles - using various aliases. It was not a huge success. Fortunes changed in 1894 when he appointed his children's governess, Rita Shell, to be editor.",
      "'How to sack a servant'",
      "Under Shell's control, it became a successful weekly guide to women who found themselves in charge of both a household and a budget to outsource the daily drudgery to the lower classes.",
      "In December 1927, it cautioned young women \"to become a good cook before you marry, darling. Then you will be competent to rebuke a staff of domestics or to dispense with one\".",
      "Eighty years later, those concerns remained central. Editor Rachel Johnson was a firm believer in not being too familiar with staff, writing: \"Never sit in the kitchen chatting to your nanny, it'll end in tears before bedtime.\"",
      "And even today there are still pages of classified adverts for livery workers and other assorted varieties of domestic help but the demand now is more for live-in carers for the elderly than butlers or nannies.",
      "Rebranding The Lady",
      "That age profile has long been a concern. In 2009, Johnson was taken on to give the magazine a more youthful rebrand. She was asked to halve the average of the reader, which was, when she started, 78.",
      "A Channel 4 documentary revealed it was not universally welcomed, and Johnson's diaries later catalogued all the difficulties of aiming articles at  younger readers amongst adverts for walk-in baths and absorbent underwear along with products to remove their associated odours. It was an eventful three years that made more than a few headlines.",
      "Nevertheless, while the readership did briefly increase, like most print magazines, sales have been in sharp decline in recent years. Once a weekly, it went from fortnightly to monthly. The last published figures in 2023 revealed it sold just under 18,000 copies an issue.",
      "Custard creams in the safe",
      "And while the website will continue, it is the end of the line for a very distinctive bit of British culture.",
      "The current owner of The Lady is the great grandson of the founder, Thomas Bowles. Ben Budworth has spent 17 years trying to keep it afloat.",
      "He took over the running of the magazine in 2008 and oversaw the controversial rebrand. His decision to sell off the Covent Garden offices and move production to a business park in Borehamwood in Hertfordshire was met with protest.",
      "The premises on Bedford Street were seen by many of the staff as more than just another office, they helped define The Lady's character.",
      "No-one had a direct phone line. Instead, calls all went through a telephonist. One former editor said work would stop at 2pm to listen to the Archers, and again at 3:30pm for tea.",
      "Johnson said the wall safe was where the tins of custard creams were stored. One particular perk was her own peach-coloured WC. Each day she would be handed two freshly laundered towels.",
      "The building was a reminder of its long history and the magazine's many contributors, among them Lewis Carroll, Nancy Mitford and Stella Gibbons, who while giving the impression of being hard at work wrote Cold Comfort Farm in the magazine's offices.",
      "The L word",
      "However, heritage does not pay bills. Problems with a tax demand made headlines in 2024 and suggested the move to Hertfordshire had not solved the financial woes.   The problem of the shrinking and ageing readership was never going away.",
      "Even the word lady has shifted over the years from being an aspiration to a term widely regarded as demeaning and disparaging.",
      "And while there are older magazines, such as The People's Friend (which did not begin as a magazine aimed specifically at women) and the American Harper's Bazaar, which absorbed the even older British stalwart Queen, the Lady has a good claim on being the UK's oldest surviving women's magazine.",
      "However, 140 years on, a magazine that once billed itself as an indispensable guide to society has found that society has moved on."

      "But after more than four decades on stage and screen, in shows such as Calendar Girls, Eastenders and Doctor Who, even she wasn't prepared for the fear of making her debut at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.",
      "\"I keep thinking to myself 'what on earth am I doing?' I don't need to do this, and I have to admit it's absolutely terrifying,\" she says.",
      "Her show Motorhome Marilyn is based on a passing glimpse of a real person she encountered years ago on the streets of Los Angeles.",
      "\"I saw this woman coming out of a motorhome near the place where the stars are on the pavement,\" says Collins. \"She was dressed as Marilyn Monroe, in a white halterneck dress, and she popped some money in the parking meter.",
      "\"It was the strangest image. I never saw her again but I never forgot her.\"",
      "Collins, who is best known for her portrayal of Cindy Beale in Eastenders, began turning that one moment into a play about an aspiring actress with an obsessive interest in Hollywood legend Marilyn Monroe.",
      "She worked with writer and actor Stewart Permutt, who she met through festival veteran and friend Miriam Margolyes.",
      "\"I found a producer, we decided to take it to Edinburgh, we had a venue, we made posters and a short trailer for the show,\" she says.",
      "\"And then Covid happened.\"",
      "The festival was cancelled in 2020 and greatly curtailed the following year. Everything went on hold.",
      "Sadly, Permutt died last year. But he left his literary estate, including the first draft of Motorhome Marilyn, to Collins.",

      "\"It became evident to me that this was the gold standard for festivals wherever you are in the world, even on the tip of Africa,\" he says.",
      "Back then, his was one of seven fringe festivals which had begun working together to further their common aims. Today, more than 300 festivals from around the world are linked in a new network, and he says the advice they share is vital.",
      "\"It can be a lonely job running a festival,\" he adds. \"Just the comfort of knowing that on your phone is a person who is going through the same thing.",

      "The August festivals have come in for a lot of scrutiny in recent years due to their effect on the letting sector in the capital.",
      "The sheer scale of the festival both benefits and strains the resources of the city. But for Lankester, it's all a question of perspective.",
      "\"We can't necessarily fix Edinburgh's accommodation crisis ourselves but we need to be there when it is under discussion,\" he says.",
      "\"The scale of the Edinburgh Fringe is staggering. It's a mammoth event and has huge impact but the approach I've always taken is to not focus on the big number.",

      "\"Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged,\" he said.",
      "Mr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - essentially rewrote the rules of hip-hop in the 1990s, but his career has been punctuated by controversies.",
      "Here is a timeline of his career and the accusations against him.",
      "1969-89: Early life in New York",
      "Sean John Combs was born in Harlem and raised in Mount Vernon, New York.",
      "His mother, Janice, was a teacher's assistant, while his father Melvin was a former member of the US Air Force who became an associate of the drug-trafficker Frank Lucas, who later inspired the Ridley Scott film American Gangster.",
      "In 1972, Melvin was fatally shot in his car during a drug transaction after being misidentified as an informant. Combs was just two, although he didn't learn the circumstances of his father's death until much later.",
      "Raised by his mother, he was a flashy kid who loved rap music and played football for the school team.",
      "As a teenager, he danced in music videos for artists such as Diana Ross and the Fine Young Cannibals.",
      "Taking a cue from his mother, who worked multiple jobs to support Sean and his sister Keisha, he also worked six separate newspaper delivery routes, before enrolling to study business administration at Howard University.",
      "Early 1990s: Party plans turn into tragedy",
      "At university, Mr Combs gained a reputation for throwing lavish parties, some of which attracted more than a thousand guests.",
      "After booking musicians such as Heavy D and Terry Riley to play at these gigs, he came to the attention of Uptown Records' founder Andre Harrell, who gave him an internship in New York.",
      "Mr Combs eventually dropped out of university to work there full-time, guiding the early careers of artists including Mary J Blige and Jodeci.",
      "However, tragedy struck in 1991, when Mr Combs co-promoted a celebrity basketball game and concert at City College of New York. Nearly 5,000 people showed up to the gymnasium, which could only fit 2,730 people. In the ensuing crush, nine people died and 29 people were injured.",
      "An inquiry by the New York Mayor's Office cited Mr Combs for hiring inexperienced security guards. However, the star and his lawyers maintained he was not responsible for security at the event.",
      "\"City College is something I deal with every day of my life,\" the musician said in 1998. \"But the things that I deal with can in no way measure up to the pain that the families deal with. I just pray for the families and pray for the children who lost their lives every day.\"",
      "No criminal charges were filed over the tragedy, but family members of the people who died sued the promoters, the college and the city, accusing them of negligence.",
      "The case was settled for $3.8m (\u00a33m), of which Mr Combs paid $750,000.",
      "Mid-to-late 1990s: A new beginning",
      "Mr Combs struck upon the idea of pairing R&B singers like Mary J Blige with the street-tough sounds of hip-hop",
      "While at Uptown, Mr Combs signed a young Brooklyn rapper called Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or the Notorious B.I.G. - and started work on his debut album.",
      "But his relationship with Harrell broke down and Mr Combs was fired. He retaliated by setting up his own label, Bad Boy Records, and taking Biggie with him.",
      "The star's debut album, Ready To Die, was hailed as an all-time rap classic, selling millions of copies and generating the multi-platinum singles Juicy and Big Poppa.",
      "Mr Combs quickly expanded the Bad Boy roster, releasing hit albums by Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112 and Total.",
      "The label's sound was slick and polished. Its biggest singles lifted chunky samples from well-known hits. The practice was frowned upon by hip-hop purists, but it was catnip to radio programmers.",
      "1997: Notorious B.I.G. is murdered",
      "The Notorious B.I.G. and Puff Daddy (as he was then known) on the set of the Hypnotize music video in 1997",
      "In March 1997, Biggie Smalls was gunned down in a drive-by shooting at the age of 24.",
      "The murder has never been solved, but it has consistently been linked to the East-Coast-West-Coast rivalry that consumed rap music in the 1990s and which had previously claimed the life of Tupac Shakur.",
      "Mr Combs, who had been travelling in the car behind his friend, poured his grief into a song, I'll Be Missing You, which became one of the biggest songs of 1997.",
      "The song, based around The Police's Every Breath You Take, also featured on Mr Combs' debut album, No Way Out, which sold seven million copies worldwide.",
      "1999: New York shooting",
      "By this stage, Bad Boy had become one of the most important labels in rap. Aside from its own releases, artists including Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez were asking Mr Combs to remix their songs, hoping for a dash of hip-hop credibility.",
      "But there was trouble, too. In May 1999, Mr Combs was arrested on suspicion of assaulting Interscope Records executive Steve Stoute, after a disagreement over a music video. He pleaded guilty to harassment and was sentenced to a one-day anger management class, external.",
      "Later that year, he was charged with criminal possession of a weapon when police found two nine-millimetre guns in his car, after an argument in a club turned violent.",
      "Mr Combs and his then girlfriend Jennifer Lopez were both arrested. Mr Combs was later acquitted of all charges, external. Lopez was not charged.",

      "After hearing it on a night out, Mr Combs convinces Cassie (as she is known professionally) to join Bad Boy Records for a 10-album deal.",
      "Her self-titled debut was released in 2008 and its futuristic, space-age R&B proved to be a hit with critics.",
      "By that stage, Mr Combs and Ventura were in a relationship. But in a civil lawsuit filed in December 2023, she said the mogul had used his position of power to \"set the groundwork\" for a \"manipulative and coercive romantic and sexual relationship\".",
      "Her lawsuit included multiple graphic descriptions of violent abuse, alleging that Mr Combs \"regularly beat and kicked Ms Ventura, leaving black eyes, bruises, and blood\".",
      "Ventura also alleged sexual abuse and rape, and claimed that many of these incidents were witnessed by Mr Combs' \"tremendously loyal network\" who \"were not willing to do anything meaningful\" to stop the violence.",
      "Mr Combs strenuously denied the allegations and accused Ventura of trying to extort him. They settled the case a day after it was filed in New York, with Mr Combs' lawyer saying the settlement was \"in no way an admission of wrongdoing\".",
      "2007-2024: Business ventures",
      "Music took a back seat after 2007, when Mr Combs signed a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand, C\u00eeroc, in the US for a 50-50 profit split.",
      "His endorsement saw the brand placed in dozens of music videos - including Diddy's own single \"Ciroc Star\" - and helped increase sales from 40,000 to 2,000,000 cases per year by 2014.",
      "Around the same time, he co-founded the media company Revolt, whose TV channels and websites are described as \"the unapologetic, authoritative voice of hip-hop culture\".",
      "Mr Combs' involvement with both companies came to an end in 2023-24. He had previously sued Diageo, accusing it of neglecting his brand because of race.",
      "2015: Arrested for fighting football coach",
      "In 2015, Mr Combs got into a scuffle with his son's football coach prompted by an argument during training.",
      "As the row escalated, Mr Combs allegedly threatened an intern with a kettle bell. He was later arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon.",
      "The charges were subsequently dropped. A representative for Mr Combs said press accounts of the incident were \"wholly inaccurate\".",
      "2019: Gina Huynh alleges abuse",
      "The first allegations of abuse to surface against Mr Combs came from his model ex-girlfriend Gina Huynh.",
      "Although largely unreported at the time, Huynh gave an interview to YouTube personality Tasha K, where she said Mr Combs had been physically abusive and offered her money to get an abortion during their on-off, five-year relationship.",
      "On one occasion, she alleged that Mr Combs had once \"stomped on my stomach really hard - like, took the wind out of my breath\".",
      "He did not respond to the accusations.",
      "September 2023: Musical comeback",
      "The musician won a lifetime achievement award last year, shortly before accusation against him started piling up",

      "The release coincided with Mr Combs being named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.",
      "In November, The Love Album earned the star his first solo nomination at the Grammys, in the best progressive R&B album category.",
      "However, he pulled out of the ceremony as his legal troubles mounted.",
      "November 2023: Three lawsuits in one week",
      "In the same week as Cassie filed (and settled) her lawsuit against Mr Combs, two more women came forward with claims of abuse and assault.",
      "In a complaint filed in Manhattan, Joi Dickerson-Neal accused the star of drugging and sexually assaulting her when she was a college student in 1991. She also claimed he recorded the attack and distributed the footage without her consent.",
      "A third woman, Liza Gardner, also filed court papers accusing Mr Combs of coercing her into sex in the early 1990s and then, a couple of days later, choking her so hard that she passed out.",
      "The lawsuits all came shortly before the expiration of the New York Adult Survivors Act, which temporarily allowed people who said they were sexually abused to file claims, even after the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "Mr Combs denied all the allegations against him, while his spokesperson called the lawsuits a \"money grab\".",
      "\"The claims involving alleged misconduct against Mr Combs from over 30 years ago and filed at the last minute are all completely denied and rejected by him,\" they said in a statement.",
      "\"The New York Legislature surely did not intend or expect the Adult Survivors Act to be exploited for improper purposes. The public should be sceptical and not rush to accept these unsubstantiated allegations.\"",
      "December 2023: Underage sex allegations",

      "In court papers, the woman alleged she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack and was left in so much pain that she could barely stand or remember how she got home.",
      "In response, Mr Combs said he \"did not do any of the awful things being alleged\", while Pierre said the \"disgusting allegations\" were \"false and a desperate attempt for financial gain\".",
      "The judge in the case later ruled that the woman, who filed her case anonymously, would have to use her real name if she wanted to proceed.",
      "On 6 December, Mr Combs responded to the flurry of lawsuits with a statement on his Instagram page, external.",
      "\"ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,\" he wrote. \"For the last couple of weeks, I have sat silently and watched people try to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and my legacy.",
      "\"Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth.\"",
      "February 2024: Accusations of grooming",
      "Music producer Rodney Jones Jr, who produced nine tracks on The Love Album, sued Mr Combs in February 2024, accusing the star of making unwanted sexual contact and forcing him to hire prostitutes and participate in sex acts with them.",
      "In court papers filed in New York, Jones also claimed that Mr Combs tried to \"groom\" him into having sex with another man, telling him it was \"a normal practice in the music industry\".",
      "Mr Combs' lawyer, Shawn Holley, called the producer \"nothing more than a liar\" and described his claims as \"pure fiction\" that can be discredited by \"overwhelming, indisputable proof\".",

      "Mr Combs was arrested in a New York hotel on 16 September, facing three charges: racketeering; sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution.",

      "It described a longstanding pattern of violently assaulting and coercing women to \"fulfil his sexual desires\".",

    "published": "Sun, 20 Apr 2025 00:04:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Blind influencer Lucy Edwards on choosing IVF which will screen out the gene that made her who she is.",
    "story": [
      "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.",
      "\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.",
      "Lucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.",
      "Lucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.",
      "The condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.",
      "Lucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.",
      "The abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.",
      "\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.",
      "This is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.",
      "Without medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.",
      "She pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"",
      "And that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.",
      "It is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.",
      "In 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.",
      "It is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.",
      "\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\"",
      "Lucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.",
      "She says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.",
      "\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"",
      "IP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.",
      "\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"",
      "In response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.",
      "But Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.",
      "\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.",
      "\"I'm going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient.\"",
      "Lucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl... series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves.",
      "NHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.",
      "\"I need to be a BMI of 30 and I'm very open that I need to lose 9kg,\" Lucy says. \"I've already lost 15kg.\"",
      "Her health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.",
      "\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"",
      "Once she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.",
      "She will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.",
      "Over a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.",
      "Meanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.",
      "The embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.",
      "Lucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.",
      "\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"",
      "A few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit.",
      "\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.",
      "\"Fingers crossed [we're] only a few weeks away from ringing the clinic.\"",

      "Backed by \u00a380m of funding, its ambition is to help two million people receive faster and more convenient care in their local community by the end of 2025/26.",
      "Health Minister Karin Smyth said the scheme would \"save time and stop masses of people having to head to hospital for unnecessary appointments\".",
      "The expanded scheme is part of the government's plan to cut long NHS waiting lists and create extra appointments for patients.",
      "It has pledged that 92% of NHS patients will be waiting less than 18 weeks for treatment after referral to a consultant, by the end of this parliament.",
      "Between July and December 2024, the scheme diverted 660,000 treatments from hospitals and into the community, the government says.",
      "Called 'Advice and Guidance', the scheme links GPs and hospital specialists before patients are referred onto waiting lists, so that tests and treatments can be offered in the most convenient place.",
      "For example, patients with tinnitus and needing ear wax removal often end up being referred to specialists when they could be helped outside hospitals. And women needing advice on types of HRT could be treated in local hubs, rather than waiting to see a gynaecologist.",
      "GP practices are able to claim \u00a320 for each 'episode of care', which could include several interactions with specialists.",

      "Why men are so unhealthy - and what can be done",
      "Smyth said the government was \"rewiring the NHS\" and doing things differently.",
      "\"This scheme is a perfect example of how we are saving patients time and reducing pressure on key NHS services in the process,\" she said.",
      "\"It will take time to reverse the damaging neglect the NHS has suffered in recent years, but our Plan for Change is starting to deliver benefits for patients, with waiting lists cut by 219,000 since July, and 1,500 new GPs in post.\"",
      "National Voices, which represents health charities in England, said \"real choice\" must be offered to patients about what the best treatment routes are.",
      "\"We must see strong communication about what the service is and what it means in practical terms for patient care,\" director of policy Sharon Brennan said.",
      "The British Medical Association said in a statement: \"We have seen decades of underinvestment in general practice, and this is an important small step in acknowledging the important role of the GP and supporting practices to deliver enhanced care to patients in the community.",
      "\"The journey to bringing back the family doctor has only just begun. Now we must focus on the secretary of state's promise to complete negotiation of a new GP contract within the term of this Parliament in order to safeguard family GP services for the future, and we look forward to working closely with the government to achieve that.\"",

    "summary": "The number of people vaping in the UK has stalled, while disposable vape usage has fallen, a study suggests.",
    "story": [
      "The popularity of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes has fallen ahead of a UK-wide ban on their sale on 1 June, a study suggests.",
      "The percentage of people aged 16-24 who mainly use disposable vapes has dropped by nearly half in the last year from 63% to 35%, University College London (UCL) researchers say.",
      "But researchers believe vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban \u2013 instead of giving up.",
      "As a result they warn the ban may only have a \"limited impact\" on vaping rates as it found vaping in general stalled between January 2024 and 2025 in all adults over 16 after several years of significant growth.",
      "The UK government ban on disposable and single-use vapes is aimed at stopping littering as, in most cases, the vapes cannot be recycled and often end up in landfill or pollute natural environments.",
      "The ban is also aimed at tackling rising rates of youth vaping and protecting children from harm.",
      "GP Dr Helen Wall told BBC Breakfast that NHS advice is \"very clear\" that vaping should be used as a means to stop smoking.",
      "\"But for people who have never smoked, and for young people particularly, to turn to vaping can be quite detrimental,\" she said.",
      "\"Our young people are becoming quite addicted. It's affecting their concentration, they're becoming agitated, their capacity to learn is affected, their developing brain can be affected.\"",
      "The UCL study looked at survey data on vaping habits in England, Wales and Scotland both before and after the ban was announced.",
      "The study used data from the Smoking Toolkit Study, which collected data on 88,611 people aged 16 and over.",
      "Before the ban, between January 2022 and January 2024, vaping among those aged 16 and over went up from 8.9% to 13.5%.",
      "In young adults aged 16-24, usage increased more sharply, from 17% to 26.5%.",
      "After the ban was announced, researchers found a decline in the number of vapers mainly using disposable e-cigarettes - in all age groups and particularly among 16-24 year olds.",
      "The study only asked vape users about their main choice of device.",
      "Dr Sarah Jackson, who works for the UCL Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group and is the lead author of the survey, tells the BBC she thinks \"more people are turning to refillable, reusable devices\" rather than stopping vaping altogether.",
      "\"We often see people change their behaviour in response to impending policy changes before they come into action,\" she adds.",
      "Disposable vapes are single-use devices, which come pre-filled with vape liquid, whereas refillable and rechargeable (reusable) devices have a longer shelf-life and are often a cheaper way to vape in the long-term.",
      "A reusable vape has vape liquid that can be refilled and a battery that can be recharged.",
      "How are the vaping rules changing?",
      "Dr Jackson adds that vape manufacturers have also been quick to react to the upcoming ban, with \"the most popular\" disposable brands producing rechargeable versions of their most popular models.",
      "\"They're very similar in design, colours, flavours and even price,\" she says.",
      "While Dr Jackson thinks it's too early to tell whether the government's new strategy will deter young people from vaping, she maintains that health legislators face \"an issue of balance\".",
      "\"We know it makes sense to do something to try and reduce the vast numbers of young people taking up vaping, but the key public health priority here does remain smoking,\" she says.",
      "\"This is vastly more harmful and is killing a lot of people every year, so we need to make sure that any policy measures that are brought in to tackle youth vaping don't put people off using vapes, which are very effective at quitting smoking,\" she adds.",

      "US negotiators were not part of the final discussions after President Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the global health agency, and the US will not be bound by the pact when it leaves in 2026.",

      "Participating manufacturers will have to allocate 10% of their production of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics to the WHO. Another 10% will then be supplied at \"affordable prices\".",
      "Countries also approved the transfer of health technologies to poorer nations as long as it was \"mutually agreed\".",
      "That should enable more local production of vaccines and medicines during a pandemic, but the clause had been extremely contentious.",
      "Developing countries are still angry at the way wealthy nations bought up and hoarded vaccines during Covid-19, while countries with large pharmaceutical industries worry mandatory transfers might undermine research and development.",
      "At the core of the agreement is a proposed Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing System (PABS), allowing the faster exchange of data between pharmaceutical companies.",
      "That should enable those firms to start working on new drugs more quickly in any future outbreak."

      "Huntington's is a hereditary disorder that slowly damages the brain, affecting the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink, make decisions and live independently. There is currently no cure.",
      "The study confirmed the rate of Huntington's disease in northern Scotland is 14.5 per 100,000 people - more than five times the estimated worldwide rate of 2.71.",
      "The researchers from the University of Aberdeen found there are more than 160 adults living in Grampian, Highland, Orkney, Shetland, and the Western Isles who have the gene but have not been tested.",
      "Every child of someone affected has a 50:50 chance of inheriting the neurodegenerative gene which causes Huntington's.",
      "On average, every person who has been diagnosed with Huntington's disease will have at least another 2.2 relatives who have the gene, meaning there are hundreds of people in northern Scotland who could be considered for effective treatments in the future, researchers said.",
      "Previous studies have mainly looked at the number of people who tested positive for the gene then estimated the number of relatives at risk using statistical modelling.",
      "In the new study, published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, scientists used family tree clinical records to count how many people have a 50:50 chance of having inherited the condition but have not been tested.",
      "It is hoped the findings can help affected families plan for the future and prompt future investment in specialist care.",

      "The biggest shortfall was 67% in West Yorkshire, followed by 60% in Humberside, and the smallest was 17% in Essex, followed by 32% in Cumbria.",
      "There are 10 more fire authorities where a county council runs the fire service, and Nics grants for the fire service were mixed in with the Nics top-ups for council staff, making the total for just the fire service difficult to untangle.",

      "A complex, emotionally-charged and fiercely contested argument around gender, trans rights and women's sex-based rights has often left politicians at Westminster floundering to answer a seemingly straightforward question.",
      "Today's Supreme Court ruling may, just may, calm a political row that has produced all sorts of verbal contortions, particularly from Sir Keir Starmer.",
      "Appearing on the BBC's Question Time election debate in June last year, the Labour leader said he agreed with former Prime Minister Tony Blair's comment that \"biologically, a woman is with a vagina and a man is with a penis\".",
      "But he was criticised by the Harry Potter author and former Labour donor JK Rowling, who accused the party under Sir Keir's leadership of a \"dismissive and often offensive\" approach to women's concerns.",
      "The question of self-identification for transgender people has long been thorny for the Labour Party.",
      "Its 2019 manifesto committed Labour to introducing self-identification.",
      "In September 2021, the then-leader of the opposition slapped down one of his own MPs, Rosie Duffield, for saying that only women have a cervix.",

      "Women's campaigners celebrate court win - but what will it change?",
      "Supreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman",
      "Speaking to LBC in March 2022, Sir Keir was repeatedly pressed on the issue, saying the \"vast majority\" of women \"of course don't have a penis\" - adding that those who are born with a gender they don't identify with should be treated with respect.",
      "With the issue increasingly divisive in his own party, the Labour leader said to the Sunday Times a year later: \"For 99.9% of women, it is completely biological... and, of course, they haven't got a penis.\"",
      "By the summer of 2023, Labour's position had shifted and the party ruled out introducing a self-ID system to allow people to change their legal sex without a medical diagnosis.",
      "Sir Keir told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Firstly, a woman is an adult female, so let's clear that one up.\"",
      "Often sounding completely exasperated by the question, the Labour leader said in one interview that \"almost nobody is talking about trans issues\", querying why it had become a focus of fierce debate.",
      "But it had, whether he liked it or not.",
      "The Conservative Party repeatedly tried to ridicule Sir Keir's position and carve out a clear political dividing line.",
      "At the Tory conference in 2023, then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, said: \"A man is a man, a woman is a woman, that's just common sense.\"",
      "But his jibes against the Labour leader were not without controversy.",
      "During Prime Minister's Questions in February 2024, Sunak jokingly ridiculed Sir Keir for U-turning on how he defined a woman.",
      "But the mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey - who was transgender - was in Parliament that day and Sunak faced calls to apologise.",
      "By the time of last year's general election, Sunak said voters faced a \"crystal-clear choice\" about the protection of single-sex spaces, promising to rewrite the Equality Act to make clear that sex as a protected characteristic means biological sex.",
      "Today's Supreme Court ruling has been welcomed by the Conservatives, with leader Kemi Badenoch calling it a \"victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious\".",
      "As Sunak's women and equalities minister, Badenoch led the UK government's efforts to block Scotland's Gender Recognition Reform Bill.",
      "She has previously criticised what she called \"extreme gender ideology\" and \"trans ideology\" and opposed gender-neutral toilets.",
      "And in a sign that the Tories might finally be ready to give up one of their most cherished attack lines, Badenoch declared on social media: \"The era of Keir Starmer telling us that some women have penises has come to an end. Hallelujah!\"",
      "A Labour source said Sir Keir had brought the party to a \"common sense position\" on the subject from an \"activist\" stance, and it was \"one of the reasons\" the electorate felt that they could back the party after the \"disaster of 2019\".",
      "Labour are not the only party to have tied themselves in knots on this issue.",
      "It was particularly thorny for the SNP, whose former leader Nicola Sturgeon championed the expansion of trans rights, cheered on by some in her party and opposed loudly by others.",
      "Scotland's First Minister John Swinney, who has been keen to avoid the issue, will now face the challenge of ensuring his government adheres to the law as interpreted by the Supreme Court.",
      "The Liberal Democrats have had their problems too.",
      "Officially, the party is pro-trans rights. It has a powerful and influential LGBTQ+ section and campaigned at the last general election for legal recognition of non-binary identities.",
      "In May 2023, leader Sir Ed Davey told LBC: \"The vast majority of people will have the same gender as their biological sex, but a small number won't.\"",
      "When asked by presenter Nick Ferrari \"so, a woman can have a penis?\", he replied: \"Well, quite clearly.\"",
      "He went on to suggest that trans people's rights were adequately protected by the Equality Act, which \"allow there to be single sex spaces\".",
      "His comments were ridiculed by then Tory leader Sunak \u2013 and did not go down well with gender critical campaigners in his own party.",
      "Liberal Voice for Women (LVW), which has fought a long campaign against a ban on having a stall at the annual Lib Dem conference, said their leader had made the party \"look dishonest, unreliable and detached from reality\".",
      "Earlier this year, party chiefs backed down and allowed LVW to hold events and have exhibition stands after the group threatened to sue for discrimination.",
      "Reform UK is clear in its opposition to what it calls \"transgender indoctrination\" and is committed to scrapping the Equality Act.",
      "Its 2024 general election \"contract\" states: \"There are two sexes and two genders.\"",
      "The party adds: \"It is a dangerous safeguarding issue to confuse children by suggesting otherwise\u2026 no gender questioning, social transitioning or pronoun swapping, inform parents of under-16s about their children's life decisions. Schools must have single-sex facilities.\"",
      "On paper, the Green Party of England and Wales is equally clear, at the opposite end of the spectrum.",
      "The party's charter of Rights and Responsibilities states \"trans men are men, trans women are women, and that non-binary identities exist and are valid\", and it campaigns to make it easier for trans people to change their legal status.",
      "But within the party there are major splits over the issue.",
      "Last year, the Greens were ordered by a court to pay nearly \u00a3100,000 to their former deputy leader Shahrar Ali after it found the party had discriminated against him when they fired him as a spokesman during a row over his gender critical beliefs.",
      "Today's court ruling takes the immediate pressure off the Labour government and other politicians who have struggled to answer the question \"what is a woman?\"",
      "But with passions running high on both sides of the debate, it is unlikely to go away.",

      "He added: \"By definition, the vast majority crossing the Channel illegally will get to stay in the UK - so there is no deterrent.\"",
      "Philp said the Conservatives had a deterrent in the Rwanda scheme, which aimed to discourage small boats crossings by sending some people who arrived in the UK illegally to the east African country.",
      "But the plan was stalled by legal challenges and Labour scrapped the scheme before any migrants were sent to Rwanda.",
      "Reform UK MP Lee Anderson said: \"Instead of negotiating trade-style agreements concerning migrants, the focus should be on securing and closing our borders.",
      "\"Such a strategy would be more effective, less costly, and far simpler.\"",
      "He added: \"The priority must be reducing the number of illegal migrants in our country, not simply replacing them.\"",
      "A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said a migrant returns scheme \"would be a positive step that we'd support\".",
      "The spokesperson said: \"We need to end these dangerous crossings. For far too long the Conservatives talked tough but failed to tackle the issue of small boats.\"",
      "The Green Party has been approached for comment.",
      "In 2023, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would seek an EU-wide returns agreement.",
      "But no such deal has come to fruition since Labour won the general election last year.",
      "An EU-wide deal would be likely to face resistance from some European countries, such as Hungary, which has taken a hard line on migrants entering the country.",
      "The UK government has so far focused on targeting people-smuggling gangs to bring down illegal migration, which is one of Labour's biggest challenges.",
      "Earlier this year the government announced a series of measures to tackle people smuggling, including a new criminal offence of endangering the lives of others at sea with a jail term of up to five years.",
      "Ministers have insisted there is no single \"silver bullet\" for solving the problem of illegal migration and the latest scheme is only one of a number of options being considered.",
      "The latest Home Office data show 705 migrants in 12 boats arrived in Dover on Tuesday - the highest daily figure so far this year.",

      "A Home Office spokesman said: \"The prime minister and home secretary have been clear the UK and France must work closely together to prevent dangerous small boat crossings, particularly on vital law enforcement co-operation.",
      "\"We have already secured agreement from the French to deploy a new elite unit of officers at the coast, launch a specialist intelligence unit, increase police numbers and introduce new powers for the French authorities to intervene in shallow waters.",
      "\"We are intensifying our collaboration with France and other European countries who face the same challenges by exploring fresh and innovative measures to dismantle the business models of the criminal smuggling gangs.\""

    "story": [
      "Judges at the UK Supreme Court have unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.",
      "It marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle which could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales.",
      "The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female.",
      "Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.",
      "Five key takeaways from Supreme Court ruling",
      "Women's campaigners celebrate court win - but what will it change?",
      "The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women.",
      "The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain.",
      "Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words \"woman\" and \"sex\" are defined in the legislation.",
      "He told the court: \"The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex.",
      "\"But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not.\"",
      "He added that the legislation gives transgender people \"protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender\".",
      "Campaigners who brought the case against the Scottish government hugged each other and punched the air as they left the courtroom, with several of them in tears.",
      "The Equality Act provides protection against discrimination on the basis of various characteristics, including \"sex\" and \"gender reassignment\".",
      "Judges at the Supreme Court in London were asked to rule on what that law means by \"sex\" - whether it means biological sex, or legal, \"certificated\" sex as defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act.",
      "The Scottish government argued the 2004 legislation was clear that obtaining a GRC amounts to a change of sex \"for all purposes\".",
      "For Women Scotland argued for a \"common sense\" interpretation of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an \"immutable biological state\".",
      "Speaking outside the Supreme Court following the ruling, For Women Scotland co-founder Susan Smith said: \"Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex.",
      "\"Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the Supreme Court for this ruling.\"",
      "First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government accepted the judgement.",
      "He posted on social media: \"The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster.",
      "\"We will now engage on the implications of the ruling.\"",
      "Swinney added: \"Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions.\"",
      "A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted \"in good faith\" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement.",
      "A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring \"clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs\".",
      "\"Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,\" the spokesman added.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch described the ruling as a \"victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious\".",
      "She added: \"It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so.\"",
      "'Deep concern'",
      "Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media: \"It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK.\"",
      "But Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent campaigner for trans-rights, said: \"This is a deeply concerning ruling for human rights and a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society.",
      "\"It could remove important protections and will leave many trans people and their loved ones deeply anxious and worried about how their lives will be affected and about what will come next.\"",
      "For Women Scotland had warned that if the court sided with the Scottish government, it would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups.",
      "Transgender people warned the case could erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender.",
      "Scottish Trans manager Vic Valentine said the organisation was \"shocked\" by the court ruling, arguing that it \"reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates\".",
      "They added: \"This judgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be excluded from both men's and women's spaces and services.",
      "\"It is hard to understand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is compatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody.\"",
      "The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy over transgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prison and an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse who objected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room.",
      "NHS Fife said it would \"carefully consider\" the court's judgement.",
      "'Biological' or 'certified'?",
      "The judges ruled that interpreting sex as \"certificated\" rather than \"biological\" would \"cut across the definitions of man and \"woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way\".",
      "They said a \"certified\" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian.",
      "The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to \"function coherently\".",
      "It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions.",
      "The judges noted \"similar confusion and impracticability\" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces.",
      "The judges added: \"The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct.\"",
      "Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender.",
      "However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs \"if it is proportionate to do so\".",
      "Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman.",
      "He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex.",
      "But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be \"settled\" by this court case.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them.\"",
      "Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a \"reassessment\" of rules.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards.",
      "For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law.",
      "The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts.",
      "Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was \"not limited to biological or birth sex\".",
      "The Scottish Parliament passed reforms that year that would have made it easier for someone to change their legally recognised sex.",

      "She told BBC Breakfast that talks to secure a deal with the US were ongoing, but declined to provide a timeline on their progress.",

      "\"It's not in Europe's interest, and it's not in America's interest, for Europe to be a permanent security vassal of the United States,\" Vance said.",

      "He reiterated the administration's messaging that to end the war \"you have to try to understand\" both sides.",
      "\"That doesn't mean you morally support the Russian cause, or that you support the full-scale invasion,\" Vance said.",
      "\"But you do have to try to understand what are their strategic red lines, in the same way that you have to try to understand what the Ukrainians are trying to get out of the conflict,\" he continued.",
      "On Sunday, Russia launched its deadliest attacks on Ukraine this year, killing at least 35 people and prompting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to invite Trump to visit his country before any deal is struck with Russia."

      "The UK Supreme Court has unanimously and unambiguously backed the argument that the definition of a woman in the Equality Act should be based on biological sex.",
      "Reading out the ruling, Lord Hodge cautioned that it should not be taken as a triumph for one group in society over another.",
      "But there were scenes of jubilation for women's campaigners outside the Supreme Court.",
      "Tearful hugs were exchanged and a bottle of champagne was cracked open.",
      "The fact someone had thought to bring one along underlines that it was potentially on the cards, but For Women Scotland (FWS) still seemed shocked by the scale of their victory.",
      "The Scottish government's argument - that sex can be changed via the gender recognition process, and that someone with a gender recognition certificate should have the protections of that sex - were dismissed.",
      "So what does it all mean?",
      "Supreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman",
      "UK Supreme Court rules legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex",
      "The application of the law on the ground, in \"real life\", was clearly foremost in the minds of the judges.",
      "Take the example of single sex spaces and services - part of the motivation for FWS bringing this case.",
      "The previous reading of the law was that everything from hospital wards and prison wings to support groups for victims of abuse can exclude everyone but women thanks to exceptions in the Equality Act.",
      "The concern from campaigners was that if people could change their sex with a certificate, and then claim protection against discrimination as a woman, that could be more complicated.",
      "That's particularly the case on a practical level, given those providing these services aren't actually meant to ask to see a gender recognition certificate.",
      "Now, the court is clear that this exemption can continue - the rules underpinning women-only spaces can exclude people with gender recognition certificates, along with everyone else.",
      "Does the Equality Act still protect trans people?",
      "There are still conditions which need to be satisfied - services will have to show that excluding trans people is a limited and proportionate means to achieving a legitimate aim.",
      "Blanket bans are generally discouraged. There is still a bar to clear to exclude anyone, and the test of proportionality has to be met in each case.",
      "The Equality and Human Rights Commission - which oversees the application of the Equality Act - is to issue new guidance to help service providers",
      "But FWS are clearly delighted with the underlying principle, and hope it will lead to clearer guidance for those providing services.",
      "It's important to note that trans people are still protected by the Equality Act.",
      "The protected characteristic of gender reassignment is not affected by this ruling, and Lord Hodge stressed that there are other defences against direct and indirect discrimination and harassment.",
      "He was clear that trans people are a \"vulnerable and often harassed minority\", who \"struggle against discrimination and prejudice as they seek to live their lives with dignity\".",
      "But the court has held that it would be problematic to effectively divide trans people between two different protected characteristics, depending on whether they have a certificate.",
      "Again, judges stressed that this is particularly the case when service providers can't ask to see the certificate.",
      "They say the law needs to be \"clear and consistent\" - and that including those with a GRC in with women would ultimately be \"incoherent\".",
      "The court carefully weighs the letter of the law, but it's worth remembering that ultimately that law is drafted by politicians - and it can be changed at the stroke of a pen.",
      "Will gender reform be relaunched at Holyrood?",
      "The issue may now move out of the legal arena and back into the political one.",
      "There had been some pressure on the UK government to clarify the definitions of the Equality Act, which is Westminster legislation.",
      "The court has handily done that for them, and UK ministers have welcomed the ruling.",
      "There may be more political pressure on the Scottish government, given it has lost this case.",
      "For a long time, ministers have batted away questions about this case - such as, do they really believe in the legal points their lawyers are making? - by saying they can't comment on live litigation.",
      "They will have to go into a little more detail now, but I imagine this is issue still just about the last thing they want to talk about.",
      "There had been some speculation that a ruling like this could raise the prospect of ministers re-launching their attempts at gender reform at Holyrood.",
      "But frankly there is not the political will in the John Swinney administration to ride into battle on this issue, as there was under his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "With a Holyrood election looming, there is no prospect of the first minister deciding to wade back into such a contentious debate.",

      "The mood music from Washington is that this 10% tariff is not for negotiation with anyone. That is the baseline tariff that has been levied on nearly all of America's trading partners.",
      "Making an exception for one country would simply invite significant trade diversion.",
      "'Good chance' of US-UK trade deal, says Vance",

      "Most countries had faced higher tariffs - as illustrated on Donald Trump's big board - such as on electronics manufacturers in East Asia and they want to keep the levy at the 10% rate.",
      "The net result is that the UK may not have much to negotiate here, and yet is being treated very harshly, given there is no US trade deficit.",
      "Factor in the exemptions for electronics which benefit the likes of China and the fact that cars, a major industry for Britain, are being tariffed at 25% and the UK side has much to complain about.",
      "Another issue is that all this is being done at the same time as the post-Brexit reset negotiations are being outlined ahead of the UK-EU summit next month.",
      "The word is that the UK and EU would like to secure an ambitious deal which aligns closely on export rules. The aim of this reset would be to rid food and farm exports of most red tape.",
      "The US has taken an interest in this in the past. Could the US make it part of their negotiation?",
      "In addition, many US officials have mentioned a desire for allies to join it in containing China.",
      "The US might also try to force a choice on the UK here, or at least encourage action to keep out diverted Chinese goods.",
      "All this would fly in the face of the UK government's entire sell to the world that Britain could be the \"most connected economy in the world\" with strong links into European goods markets, US technology and the east Asia market, including China.",
      "There is a final factor here, which is very intriguing.",
      "Given last week's chaos in financial markets including for US government debt, it is now the case that the US needs these deals, especially the easy pickings with its closest allies.",

      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",

    "story": [
      "A ground-breaking project to suck carbon out of the sea has started operating on England's south coast.",
      "The small pilot scheme, known as SeaCURE, is funded by the UK government as part of its search for technologies that fight climate change.",
      "There's broad consensus among climate scientists that the overwhelming priority is to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the chief cause of global warming.",
      "But many scientists also believe that part of the solution will have to involve capturing some of the gases that have already been released.",
      "These projects, known as carbon capture, usually focus either on capturing emissions at source or pulling them from the air.",
      "What makes SeaCure interesting is that it is testing whether it might be more efficient to pull planet-warming carbon from the sea, since it is present in greater concentrations in water than in the air.",
      "To reach the project's entrance you have to go round the back of the Weymouth Sealife Centre and walk past a sign that says \"Caution: Moray Eels may Bite\".",
      "There's a reason this ground-breaking project has been placed here.",
      "It's a pipe that snakes under the stony beach and out into the English Channel, sucking up seawater and bringing it onshore.",
      "The project is trying to find whether removing carbon from the water might be a cost effective way of reducing the amount of the climate warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere.",
      "SeaCURE processes the seawater to remove the carbon before pumping it back out to sea where it absorbs more CO2.",
      "We're the first broadcast journalists to visit and Professor Tom Bell from Plymouth Marine Laboratory is tasked with showing us around.",
      "He explains that the process begins by treating some of the seawater to make it more acidic. This encourages the carbon that's dissolved in the seawater to turn into a gas and be released into the atmosphere as CO2.",
      "\"This is the seawater stripper\" Prof Bell says with a smile as we turn a corner.",
      "The \"stripper\" is a large stainless steel tank which maximises the amount of contact between the acidic seawater and the air.",
      "\"When you open a fizzy drink it froths, that's the CO2 coming out.\" Prof Bell says. \"What we're doing by spreading the seawater on a large surface area. It's a bit like pouring a drink on the floor and allowing the CO2 to come out of the seawater really quickly.\"",
      "The CO2 that emerges into the air is sucked away and then concentrated using charred coconut husks ready to be stored.",
      "The low-carbon seawater then has alkali added to it \u2013 to neutralise the acid that was added \u2013 and is then pumped back out into a stream that flows into the sea.",

      "There are already much more developed carbon capture technologies which take carbon directly out of the air \u2013 but Dr Paul Halloran who leads the SeaCURE project tells me that using water instead has its advantages.",
      "\"Seawater has got loads of carbon in it compared to the air, about 150 times more,\" says Dr Halloran.",
      "\"But it has got different challenges, the energy requirements to generate the products that we require to do this from seawater are huge.\"",
      "At present the amount of CO2 this pilot project is removing is tiny \u2013 at most 100 metric tonnes per year \u2013 that's less CO2 than a commercial plane emits crossing the Atlantic. But given the size of the world's oceans those behind SeaCURE think it has potential.",
      "In its submission to the UK government SeaCURE said the technology had the potential to be massively scaled up to remove 14 billion tonnes of CO2 a year if 1% of the world's seawater on the ocean's surface was processed.",
      "For that to be plausible the entire process for stripping the carbon \u2013 would have to be powered by renewable energy. Possibly by solar panels in a floating installation at sea.",
      "\"Carbon removal is necessary. If you want to reach net zero emissions and net zero emissions is needed to halt further warming,\" says Dr Oliver Geden who's part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and an expert in carbon capture.",
      "\"Capturing directly from seawater is one of the options. Directly capturing it from the air is another one. There are basically 15 to 20 options, and in the end the question of what to use, of course, will depend on the cost.\"",

      "\"Removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere is essential in helping us achieve net zero,\" says energy minister Kerry McCarthy. \"Innovative projects like SeaCURE at the University of Exeter play an important role in creating the green technologies needed to make this happen, while supporting skilled jobs and boosting growth.\"",

      "Scientists have found new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life.",
      "A Cambridge team studying the atmosphere of a planet called K2-18b has detected signs of molecules which on Earth are only produced by simple organisms.",
      "This is the second, and more promising, time chemicals associated with life have been detected in the planet's atmosphere by Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).",
      "But the team and independent astronomers stress that more data is needed to confirm these results.",
      "The lead researcher, Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, told me at his lab at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there. I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "K2-18b is two-and-a-half times the size of Earth and is 700 trillion miles, or 124 light years, away from us - a distance far beyond what any human could travel in a lifetime.",
      "JWST is so powerful that it can analyse the chemical composition of the planet's atmosphere from the light that passes through from the small red Sun it orbits.",
      "The Cambridge group has found that the atmosphere seems to contain the chemical signature of at least one of two molecules that are associated with life: dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). On Earth, these gases are produced by marine phytoplankton and bacteria.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan said he was surprised by how much gas was apparently detected during a single observation window.",
      "\"The amount we estimate of this gas in the atmosphere is thousands of times higher than what we have on Earth,\" he said.",
      "\"So, if the association with life is real, then this planet will be teeming with life,\" he added.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan went further: \"If we confirm that there is life on K2-18b, it should basically confirm that life is very common in the galaxy.\"",
      "He told BBC Radio 5Live on Thursday: \"This is a very important moment in science, but also very important to us as a species.",
      "\"If there is one example, and the universe being infinite, there is a chance for life on many more planets.\"",
      "Dr Subir Sarkar, a lecturer in astrophysics at Cardiff University and part of the research team, said the research suggests K2-18b could have an ocean which could be potentially full of life - though he cautioned scientists \"don't know for sure\".",
      "He added that the research team's work will continue to focus on looking for life on other planets: \"Keep watching this space.\"",
      "The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans",
      "There are lots of \"ifs\" and \"buts\" at this stage, as Prof Madhusudhan's team freely admits.",
      "Firstly, this latest detection is not at the standard required to claim a discovery.",
      "For that, the researchers need to be about 99.99999% sure that their results are correct and not a fluke reading. In scientific jargon, that is a five sigma result.",
      "These latest results are only three sigma, or 99.7%. Which sounds like a lot, but it is not enough to convince the scientific community. However, it is much more than the one sigma result of 68% the team obtained 18 months ago, which was greeted with much scepticism at the time.",
      "But even if the Cambridge team obtains a five sigma result, that won't be conclusive proof that life exists on the planet, according to Prof Catherine Heymans of Edinburgh University and Scotland's Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team.",
      "\"Even with that certainty, there is still the question of what is the origin of this gas,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"On Earth it is produced by microorganisms in the ocean, but even with perfect data we can't say for sure that this is of a biological origin on an alien world because loads of strange things happen in the Universe and we don't know what other geological activity could be happening on this planet that might produce the molecules.\"",
      "That view is one the Cambridge team agree with. They are working with other groups to see if DMS and DMDS can be produced by non-living means in the lab.",
      "\"There is still a 0.3% chance that it might be a statistical fluke,\" Prof Madhusudhan said.",
      "Suggesting life may exist on another planet was \"a big claim if true\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding: \"So we want to be really, really thorough, and make more observations, and get the evidence to the level that there is less than a one-in-a-million chance of it being a fluke.\"",
      "He said this should be possible in \"maybe one or two years\".",
      "Other research groups have put forward alternative, lifeless, explanations for the data obtained from K2-18b. There is a strong scientific debate not only about whether DMS and DMDS are present but also the planet's composition.",
      "The reason many researchers infer that the planet has a vast liquid ocean is the absence of the gas ammonia in K2-18b's atmosphere. Their theory is that the ammonia is absorbed by a vast body of water below.",
      "But it could equally be explained by an ocean of molten rock, which would preclude life, according to Prof Oliver Shorttle of Cambridge University.",
      "\"Everything we know about planets orbiting other stars comes from the tiny amounts of light that glance off their atmospheres. So it is an incredibly tenuous signal that we are having to read, not only for signs of life, but everything else,\" he said.",
      "\"With K2-18b part of the scientific debate is still about the structure of the planet.\"",
      "Dr Nicolas Wogan at Nasa's Ames Research Center has yet another interpretation of the data. He published research suggesting that K2-18b is a mini gas giant with no surface.",
      "Both these alternative interpretations have also been challenged by other groups on the grounds that they are inconsistent with the data from JWST, compounding the strong scientific debate surrounding K2-18b.",
      "Prof Chris Lintott, presenter of the BBC's The Sky at Night, said he had \"great admiration\" for Prof Madhusudhan's team, but was treating the research with caution.",
      "\"I think we've got to be very careful about claiming that this is 'a moment' on the search to life. We've [had] such moments before,\" he told Today.",
      "He said the research should be seen instead as \"part of a huge effort to try and understand what's out there in the cosmos\".",
      "Prof Madhusudhan acknowledges that there is still a scientific mountain to climb if he is to answer one of the biggest questions in science. But he believes he and his team are on the right track.",
      "\"Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,\" he said.",
      "\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering.\"",

    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",

    "story": [
      "Some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being \"torched alive\" and pushed closer to extinction after weeks of intense grass fires, conservationists have warned.",
      "They include endangered birds like hen harriers and water voles, which are now the UK's fastest declining mammal.",
      "The National Trust said it believed ongoing wildfires at Abergwesyn common in Powys had destroyed \"the last remaining\" local breeding habitat for golden plovers - considered one of the most beautiful birds of the British uplands.",
      "So far this year 110 sq miles (284 sq km) of land has been burnt by wildfires around the UK - an area larger than Birmingham.",
      "Wildfire home scare has owners fearing about future",
      "Some wildlife may not return after recurring fires",
      "Aerial images show land devastated by wildfire",
      "Figures obtained by the BBC show that in Wales, fire crews have battled almost 1,400 wildfires already this year, leading fire services to urge people to \"act responsibly\" and report any suspicious behaviour to the police.",
      "The National Trust said 2025 was \"turning out to be the worst year ever for these human-caused fires across the country\".",
      "\"We're extremely worried, this is looking like it's going to be the worst year for seeing our wildlife going up in flames,\" said Ben McCarthy, the charity's head of nature conservation.",
      "A record dry spell and unusually high temperatures in March are believed to have contributed to the fires. A low number of blazes in 2024 also left more vegetation to fuel them.",
      "Coed Cadw, the Woodland Trust in Wales, said an \"irreplaceable\" area of temperate Atlantic rainforest had been affected at Allt Boeth near Aberystwyth, with damage to protected bluebells too.",
      "Also known as Celtic rainforest, the habitat harbours scarce plants, lichens and fungi, and is considered more threatened than tropical rainforest.",
      "In England, the National Trust said several thousand newly planted trees at Marsden Moor, in West Yorkshire, had gone up in flames.",
      "While on the Morne Mountains, in Northern Ireland, invertebrates and ground dwelling animals like reptiles were \"simply being torched alive\".",
      "\"That then cascades through the food web because without the invertebrates you don't get the birds who are reliant on them for food,\" Mr McCarthy said.",
      "He said government funding to help farmers and land managers restore peat bogs in the uplands, to prevent fires while also soaking in planet-warming carbon and providing habitat, was essential.",
      "Conservation charities including The Wildlife Trusts and the Initiative for Nature Conservation Cymru (INCC) also voiced fears for the future of the water vole, which is already under serious threat from habitat loss and predation by American minks.",
      "Small animals like water voles and shrews, which live in burrows, can survive fast-moving fires but their habitats and the food they rely on are destroyed.",
      "Water voles are \"the fastest-declining mammal ever\" according to Rob Parry of the INCC.",
      "\"Their last foothold [in Wales] is in the uplands so when those sites are burned it is awful for that particular population, but from a UK point of view we are one step closer to the extinction of an entire species,\" he said.",
      "The INCC is also monitoring five breeding pairs of barn owls in the Amman Valley in south Wales, where wildfires have destroyed huge areas of habitat.",
      "\"A few weeks ago they had all of this area to find food for their chicks and suddenly they don't have that any more,\" said Mr Parry.",
      "\"I don't know how they are going to cope. A wildfire just makes that habitat disappear overnight.\"",
      "Other rare birds are also affected, including hen harriers, which have been subject to  recent conservation efforts to increase their numbers in the Welsh uplands, and skylarks, which have declined in huge numbers since the 1970s.",
      "\"We're worried enough as it is about wildlife,\" said Mr Parry.",
      "\"We're one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world and wildfires every spring at the worst possible time is a burden that wildlife and the environment just can't cope with.\"",
      "The INCC has called for closer oversight of controlled burns by farmers and better monitoring of the impact of wildfires on the environment.",
      "Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said wildfires were a \"massive issue\", particularly in south Wales, where Welsh government figures showed more than half of wildfires in Wales took place last year.",
      "Becky Davies, a senior officer at NRW, said: \"In the last three days we've had over 75 fires in the south Wales valleys alone.",
      "\"We have a lot of hillsides that are linear, the valley side has a lot of bracken, a lot of heathland, grassland and coal spoil and that is the sort of hillside that goes up in flames.\"",
      "The environmental impact of wildfires can also be felt more widely.",
      "When it rains after a fire, the newly bare soil and the phosphates that were trapped inside it can wash off into streams and rivers, affecting water quality.",
      "'Deliberate fire setting is a crime'",
      "Numbers of wildfires vary year-on-year depending on when spells of dry weather happen.",
      "But figures obtained by the BBC show that in south Wales, grassfires have increased by 1,200% from the same time period last year.",
      "From 1 January to 10 April 2024, there were 34 wildfires in the region, whereas there were 445 over the same dates in 2025.",
      "In north Wales, crews have attended 170 fires this year, and Mid Wales Fire and Rescue said it had tackled 772 blazes.",
      "Wildfires are also up in England and Northern Ireland compared to last year, while the fire service in Scotland has issued an extreme wildfire alert covering the whole country.",
      "Statistics show the majority of wildfires are started deliberately, but they can also be ignited from disposable BBQs or controlled burns that get out of hand.",
      "In south Wales, firefighters are going to primary schools to teach children from a young age about the devastating impact.",
      "At Pontnewydd Primary School in Cwmbran, staff from South Wales Fire and Rescue  Service and Gwent Police brought along animals like snakes, hedgehogs and foxes for children to meet.",
      "Station manager Mark Bowditch said his crews saw the damage to wildlife from wildfires first-hand.",
      "\"We see the death of local wildlife, we see the destruction of their habitat,\" he said.",

      "The singer was joined by Bezos's fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez and CBS presenter Gayle King, who said a highlight of the flight was hearing Perry sing Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\".",
      "After landing back on Earth, Perry said she felt \"super connected to life\" and \"so connected to love\".",
      "The flight lasted around 11 minutes and took the six women more than 100km (62 miles) above Earth, crossing the internationally recognised boundary of space and giving them a few moments of weightlessness.",
      "Also on board were former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.",
      "The New Shepard rocket lifted off from its West Texas launch site just after 08:30 local time (14:30 BST).",
      "The capsule returned to Earth with a parachute-assisted soft landing, while the rocket booster also landed back in Texas.",
      "Cheering could be heard from inside the capsule as the recovery crew went to collect them.",
      "Jeff Bezos opened the capsule door to welcome back Lauren S\u00e1nchez, the first to disembark.",
      "\"I'm so proud of this crew,\" she said tearfully. \"I can't put it into words.\"",
      "She paused, before adding: \"I looked out of the window and we got to see the moon.\"",
      "\"Earth looked so quiet,\" she said, adding that it was not what she expected. \"It was quiet, but really alive.\"",
      "Next out was Katy Perry, who kissed the ground and lifted a daisy to the sky - her daughter is called Daisy.",
      "Gayle King also got on her knees and kissed the ground.",
      "\"I just want to have a moment with the ground, just appreciate the ground for just a second,\" she said.",
      "The last to get out, Kerianne Flynn, pointed at the sky and shouted: \"I went to space.\"",
      "A celebrity cast had watched the launch from the ground.",
      "Speaking from the viewing platform, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian said: \"I didn't realise how emotional it would be, it's hard to explain. I have all this adrenaline and I'm just standing here.\"",
      "\"Whatever you dream of is in our reach, especially in today's day and age. Dream big, wish for the stars\u2014and one day, you could maybe be amongst them,\"\u200b she added.",
      "Oprah Winfrey spoke about her friend Gayle King, and revealed she was a nervous flier.",
      "\"I mean, for her\u2014whew\u2014anytime we're on a flight, she's in somebody's lap at the slightest bit of turbulence. She has real, real-world anxiety when it comes to flying. And this... this is her overcoming a wall of fear,\" she said.",
      "The spacecraft was fully autonomous, requiring no pilots, and the crew did not manually operate the vehicle.",
      "The last all-female spaceflight was over 60 years ago when Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space on a solo mission aboard the spacecraft Vostok 6.",
      "Since then, there have been no other all-female spaceflights but women have made numerous significant contributions.",
      "The space tourism  industry is still in its infancy, so every successful launch is significant and demonstrates that these short, commercial flights can be carried out safely.",
      "But some critics stress it is tourism, not space science, and professional astronauts undertake missions, including scientific research, for the benefit of humankind.",
      "\"A celebrity isn't an envoy of humankind - they go into space for their own reasons,\" Dr Kai-Uwe Schrogl, special advisor for political affairs at the European Space Agency, told BBC News.",
      "\"These flights are significant and exciting, but I think maybe they can also be a source of frustration for space scientists,\" he added. \"We see space flight as being for science, knowledge and the interests of humanity.",
      "\"Celebrities do it for amusement but get a lot more attention than the regular astronauts.\"",
      "The space flight also generated a range of response on social media, from enthusiasm to hostility.",
      "Dr Tanya Harrison, from the Outer Space Institute experts network said: \"A lot of the comments that I saw on social media were things about, 'Oh, it's like the Real Housewives go to Mars' or 'It's the oligarchy in space, read the room, the timing is terrible.'\"",
      "But: \"There were a lot of positive takes as well. People were like, 'Oh, this is so cool. Katy Perry is going to space.'\"",
      "Dr Harrison, who had previously worked on Nasa missions to Mars said: \"The cynical part of me wants to call it a marketing stunt. This is a company promoting the fact they can launch tourists into space.\"",
      "However she noted the all-women team might \"change the demographics a little bit of who might want to do something like this.\"",
      "\"Socially, they might have had some impact\", she said.",
      "In a news conference after the flight, two of the women took issue with some of the criticism the mission had received, related for example to its cost.",
      "\"I feel that anybody who is criticising doesn't really understand what's happening here,\" said Gayle King.",
      "She said that the astronauts had had a huge, positive response from young women and young girls.",
      "Lauren S\u00e1nchez said she had got \"fired up\" about the criticism and would love to have the naysayers come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees who \"put their heart and soul into\" the missions.",
      "Blue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon.",
      "Although Blue Origin has not released full ticket prices, a $150,000 (\u00a3114,575.85) deposit is required to reserve a seat\u2014underlining the exclusivity of these early flights.",
      "Alongside its suborbital tourism business, the company is also developing long-term space infrastructure, including reusable rockets and lunar landing systems.",
      "The New Shepard rocket is designed to be fully reusable and its booster returns to the launch pad for vertical landings after each flight, reducing overall costs.",
      "According to US law, astronauts must complete comprehensive training for their specific roles.",
      "Blue Origin says its New Shepard passengers are trained over two days with a focus on physical fitness, emergency protocols, details about the safety measures and procedures for zero gravity.",
      "Additionally, there are two support members referred to as Crew Member Seven: one provides continuous guidance to astronauts, while the other maintains communication from the control room during the mission.",
      "The rise of space tourism has prompted criticism that it is too exclusive and environmentally damaging.",

      "International aviation rules at the time were that aircraft could not fly into any levels of volcanic ash and the airspace was quickly closed down.",

      "In the months and years after research and working groups continued to assess procedures and rules.",
      "\"The work that happened very quickly at the time around the event got us to 90% of where we are now\u2026but that has been consolidated and put into specific safety measures,\" Mr Nicholson said.",
      "Today there are three levels of volcanic ash contamination - low, medium and high, with guidance on how long a pilot can fly in those concentrations before causing significant damage.",
      "\"If something similar happened today, it will be up to the airlines to use their own permissions from the engine manufacturers and their own safety cases to decide where and when, based on forecasts, will allow them to go,\" Mr Nicholson added.",
      "\"And that will be different for each airline as some may accept higher or lower levels of ash as acceptable.\"",
      "There has also been a massive development programme in the monitoring and forecasting of volcanic ash.",
      "As a direct result of the ash cloud the Met Office deployed permanent LIDAR instruments that point a laser into the sky capable of measuring ash concentrations.",
      "New satellites have also been launched globally which enable scientists to monitor ash concentrations every 15 minutes.",
      "In addition there have been advances in computer modelling to improve the physics and processes involved in how different shapes and sizes of volcanic ash behave in the atmosphere.",
      "Volcano has been erupting intermittendly near Grindavik, Icleand with large lava flows but no ash cloud",
      "Could it happen again?",
      "What is clear today is that as a direct result of 2010, with all the improvements made, the UK and Europe is in a much better place to control and manage volcanic ash.",
      "In recent months there have been small eruptions in Iceland leading to the evacuation of Grindavik and the closure of the famous Blue Lagoon spa.",
      "However, there has been little concern to aviation as these recent eruptions are mostly small fissure eruptions with large and slow lava flows - rather than the explosive ash eruption from Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull.",
      "Experts believe that if the 2010 volcanic ash event happened today there would be \"nowhere near the same level, if any, disruption\" according to both Dr Hort and Mr Nicholson, largely because we now know that the level of ash seen in UK airspace in 2010 was relatively low and safe to fly in.",
      "But Dr Hort warns: \"You can always have a bigger eruption.\"",

    "summary": "Could discoveries of alien life ever change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",

    "story": [
      "Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.",
      "While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.",
      "Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.",
      "Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.",
      "But the comfort is short-lived.",
      "The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".",
      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",
      "\"But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.\"",

      "Artists and creatives are pushing back against a recent trend using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate \"starter pack\" images of people as toys - which they say may be in danger of risking their livelihoods.",
      "Since the start of April, thousands of people have uploaded their photos to generate images of themselves as dolls, despite warnings of damaging the environment, giving away personal information, and devaluing creativity.",
      "Nick Lavallee, who has made custom action figures for six years, told the BBC he was concerned his work may be at risk after \"AI images saturated social media\".",
      "\"People are sick of them,\" he said. \"It's an artistic aesthetic - AI-generated art diminishes that.\"",
      "Nick has made figures of - and for - comedians, film directors, and artists such as Weezer and Tyler Childers, which sell for as much as $250 (\u00a3188) online on his Wicked Joyful website.",
      "His success has led to a clothing brand and will soon be followed by a physical shop in his hometown of Manchester, New Hampshire.",
      "But he's concerned action figure commissions could soon dry up, as well as the public perception of his work, from thousands of AI images mimicking his passion.",
      "The feeling has been shared by other creatives with the rise of the #StarterPackNoAI movement, which has been used thousands of times since first appearing on Instagram in early April before spreading to X soon after.",
      "After Patouret's post, others quickly joined the counter-trend, with artist Maria Picass\u00f3 Piquer saying she chose to take part \"for fun, but also as a statement\".",
      "\"While AI pieces all looked more or less the same, I was amazed at the variety of the 'human' works,\" she said.",
      "\"Plus, self-portraits added an extra layer of, well, humanity.\"",
      "Maria, like many other artists, sees the dual risk of AI images threatening intellectual property rights by being \"fed on 'stolen' art\", and the possibility of reducing her finding new clients.",

      "He contributed his starter\u00a0pack because \"like many artists who use their real hands\", he was \"tired\" of the deluge of AI-generated doll images.",

      "\"People usually forget about it because of the technology surrounding us, but we really don't need more than basic stuff to create something and be original,\" he said.",

      "\"It doesn't have to be perfect - mine isn't,\" he said. \"Art isn't meant to be perfect or look flawless.\"",
      "And illustrator and student Evie Joyce said creating her own artwork meant being able to consider what to reflect of her personality during a process lasting several hours, rather than seconds.",
      "\"I think that what's so magical about it is you're seeing people put time and effort and their personality, all of their experiences, into pieces of art,\" she said.",
      "\"With AI, it can even steal from artists and steal their work and their style, it just loses that touch of personality.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:42:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Led by Jensen Huang, dubbed the 'Taylor Swift of tech', the chip giant has become pivotal in the race for AI supremacy.",
    "story": [
      "Computer chip giant Nvidia has once again found itself at the centre of US-China tensions over trade and technology.",
      "On Thursday Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang flew to Beijing to meet senior Chinese officials, just after the US imposed new export controls on its chips.",
      "The California-based company will require licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, a move which the US Commerce Department said was designed to safeguard \"national and economic security\". Nvidia said federal officials had told them the requirement will be in force for the \"indefinite future\".",
      "But why is the company so pivotal in the race for AI supremacy between the US and China?",
      "What is Nvidia?",
      "Nvidia designs advanced chips, or semiconductors, that are used in generative artificial intelligence. Generative AI can produce new content from a user's prompt, like ChatGPT.",
      "In recent years, a surge in global demand for AI chips led Nvidia to become one of the world's most valuable companies. In November, Nvidia briefly unseated Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalisation.",
      "Because its chips are seen as so essential to advancements in generative AI, successive US administrations have scrutinised Nvidia's relationship with China.",
      "Washington hopes the new export controls will slow China's development of advanced AI chips - especially their use by the Chinese military - and secure an advantage in AI competition with Beijing.",
      "Why is Trump targeting Nvidia's H20 chips?",
      "US restrictions on Nvidia selling chips to China are not new.",
      "In 2022, Joe Biden's administration imposed separate export controls on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with those existing restrictions.",
      "A more powerful Nvidia chip, the H100, was already banned for sale in China.",
      "However, the recent emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI company, has prompted fresh concerns in the US that even less powerful chips could lead to significant technological breakthroughs.",
      "DeepSeek claimed it could operate as effectively as other applications like ChatGPT using less advanced chips.",
      "Now, there is increasing demand for Nvidia's H20 chips among Chinese technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.",
      "Those companies have outstanding orders for the chips. But because there is no grace period on the imposition of the new curbs, Nvidia expects to be hit by losses of $5.5bn (\u00a34.15bn) from these orders that it can no longer fulfil.",
      "Chim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, told the BBC that there are alternative AI chips being developed in China, by companies like Huawei.",
      "Although they are currently viewed as inferior to Nvidia's, Mr Lee said the US curbs could prompt China to focus on developing better chips.",
      "\"It will introduce challenges to China's AI scene, but it won't massively slow down China's AI development and deployment,\" Mr Lee added.",
      "Why is Nvidia's CEO in China?",
      "China is a critical market for Nvidia. The world's second-largest economy accounted for 13% of its total sales last year,  though that is still far less than the United States, which accounted for nearly half.",
      "The timing of Mr Huang's trip is being seen as an effort to shore up Nvidia's business in China despite the latest curbs.",
      "In his Beijing meeting with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Mr Huang said he hoped \"to continue to cooperate with China\", according to state broadcaster CCTV.",
      "On Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Mr Huang's trip to China also included a meeting with DeepSeek's founder, Liang Wenfeng.",
      "Separately, top Chinese official He Lifeng told Mr Huang that \"China's market investment and consumption potential is huge\", according to state news agency Xinhua.",
      "During talks with Shanghai's mayor on Friday, Mr Huang said he was committed to the Chinese market, according to a Shanghai government statement.",
      "How will the export controls impact US-China competition?",
      "The controls are part of Washington's broader goal to de-risk supply chains for advanced technology away from China, and bring more semiconductor production back to the US.",
      "Nvidia this week announced plans to build up AI servers in the US worth up to $500bn. US president Donald Trump later claimed his re-election drove Nvidia's decision.",
      "And in March, Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC, which manufactures Nvidia's chips, announced it would invest an additional $100bn in advanced manufacturing facilities in Arizona.",
      "Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, told the BBC the latest developments show that global technology is becoming increasingly polarised between \"two systems\", one dominated by the US and the other by China.",

    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 23:39:32 GMT",
    "summary": "America is trying to create a chip industry through isolation and protectionism, when what allowed it to emerge in Asia is the opposite: collaboration.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "The US has \"dropped the ball\" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead. So said Gina Raimondo, who at the time was the US Commerce Secretary, in an interview with me back in 2021.",
      "Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.",
      "He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality products in their American factories.",
      "So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale?",
      "Microchips: The secret sauce",
      "Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles. These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale.",
      "Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US.",
      "It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades.",
      "Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US.",
      "With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US.",
      "The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success.",
      "That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden \u2013 an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing.",
      "Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas.",
      "TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island.",
      "But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions.",
      "\"This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,\" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. \"The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.\"",
      "And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips.",
      "Did China try to steal Taiwan's prowess?",
      "Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that \"they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan\".",
      "\"The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,\" he says. \"Today, Taiwan has far more capacity.\"",
      "The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive.",
      "TSMC was the pioneer of the \"foundry model\" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies.",
      "Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing.",
      "\"Could the US make chips and create jobs?\" asks Mr Einstein. \"Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not.\"",
      "One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India.",
      "\"Even Elon Musk has had an immigration problem with Tesla engineers,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to Musk's support for the US's H-1B visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US.",
      "\"That's a bottleneck and there's nothing they can do, unless they change their stance on immigration entirely. You can't just magic PhDs out of nowhere.\"",
      "The global knock-on effect",
      "Even so, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector.",
      "\"It's a wrench in the machine \u2013 a big wrench,\" says Mr Einstein. \"Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan.\"",
      "The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US.",
      "Some companies could look for new markets. Chinese technology giant Huawei, for example, expanded into Europe and emerging markets including Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and many countries in Africa in the face of export controls and tariffs, although the margins in developing nations are small.",
      "\"China ultimately will want to win \u2013 it has to innovate and invest in R&D. Look at what it did with Deepseek,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to the China-built AI chatbot.",
      "\"If they build better chips, everyone is going to go to them. Cost-effectiveness is something they can do now, and looking forward, it's the ultra-high-tech fabrication.\"",
      "In the meantime, new manufacturing hubs may emerge. India has a lot of promise, according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the US \u2013 it's geographically closer, labour is cheap and education is good.",
      "India has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing, but it faces a number of challenges, including land acquisition for factories, and water \u2013 chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it.",
      "Bargaining chips",
      "Chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs. The sheer reliance and demand for chips from major US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Cisco could apply pressure on Trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector.",
      "Some insiders believe intense lobbying by Apple CEO Tim Cook secured the exemptions to smartphone, laptop and electronic tariffs, and Trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips Nvidia can sell to China as a result of lobbying.",
      "Asked specifically about Apple products on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm a very flexible person,\" adding that \"there will be maybe things coming up, I speak to Tim Cook, I helped Tim Cook recently.\"",
      "Mr Einstein thinks it all comes down to Trump ultimately trying to make a deal - he and his administration know they can't just build a bigger building when it comes to chips.",
      "\"I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is what it has done with TikTok's owner Bytedance. He is saying I'm not going to let you operate in the US anymore unless you give Oracle or another US company a stake,\" says Mr Einstein.",
      "\"I think they're trying to fandangle something similar here \u2013 TSMC isn't going anywhere, let's just force them to do a deal with Intel and take a slice of the pie.\"",
      "But the blueprint of the Asia semiconductor ecosystem has a valuable lesson: no one country can operate a chip industry on its own, and if you want to make advanced semiconductors, efficiently and at scale \u2013 it will take time.",
      "Trump is trying to create a chip industry through protectionism and isolation, when what allowed the chip industry to emerge throughout Asia is the opposite: collaboration in a globalised economy.",

      "Its existing facilities across the street already house around 240 start-ups. They are spread across six buildings that used to make up the city's first hospital, founded in the 19th Century and notorious in Helsinki for treating patients with the plague.",
      "Now, the current 20,000 sq m site is a hub for companies developing innovative health technologies, alongside AI, cybersecurity, gaming and defence tech start-ups.",
      "\"The whole place is really based on community,\" says Maria 01's CEO Sarita Runeberg. \"We bring people together so they can network\u2026 and find different kinds of resources to grow their businesses.\"",
      "There are also office perks including a pool table, table football, running and ice bathing clubs, and in true Finnish-style, a sauna.",
      "\"We wouldn't be a proper start-up hub if we didn't have our own sauna here!\" laughs Ms Runeberg.",
      "While co-working spaces for tech companies are well established across the Nordics, Maria 01 is the largest of its kind in the region.",
      "It is run as a not-for-profit organisation partly funded by the city of Helsinki, which has invested more than \u20ac6m ($6.7m; \u00a35.2m) in the hub since its launch in 2016.",
      "Ms Runeberg believes it will become the biggest start-up campus in Europe following the completion of three new buildings by 2028, adding a 50,000 sqm floor area.",
      "Later this year it is launching an accelerator programme designed to support and guide high-growth start-ups.",
      "Can Finland compete as Europe\u2019s start-up capital?",
      "The hub's current and former members have already collectively raised over \u20ac1bn in funding.",
      "This represents around 40% of all early stage funding raised annually by Finnish start-ups.",
      "Ruben Byron is the Belgian co-founder of a start-up offering cloud services to AI developers.",
      "He has already scaled his business from a handful of staff using the hub's hot desks to a team of around 40 working from private offices in the former hospital, as well as remotely.",
      "\"That has been a great experience, that we've kind of been able [to] be nurtured here in a way,\" he says.",
      "Although not as mature \u2013 or well known globally \u2013 as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Finland has been steadily making a name for itself in the tech scene over the last two decades.",
      "The small Nordic nation, which has a population of around 5.6 million, has spawned 12 unicorn businesses \u2013 firms worth a billion dollars or more \u2013 including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura, game developers Supercell, Rovio (the creators of the Angry Birds game), and food delivery platform Wolt.",
      "Last year, Startup Blink, a global index mapping more than 100 countries ranked Finland's start-up ecosystem the 7th best in western Europe, and 14th in the world.",
      "The index cites factors including hubs like Maria 01, alongside high levels of state and university support, and Slush - a huge annual non-profit gathering for global start-ups and investors.",
      "It also highlights Finland's transparent and open business culture.",
      "\"There is an authenticity with the Finns,\" says Jack Parker, a Helsinki-based founder originally from Newcastle upon Tyne, who runs a healthcare innovation start-up.",
      "\"Ego doesn't really play a part. So if I reach out to somebody, it's quite likely eight out of 10 times that they will respond.\"",
      "Finland's right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2023, is on a mission to push the country even further up global indices, stating in its official government programme that it wants the Nordic nation to become a leader in fostering a dynamic start-up and growth company ecosystem.",
      "\"It's not just about rankings,\" says Marjo Ilmari, who runs the start-up services team at Business Finland, the government agency that promotes investment and innovation.",
      "In 2024 Business Finland alone invested \u20ac112m in start-ups, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year.",
      "\"The real goal is to create an environment where our ground-breaking start-ups can emerge and really tackle global challenges.\"",
      "The agency hopes this will help drive growth in the Finnish economy, which went into recession in 2023 and is currently making a sluggish recovery, with the Bank of Finland forecasting an increase of less than 1% this year.",
      "The country is also trying to attract more global talent by offering start-up permits for international founders who want to grow their businesses in Finland.",
      "These entrepreneurs are eligible for a so-called soft-landing support package provided by Business Finland.",
      "\"They give you advice, support, sometimes grants to support the initiation phase,\" explains Lalin Keyvan, a Turkish-born entrepreneur at Maria 01 who says the scheme was one of the main reasons why she relocated to Helsinki.",
      "Business Finland's marketing campaigns for would-be movers highlight social and lifestyle factors too: Finns tend to prioritise wellbeing, plus there's free education and subsidised healthcare and childcare.",
      "\"You don't really have to choose between building a high-growth company and enjoying life, because you can do both,\" says Ms Ilmari.",
      "But whether all this is enough for Finland to compete with Europe's more established start-up hubs is up for debate.",
      "Data suggests it still has a long way to go to catch up with neighbouring Sweden, long the Nordic darling of the European start-up scene.",
      "It is home to more than 40 unicorn businesses including Spotify, payments platform Klarna and game developer King.",
      "In Startup Blink's ecosystem ranking Sweden ranks second in Europe after the UK, and top in the EU.",
      "In the last decade it has attracted more than $29bn in funding compared to just over $8bn in Finland, according to the annual State of European Tech report by investment company Atomico.",
      "\"I love Finland's bold approach,\" says Charlotte Ekelund, deputy CEO of Sting, a non-profit organisation that helps develop start-ups in Stockholm. However she believes Finland is still years behind Sweden in terms of pulling in capital and developing its ecosystem.",
      "\"We observe some of the things that the Finnish ecosystem is doing now, Sting was part of driving 10 or 15 years ago here - co-working spaces, [and] new organisations in the ecosystem that can support in different ways.\"",
      "Mikael Pentikainen, CEO of the Federation of Finnish Enterprises, says the country's government is currently losing support amongst entrepreneurs despite its pro-start-up and pro-business approach.",
      "A recent survey for the organisation found 41% of small and medium-sized business owners are satisfied with the coalition's actions, down from 54% in June.",
      "One likely reason for the dip, says Mr Pentikainen, is a decision to raise VAT from 24% to 25.5% last September, the highest rate in western Europe. The government said this was a \"difficult but necessary\" move designed to stabilise public finances.",
      "But Mr Pentikainen suggests it could make Finland's start-up ecosystem less competitive for international founders.",
      "The Finnish government has also recently toughened up citizenship requirements, meaning foreign entrepreneurs now need to stay at least eight years instead of five in order to obtain a passport, and will soon also be required to pass a test on Finnish society and culture if they want to settle long-term.",
      "Back at Maria 01, Mr Parker, the health company founder, says he's confident Finland's start-up ecosystem will continue to expand and attract international talent. But he warns it might lose some of the aspects that have so far made it an attractive option for entrepreneurs.",

      "Mr Bushiri, from Malawi, was one of southern Africa's best known preachers when he was arrested and charged with fraud in 2020.",
      "After being released on bail, he managed to flee to his home country in unclear circumstances. South Africa has been trying to extradite him ever since.",

      "Mr Bushiri has also been charged with rape. He and his wife have denied any wrongdoing.",
      "South Africa's Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development Mmamoloko Kubayi said Shivambu's association with Mr Bushiri was \"a blatant act of disrespect toward South Africa's legal system\".",
      "She added that it would \"embolden those who believe they can escape accountability\".",
      "Shivambu's own MK party also released a statement to distance itself from his visit, saying he had undertaken it \"in his personal capacity and without the mandate or knowledge of the party\".",
      "The party added that it \"condemns all forms of gender-based violence and the exploitation of vulnerable communities, especially innocent Christian believers, by individuals who manipulate faith for personal enrichment or to evade justice\".",
      "In a post on X on Saturday, Shivambu praised Mr Bushiri for his \"good work\".",
      "\"Thank you my brother, Prophet Bushiri for hosting us and for the kind words,\" he wrote.",
      "\"The government scale amount of work you do to economically, educationally, socially and spiritually uplift our people is unparalleled now and in history.",

      "Under the leadership of former President Zuma, the newly formed MK party came third in last year's elections - a major factor in the governing ANC losing its majority for the first time since democratic elections were introduced in 1994.",
      "Shivambu joined the party in August last year from the rival Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and was later appointed secretary-general - one of the party's top positions.",

    "story": [
      "Iran and the US have held a second round of high-stakes nuclear talks in Rome - and agreed to meet again next week - even as hopes for de-escalation are tempered by mounting military threats and mixed messages.",
      "US President Donald Trump reminds Tehran nearly every day of its options: a deal or war.",
      "He has previously said Israel would lead a military response if the talks failed.",
      "On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that Trump had \"waved off\" an Israeli plan to strike Iranian nuclear sites as early as next month.",
      "\"I wouldn't say waved off. I'm not in a rush to do it,\" Trump told reporters in response to the article on Thursday, adding that he preferred to give diplomacy a chance.",
      "\"I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death... That's my first option. If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran.\"",
      "After both sides described the first round of talks in Oman last weekend as constructive, Trump had said he would be \"making a decision on Iran very quickly\".",
      "US and Iran hold 'constructive' first round of nuclear talks",
      "What is Iran's nuclear programme and what does the US want?",
      "Can Trump convince Iran to ditch its nuclear programme?",
      "Why Iran returned to the table",
      "In 2018, Trump pulled the US out of a 2015 agreement which saw Iran limit its nuclear activities and allow inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in return for sanctions relief.",
      "He said it did too little to stop Iran's potential pathway to a nuclear weapon and reinstated US sanctions as part of a \"maximum pressure\" campaign to compel Iran to negotiate a new deal.",
      "However, Iran refused and increasingly breached restrictions in retaliation. It has now stockpiled enough highly-enriched uranium to make several bombs if it chose to do so - something it says it would never do.",
      "The threat of military action appears to have played a role in bringing Iran back to the negotiating table. Yet it insists that is not the reason.",
      "The website of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Iran had agreed to talks only because the US limited its demands strictly to nuclear issues - not out of fear of US and Israeli strikes.",
      "Even so, reaching a deal remains far from certain.",
      "Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who is leading the US negotiating team, posted on X on Tuesday: \"Any final arrangement must set a framework for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East - meaning that Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization programme.\"",
      "It came just a day after he had suggested in an interview with Fox News that Iran would be allowed to continue enriching uranium.",
      "\"They do not need to enrich past 3.67%,\" he said, referring to the limit set by the 2015 nuclear deal.",
      "\"This is going to be much about verification on the enrichment programme and then ultimately verification on weaponization.\"",
      "Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, the head of the Iranian delegation, responded by noting Witkoff's \"contradictory statements\" and stressing that \"real positions will be made clear at the negotiating table\".",
      "\"We are ready to build trust regarding possible concerns over Iran's enrichment, but the principle of enrichment is not negotiable,\" he said.",
      "Diplomatic flurry",
      "Saturday's talks in Rome come amid a flurry of diplomatic activity.",
      "Saudi Arabia's Defence Minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman, visited Tehran on Thursday, delivering a personal message from his father King Salman to Ayatollah Khamenei. He also met Iran's President, Masoud Pezeshkian.",
      "Iran has warned that any US military action would be met with retaliation against American bases in the region - many of them hosted by Iran's Arab neighbours.",
      "At the same time, Araghchi visited Moscow and handed a letter from Khamenei to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Iran and Russia have strengthened their military ties since the start of the war in Ukraine, with Tehran accused of supplying drones to support Moscow's war effort.",
      "The Russian parliament ratified a 20-year strategic partnership between Iran and Russia 10 days ago. However, the deal does not include a mutual defence clause.",
      "Meanwhile, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi completed a two-day visit to Tehran this week, meeting Iranian nuclear officials and the foreign minister in a bid to ease tensions and restore inspection protocols.",
      "Atmosphere of distrust",
      "Since Trump returned to office this year, Ayatollah Khamenei has consistently denounced negotiations with Washington.",
      "\"Negotiating with this administration is not logical, not wise, nor honourable,\" he said in a February speech, just two months before agreeing to the current round of talks.",
      "The supreme leader's distrust stems from Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear deal, the \"maximum pressure\" campaign that followed, and the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani in a US strike in Iraq in 2020.",
      "Ayatollah Khamenei expressed satisfaction with the first round of talks, saying it was \"implemented well\".",
      "But he cautioned that he was \"neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic\".",
      "He has also previously warned that Iran would \u200bretaliate in the event of strikes on its nuclear programme.",
      "Some officials, including his adviser Ali Larijani, have even said that Iran might be \"forced\" to acquire a nuclear weapon if attacked.",
      "\"We are not pursuing weapons, and we have no problem with IAEA oversight - even indefinitely. But if you resort to bombing, Iran will have no choice but to reconsider. That is not in your interest,\" Larijani told state TV earlier this month.",
      "Direct or indirect?",
      "Each side is pushing its own narrative about how the talks are being conducted.",
      "The US says they are direct. Iran says they indirect, and that Oman is mediating by exchanging written notes.",
      "After the first round in Muscat, Araghchi acknowledged he had a brief exchange with Witkoff \"out of diplomatic courtesy\" after crossing paths.",
      "US news website Axios, citing sources, reported the two chief negotiators spoke for up to 45 minutes.",
      "Tehran prefers secrecy. Washington seeks publicity.",
      "After both sides put out positive statements about the first round, Iran's currency surged by 20%.",
      "Iran's leadership is well aware of public discontent over the country's harsh economic conditions - and the potential for protests it may trigger.",
      "For the Islamic Republic, the fear is not just over bombs - it's protests too."

    "published": "Sat, 19 Apr 2025 22:58:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Spanish police use an algorithm to assess the risk of repeat domestic violence.  Does it work?",
    "story": [
      "In January, Lina went to the police.",
      "Her ex-partner had been threatening her at home in the Spanish seaside town of Benalm\u00e1dena. That day, he'd allegedly raised his hand as if to hit her.",
      "\"There had been violent episodes - she was scared,\" Lina's cousin Daniel recalls.",
      "When she got to the police station, she was interviewed and her case registered with VioG\u00e9n, a digital tool which assesses the likelihood of a woman being attacked again by the same man.",
      "VioG\u00e9n - an algorithm-based system - asks 35 questions about the abuse and its intensity, the aggressor's access to weapons, his mental health and whether the woman has left, or is considering leaving, the relationship.",
      "It then records the threat to her as \"negligible\", \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\" or \"extreme\".",
      "The category is used to make decisions about the allocation of police resources to protect the woman.",
      "Lina was deemed to be at \"medium\" risk.",
      "She asked for a restraining order at a specialist gender violence court in Malaga, so that her ex-partner couldn't be in contact with her or share her living space.  The request was denied.",
      "\"Lina wanted to change the locks at her home, so she could live peacefully with her children,\" says her cousin.",
      "Three weeks later, she was dead. Her partner had allegedly used his key to enter her flat and soon the house was on fire.",
      "While her children, mother and ex-partner all escaped, Lina didn't. Her 11-year-old son was widely reported as telling police it was his father who killed his mother.",
      "Lina's lifeless body was retrieved from the charred interior of her home. Her ex-partner, the father of her three youngest children, was arrested.",
      "Now, her death is raising questions about VioG\u00e9n and its ability to keep women safe in Spain.",
      "VioG\u00e9n didn't accurately predict the threat to Lina.",
      "As a woman designated at \"medium\" risk, the protocol is that she would be followed up again by a nominated police officer within 30 days.",
      "But Lina was dead before that. If she had been \"high\" risk, the police follow-up would have happened within a week.  Could that have made a difference to Lina?",
      "Tools to evaluate the threat of repeat domestic violence are used in North America and across Europe. In the UK, some police forces use DARA (Domestic Abuse Risk Assessment) - essentially a checklist. And DASH (Domestic Abuse, Stalking, Harassment and Honour-based Violence Assessment) may be employed by police or others, like social workers, to assess the risk of another attack.",
      "But only in Spain is an algorithm woven so tightly into police practice. VioG\u00e9n was developed by Spanish police and academics.  It's used everywhere apart from the Basque Country and Catalonia (those regions have separate systems, although police co-operation is nationwide).",
      "The head of the National Police's family and women's unit in Malaga, Ch Insp Isabel Espejo, describes VioG\u00e9n as \"super-important\".",
      "\"It helps us follow each victim's case very precisely,\" she says.",
      "Her officers deal with an average of 10 reports of gender violence a day. And every month, VioG\u00e9n classifies nine or 10 women as being at \"extreme\" risk of repeat victimisation.",
      "The resource implications in those cases are huge: 24-hour police protection for a woman until the circumstances change and the risk decreases. Women assessed as \"high\" risk may also get an officer escort.",
      "A 2014 study found that officers accepted VioG\u00e9n's evaluation of the likelihood of repeated abuse 95% of the time. Critics suggest police are abdicating decision-making about women's safety to an algorithm.",
      "Ch Insp Espejo says that the algorithm's calculation of risk is usually adequate. But she recognises  - even though Lina's case wasn't under her command - that something went wrong with Lina's assessment.",
      "\"I'm not going to say VioG\u00e9n doesn't fail \u2013 it does. But this wasn't the trigger that led to this woman's murder. The only guilty party is the person who killed Lina. Total security just doesn't exist,\" she says.",
      "But at \"medium\" risk, Lina was never a police priority. And did Lina's VioG\u00e9n assessment have an impact on the court's decision to deny her a restraining order against her ex-partner?",
      "Court authorities didn't give us permission to meet the judge who denied Lina an injunction against her ex-partner - a woman attacked on social media after Lina's death.",
      "Instead, another of Malaga's gender violence judges, Maria del Carmen Guti\u00e9rrez tells us in general terms that such an order needs two things: evidence of a crime and the threat of serious danger to the victim.",
      "\"VioG\u00e9n is one element I use to assess that danger, but it's far from the only one,\" she says.",
      "Sometimes, the judge says, she makes restraining orders in cases where VioG\u00e9n has assessed a woman as at \"negligible\" or \"low\" risk.  On other occasions she may conclude there's no danger to a woman deemed at \"medium\" or \"high\" risk of repeat victimisation.",
      "Dr Juan Jose Medina, a criminologist at the University of Seville, says Spain has a \"postcode lottery\" for women applying for restraining orders \u2013 some jurisdictions are much more likely to grant them than others.  But we don't know systematically how VioG\u00e9n influences the courts, or the police, because studies haven't been done.",
      "\"How are police officers and other stakeholders using this tool, and how is it informing their decision-making? We don't have good answers,\" he says.",
      "Spain's interior ministry hasn't often allowed academics access to VioG\u00e9n's data. And there hasn't been an independent audit of the algorithm.",
      "Gemma Galdon, the founder of Eticas \u2013 an organisation working on the social and ethical impact of technology \u2013 says if you don't audit these systems, you won't know if they're actually delivering police protection to the right women.",
      "Examples of algorithmic bias elsewhere are well-documented.  In the US, analysis from 2016 of a recidivism tool found black defendants were more likely than their white peers to be incorrectly judged to be at higher risk of repeat offending. At the same time, white defendants were more likely than black defendants to be wrongly flagged as low risk.",
      "In 2018, Spain's interior ministry didn't give a green light to an Eticas proposal to conduct a confidential, pro-bono, internal audit. So instead, Gemma Galdon and her colleagues decided to reverse-engineer VioG\u00e9n and do an external audit.",
      "They used interviews with women survivors of domestic abuse and publicly available information - including data from the judiciary about women who, like Lina, had been killed.",
      "They found that between 2003 and 2021, 71 women murdered by their partners or ex-partners had previously reported domestic abuse to the police.  Those recorded on the VioG\u00e9n system were given risk levels of \"negligible\" or \"medium\".",
      "\"What we'd like to know is, were those error rates that cannot be mitigated in any way? Or could we have done something to improve how these systems assign risk and protect those women better?\" asks Gemma Galdon.",
      "The head of gender violence research at Spain's interior ministry, Juan Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez-Ossorio, is dismissive of the Eticas investigation: it wasn't done with VioG\u00e9n data. \"If you don't have access to the data, how can you interpret it?\" he says.",
      "And he is wary of an external audit, fearing it could compromise both the security of women whose cases are recorded and VioG\u00e9n's procedures.",
      "\"What we know is that once a woman reports a man and she's under police protection, the probability of further violence is substantially lowered - we've no doubts about that,\" says L\u00f3pez-Ossorio.",
      "VioG\u00e9n has evolved since it was introduced in Spain.  The questionnaire has been refined, and the \"negligible\" category of risk will soon be abolished. And even critics agree it makes sense to have a standardised system responding to gender violence.",
      "In Benalm\u00e1dena, Lina's home has become a shrine.",
      "Flowers, candles and pictures of saints were left on the step. A small poster stuck on the wall declared: Benalm\u00e1dena says no to gender violence. The community fundraised for Lina's children.",
      "Her cousin, Daniel, says everyone's still reeling from news of her death.",
      "\"The family it's destroyed \u2013 especially Lina's mother,\" he says.",
      "\"She's 82 years old. I don't think there's anything sadder than to have your daughter killed by an aggressor in a way that could have been avoided. The children are still in shock \u2013 they'll need a lot of psychological help.\"",

    "summary": "The tycoon and Donald Trump adviser has moved his businesses from California to a mostly rural central Texas county.",
    "story": [
      "After fleeing Silicon Valley for political and business reasons, Elon Musk is building a corporate campus in rural Texas \u2013 but his new neighbours have mixed views.",
      "Half an hour east of Austin, past the airport, the clogged-up traffic starts to melt away and the plains of Central Texas open up, leaving the booming city behind.",
      "Somewhere along the main two-lane highway, a left turn takes drivers down Farm-to-Market Road 1209. It seems like an unlikely address for a high-tech hub, but that's exactly what Elon Musk, the world's richest man and one of President Donald Trump's closest allies, hopes it will become.",
      "Court filings indicate that a large metal building finished in the last few months will be the new headquarters of X, his social media platform.",
      "A short distance away, a large logo of the Boring Company, Musk's infrastructure company, is plastered on the side of another headquarters.  And across FM 1209 is a rapidly growing SpaceX facility which manufactures Starlink satellite internet equipment.",
      "Like most technology tycoons, Musk had long made Silicon Valley his home and headquarters. Once a supporter of the Democrats, his move to Texas is part of a larger tech world trend and also appears to reflect his own transformed ideological views.",
      "Here the land is (relatively) cheap, skilled tech workers from nearby Austin are plentiful, and local laws are favourable to development.",
      "Of course, there are also specific political angles to the move.",
      "In July 2024, Musk said he was quitting California after the state passed a law prohibiting teachers from enforcing rules about notifying families when students' gender identity changes.",
      "Musk has an estranged transgender daughter and has spoken out against what he calls \"woke mind virus\" - which he describes in interviews as divisive identity politics - along with anti-meritocratic and anti-free speech ideas.",
      "And so Musk upped sticks and headed to Texas, a Republican stronghold and the fastest-growing state in the US.",
      "In addition to the cluster of buildings near Bastrop in central Texas, he has built a SpaceX facility in Cameron County, on the southern tip of Texas near the border with Mexico. SpaceX employees there have filed a petition to create a new town called Starbase. The measure will go to a vote in May.",
      "Locals in Bastrop have mixed feelings about the development.",
      "\"It's almost like we have a split personality,\" says Sylvia Carrillo, city manager of Bastrop, which has a growing population of more than 12,000. \"Residents are happy that their children and grandchildren will have jobs in the area.",
      "\"On the other hand it can feel like we are being overwhelmed by a third party and that the development will quickly urbanise our area,\" she says.",
      "Although the Musk development is technically outside of the city's limits, it's close enough that Texas laws give Bastrop's government sway over development. And, Ms Carrillo stresses, the Musk buildings are just one example of many developments springing up in a booming area.",
      "\"He's faced a backlash that is not entirely of his own creating,\" she says.",
      "\"But now that he's here and things are changing quickly, it's a matter of managing\" issues like house and land prices and the environment, she says.",
      "The Musk compound is still fairly bare-bones. The grandly named Hyperloop Plaza sits in the middle of the corporate buildings, and is home to the company-owned Boring Bodega, a bar, coffee shop, hairdresser and gift shop.",
      "On a recent windy Sunday afternoon, a video game console sat unplayed in front of a couch near a display of company T-shirts, while a few children scurried back and forth to a playground outside.",
      "The developments in Bastrop fit right into the quickening pace of activity across central Texas, where cranes perpetually loom above the Austin skyline and the housing market is a perpetual topic of conversation.",
      "The area has gone through various industry booms and busts over the years, including lumber and coal mining, says Judy Enis, a volunteer guide at the Bastrop Museum and Visitor Center.",
      "During World War Two, tens of thousands of soldiers - and around 10,000 German prisoners of war - poured in to Camp Swift, a US Army facility north of the town.",
      "\"That probably had more of an impact than Elon Musk,\" Ms Enis notes.",
      "Views of the tycoon are mixed, to say the least, and inseparable not only from his politics but also opinions on economic development, in what still is a predominately rural area.",
      "Judah Ross, a local real estate agent, says the development has supercharged population growth that started as a result of the Austin boom and accelerated during the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"I'm always going to be biased because I want the growth,\" Mr Ross says. \"But I love it here and I want to be part of it.",
      "\"If nothing else, what's good is the amount of jobs that this is bringing in,\" he says. \"In the past year,  I've sold to people working at Boring and SpaceX.\"",
      "Alfonso Lopez, a Texan who returned to the state after working in tech in Seattle, says he initially picked Bastrop figuring he would make a quick buck on a house purchase and move on.",
      "Instead, he quickly became enamoured with the town, its mix of local businesses and friendly people, and wants to stay.",
      "Mr Lopez is no big fan of Musk and is critical of some of his management practices and politics, but admires the technology his companies have built and is happy to live nearby as long as the companies are good neighbours.",
      "\"As long as they don't ruin my water or dig a tunnel beneath my house and create a sinkhole, this isn't bad,\" he says, gesturing around the metal shed housing the bodega, coffee shop and bar. \"I'll come here and watch a game.\"",
      "His concerns about water are more than theoretical. Last year The Boring Company was fined $11,876 (\u00a38,950) by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality after being cited for water pollution violations.",
      "The Boring Company initially planned to dump wastewater in the nearby Colorado River but, after local pressure, signed a deal to send the sludge to a Bastrop wastewater treatment plant.",
      "The water issues appear to have delayed housebuilding, which reportedly could include more than 100 homes for Musk employees. The planned development of homes has so far failed to materialise, however. For now, the extent of living quarters is a handful of temporary trailers behind the bodega building, surrounded by a wall, acres of Texas plain and a few horses munching grass. Ms Carrillo, the city manager, says any large-scale home building is at least a year off.",
      "In November, SpaceX applied for a free trade zone designation, which would allow it to move materials and finished products in and out of the Bastrop factory without being subject to tariffs - one of Donald Trump's signature policies.",
      "It's a common practice for manufacturers, and there are hundreds of similar zones across the country.",
      "Local officials in Texas have endorsed the proposal, saying it will boost the local economy, despite costing the county an estimated $45,000 (\u00a334,800) in revenue this year.",
      "The company is also getting an injection of $17.3m (\u00a313.4m) from the Texas government to develop the site, a grant that officials say is expected to create more than 400 jobs and $280m in capital investment in Bastrop.",
      "Few local residents wanted to directly criticise Musk when standing face-to-face with a visiting reporter. But it's a different story online, where sharper feelings shine through.",
      "\"They will ruin everything nearby,\" one resident posted on a local online forum. \"Nothing good comes with him.\"",
      "The BBC contacted SpaceX, The Boring Company and X for comment.",
      "Ms Carrillo, the city manager, says she hasn't picked up on much personal anger on the part of locals prompted by Musk's activities in Washington.",
      "But to protect Bastrop, she says, the city has recently enacted laws limiting housing density and providing for public parks - measures that she says will keep the \"historic nature\" of the well-preserved downtown while allowing for growth on the outskirts.",
      "Bastrop, she says, is a conservative, traditionally Republican place.",
      "\"His national stuff doesn't really register,\" she says. \"His companies have been good corporate citizens, and we hope it can stay that way.\"",

    "story": [
      "An 82-year-old woman who teaches the ancient Indian martial art of Kalaripayattu says she has no plans to retire.",
      "\"I'll probably practise Kalari until the day I die,\" says Meenakshi Raghavan, widely thought to be the oldest woman in the world to practise the art form.",
      "Kalaripayattu - kalari means battleground and payattu means fight - is believed to have originated at least 3,000 years back in the southern state of Kerala and is regarded as India's oldest martial art.",
      "It is not solely practised for combat or fighting; it also serves to instil discipline, build strength and develop self-defence skills.",
      "Ms Raghavan is fondly known as Meenakshi Amma -  Amma means mother in the Malayalam language - in Kerala's Vadakara, where she lives. The town is also home to other renowned exponents of the art like Unniyarcha, Aromal Chekavar and Thacholi Othenan.",
      "Meenakshi Amma occasionally performs in other cities but mainly runs her own Kalari school, founded by her husband in 1950. Her days are busy, with classes from five in the morning to noon.",
      "\"I teach about 50 students daily. My four children were also trained [in the art form] by me and my husband. They started learning from the age of six,\" she says.",
      "Kalaripayattu has four stages and it requires patience to learn the art form.",
      "Training begins with meypattu - an oil massage followed by exercises to condition the body.",
      "After about two years, students progress to kolthari (stick fighting), then to angathari (weapon combat), and finally to verumkai - the highest level, involving unarmed combat. It typically takes up to five years to master Kalaripayattu.",
      "Kung fu is believed to have adapted principles like breathing techniques and marmashastra (stimulating vital points to optimise energy flow) from Kalaripayattu, according to Vinod Kadangal, another Kalari teacher.",
      "Legend has it that around the 6th Century, Indian Buddhist monk Bodhidharma introduced these techniques to the Shaolin monks, influencing the more famous Chinese martial art.",
      "Meenakshi Amma still recalls the first time she stepped into a Kalari - the red-earth arena where the art is practised - 75 years ago.",
      "\"I was seven and quite good at dancing. So my guru - VP Raghavan - approached my father and suggested that I learn Kalaripayattu. Just like dance, the art form requires you to be flexible,\" she says.",
      "Hailing from Kerala's Thiyya community, Meenakshi Amma's guru was 15 when he and his brothers opened their own Kalaripayattu school after being denied admission elsewhere because of their low social caste.",
      "\"There was no bias when it came to girls enrolling to study Kalari - in fact, physical education was compulsory in all Kerala schools at that time. But we were expected to stop after attaining puberty,\" she says.",
      "Unlike others, Meenakshi Amma's father encouraged her training into her late teens. At 17, she fell in love with Raghavan, and they soon married. Together, they went on to train hundreds of students, often for free.",
      "\"At the time, a lot of children came from poor families. The only money he [Raghavan] accepted was in the form of dakshina or a tribute paid to the teacher,\" she says.",
      "Donations sustained the school, while Raghavan later took a teaching job for extra income. After his death in 2007, Meenakshi Amma formally took charge.",
      "While she has no plans to retire at the moment, she hopes to hand over the school  one day to her eldest son Sanjeev.",
      "The 62-year-old, who is also an instructor at the school, says he is lucky to have learnt from the best - his mother. But being her son earns no favours; he says she's still his toughest opponent.",
      "Meenakshi Amma is a local celebrity. During our interview, three politicians drop by to invite her to an awards ceremony.",

      "But she was uprooted again after fighting erupted in the city in 2023 between forces loyal to military ruler Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his then-deputy Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti.",
      "\"The conflict started among themselves,\" Ms Williams says. \"But later, they began killing South Sudanese also, even though we weren't part of their fight.\"",
      "In the past two years, the conflict in Sudan has claimed more than 150,000 lives, forcing more than 12 million people from their homes, and turning large parts of Khartoum into rubble.",
      "When her home came under attack, she packed her few belongings and headed back to South Sudan.",
      "However, conflict has now resumed there too, with the United Nations (UN) warning that the 2018 peace agreement between Kiir and Machar is at risk of collapsing.",
      "Ms Williams' journey has ended, for now, in Renk. A once quiet dusty border town, it has  turned into a transit hub, heaving with refugees from both Sudan and its neighbour to the south.",
      "Stranded in Renk for about five months, Ms Williams wants to return to her hometown, Nasir, in Upper Nile State.",
      "However, it is unsafe to travel to Nasir - a strategically important port town along the Sobat River - as it has turned into a war zone.",
      "\"There's conflict ahead of us,\" she tells the BBC, holding her four-year-old daughter while gently rocking her one-year-old son.",
      "Her voice is steady, but her eyes are heavy - carrying the weight of war, loss, and uncertainty.",
      "Government troops and the White Army - a militia allied with Machar during the civil war - have repeatedly clashed in Nasir, with reports of heavy shelling, ambushes, and displacement of residents.",
      "Ms Williams has not heard from her family in the town.",
      "\"I don't know where they ran to when the clashes started\u2026 or even if they're alive,\" she says quietly.",
      "The fighting in South Sudan has left thousands of people like Ms Williams stranded at the Renk Transit Centre. The camp is overcrowded, accommodating more than 9,000 people - three times the number it was designed for.",
      "Refugees are given a small amount of cash by aid agencies to buy food, but it lasts for only two weeks and they are then expected to fend for themselves.",
      "Sarah says she and other refugees were then forced to chop down trees to sell as firewood, so that they could raise money for food",
      "\"I used to collect firewood and sell it to buy flour, but there's nothing left in the forest now. No wood for women to collect and sell,\" Ms Williams says  - a reminder of the environmental degradation that war causes.",
      "Corrugated shelters at the camp squeeze in up to 15 people per room. Others build fragile homes from sticks, cloth, and torn sacks. Overcrowding is fuelling disease, hunger and despair.",
      "Aid agencies are scrambling to move families to safer parts of South Sudan, where people have \"stronger community or family ties, livelihood opportunities, and better access to services\", says Vijaya Souri of the International Organization for Migration (IOM).",
      "Hundreds wait under a scorching sun to board metal boats bound for Malakal. The journey takes two and a half days down the River Nile. Passengers sit on their luggage or the floor of the boat.",
      "Among them is Mary Deng, who escaped from Wad Madani, a fierce battleground in the Sudanese conflict.",
      "\"This child was just one day old when we crossed the border,\" she says. \"We are 16 in total. We had no money - but we had God.\"",
      "She clutches a bundle of documents - her family's ticket out of Renk.",
      "Medical services are stretched to their limits. The Joda border clinic - built from iron sheets - is the only functioning health centre in the area.",
      "\"Over 600 babies have been born here since the war began,\" says a health worker. \"But we can only operate during the day now, there's no funding for night shifts.\"",
      "A cholera epidemic was declared in Renk last October. It spread across most of South Sudan, including the capital Juba, causing more than 450 deaths.",
      "Tatek Wondimu Mamecha, the World Health Organisation's (WHO) emergency officer in South Sudan, warns of the growing risks.",
      "\"Even though the cholera outbreak is controlled, we're not out of the woods. Right now, malaria is spiking and with the rainy season coming, it will shoot up,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Mr Tatek adds that the ripple effects of global aid cuts by US President Donald Trump's administration are devastating.",
      "\"Five of our partners either stopped service or reduced operations by 50%.\"",
      "Hospitals like Renk Referral have lost half their staff, including surgeons, obstetricians, paediatricians, putting an enormous strain on the remaining medics.",
      "\"The facility manages around 350 to 400 patients a day,\" Mr Tatek says.",
      "The refugee crisis in Renk brings into sharp focus the fact that tens of thousands people are trapped between two conflicts, with parts of South Sudan no longer a safe haven for people fleeing the two-year conflict in Sudan.",
      "Tensions have escalated in South Sudan since March when Machar was put under house arrest after being accused by Kiir's allies of supporting armed groups - a claim his party denies.",
      "George Owino, the chair of a monitoring body set up under the 2018 peace deal to assist in its implementation, has warned that the latest clashes \"threaten the foundation of the agreement.\"",
      "He tells the BBC the core problem is that political leaders continue to command  rival troops, failing to integrate them into a unified national army.",
      "\"The link between politics and military power is still intact,\" Mr Owino says.",
      "\"When leaders disagree, it quickly turns into armed confrontation - exactly what the agreement was supposed to prevent.\"",
      "The 2013 civil war broke out after Kiir sacked Machar as vice-president, accusing him of plotting a coup, while Machar made the counter-accusation that Kiir was a \"dictator\".",
      "The devastating civil war ended following the 2018 peace deal that saw Machar being reappointed as vice-president.",
      "\"There used to be more dialogue within the presidency. That has diminished,\" Mr Owino says.",
      "The African Union (AU) has so far failed in its efforts to get the peace process back on track, while Uganda has deployed troops to South Sudan to bolster Kiir's position.",
      "Machar's party says the deployment undermines South Sudan's sovereignty, and the 2018 peace deal.",
      "Both Uganda and Kiir's government defend the deployment, saying it is in accordance with a long-standing security agreement between the two nations.",
      "Nevertheless, the deployment shows how fragile Kiir's grip on power is, while fears grow that a full-scale civil war could resume.",
      "And across the border in Sudan, the civil war continues to rage, with Gen Dagalo announcing the formation of a rival government.",
      "His move comes despite the fact that his forces have lost control of Khartoum after heavy fighting. The city is now a burnt-out shell, with bombed and blackened buildings.",
      "Ms Williams says she has no intention of going back to Khartoum, and has decided that it is best to try and rebuild her life in her home country, \"even if the situation is bad\".",

    "summary": "Rakhaldas Banerjee is credited with discovering Mohenjo-daro, but his legacy is tainted by controversy.",
    "story": [
      "An Indian archaeologist, whose career was marked by brilliance and controversy, made one of the world's greatest historical discoveries. Yet he remains largely forgotten today.",
      "In the early 1900s, Rakhaldas Banerjee (also spelled Banerji) unearthed Mohenjo-daro - meaning \"mound of the dead men\" in the Sindhi language - in present-day Pakistan. It was the largest city of the thriving Indus Valley (Harappan) Civilisation, which stretched from north-east Afghanistan to north-west India during the Bronze Age.",
      "Banerjee, an intrepid explorer and talented epigraphist, worked for the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) when the country was under British colonial rule. He spent months travelling to distant corners of the subcontinent, looking for ancient artefacts, ruins and scripts.",
      "But while his discovery of Mohenjo-daro was ground-breaking, Banerjee's legacy is clouded by disputes. His independent streak and defiance of colonial protocols often landed him in trouble - tainting his reputation and perhaps even erasing parts of his contribution from global memory.",
      "Interestingly, Banerjee's reports on Mohenjo-daro were never published by the ASI. Archaeologist PK Mishra later accused then ASI chief John Marshall of suppressing Banerjee's findings and claiming credit for the discovery himself.",
      "\"The world knows Marshall discovered the civilisation's ruins and it is taught in institutions. Banerjee is an insignificant footnote,\" Prof Mishra told the Times of India newspaper.",
      "In her book, Finding Forgotten Cities: How the Indus Civilization Was Discovered,  historian Nayanjot Lahiri writes that Banerjee \"lacked diplomacy and tact and displayed a high-handedness that ruffled feathers\". Her book also sheds light on the controversies he was embroiled in during his time at the ASI.",
      "She notes how once, he attempted to procure inscriptions and images from a museum in north-east India without the approval or knowledge of his boss.",
      "Another time, Banerjee attempted to relocate some stone sculptures from a museum in Bengal to the one he was stationed at without the necessary permissions.",
      "In another instance, he purchased an antique painting for a sum without consulting his superiors who thought he'd paid more than was necessary.",
      "\"Banerjee's many talents seemed to include being always able to rub people the wrong way,\" Lahiri writes.",
      "But Banerjee remains a prominent figure among world historians and scholars in Bengal because of his connection with Mohenjo-daro.",
      "He was born in 1885 to a wealthy family in Bengal.",
      "The medieval monuments that dotted Baharampur, the city he grew up in, kindled his interest in history and he pursued the subject in college. But he always had an adventurous streak.",
      "Once, when he was tasked with writing an essay about the Scythian period of Indian history, he travelled to a museum in a neighbouring state to study first-hand sculptures and scripts from that era.",
      "In her book, The Life and Works of Rakhaldas Banerji, author Yama Pande notes how Banerjee joined the ASI as an excavation assistant in 1910 and rose quickly within the ranks to become a superintending archaeologist in western India in 1917.",
      "It was in this post that he first set eyes on Mohenjo-daro in Sindh in 1919. In the following years, he conducted a series of excavations at the site that revealed some of the most fascinating finds: ancient Buddhist stupas, coins, seals, pots and microliths.",
      "Between 1922 and 1923, he discovered several layers of ruins that held clues about various urban settlements that had emerged in the region, but most importantly, the oldest one that had existed some 5,300 years ago - the Indus Valley Civilisation.",
      "At that time, historians had not yet discovered the full scale of the Indus Civilisation which, we now know, covered an expanse of approximately 386,000 sq miles (999,735 sq km) along the Indus river valley.",
      "Three seals from Banerjee's excavation bore images and scripts similar to those from Harappa in the Punjab province in present-day Pakistan. This helped establish a link between the two sites, shedding light on the vast reach of the Indus Valley civilisation.",
      "But by 1924, Banerjee's funds for the project had dried up and he was also transferred to eastern India. He had no further contact with the site, nor did he participate in any excavations there, Pande writes in her book.",
      "But Nayanjot Lahiri notes that Banerjee was transferred at his own request, after becoming entangled in questions over his spending. He had failed to account for several job-related expenses.",
      "It was also revealed that Banerjee had used excavation grants to buy office furniture and his travel expenses were deemed excessive.",
      "His explanations failed to convince his superiors and disciplinary action was recommended. After some negotiation, Banerjee was granted his request and transferred to another region.",
      "Banerjee continued to work with the ASI in eastern India. He spent most of his time in Calcutta (now Kolkata) and oversaw the restoration work of many important monuments.",
      "He resigned from the ASI in 1927, but his departure was marred by controversy. In the years prior to his departure, he became the prime suspect in a case of idol theft.",
      "It all started in October 1925, when Banerjee had visited a revered Hindu shrine in Madhya Pradesh state that housed a stone idol of a Buddhist goddess. Banerjee was accompanied by two low-ranking assistants and two labourers, Lahiri notes in her book.",
      "However, following their visit, the idol went missing, and Banerjee was implicated in its theft. He denied any involvement in the disappearance and an investigation was launched.",
      "The idol was later recovered in Calcutta. Though the case against Banerjee was dismissed and the charges were found to be unsubstantiated, Marshall insisted on his resignation.",
      "After leaving the ASI, Banerjee worked as a professor, but faced financial difficulties because of his lavish lifestyle.",
      "Historian Tapati Guha-Thakurta told the Telegraph newspaper that Banerjee splurged on good food, horse carriages and friends. In 1928, he joined the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) as a professor. He died just two years later at the age of 45.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 22:56:24 GMT",
    "summary": "China sits at the heart of Apple's supply chain - and has benefited hugely from it. Can they break up?",
    "story": [
      "Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.",
      "While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.",
      "Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.",
      "Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.",
      "But the comfort is short-lived.",
      "The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".",
      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",
      "\"But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.\"",

      "By 07:30, a slight figure in a pink headscarf, Dr Wissam Sukkar, is picking her way through the devastated streets of Gaza City.",
      "\"I was walking for around 50 minutes to reach our clinic,\" she explains when she is met by a local BBC journalist who helped us log her day. With virtually no fuel left in Gaza, few taxis are running.",
      "\"With our limited resources we're still trying to be here in northern Gaza through these difficult times,\" adds Dr Sukkar.",
      "The UN's World Health Organization (WHO) says that only 21 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are currently partially functional. Medical supplies are running critically low due to Israel's ongoing blockade of Gaza.",
      "The GP points out what is left of her former workplace, an MSF burns clinic that came under fire in the early weeks of the war, during street battles between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters.",
      "Her team has now converted an office towards the west of Gaza City into a clinic - and by 09:30, as Dr Sukkar is putting on her white robe, there are already some 150 people waiting outside in a tented reception area.",
      "\"Most of our patients are displaced people,\" Dr Sukkar says. \"They live in shelters, they even live in tents in the streets.\"",
      "Since a ceasefire collapsed a month ago, thousands of Gazans have once again left their homes and fled to this neighbourhood, seeking safety.",
      "With little food and clean water, there is a rise in malnutrition and diseases - from stomach bugs to scabies. The elderly and young are worst affected, and the first patients of the day are babies with viral infections.",
      "\"We receive a lot of children who suffer from upper respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea. In the shelters, there are a lot of children in the same place and a virus can spread very quickly,\" the doctor explains.",
      "One toddler has his face dotted with mosquito bites and Dr Sukkar administers some soothing cream. As cooking gas has run out, families have taken to using open fires to heat food and this has also led to an increase in serious burns.",
      "Within an hour, Dr Sukkar and three other physicians have seen dozens of patients. But there are many whom they struggle to help.",
      "\"We have more and more challenges with the huge number of patients with less and less medical supplies,\" Dr Sukkar says wearily.",
      "\"Also, we receive complicated cases, and we don't know where to refer these patients because the health system in Gaza has collapsed.\"",
      "There has been an influx in seriously wounded patients arriving at the clinic since last Sunday, when Israeli warplanes attacked al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City.",
      "Israel accused Hamas of using a hospital building as a \"command and control centre\"; something the armed group denied.",
      "Al-Ahli - which was the main medical site for treating trauma in northern Gaza - can no longer accept patients. The WHO says the emergency room, laboratory, X-ray machines and pharmacy were destroyed.",
      "\"I started my treatment at al-Shifa hospital, then I got transferred to al-Ahli and they bombed it,\" says Saeed Barkat, an older man with a fractured thigh bone, who arrives at the MSF clinic on crutches.",
      "He had surgery after he was wounded by Israeli artillery fire on the shelter where he was staying late last year. He has pins in his leg, and it is swollen.",
      "\"I came here for any treatment and to follow-up,\" says Mr Barkat, as nurses change his dressing and give new painkillers.",
      "At midday, when Dr Sukkar checks on the small pharmacy at the clinic, she looks worried. Many of the shelves are bare.",
      "Israel closed all crossings to Gaza at the start of March, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages it is holding. Since then, no aid has entered.",
      "\"For diabetes, we don't have insulin, we don't have treatments for epilepsy, we don't have basic medicines like anti-fever drugs,\" Dr Sukkar says.",
      "\"It's the season for skin infections and we don't have creams or ointments for bacterial infections, no medicines to treat scabies and head lice.\"",
      "The doctors are rationing the supplies that remain.",
      "\"We are doing our best so that it will be enough for the coming week,\" sums up Dr Sukkar, \"but we expect that our stock will run out in more or less two weeks.\"",

      "By 15:30, it is time to close up the clinic for the day. The four doctors here calculate that they have seen nearly 390 patients.",
      "After a long, tiring day, there is the long, tiring walk home for Dr Sukkar.",

    "story": [
      "All David Hyde Pierce has to do is step out on stage, and he gets applause, even before he launches into the idiotic tongue-twister from \"The Pirates of Penzance\":",
      "I am the very model of a modern Major-General,I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historicalFrom Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical",
      "With practically no expression on his face, babbling away, all kinds of commotion around him, he's funny.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think 'less is more' can be funny?\"",
      "\"Well, I think so much of theater, rightly, is MORE,\" Pierce replied. \"Sometimes, what's unexpected in theater is someone doing less.\"",
      "\"Is there a temptation to overact?\"",
      "\"Always,\" he said. \"You remind me of a great line from 'Frasier,' which was, 'If less is more, think how much more MORE will be!'\"",
      "It is thanks to his 11-year run on the TV mega-hit \"Frasier\" that Pierce has the recognition, and can afford to pick and choose his roles. He's the Major-General in \"Pirates! The Penzance Musical,\" a jazzy re-working of the Gilbert & Sullivan classic, transplanted to New Orleans.",
      "Pierce showed us one of the Gilbert & Sullivan scores from his summer camp from the 1970s (\"It's almost as old as I am\"), which was also the score he used for an episode of \"Frasier\" where he, Kelsey Grammer and David Ogden Stiers sang from \"Penzance.\"",
      "I asked, \"What does Gilbert & Sullivan mean to you?\"",
      "\"Hmm. Well, it must mean something, 'cause it's \u2026 I'm getting emotional,\" Pierce replied. \"Thinking about the question, I guess it's just, it's just because it's been threaded through my life for so long.\"",
      "In his dressing room at the Roundabout Theatre, the wall is covered with photographs of people who were in the dressing room before: \"Famous people, a lot of them dear friends of mine,\" he said. \"I'll be up there eventually. Tradition is very important to us. It's being aware that you're part of something bigger.\"",
      "Pierce's \"Pirates\" dressing room is full of nods to the emotional touchstones that define him, including one of the most important: a photograph of him talking to his dad about a show he was doing, \"at a time when I didn't even know that that's what I was going into, had no idea what was lying ahead,\" he said.",
      "Pierce's father and his grandfather were amateur performers. \"The disease runs in the family,\" he said. \"I just hadn't been diagnosed, I guess!\"",
      "He set out to be a concert pianist. He still plays every day, but decided to become an actor instead while he was a student at Yale.",
      "And what brought him to comedy? \"I think it has to do with what I was drawn to,\" Pierce said. \"I watched reruns of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show' and 'Mary Tyler Moore' and 'All in the Family.' When I was a teenager, 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' came to American television on PBS, and my head blew off. I loved Alec Guinness. Oh, and Buster Keaton. Oh my God, Buster Keaton!\"",
      "It's impossible not to see a hint of Buster Keaton in Pierce's famous ironing board scene from \"Frasier\":",
      "Pierce said, \"I do want people to be able to laugh.\"",
      "\"Why? What does that mean to you? Why is it important?\"",
      "\"I guess it's the perception of connection,\" he said. \"For example, doing a comic film is not nearly as enjoyable for me as doing a comic play. In a comic play, you feel from the audience the connection. That's what I'm in it for. That's where I started out. I love that.\"",
      "For almost as long as he's been in it, his partner along the way, his husband since 2008, has been actor-writer Brian Hargrove. They met at an audition, became friends, and only later discovered they were both gay. \"Brian had me over to dinner at his apartment to do my taxes,\" said Pierce.",
      "\"I used to have a tax business as well as an actor,\" said Hargrove.",
      "\"That's not a metaphor; that's actually what he was doing. Tax practitioner! And then we were going to see this movie, and it came up. We went back to his apartment, and then, as Brian puts it, I never left.\"",
      "That was in 1983. It was Hargrove who suggested moving to California, which led to Pierce being cast as Dr. Niles Crane alongside Kelsey Grammer in \"Frasier.\" Forty years, four Emmys and two Tonys later, he chose not to be in the \"Frasier\" reboot. At the time he was playing Julia Child's husband, Paul, on HBO. \"I've been very happy with what originally came to me, and then when I've been able to make choices in my career and the choices I've made,\" Pierce said. \"My creativity is fueled by change and by diversity.\"",
      "Which is why David Hyde Pierce said yes to \"Pirates\" \u2013 and a new chance to make people laugh in one of his old favorites.",

    "summary": "Some employees working on the CDC's measles response were warned they could face layoffs.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has scrapped a plan to offer help curbing measles in Texas schools after some staff working on the agency's response to this year's record outbreak of the virus were warned they could face layoffs, an agency employee said.",
      "CDC officials had initially weighed expanding a service they had been offering to hospitals in Texas \u2014 onsite assessments to root out how errors in ventilation and air filtration could be enabling spread of the virus \u2013 to other kinds of facilities like schools as well.",
      "\"Being on the ground allows us to actually look at the filters that are in place, look at the HVAC systems, how they're set up, how they're being used, how they're being monitored. And after seeing what we did, I'm glad we did,\" Dylan Neu, who had led the CDC's ventilation assessments in Texas, told CBS News.",
      "Neu is a biomedical engineer for the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, which was largely eliminated by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s first wave of layoffs earlier this month.",
      "He spoke with CBS News as a member of the labor union American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840, which represents NIOSH employees in Ohio that were impacted by Kennedy's layoffs.",
      "Two experts from NIOSH \u2014 Neu and an industrial hygienist \u2014 were first sent to Texas on March 20 at the state's request. They found a number of issues at hospitals in Texas that had been actively treating measles patients during the outbreak, Neu said.",
      "The agency's teams do careful inspections of the hospital's facilities, assessing how air is moving, he said, which can be difficult to accurately do over the phone with people unfamiliar with the technical details of how HVAC systems work.",
      "In one example, an isolation room at a hospital was found to have been pressurized wrongly, with air flowing out of the room with the measles patient, Neu said. Another hospital had skipped a key step in setting up an air filter in their waiting room: unwrapping the filter before turning it on.",
      "\"They might say in an interview, 'Yeah, we purchased HEPA filters. They've been running in the waiting room.' But if they're not actually out of the plastic bag, they're not doing what they think they're doing,\" Neu said.",
      "While Neu remains on the job for now, he received a notice on April 1 warning him to expect to be laid off by HHS in the coming weeks.",
      "\"This action is necessary to align our workforce with the agency's current and future needs and to ensure the efficient and effective operation of our programs,\" Neu's notice from the department said.",
      "Neu said he received the notice while in his hotel room in Texas, as he prepared to return from his deployment. Most of his colleagues and the leadership above him within NIOSH have either been laid off, offered reassignments to other agencies or warned to expect cuts.",
      "\"My current understanding is that I'll be working in the office until the end of this month, and then I'll be on 60 days administrative leave until June 30th, and then we'll be separated at that point,\" he said.",
      "Agency officials scrapped plans to offer future ventilation assessments to Texas, he said, because of the prospect that he might get laid off while in the field and cut off from the agency's systems.",
      "A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "While much of the work Neu's team does at NIOSH is research, he said that experts on his team have often been tapped to deploy to emergency responses as the agency's primary experts on topics like ventilation and contamination.",
      "He recounted several past deployments, ranging from helping hospitals around the country draw up plans to prepare for Ebola cases during the Obama administration, to helping the agency's quarantine station at Detroit's airport build an isolation room to screen passengers early during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We're involved in pretty much every response the CDC is involved in. Especially if there's some sort of engineering or ventilation component, NIOSH gets called in as that scientific expertise,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs have also upended other work done by NIOSH to respond to requests like health hazard evaluations, where workplaces can call on the agency for help investigating health issues on the job, like cancer clusters\u00a0or fungal outbreaks.",
      "Impact on the CDC's measles response also goes beyond NIOSH. CBS News previously reported that multiple agency staff assigned to the effort had been let go.",

    "summary": "Some states want to block SNAP recipients from using benefits to buy sugary foods as part of the \"make America healthy again\" movement.",
    "story": [
      "The federal food stamp program is facing scrutiny in some states that want to block enrollees from using their government benefits to buy soda and candy.",
      "Three Republican-led states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho and Indiana \u2014 on Tuesday moved to ban purchases of soda and candy with benefits provided by the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Those states have a combined total of roughly 1 million residents on SNAP out of the program's total 41.7 million U.S. participants.",
      "Other states are also likely to restrict SNAP recipients' food purchases, experts say. Lawmakers in states including Arizona, Kansas and Tennessee\u00a0have introduced similar measures to curtail food stamp purchases of sugary foods and drinks.",
      "The rationale for such legislation is the view that blocking low-income Americans from using food stamps on soda and candy will help improve their health. But anti-hunger advocates say that these restrictions will add to negative perceptions of receiving food aid, while also being unlikely to improve recipients' eating habits.",
      "\"It's stigmatizing to say, 'You who are low income, we don't trust you to make the right choices,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, the SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger research group.",
      "Instead, she said, these states would be better off focusing on the biggest obstacle to healthy eating: the high cost of groceries, particularly the expense of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Because SNAP provides an average individual monthly benefit of $187, or a little over $6 per day, many recipients fill up by purchasing the cheapest, most calorie-dense foods they can afford, she added.",
      "Grocery costs soared during the pandemic, surging almost 24% from 2020 to 2024 and outpacing overall inflation by almost three percentage points, according to an analysis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Food prices aren't expected to drop anytime soon, with the USDA forecasting that groceries could rise 2.7% in 2025, adding to the challenges SNAP recipients face in affording healthy food.",
      "Make America healthy again?",
      "In announcing plans to block food stamp purchases of soda and candy, Idaho Governor Brad Little on Tuesday\u00a0proclaimed that the state \"welcomes the MAHA movement,\" referring to the \"make America healthy again\" movement started by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders credited the Trump administration with placing \"a laser focus on solving America's chronic disease epidemic,\" saying that banning candy and soda from food stamp purchases is \"a great place to start.\"",
      "About 80 cents of every $1 in SNAP benefits is used to purchase staples like meat, bread, milk, cereal and rice, with the remainder going to salty snacks, candy and sweetened beverages. Households that rely on food stamps have very similar patterns of spending to households not on food stamps, according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "The Arkansas plan, which would take effect in July 2026, would exclude soda, including no- and low-calorie soda; fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice; \"unhealthy drinks;\" candy, including confections made with flour, like Kit Kat bars; and artificially sweetened candy.",
      "It also would allow participants to use benefits to buy hot rotisserie chicken, which is excluded from the program now under the SNAP program's longstanding ban on hot foods. Food stamp recipients also would be barred from using their benefits to buy nonfood items, such as soap or toothpaste, as well as alcohol or tobacco.",
      "Some industries are pushing back against the SNAP restrictions. Representatives for American Beverage accused state and federal officials of \"choosing to be the food police rather than take truly meaningful steps to lift people off SNAP with good-paying jobs.\"",
      "The National Confectioners Association called the approach \"misguided.\"",
      "\"SNAP participants and non-SNAP participants alike understand that chocolate and candy are treats \u2014 not meal replacements,\" spokesman Chris Gindlesperger said.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health\"",
      "Over the past two decades, lawmakers from both political parties have proposed halting SNAP payments for everything from soda to\u00a0 steak. To date, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the SNAP program, hasn't granted the required waivers for states to curb food stamp purchases.",
      "But the Trump administration is signaling that it will grant the waivers requested this week, with USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins saying in a Tuesday statement\u00a0that she plans to quickly approve Arkansas' request.",
      "\"I have said since my confirmation that USDA has a role to play in improving nutrition programs to better serve individuals in need of support, all while recognizing the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Rollins said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our shared goal should be to lift millions of Americans out of dependency and into hopeful futures and insert new energy and ideas into long-ignored programs like diet-related, chronic disease.\"",

    "summary": "CDC experts were not made available to discuss the findings showing a rise in autism prevalence.",
    "story": [
      "One out of 31 children \u2014 more than 3% of kids \u2014 have been identified with autism, according to the latest results published Tuesday from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that tracks trends of autism's prevalence across some communities in the U.S.",
      "\"They've again gone up dramatically, just in two years. We have in some states as low as 1 out of 20 boys having autism, 1 out of 31 kids. And when I was, in my generation today, the rate of autism was 1 in 10,000,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday in Indiana, announcing the new findings. \"And this is just one disease. This whole generation of kids is damaged by chronic disease.\"",
      "Kennedy often cites the CDC's figures from this study as evidence for his claim that the U.S. is now seeing a growing \"epidemic\"\u00a0of autism, which experts and advocacy groups have criticized as stigmatizing and misleading.",
      "\"As the report indicates, more children have access to evaluations for autism and more children are being identified as autistic. This is encouraging because when children are identified early, appropriate supports and services can be tailored to help them, and their families thrive,\" said Dr. Kristin Sohl, of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism, in a statement shared before Kennedy's remarks and the report's release.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told \"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0that the definition of what autism is has also expanded.",
      "\"It's a spectrum. It's not just one thing. ... So that's part of it,\" she said. \"We also are being much more aggressive about looking for it \u2014 pediatricians, educators.\"",
      "The definitions used in this study are also quite broad, Gounder added.",
      "\"They were looking at both health records, educational records, did a student access special ed supports, that sort of thing,\" she said. \"So part of it is the way in which we're looking for it. But there also does seem to be an underlying increase that has been occurring over time.\"",
      "For years, CDC scientists have said that the data indicating a rise in diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, could be reflecting improved screening and access to autism services in some communities. However, the agency's experts were not made available for a press briefing about the latest findings, marking a change from previous years.",
      "\"Research has not demonstrated that living in certain communities puts children at greater risk for developing ASD,\" the CDC's authors said in their report.",
      "The study's authors said estimated autism prevalence was consistently higher among Asian, Black and Hispanic children compared to White children. Factors like disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning could be contributing to this gap, the report says.",
      "Data from sites in 16 communities were collected for the new CDC report. The last report found a rate of 1 in 36 children through 2020, based on data from 11 communities.",
      "While the network's data is not nationally representative, figures from other federally-funded surveys and studies have also tracked a rise in autism's prevalence over the past two decades, accelerating in the early 2000s.",
      "\"Autistic children add value to our communities. Advocating for resources and funding to support autistic people across the lifespan is essential for a productive and healthy America,\" Sohl said in the statement.",
      "It comes as federal spending into autism research has also surged, largely going into efforts to study the biology suspected to underlie the condition. While scientists have linked up to 90% of autism to genetic traits, other factors are also suspected to play a role in changing its risk.",
      "Kennedy has said he believes \"an environmental toxin\" is causing autism, pointing to a range of potential culprits from food contaminants to vaccines.",
      "Many studies have debunked the claim that vaccines cause autism. But there is less research for some other factors that studies suggest might be linked to autism, ranging from pesticides to time between pregnancies.",
      "\"While the number of studies investigating the epidemiology of autism is increasing, most potential environmental factors have not been investigated sufficiently to draw firm conclusions,\" the federal government's autism research coordination office said in 2023.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Kennedy claimed that autism was preventable and said that it was \"unforgivable that we have not yet identified the underlying causes.\"",
      "\"We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September,\" he said. Leading autism organizations have expressed skepticism over that promise and concern that he will revive debunked theories.",
      "Finding an answer to the cause or causes of autism by September is \"not realistic,\" Gounder said.",
      "\"Some of the theories include diabetes during pregnancy that might be affecting the development of the child, air pollution, exposure to micro plastics, antibiotic use and the way that changes the microbiome and the gut,\" she said. \"There's a whole bunch of different theories. And again, because it's so many different diseases actually labeled Autism Spectrum Disorder, it's going to take a while to really tease that out.\"",
      "The CDC also released a statement noting that prevalence varied widely between different sites in the study. That variation \"could reflect differences in availability of services for early detection, evaluation, and diagnostic practices,\" Dr. Karyl Rattay, head of the CDC's Division of Human Development and Disability, said.",
      "CDC delayed report, barred agency experts from media",
      "The CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities was initially planning to release the report in March this year, multiple officials told CBS News. Its publication was pushed back by CDC officials amid a department-wide pause on communications ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Plans to make the agency's experts available to explain and interpret the results were also scrapped, said multiple CDC officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ahead of the agency's last release of autism figures in 2023, CDC scientists appeared at press briefings and interviews with media outlets about the report.",
      "That year, news outlets were also provided with embargoed copies of the report ahead of time to give journalists time to prepare their reports and interview experts. This longstanding practice has also now been abandoned agency-wide under the Trump administration, officials said, both for the autism report and many other studies published by the agency.",
      "The CDC and HHS did not respond to requests for the embargoed report, or to make any experts available for an interview.",
      "Most of the communications staff working with the center have also been laid off, officials said, as part of Kennedy's sweeping restructuring of the department this month.",
      "The branch responsible for producing the autism figures is one of the few teams remaining on the job in the CDC's birth defects and disabilities center.",
      "Officials expect it to be cleaved off from the CDC and merged into Kennedy's new Administration for a Healthy America agency.",

      "An HHS spokesperson denied to CBS News that HHS had edited Hall's answers. In a statement, another spokesperson for HHS said it was \"disappointing that this individual is fabricating false claims.\"",
      "\"NIH scientists have, and will, continue to conduct interviews regarding their research through written responses or other means. We remain committed to promoting gold-standard research and advancing public health priorities. Any attempt to paint this as censorship is a deliberate distortion of the facts,\" the statement said.",
      "In response to the department's statement, Hall asked: \"I wonder how they define censorship?\"",
      "Hall said he had also been blocked from presenting his research on ultra-processed foods at a conference and given an ultimatum to either comply with edits demanded by officials on a manuscript he had worked on with outside scientists or remove himself as a co-author.",
      "\"I was hoping this was an aberration. So, weeks ago I wrote to my agency's leadership expressing my concerns and requested time to discuss these issues, but I never received a response,\" he said in his post.",
      "Before this week, Hall had been considered as one of NIH's leading researchers on ultra-processed foods. He was among experts featured in CBS Reports' investigation on how ultra-processed foods have become so pervasive in the American diet.",
      "\"He led a seminal clinical trial demonstrating that ultra-processed foods led to calorie overconsumption,\" Susan Mayne, former head of the Food and Drug Administration's food safety and nutrition center, said in a message.",

      "\"This work is critical to understand what it is mechanistically about UPF that may be driving obesity. Few places other than NIH have metabolic wards to even do such research,\" Mayne said.",

      "\"The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, 'Too Late' Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete 'mess!'\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "He added, \"Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "A landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 1935 affirmed Congress' authority to create independent federal agencies whose boardmembers could only be forced out before their terms expired \"for cause.\"",
      "\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled\u00a0in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president, who has previously criticized his performance. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair.",
      "In a meeting Thursday with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Mr. Trump said of Powell, \"Oh, he'll leave. If I ask him to, he'll be out of there.\"",
      "Mr.\u00a0Trump nominated Powell\u00a0to lead the Fed in 2017, and Powell was re-nominated by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "Over the years, Powell has steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. In December, he said that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials.",
      "Whether the White House chooses to respect the Fed's independence remains to be seen. Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, ranging from refusing to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election to, since his return to power in January, empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the billionaire's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Research Group, notes that Mr. Trump this week fired two Democrats on the board of another financial regulator, the National Credit Union Administration. In March, the White House also dismissed two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, which historically has operated as an independent, bipartisan commission.",
      "\"The President appears to be moving closer to justifying removal of Democrats on the Federal Reserve Board.

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 18:20:33 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has suggested stripping Harvard of its tax-exempt status, a step that experts say would be unusual and face  legal challenges.",
    "story": [
      "The battle between President Trump and Harvard University has moved to a new front, with the IRS now considering whether to revoke the Ivy League school's tax-exempt status.",
      "A final decision has not yet been made by the IRS, CBS News' Aaron Navarro reports. But the effort comes after Mr. Trump on Tuesday\u00a0suggested that Harvard could lose its tax exemption. The tax agency's move to consider whether to strip Harvard of its designation as a 501(c)(3) organization was earlier reported by CNN.",
      "The IRS has awarded tax-exempt status to almost 2 million organizations, ranging from universities like Harvard to charities such as churches and foundations. The designation exempts these groups from paying federal income taxes, while donations to these groups are considered tax-deductible by the IRS.",
      "Mr. Trump's scrutiny of Harvard's tax status comes after the university on Monday rejected his administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration this week moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard.",
      "The Trump administration has also threatened to cut off federal funding at other\u00a0top universities\u00a0as it exerts pressure on the institutions' policies governing student expression on campus and academic programs.",
      "But stripping an organization of its tax-exempt status is an unusual step, especially for an institution the size and reputation of Harvard, experts said.",
      "\"It would be historically unprecedented,\" Brian Galle, professor of tax policy at Georgetown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Certainly no major research university has ever lost its tax exemption.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the issue.",
      "Why is Harvard tax exempt?",
      "Organizations that have a purpose deemed to be \"charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition and the prevention of cruelty to children or animals\" can qualify for tax-exempt status, according to the IRS.",
      "Most private and public universities and colleges have been granted tax-exempt status by the IRS because of their educational mission, which the federal government has recognized for their importance in fostering the productivity and civic contributions of American citizens, the Association of American Universities says.",
      "Can Mr. Trump order the IRS to remove Harvard's tax-exempt status?",
      "Not legally, according to Sam Brunson, a professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and an expert on federal income tax and nonprofit organizations.",
      "That's because Congress in 1998 passed a law that forbids the president from directing the IRS to audit or investigate taxpayers, he explained. If Mr. Trump instructed the IRS to remove Harvard's tax exemption, \"that runs exactly contrary to law,\" Brunson said.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said, \"Any forthcoming actions by the IRS will be conducted independently of the President, and investigations into any institution's violations of its tax status were initiated prior\" to Mr. Trump's social media post this week questioning Harvard's tax-exempt status.",
      "The IRS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Could the IRS remove Harvard's tax exemption?",
      "The IRS has legal authority to strip organizations of their tax-exempt status, and it occasionally exercises that power. But that is usually due to groups failing to meet tax requirements, like neglecting to file an annual information return for more than three consecutive years.",
      "One famous case involved a university losing its tax-exempt status, Galle and Brunson noted. In the 1970s, Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, a Christian institution, lost its tax-exempt status due to a policy that banned interracial relationships.",
      "That case ended up at the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1983 that the IRS was correct in depriving Bob Jones of the status because its rules had violated a \"fundamental national public policy\" about racial discrimination in education.",
      "The IRS could argue that Harvard is in violation of public policy either by failing to crack down on protestors rallying against Israel's actions in Gaza or by refusing to comply with the Trump administration's push against diversity, equity and inclusion policies, Brunson said. But both he and Galle expressed skepticism that such rationales would hold up in court, partly because universities have a constitutional right to freedom of speech, while also representing issues that are far different from the practices that Bob Jones engaged in.",
      "\"There isn't a society-wide agreement that allowing protests on your campus is inconsistent with fundamental public policy,\" Galle said.",
      "He added, \"Let's be clear: There is absolutely no basis for Harvard to lose its exemption. Zero.\"",
      "What happens if the IRS strips Harvard of its tax-exempt status?",
      "The IRS would first do an investigation and then inform Harvard of its reason for removing its tax-exempt status, Brunson said. Harvard could then file an appeal to the IRS. If that appeal failed, the university could then take the issue to the courts.",
      "As the case proceeded, it's likely that a court would issue an injunction or order to halt the IRS' decision, which means that Harvard would likely continue to operate as a tax-exempt institution until the case was resolved, experts said.",
      "\"Harvard isn't going to lose this \u2014 they have the money and the resources and the alumni to get the best people representing them,\" Brunson said. He predicted that Harvard would win a court case and \"set a precedent.\"",
      "How could losing tax-exempt status affect Harvard?",
      "Harvard could take a financial hit if it were to lose the tax-exempt status. But the extent of any resulting damage would be unclear given that Harvard could use tax strategies to lower its taxable income, similar to how major corporations rely on sophisticated techniques to reduce their tax liability. For instance, Harvard could lower its taxable income by deducting business costs, including its faculty salaries.",
      "By contrast, donors to Harvard could feel the impact because they wouldn't be able to deduct their contributions to the university from their own taxes. That could make it less palatable for donors to make large financial contributions.",
      "\"The biggest cost would be reduced donations,\" Brunson said. \"And the other cost is its endowment, which would no longer be tax exempt.\"",
      "Harvard's endowment stands at $52.3 billion, making it the biggest among all U.S. universities.",
      "What does Harvard say about the risk to its tax-exempt status?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Harvard reiterated that such a decision would be illegal.",
      "\"The government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission,\" a spokesperson wrote in an email. \"The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth.\"",
      "The spokesperson added, \"There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status.\"",

    "summary": "Some states want to block SNAP recipients from using benefits to buy sugary foods as part of the \"make America healthy again\" movement.",
    "story": [
      "The federal food stamp program is facing scrutiny in some states that want to block enrollees from using their government benefits to buy soda and candy.",
      "Three Republican-led states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho and Indiana \u2014 on Tuesday moved to ban purchases of soda and candy with benefits provided by the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Those states have a combined total of roughly 1 million residents on SNAP out of the program's total 41.7 million U.S. participants.",
      "Other states are also likely to restrict SNAP recipients' food purchases, experts say. Lawmakers in states including Arizona, Kansas and Tennessee\u00a0have introduced similar measures to curtail food stamp purchases of sugary foods and drinks.",
      "The rationale for such legislation is the view that blocking low-income Americans from using food stamps on soda and candy will help improve their health. But anti-hunger advocates say that these restrictions will add to negative perceptions of receiving food aid, while also being unlikely to improve recipients' eating habits.",
      "\"It's stigmatizing to say, 'You who are low income, we don't trust you to make the right choices,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, the SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger research group.",
      "Instead, she said, these states would be better off focusing on the biggest obstacle to healthy eating: the high cost of groceries, particularly the expense of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Because SNAP provides an average individual monthly benefit of $187, or a little over $6 per day, many recipients fill up by purchasing the cheapest, most calorie-dense foods they can afford, she added.",
      "Grocery costs soared during the pandemic, surging almost 24% from 2020 to 2024 and outpacing overall inflation by almost three percentage points, according to an analysis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Food prices aren't expected to drop anytime soon, with the USDA forecasting that groceries could rise 2.7% in 2025, adding to the challenges SNAP recipients face in affording healthy food.",
      "Make America healthy again?",
      "In announcing plans to block food stamp purchases of soda and candy, Idaho Governor Brad Little on Tuesday\u00a0proclaimed that the state \"welcomes the MAHA movement,\" referring to the \"make America healthy again\" movement started by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders credited the Trump administration with placing \"a laser focus on solving America's chronic disease epidemic,\" saying that banning candy and soda from food stamp purchases is \"a great place to start.\"",
      "About 80 cents of every $1 in SNAP benefits is used to purchase staples like meat, bread, milk, cereal and rice, with the remainder going to salty snacks, candy and sweetened beverages. Households that rely on food stamps have very similar patterns of spending to households not on food stamps, according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "The Arkansas plan, which would take effect in July 2026, would exclude soda, including no- and low-calorie soda; fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice; \"unhealthy drinks;\" candy, including confections made with flour, like Kit Kat bars; and artificially sweetened candy.",
      "It also would allow participants to use benefits to buy hot rotisserie chicken, which is excluded from the program now under the SNAP program's longstanding ban on hot foods. Food stamp recipients also would be barred from using their benefits to buy nonfood items, such as soap or toothpaste, as well as alcohol or tobacco.",
      "Some industries are pushing back against the SNAP restrictions. Representatives for American Beverage accused state and federal officials of \"choosing to be the food police rather than take truly meaningful steps to lift people off SNAP with good-paying jobs.\"",
      "The National Confectioners Association called the approach \"misguided.\"",
      "\"SNAP participants and non-SNAP participants alike understand that chocolate and candy are treats \u2014 not meal replacements,\" spokesman Chris Gindlesperger said.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health\"",
      "Over the past two decades, lawmakers from both political parties have proposed halting SNAP payments for everything from soda to\u00a0 steak. To date, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the SNAP program, hasn't granted the required waivers for states to curb food stamp purchases.",
      "But the Trump administration is signaling that it will grant the waivers requested this week, with USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins saying in a Tuesday statement\u00a0that she plans to quickly approve Arkansas' request.",
      "\"I have said since my confirmation that USDA has a role to play in improving nutrition programs to better serve individuals in need of support, all while recognizing the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Rollins said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our shared goal should be to lift millions of Americans out of dependency and into hopeful futures and insert new energy and ideas into long-ignored programs like diet-related, chronic disease.\"",
      "Blocking SNAP purchases of candy and soda wouldn't keep recipients from using their own money to buy such items, as food stamp benefits typically pay for roughly\u00a0two-thirds of a household's grocery costs.",
      "But advocates of banning unhealthy foods from SNAP say that taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for supporting bad eating habits.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health,\" Sanders said Tuesday at a news conference with Rollins in Little Rock, Arkansas. \"We're paying for it on the front end and the back end.\"",

    "story": [
      "As ongoing inflation continues to deplete household budgets, perhaps nowhere is the pinch felt more strongly\u00a0than in grocery aisles. However, depending on where you live, the pain can be sharper than in other areas.",
      "That's according to a new study from\u00a0SmartAsset\u00a0which reveals notable fluctuations in grocery price increases from city to city. The financial technology company used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to examine how the costs of everyday items like eggs, meat and produce have changed in 12 major metro areas over the last year.",
      "\"While prices of fruits, vegetables and dairy products either increased or decreased depending on the location, eggs, meat and poultry soared almost unanimously, reaching over 9% or higher than just a year before \u2014 tripling the general rate of inflation,\" the study found.",
      "Jaclyn DeJohn, director of economic analysis and author of the SmartAsset study, said the big takeaway is how much location can impact these day-to-day items.",
      "\"We really wanted to do was compare where people's budget is going to get hit the hardest,\" said DeJohn, who noted that the study in not a comprehensive ranking but a snapshot of location-related shifts in the cost of groceries. \"People are noticing these costs, and they're impacting their bottom line.\"",
      "Read on to see how grocery prices\u00a0fluctuated in 12 major U.S. metros.",
      "Which cities are seeing price increases?",
      "Out of the 12 cities included in SmartAsset's analysis, Honolulu, Hawaii, experienced the largest uptick with a 5.3% increase in overall grocery prices since last year. Price hikes in Tampa Bay, Florida, are the second highest at 4.3%, followed by the Twin Cities, Minnesota, at 4.2%.",
      "When it comes to fresh produce, the Twin Cities saw the biggest spike among the 12 metro areas, with the cost of fruits and vegetables rising 6.9% from 2024. In Los Angeles, egg, meat, poultry and fish prices rose the most, at 9.8%, followed by the D.C. metro area at 9.4%.",
      "By contrast, residents of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington experienced only a modest price hike of 2.1% on eggs, meat, poultry and fish.",
      "While the report doesn't specify the factors driving price changes from city to city, a combination of influences could be at play, said SmartAsset's DeJohn. \"A big factor for something like Honolulu is it's isolated from the rest of the U.S.,\" she said. \"So, that's a good illustration of how transportation costs where you're located geographically compared to where your food is sourced can impact the prices big time.\"",
      "While price fluctuations varied from city to city, prices for egg, meats, poultry and fish went up in all metro areas, which DeJohn says were behind overall grocery cost increases across all 12 metro areas. \"As we didn't see such intense price increases across any other category of grocery, it was the egg and meat prices that were really driving the increase in grocery prices across the board in these metros,\" she said.",
      "The rise in egg prices at the metro level tracks with national BLS data. Egg prices have been climbing in large part due to the bird flu outbreak which has\u00a0forced farmers to kill infected flocks to prevent the disease from spreading.",
      "Are any cities seeing lower grocery prices?",
      "Yes. Two metro areas in SmartAsset's study \u2014 Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and Boston \u2014 saw a decrease in grocery prices of 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively, from a year ago.",
      "Where are grocery prices headed?",
      "A recent analysis by the Yale Budget Lab estimates that overall food prices will rise by 2.6% in the next three years, as a result of U.S. tariffs as well as reciprocal tariffs from foreign nations in place as of April 15. Fresh produce is estimated to rise 5.4%, according to the think tank, before stabilizing at 3.6% higher.",
      "The USDA's\u00a0food price outlook, based on Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index data from this year and last, forecasts a slightly larger rise in overall food prices of 3.2%, with grocery store or supermarket food purchases, or food-at-home, increasing 2.7%.",
      "Prices for dairy products and fresh vegetables will remain mostly unchanged, according to the USDA, but unfortunately for consumers, the cost of egg prices is expected to climb. Egg prices, which have\u00a0soared over the past year, are expected to rise 57.6% in 2025, according to the report.",

      "European leaders are hoping Italy's right-wing premier\u00a0can position herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and the European Union, which Mr. Trump and his top aides have bashed as a deadbeat, if not abusive partner on defense and trade.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday that \"of course\" there will be a trade deal with the EU, amid the 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Asked if the EU is on his priority list of nations for reaching trade deals, Mr. Trump said, \"Everybody's on my priority list.\"",
      "The president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal.",
      "The hope not only in Rome, but in EU capitals across the 27-nation bloc is likely that Meloni can persuade Mr. Trump not to impose the steep tariff hikes he's threatened, which could devastate European economies. A reporter asked Meloni if she believes the U.S. is a reliable partner.",

      "After the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris last year, which both leaders attended, Mr. Trump was quoted by the New York Post as saying: \"I was with her a lot\" and \"we get along great.\"",
      "But the Italian leader will have to try to balance that budding special relationship with her mandate to protect the interests not only of her own nation's economy, but the EU's, with which Italy's financial future is inextricably linked.",
      "Europe has hope, and anxiety, over the Trump-Meloni meeting",
      "Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed strategies on how to approach her meeting with Mr. Trump during multiple phone calls ahead of the trip, according to a commission spokesperson.",
      "Von der Leyen herself has not yet been granted a meeting with Mr. Trump, despite repeated requests. Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.",
      "Meloni has gently chided the sweeping tariffs on the EU as \"wrong,\" but she's been one of the voices urging the continental bloc not to impose retaliatory measures, insisting that a calm response focused on negotiations would bring a more constructive resolution.",
      "The White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.",
      "\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"",
      "Not all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however.\u00a0 Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"",
      "In other European capitals, there was clear anxiety over the possibility that the White House could use the meeting to try to undermine EU unity.",
      "\"If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,\" the French government's Minister for Industry and Energy, Marc Ferracci, said last week, adding: \"Europe is only strong if it is united.\"",
      "The French news agency AFP said a government spokeswoman later stressed that any voices capable of encouraging dialogue between Washington and the EU were to be welcomed. That statement echoed the remarks by the EU spokesperson on Monday, who noted the close coordination between Meloni and Von der Leyen ahead of the Italian leader's trip to Washington and said the \"outreach is very welcome.\"",
      "After her brief visit to Washington the Italian leader will return home, where she's expected to meet on Friday with Vice President JD Vance during his visit to the Italian capital and the Vatican.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin have met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office since he took office for his second term, but those encounters all came prior to the massive tariffs announcement on April 2.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/googles-digital-ad-network-illegal-monopoly-federal-judge/",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The ruling involving Google's online ad technology follows a similar case last year in which Google's search engine was declared a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Google has been branded an abusive monopolist by a federal judge for the second time in less than a year, this time for illegally exploiting some of its online marketing technology to boost the profits fueling an internet empire currently worth $1.8 trillion.",
      "The ruling issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia comes on the heels of a separate decision in August that concluded Google's namesake search engine has been illegally leveraging its dominance to stifle competition and innovation.",
      "After the U.S. Justice Department targeted Google's ubiquitous search engine during President Donald Trump's first administration, the same agency went after the company's lucrative digital advertising network in 2023 during President Joe Biden's ensuing administration in an attempt to undercut the power that Google has amassed since its inception in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called remedy hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Brinkema's 115-page decision centers on the marketing machine that Google has spent the past 17 years building around its search engine and other widely used products and services, including its Chrome browser, YouTube video site and digital maps.",
      "The system was largely built around a series of acquisitions that started with Google's $3.2 billion purchase of online ad specialist DoubleClick in 2008. U.S. regulators approved the deals at the time they were made before realizing that they had given the Mountain View, California, company a platform to manipulate the prices in an ecosystem that a wide range of websites depend on for revenue and provides a vital marketing connection to consumers.",
      "The Justice Department lawyers argued that Google built and maintained dominant market positions in a technology trifecta used by website publishers to sell ad space on their webpages, as well as the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of consumers, and the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions in fractions of a second to match buyer and seller.",
      "After evaluating the evidence presented during a lengthy trial that\u00a0concluded just before Thanksgiving last year,\u00a0Brinkema reached a decision that rejected the Justice Department's assertions that Google has been mistreating advertisers while concluding the company has been abusing its power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers forced to rely on its network for revenue.",
      "\"For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.\" Brinkema wrote. \"Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anticompetitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features.\"",
      "Despite that rebuke, Brinkema also concluded that Google didn't break the law when it snapped Doubleclick nor when it followed up that deal a few years later by buying another service, Admeld.",
      "The Justice Department \"failed to show that the DoubleClick and Admeld acquisitions were anticompetitive,\" Brinkema wrote. \"Although these acquisitions helped Google gain monopoly power in two adjacent ad tech markets, they are insufficient, when viewed in isolation, to prove that Google acquired or maintained this monopoly power through exclusionary practices.\"",
      "That finding may help Google fight off any attempt to force it to sell its advertising technology to stop its monopolistic behavior.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools,\" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \"Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\"",
      "Analysts such as Brian Pitz of BMO Markets had been predicting that Google would likely lose the case, helping to brace investors for the latest setback to the company and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose shares declined 1% in afternoon trading. Alphabet's stock has plunged by 20% so far this year.",
      "As it did in the search monopoly case, Google and its corporate parent Alphabet vehemently denied the Justice Department's allegations. Their lawyers argued the government largely based its case on an antiquated concept of a market that existed a decade ago while underestimating a highly competitive market for advertising spending that includes the likes of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Comcast.",
      "The market as drawn in the Justice Department's case didn't include ads that appear on mobile apps, streaming television services, or other platforms to which internet users have increasingly migrated, prompting Google lawyer Karen Dunn to compare the government's definition a \"time capsule with a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster video card\" during her opening statement\u00a0when the trial began last September.",
      "At trial, the Justice Department's lawyers emphasized the harm to news publishers that has arisen from Google's alleged dominance of the marketplace. Witnesses from Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, and News Corp., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, testified about the difficulties they have faced and what they said was a lack of alternatives to Google's ad tech. Those companies rely on online advertising to fund their news operations and make their articles free to consumers on the internet, government lawyers have argued.",
      "Now, government is in position to try to dismantle that byzantine ad system. When the case was filed more than two years ago during the Biden administration, the Justice Department asserted Google should be forced to sell, at a minimum, its Ad Manager product, which includes the technology used by website publishers and the ad exchange.",

    "story": [
      "Shein and Temu, two popular Chinese e-commerce sites known for their low-cost items, say they will raise prices for U.S. consumers starting next week, a move that comes amid President Trump's 145% tariff on imports from China and the end of a trade loophole.",
      "The sites are popular with U.S. shoppers because of their low prices, with a focus on fast fashion. While they predominantly sell women's apparel and accessories, both also sell men's and children's clothing. Temu carries household items and small personal electronics.",
      "At Shein, women's blouses cost as little as $5, and bikinis can be found for around $10. Temu offers running sneakers for $14.",
      "Beginning April 25, though, the deals won't be as enticing for U.S. consumers. In a notice on its website, Shein told customers that \"price adjustments\" will go into effect late next week. Shein said \"recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\" have caused its own costs to rise, making the price hikes necessary.",
      "\"We're doing everything we can to keep prices low and minimize the impact on you. Our team is working hard to improve your shopping experience and stay true to our mission: making fashion accessible for everyone,\" Shein added, without indicating the size of the price hikes.",
      "Temu posted a nearly identical notice, saying that its operating expenses have risen, and that it will therefore introduce price hikes beginning next week. Until then, prices will remain unchanged, it added.",
      "The \"de minimis\" loophole",
      "The two e-commerce sites have benefitted from a tax law loophole known as the \"de minimis\" exemption, which has allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty free. Mr. Trump's recent action\u00a0to eliminate the loophole beginning May 2 throws a wrench in the companies' business models.",
      "In an April 2 executive order, the White House said that shippers in China have previously used the exemption to \"hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices.\"",
      "\"These shippers often avoid detection due to administration of the de minimis exemption,\" the executive order said.",
      "Effective May 2, such shipments will be subject to \"all applicable duties,\" the order states.",
      "The end of the \"de minimis\" loophole, as well as the Trump administration's tariffs of 145% on imports from China, have dented the business models of the two platforms.",
      "The changes come at a time when American shoppers have increasingly flocked to the low-cost retailers. The number of de minimis parcels shipped to the U.S. has surged to more than 1 billion in 2023, up from 153 million in 2015, with China accounting for the largest volume of shipments, according to a January Congressional Research Service report. That year, the average package value was $54, according to the report.",

    "summary": "Triple-digit U.S tariffs on China will \"wipe out our business completely,\" one small business owner says.",
    "story": [
      "Small business owners worry that mounting economic uncertainty, driven largely by President Trump's\u00a0shifting tariff policies, could shut their doors for good.",
      "Beth Benike, cofounder of Busy Baby, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lack of clarity on the direction of U.S. tariffs poses serious problems for the Oronoco, Minnesota-based retailer.",
      "\"I am a problem solver. When a decision or policy comes out, I'll find a solution. I will work with it or around it,\" said Benike, whose company makes nonslip placemats and other products for babies. \"The next day, the policy changes and that plan doesn't make sense anymore, so I come up with something else.\"",
      "Smaller enterprises that rely on imported goods and packaging from China, which now faces U.S. tariffs of as high as 145%, are among the most concerned about Mr. Trump's trade policies. But a prolonged period of economic uncertainty alone can prove fatal, obscuring future borrowing costs, dampening consumer spending, and otherwise hindering the strategic planning and managerial decision-making involved in running a small business.",
      "Trump administration officials have staunchly defended their economic policies.",
      "\"Just as it did during President Trump's first term, the administration's America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts and the unleashing of American energy will restore American Greatness from Main Street to Wall Street,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Recently, however, tremors in the economy intensified by Mr. Trump's tariffs have eroded the optimism of small businesses, according to a closely watched confidence\u00a0gauge.",
      "\"The implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months,\" William Dunkelberg, chief economist of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, said in a statement.",
      "The decline in optimism comes as Mr. Trump's economic agenda roils financial markets and raises concerns about slowing U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Consumers are concerned about the inflationary effects of the tariffs hikes. They understand if\u00a0prices rise, their real spending power will go down,\" Steven J. Davis, a Stanford University economist who co-developed an economic policy uncertainty\u00a0index, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Also, some of them also feel that maybe their jobs are at risk, so for both reasons many consumers will cut back on discretionary spending.\"",
      "The cost of unpredictability",
      "To be sure, even in the best of times business owners can be caught flat-footed by abrupt changes in the competitive landscape. But risks surge when the economic climate become unpredictable.",
      "\"Uncertainty is the enemy of entrepreneurship,\" Neri Karra Sillaman, an entrepreneurship expert at Oxford University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When the rules of the game are constantly shifting \u2014 one day you have a pause on tariffs, another day you don't have tariffs, if there are interest rate changes or political and economic instability \u2014 businesses cannot then confidently invest in growth.\"",
      "Smaller businesses, which typically have less of a financial cushion than larger enterprises, tend to struggle more in such an environment, she added.",
      "Davis, whose own\u00a0index\u00a0shows a spike in uncertainty in recent months, said trade policy unknowns are \"the big source of uncertainty right now inhibiting business investment and hiring.\"",
      "\"When you have tariffs, they tend to introduce cost unpredictability, which makes it very hard to predict and forecast margins accurately, especially in a product-based business,\" Karra added.",
      "Busy Baby's Benike said the sudden swerves in U.S. trade policy have made planning all but impossible.",
      "\"If I invest time, energy and money and the policy changes again in a way that makes the decision a poor one, I am already invested, the wheels are in motion and I'd be screwed,\" she said.",
      "\"I can't make a decision, so the best thing I can do is get the inventory I've paid for here and ready to sell,\" she added, referring to her latest factory order, now sitting in a Chinese warehouse.",
      "Meanwhile, the new 125% U.S. baseline tariff on Chinese imports means that Benike would owe $229,000 in duties on products worth roughly $158,000. She has launched a fundraising campaign to help cover the tariff costs.",
      "Her plan B, should the steep levies remain in place, is to continue manufacturing her products in China and to sell them to markets outside the U.S.",
      "\"There are babies everywhere. If I can't sell in America, there are other countries that are interested,\" she said.",
      "Business on the brink",
      "Kristin Bear, founder of Kilo Brava, an online lingerie and sleepwear company that sells both directly to consumers as well as to major retailers including Macy's, Nordstrom and Anthropologie, said the sky-high U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports \"wipe out our business completely\" if they stay in place.",
      "\"We have not imported anything yet with the 145% tariffs in place, but it really puts our business in complete jeopardy,\" she said.",
      "Another challenge is that U.S. factories aren't equipped to manufacture the types of garments she designs, Bear said. And because orders for garments intended for sale this fall must be placed with factories by May, it's too late to explore manufacturing options in other countries.",
      "Said Bear, noting that she can't afford to lose a whole season's worth of orders, equivalent to roughly $500,000 in sales: \"If tariffs are still in place when it's time to import them, we'll just have to abandon the goods and close the company.\"",

      "In written remarks\u00a0at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell reiterated that the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Even so, Powell said the Federal Reserve can stay patient and wait to see how tariffs and other economic policies of the Trump administration play out before making any changes to interest rates. The sharp volatility in financial markets since Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2, only to put most of them on hold a week later, has led to speculation about whether the Fed would soon cut its key interest rate or take other steps to calm investors.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity\" on the impact of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation, and tariffs, Powell said.",
      "Powell said the inflation will likely be temporary, but \"could also be more persistent,\" echoing a concern expressed by a majority of the Fed's 19-member interest rate-setting committee in the minutes of their meeting last month.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have led economists to lower their expectations for U.S. economic growth and forecast higher inflation this year. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers like Walmart, they typically pass on the added costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"Tariffs likely lead to higher prices while softening consumer sentiment and business optimism possibly means slower growth,\" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, in an email. \"This is going to make economic forecasting more difficult, and the Fed is likely going to widen their bands growth and rates with risks to both price stability and full employment rising.\"",
      "Yet some splits among the Fed's interest rate-setting committee have emerged. On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he expects the impact of even a large increase in tariffs to be temporary, even if they are left in place for several years. At the same time, he also expects such large duties would weigh on the economy and even threaten a recession.",
      "Should the economy slow sharply, even if inflation remained elevated, Waller said he would support cutting interest rates \"sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.\"",
      "But other Fed officials, including Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed's Minneapolis branch, have said they are more focused on fighting the effects of higher tariffs on inflation, suggesting they are less likely to support rate cuts anytime soon.",

      "\"I would love to make them here, but the U.S. simply doesn't have the infrastructure or the supply chain to do it,\" Ley told CBS News.",

      "\"We don't have the same options as large businesses,\" Ley said. \"We don't have the same capital or ability to pivot.\"",
      "After President Trump raised tariffs on China this month,\u00a0eventually totaling 145%, Ley, with the help of the nonpartisan, conservative-funded New Civil Liberties Alliance, filed a federal lawsuit against the president, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and acting U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Pete Flores, alleging illegal use of emergency powers illegally to enact the fees.",
      "Ley said that because Congressional approval was bypassed to impose the tariffs, she and other voters didn't have their positions represented.",
      "\"Had (Congress) had a chance to debate, discuss, vote, be involved,\u00a0I would've then had the opportunity to make my voice heard,\" she explained. \"And same for other Americans who were gonna be impacted by the tariffs. That didn't happen.\"",

      "But according to Ley, \"We can't survive the short-term pain, and especially without any sort of plan in place to create the infrastructure here...It would take years and millions and millions of dollars to build such a thing that's been built overseas over decades.\"",
      "Ley said Simplified has paid nearly $1.2 million in tariffs since Mr. Trump's first term, and is facing between $830,000 and $1 million in payments this year alone under the administration's new tariffs.",
      "While the White House is\u00a0offering exemptions\u00a0to multibillion-dollar Chinese industries that produce smartphones and other electronics, Ley says that to just cover the cost of tariffs at 145%, she would have to raise prices on her $64 signature planner to $82. To maintain a profit on her planners, Ley would have to double the sticker price to about $120.",
      "\"I'm not paying $120 for a planner,\" Ley said.",
      "Ley employs eight other women, and disclosed that she is being forced to consider reducing salaries and possibly eliminating positions, something she says she really doesn't want to do.",
      "She says it comes down to keeping prices manageable for customers while balancing the new tariff burden on her bottom line.",
      "Ley said that China's unique manufacturing infrastructure isn't currently available in the U.S. or other countries internationally. Different elements of her planners are made in several different factories in the Shenzhen region. Because they are located close to one another, the final product is higher quality and more affordable.",
      "In response to Ley's lawsuit, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, told CBS News in a statement that the president \"has broad authority to impose tariffs to address issues of national emergency, such as the opioid pandemic. The Trump Administration looks forward to victory in court.\"",

    "story": [
      "Reaching the six-figure salary threshold may be considered a financial victory for many Americans, but in a many big U.S. cities the once aspirational milestone just doesn't cut it anymore.",
      "In one out of four large metro areas in the United States, a family of three with a household income of $100,000 will still struggle to get by, a LendingTree\u00a0analysis\u00a0reveals. That's a stark realization for many Americans, who continue to face\u00a0rising household expenses\u00a0on everything from\u00a0a dozen eggs to a bag of coffee. The average median household income in then U.S. was $80,610 in 2023,\u00a0according\u00a0to the most recent estimate from the Census Bureau.",
      "\"For generations of Americans, $100,000 has long been a magic number. It has been seen as a level of yearly earnings that says: You've made it. You're successful,\" according to the report. \"However, that has changed dramatically in many of the nation's biggest metros. In 25 of the 100 largest metros in this country, a six-figure household income isn't enough to handle the basics.\"",
      "In determining the metro areas where a $100,000 salary wouldn't stretch far enough, LendingTree considered eight different spending categories a typical family of three might face \u2014 such as two-bedroom apartment and infant daycare \u2014 and then subtracted the total cost from the $8,333 in monthly income the family would be earning on a salary of $100,000. That left a slew of large metro areas, from Los Angeles to New York, with negative monthly income estimates.",
      "In 25 of the 100 largest U.S. cities LendingTree looked at for its report, researchers found that monthly expenditures \u2013 which ranged from food to childcare and health insurance costs \u2013 outweighed net monthly income. The analysis didn't factor in debt payments.",
      "\"It's a rough time out there. The fact that you can make six figures in many, many cities across this country and still be broke, even before you factor in debt payments, is scary,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree and author of the study. \"That's the reality for many families today, though, and unfortunately, there's not much reason to think things are going to improve anytime soon. That means that families are going to be forced to make some tough decisions and real sacrifices to get by.\"",
      "The study comes at a time when consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest levels since the pandemic, as Americans weather a period of economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's tariff rollout. Americans expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4%, up from 4.1% last month.",
      "Read on to see how your city ranked.",
      "Where is it hardest to get by on $100,000?",
      "In San Jose, the heart of California's pricey Silicon Valley, a family of three with household income of $100,000 a year would find themselves more than $2,000 short every month after covering basic expenses. Researchers say this is attributable to disproportionately high housing and transportation costs. Trailing San Jose are San Francisco and Boston which are the second and third hardest places, respectively, to get by on a $100,000 annual salary.",
      "Notably, the lion's share of locations where family breadwinners making $100,000 might still end up broke were cities on the West or East Coasts. California metro hubs figured prominently on the list, with all 10 of the state's largest cities among the top 25.\u00a0Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York also had multiple metro areas included on the list.",
      "Which cities were the most affordable for a family making $100,000?",
      "In 1 in 3 cities, however, a $100,000 salary \"is still magical,\" even for a family of three. Earners in these areas could still pocket $1,000 or more each month after paying basic expenses, LendingTree found.",
      "McAllen, Texas, located on the U.S. - Mexico border, came in at the top for places where a $100,000 salary will give you the biggest bang for your buck. Residents there would have $1,770 left over after subtracting money for their monthly expenditures. Close behind McAllen are Little Rock, Arkansas and El Paso, Texas, according to the report.",
      "For those facing stubborn costs of living, LendingTree says there are still ways to\u00a0mitigate the impact\u00a0whether it's by staying in your rental longer or reducing the interest rate you're paying.",

    "summary": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in federal court for a second day in a landmark federal antitrust trial accusing Meta of being a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sparred Tuesday with a Federal Trade Commission attorney over the meaning of emails the Facebook founder wrote about why he wanted to acquire Instagram, as a historic antitrust trial alleging Meta illegally monopolized the social media market went into its second day.",
      "Zuckerberg returned to the witness stand on Tuesday to defend Meta's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp, in a trial that could force Meta to divest the two apps, startups the tech giant bought more than a decade ago which have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, who is leading the FTC's case against Meta, contends that Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he saw it as a threat to his company, not because he thought he could make it thrive.",
      "While questioning Zuckerberg on Tuesday morning, Matheson noted that the CEO had referred to Instagram as being a \"rapidly growing, threatening, network.\"",
      "But Zuckerberg, who is the first witness called in the trial, said while Matheson was able to show documents in court that indicated his concern about Instagram's growth, he also had many conversations about how excited his company was to acquire Instagram to make a better product.",
      "Zuckerberg pushed back against Matheson's contention that the reason for buying the company was to neutralize a threat.",
      "\"I think that that mischaracterizes what the email was,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "In his questioning of Zuckerberg, Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company.",
      "Matheson also brought up a February 2012 message in which Zuckerberg wrote to the former chief financial officer of Facebook that Instagram and Path, a social networking app, already had created meaningful networks that could be \"very disruptive to us.\"",
      "Zuckerberg testified that the message was written in the context of a broad discussion about whether they should buy companies to accelerate their own developments.",
      "The CEO was also questioned about why he bought Instagram and WhatsApp instead of building new apps.",
      "\"I'm sure we could have built an app, whether it would have succeeded or not, I think is a matter of speculation\u2026\u00a0 building a new app is hard, and many more times than not, when we've tried to build a new app, it hasn't gotten a lot of traction,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "Zuckerberg also repeatedly disputed the government's claim that acquiring Instagram was bad for competition and for consumers.",
      "\"What I was focused on is the software infrastructure of different services that they (Instagram) can plug into. I think the explicit strategy for the Instagram integration was that we wanted to let Kevin and Mike, the founders basically tell us what services they needed from Meta in order to help improve the quality of growing Instagram faster,\" he said.",
      "The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump's FTC's ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "Narrow market definition",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.",
      "However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC's lawsuit \"defies reality.\"",
      "\"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" the company said in a statement.",

    "summary": "Filing a tax extension is easy. But it's important to know what you're getting into, including what to do if you owe money to the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "If you're still scrambling to get your taxes filed before the April 15 deadline, an extension can take the pressure off.",
      "Normally, the IRS recommends\u00a0that people file their income tax return as early as possible. But that's not always feasible, whether because of personal circumstances or a complicated tax situation. For those in a bind, a\u00a0tax extension\u00a0gives people an additional six months to file their federal return. The quick and free process gives Americans plenty of extra time to assemble their forms, work through complex tax situations and submit everything to the government without penalty.",
      "As of April 4, roughly 100 million people had already filed their taxes, according\u00a0to the IRS. The tax agency said\u00a0in January that it is expecting more than 140 million individual tax returns to be filed before the April 15 deadline, meaning there are likely millions of outstanding 1040s yet to be filed.",
      "Taxpayers in these states have beyond April 15 to file their taxes, IRS says. Here's where.Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",

      "Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",
      "Taxes are typically a major source of stress for Americans. In an April TaxAct survey, a quarter of respondents said one of their top concerns was filing their taxes incorrectly. Those polled also expressed uncertainty around what to expect when filing, with one-quarter of respondents saying they worried about having to pay more taxes than they'd expected.",
      "If you're planning to file a tax extension this year, here are some things to keep in mind.",
      "What is the 2025 filing deadline?",
      "The deadline to file your taxes this year is Tuesday, April 15, by 11:59 p.m. in your local time zone. However, there are exceptions.",
      "U.S. citizens, resident aliens and members of the military on duty who live outside of the U.S. are granted an automatic extension of two months. Military servicemembers serving in combat zones are given 180 days after they leave the area to file and pay their tax returns.",
      "This year, the IRS also extended the deadline for 13 states due to natural disasters in those areas. All taxpayers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and certain locations in Alaska, New Mexico, and Virginia have until May 1 to file their returns. Taxpayers in California's Los Angeles County have until October 15. And people in Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as in certain counties in West Virginia, have until November 3 to file.",
      "How do I file a tax extension online?",
      "The IRS offers a few different ways for people to extend their tax deadline to October 15. The online payment system, which allows you to pay the IRS directly from your bank account, debit card, credit card or digital wallet, has a box you can check if you need to file for an extension.",
      "Taxpayers can also electronically request an automatic tax-filing extension while using IRS File Free, which guides taxpayers through their federal income returns using tax preparation software.",
      "Another option is to file a Form 4868, which is the Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. It asks for basic information including your name, address and Social Security number. You can file a Form 4868 electronically by using IRS e-file or mailing the form to the IRS.",
      "If I get an extension, does that mean I have more time to pay the IRS?",
      "Even if you get an extension, you are still required to pay the IRS by the regular deadline if you owe money. As the IRS says, \"an extension gives extra time to file, but it does not give taxpayers extra time to pay if they owe.\" If taxpayers want to avoid financial penalties, it's best to estimate the amount you owe and pay it by the regular deadline, which is 11:59 p.m, Tuesday, April 15.",
      "Is there a penalty for filing taxes late?",
      "Yes. The IRS charges individuals and businesses a fine if they fail to file their return by the deadline or by their extension date. The \"failure to file penalty\" is 5% of the tax due for each month the return is late and is capped at 25%.",
      "What happens if I file but don't pay?",
      "The IRS levies a fine based on the amount of taxes you didn't pay. The \"failure to pay penalty\" is 0.5% of the unpaid taxes for each month, with a cap of 25% of the unpaid taxes. You would be subject to the penalty if you file your taxes on time but don't pay by the April 15 deadline.",
      "Tax filers can avoid the \"failure to file\" and \"failure to pay\" charges if they can prove that they missed the payment due to a\u00a0reasonable cause. \"Reasonable cause is determined on a case by case basis considering all the facts and circumstances of your situation,\" the IRS says.",
      "What if I can't afford to pay the IRS?",
      "The IRS offers both a short-term and long-term payment plan for taxpayers struggling to pay what they owe to the IRS. Those interested in applying can do so on the IRS website.",

      "After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. His\u00a0testimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012.",
      "Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop.",
      "Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app.",
      "According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads.",
      "In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",
      "\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"",
      "\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",
      "\"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The FTC did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "When did this case get started?",
      "The history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020 during President Trump's first term in office.",
      "In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly.",
      "But the federal judge later cleared the path for the case to proceed after the FTC introduced more evidence in an amended complaint, according to The Washington Post.",

      "WEIJIA JIANG: Russia and Ukraine exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war yesterday, the largest such swap since Russia launched its invasion more than three years ago. But despite hopes that a brief Easter truce might open the door to lasting peace, both Kyiv and Moscow are accusing each other of breaking the ceasefire. Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick is just back from a trip to Ukraine's front line, and he joins us this morning from Langhorne, Pennsylvania. Congressman, thank you for being here.",
      "REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Good morning, Weijia. Happy Easter.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Happy Easter to you too. So just hours ago, you landed from that visit to Ukraine, and you had a chance to sit down with President Zelenskyy. Did you talk about the status of the peace agreement that the US is trying to broker?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: We sure did. We spent a lot of time with them, one-on-one. President Zelenskyy and I have spoken many times. I consider him a friend now and a great leader. And yes, we talked at length about a whole host of topics. We didn't leave really anything out of the discussion. And obviously, that day, he was signing a Memorandum of Understanding on a minerals agreement, which they've gone back and forth on. You know, he and I had talks about the security guarantees. That's obviously a big concern of his. He is rightfully concerned. The history is with the Budapest Memorandum. When Ukraine was the third largest possessor nuclear weapons, they gave them up voluntarily, based on a memorandum- also a memorandum in 1994 that said that they would get security guarantees for- in exchange for giving up the nuclear arsenal. As it turns out, that that promise was not kept by none other than Russia, right? Go figure. So he has justifiable concerns, but we talked through that because we do want this economic partnership to be the precursor to security guarantees.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And just a quick follow on that Congressman the President indicated in the Oval Office on Thursday that that deal would be signed next week. Do you know if that's true?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, that remains to be seen, and it depends on what's in the deal. So what President Zelensky made clear to me, as he has many times, is, you know, certain agreements can be signed by his finance minister and Secretary Bessent, but if it's worded differently, if there are specific numbers, for example, that's something that needs to go through his parliament and potentially our Congress, if it's fashion in terms of a treaty. So a lot of it's going to depend on the details and what is actually in it, in terms of what's required for approval.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG : Okay. So we'll wait- wait to see that. You just talked about all the frustration that Zelenskyy continues to express, and he did so with regard to this Easter ceasefire. If these two countries can't even get through a holiday ceasefire, how realistic is a 30-day-pause, not to mention the end of a war anytime soon?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: That is entirely up to Vladimir Putin. The man has never kept his word, ever in any context, as far as I'm aware. So we have to know what we're dealing with our government, I hope knows who they're dealing with, with Vladimir Putin. He's not a man of his word. He's not interested in peace. I hope he gets there. He is not all that different, Weijia, from the schoolyard bully. If you look at Russia, right? Obviously, it's huge geographically, but a population of about 150 million people, about half the size of the United States, 1/5 the size of Europe, a total GDP of $2 trillion. That's the GDP of the state of Texas. So they are large, but they're weak, and they're proving that weakness by the fact that they can't even successfully prosecute a war against a much weaker neighbor. So we got to stop, you know, being fearful or bowing down to Russia. We need to stand up to Russia. We need to defend Ukraine, support Ukraine, and if it's done the right way, this will end positively. It's all about peace through strength. There's peace through strength and there's war through weakness. There's no magical third option.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, President Trump and Secretary of State Rubio have said that the US has to figure out if a deal is doable in a matter of days, or just move on. And on Friday, I asked President Trump about this fresh sense of urgency. Here's what he said.",
      "[START SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: What do you need to see from both sides in order to keep negotiations going? What do you want to see from Russia and Ukraine?",
      "DONALD TRUMP: I have to see- my whole life has been one big negotiation, and I know when people are playing us, and I know when they're not. And I have to see an enthusiasm to want to end it.",
      "[END SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: How much of this demand, Congressman for enthusiasm, do you think it's a direct message to Russia, and how much time do these two sides have to get something done?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, I hope it's directed to Russia. I think it is directed to Russia. I can tell you, President Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian people. I know them well, Weijia. I have lived there as an FBI agent. I was assigned there as a- working Russian counterintelligence. They want peace. They're a peaceful nation. There are democratically elected- elected officials, including President Zelenskyy. They want peace. They did not ask for this invasion. They did not provoke this invasion. They were invaded by Vladimir Putin, who had been telegraphing this punch for years. We all knew what he was intending to do, and now he's doing it. He views the fall of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical disaster of our lifetimes, and he's trying to reconstitute it. Step one is Ukraine. We cannot allow him to do that, and what we also can't allow is for the precedent being set here that dictators are going to be rewarded for violating the territorial borders and territorial sovereignty of their neighbors. We cannot reward that. So, you know, I- I want to say this too. I think Secretary Rubio is doing a great job. He's a smart man. He understands Putin, he understands the dynamic of the- of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the history there, and I have full faith in his ability to barter a just and fair agreement. But it's important to remember, and this applies to all agreements where we facilitate as a nation, that it's ultimately up to the nations to accept and abide by those conditions. President Zelensky, the Ukrainian people desperately want peace. They've always wanted peace. They were a peaceful nation before Russia wrongfully invaded them, and they want to get it back, but it's got to be a just and lasting peace.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And very quickly, Congressman, because we have to let you go soon. But if these talks fail, the President was ambiguous about whether the Administration would continue to support Ukraine, and Speaker Johnson has earlier said that there was no appetite for additional aid. So will there be a new bill on the House floor, quickly?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I don't want to get ahead of the administration or the Speaker, but I will just leave it at this. I will do everything in my power to make sure that Ukraine wins this fight and that Russia loses, and that we have a peaceful settlement. If you look at every time the Ukraine support has been put on the House floor, overwhelming support.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Sunday that El Salvador \"tried really hard\" to prevent him from seeing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, before the government reversed course late last week.",
      "\"I think they realized that that was not a good look at the end of the day,\" Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia is a 29-year-old Salvadoran national who lived in Maryland who was sent last month to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison as part of a White House effort, although the administration later admitted in court that Abrego Garcia was mistakenly among those deported. The case has come to the fore in recent weeks amid simmering tensions between the federal judiciary and the Trump administration's sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week, where he met with Abrego Garcia on Thursday after he said his attempts were repeatedly turned down by the Salvadoran government.",
      "Van Hollen noted that he held press conferences in El Salvador, where he made the point that the government was \"violating international law by not allowing anyone to reach him,\" adding that \"they realized that was a bad look.\"",
      "After Van Hollen was allowed to meet with Abrego Garcia, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele was the first to announce the meeting, writing in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was \"now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador,\" alongside photos that showed the two men sitting at a table with drinks that resemble margaritas. The president later wrote, \"I love chess.\"",
      "Van Hollen said of the Salvadoran government, \"they go to great lengths to deceive people,\" outlining how drinks were brought to the table as photos were taken during his meeting with Abrego Garcia, adding that \"no one touched them.\"",
      "\"The reality is, if you look at the photos when I first sat down and the ones at the end, you can see that that was all staged,\" Van Hollen said. \"They're trying to create the impression that, you know, this is a guy in paradise, when in fact he's been in one of the most notorious prisons in the world.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011 and was arrested in 2019. When he was released from immigration custody, an immigration judge granted him withholding of removal \u2014\u00a0 a legal status that forbids the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "Van Hollen said Sunday that Abrego Garcia has since been transferred from CECOT to a facility in Santa Ana. Trump administration officials have since acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "Still, a fierce legal battle has ensued around efforts to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. The administration was ordered earlier this month to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador, before the Supreme Court ruled that the judge's decision properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release, while the scope should be clarified. On Thursday, a federal appeals court rejected a request from the Trump administration to pause the district judge's order, writing that the government's assertions in the case should be \"shocking\" to all Americans.",
      "Meanwhile, the White House and Bukele have made clear that they don't intend to bring Abrego Garcia back, despite the orders, while Trump administration officials have repeatedly claimed that he is a member of the gang MS-13. Van Hollen stressed that the administration hasn't presented evidence to link Abrego Garcia to MS-13 or other terrorist activity, while urging officials to \"put up or shut up in court.\"",
      "\"Go to court, stop tweeting, and put up or shut up in front of the judges,\" Van Hollen added.",
      "The Maryland Democrat said he did not travel to El Salvador to litigate the details of Abrego Garcia's case, but rather \"to make sure that he was still alive and check on his health.\" But he argued that the case is also much bigger than one man.",
      "\"This is not a case about just one man whose constitutional rights are being ignored and disrespected, because when you trample on the constitutional rights of one man \u2014 as the courts have all said is happening in this case \u2014 you threaten the constitutional rights of every American,\" Van Hollen said.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Austan Goolsbee, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank president, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 20, 2025.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: We turn now to the economy and the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, Austan Goolsbee, he joins us this morning from Chicago. Austan, it's great to see you this morning.",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Yeah. Thank you for having me, Weijia.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I want to talk about President Trump's tariffs plan, because last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said tariff increases were higher than expected, and the economic effects will be too, including higher inflation and slower growth. Do you agree with that assessment?",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Well, look, I'm out here. The Chicago Fed district is kind of the heart of the Midwest, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan. Folks, when I'm out talking to them, business people and civic leaders have been saying for months that they had anxiety that if the tariffs were going to be as big as- as what- what they were saying they might be in February, March, that that would have a pretty significant impact on their operations. The tariff announcement, April 2, was definitely bigger than- than what- what they had been expressing, but there's just a lot of question marks. We don't know 90 days from now, when, when they've revisited the tariffs, we just don't know how big they're going to be.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Yeah, and the administration says they have a lot of deals in the works, so we have to wait to see what those look like. Trump's former top economic adviser Gary Cohn, was on CNBC talking about what he is hearing from business executives about how they are impacting consumers right now. I want to play that- some of that for you.",
      "(BEGIN SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "GARY COHN: What everyone's worried about is June, July and August. Are we just pulling all this demand forward from the summer? Because people that were going to buy stuff naturally through the next six months are saying, Look, I'm going to save the tariff. I'm going to buy it now.",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: So, he's talking about people trying to get ahead of the tariffs in case no deals are reached in case those high numbers do get put into effect. So I wonder if you're hearing the same from your contacts in Chicago that people are trying to rush out there to buy, and how does that impact your outlook for the economy?",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Yeah, that kind of preemptive purchasing is probably even more pronounced on the business side, where in anticipation, a lot of the imports that the tariffs would apply to, especially in the auto sector, are things that are parts, components, supplies that go into the manufacturing of other products. So we heard a lot about preemptive building up of inventories that could last 60 days, 90 days, if there were going to be more uncertainty. That raises the possibility that that Gary Cohn raised there, that activity might look artificially high in the initial and then by the summer, might fall off, because people had bought it all and brought it forward. I'm still hopeful, and the people that I talked to out in the Midwest are still hopeful that on the back end of this, it would be more like what Secretary Besent said, that this could be a spark to lead to a new he called it golden age of global trade. If we can get through this, it's important to remember the hard data coming into April was pretty good, the unemployment rate around steady, full employment, inflation coming down. It's just a desire of people expressing they don't want to go back to kind of 21 and 22 at a time when inflation was- was really raging out of control.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Got it. I do want to go back to Jay Powell's remarks about the impact of tariffs, or potential impact, because they prompted President Trump to lash out by declaring \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\" Here's what the President said when reporters pressed if he has the power to remove Powell.",
      "(BEGIN SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "DONALD TRUMP: I'm not happy with him. I let him know it, and if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me.",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Now, Austan, I know the Fed does not wade into politics, and I'm not going to ask you to do that, but I wonder if statements like this undermine or complicate your job as an apolitical institution?",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Look, I'm glad you didn't ask me for legal advice, because I have an econ PhD. Don't ever ask legal advice from somebody like me. I would say, monetary independence- before I was ever at the Fed, I was a research economist at the University of Chicago. There's virtual unanimity among economists that monetary independence from political interference, that the Fed or any central bank be able to do the job that it needs to do, is really important. And they came to that not as a theory, but just by looking around the world at places where they don't have monetary independence. And the fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse. So we really- I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that- that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: All right, Austan, thank you so much for your time, and Happy Easter to you.",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Yeah, happy Easter. Great to see you, Weijia.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 20, 2025.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: We go now to Massachusetts, Democratic governor Maura Healey, who joins us this morning from just outside of Boston. Governor Healy, good morning to you.",
      "GOV. MAURA HEALEY: Good morning Weijia. Happy Easter to you and to all out there listening.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Happy Easter to you as well. I want to start with Harvard University, which is, of course, in your state and your alma mater. Last week, the Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in multi-year grants, $60 million in multi-year contracts to Harvard, and that's after the university rejected some of the administration's demands in order to keep that money flowing. We saw the impact was swift, everything from research to staffing. And I wonder, is the university going to be able to withstand this funding freeze?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Well, here's what's- here's what's happening on the ground as a result of those actions. And really, let's go back six weeks when the first cuts were announced for NIH funding. Massachusetts, we've got a number of colleges and universities, research institutions. These are entities that actually have pioneered for decades. Cures to diseases, cancer, working right now on treatments for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and so much more. In addition, they've often been the ones that have been leading the research when it comes to our defense industry. I could go through the various sectors, but basically what Donald Trump is doing by cutting off this funding, a few things are happening. Research labs are shutting down, scientists and researchers are leading the United States and going to other countries to do their work. And essentially, Donald Trump is giving away intellectual assets. The other thing that's happening real time right now, and it's incredibly sad, Weijia, I was in a hospital here just the other week, and this is a Hospital Boston Children's, where some of the sickest kids in the country go for care. And there have been cuts to Boston Children's and other hospitals as a result of Donald Trump's actions, because these are part of a teaching hospital system. These cuts to universities have significant ripple effects, because they result in people being laid off, scientists being laid off, doctors being laid off, clinical trials for things like cancer treatments have been shut down, and this is really bad. It's bad for patients, it's bad for science, and it's really bad for American competitiveness. As Governor, I want Massachusetts soaring. I want America soaring. And what Donald Trump is doing is basically saying to China and other company- other countries, come to the United States, take- take our scientists, take our researchers and that, and that's what's happening, and it's really it's terrible, on top of what he's done to the economy, and in just dismantling and wrecking the economy right now, I'm working hard every day to lower costs in my state, cut taxes, build more housing, and Donald Trump is just making life more expensive for all of us, making life harder for all of us, and by coming after colleges and universities Weijia, this is really going to have an impact on American competitiveness. There's a reason this country has led the world, remember, and it's because we've invested in science and innovation for decades.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Has Harvard asked your state for any support?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: There is no way a state can begin to make up for the cuts to federal funding, the cuts that Donald Trump has made to education, to health care, food for kids, heating assistance for seniors. He just cut off FEMA disaster relief for our states the other day, and as governor, I'm going to do everything I can to protect my residents, to protect our state, to protect our economy, but he makes it really difficult. I'll give you an example, Weijia. I filed and signed the largest housing bill in history. I want to build more housing so that we can drive down costs. Donald Trump comes in with tariffs. Where do we get our lumber from? Canada. Where do we get other building materials from? Mexico. He's just made everything more expensive and more difficult, and states will do the best they can. Governors like myself will do the best that we can, but there's no way that states can begin to make up for, or course correct these failings by the President of the United States and his administration when it comes to managing the economy.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: President Trump is also calling for Harvard to lose its tax-exempt status, and CBS News has confirmed that the IRS is considering at least rescinding it. Are you aware of any evidence that the university has done anything to merit that?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Absolutely not. It's outrageous, but it's part of this continued playbook that Donald Trump has been using, which is to silence critics, right? First, he went after the law firms. Then he went after companies. Then he went after everyday Americans. Now he's going after colleges and universities, using any and all tactics to try to shut them down, to silence them. That's what Donald Trump is about. There's no merit to any of this. And of course, it's illegal. You can't do that as President of the United States, and that will get tested in court. Of course, Donald Trump, right now is ignoring court orders, which is another issue, but there's absolutely no basis. And you know what he is saying in doing that is he's saying to every not for profit out there, not just colleges and universities, but think of all the organizations out there that are nonprofits in your community, right? Supporting your little league, supporting seniors, any number of organizations, tens of thousands across the United States, Donald Trump is saying, I can take that away from you right now, because I'm President and I have that power. He does not have that power. And there is no- not only is there no legal basis for what he is trying to do it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And Governor, I want to ask you about a Tufts student, Rumeysa Ozturk, who was detained in your state by plainclothes officers late last month. Right now, she's being held at a detention facility in Louisiana and has not been charged with any crimes. Late on Friday, a judge ordered ICE to move her to Vermont by May 1, so she can attend the district court proceedings over her detention. Have you talked to her family or lawyers, and is there anything your state can do to support her right now?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Well, this is a very troubling matter, because this woman is a Fulbright Scholar. She's getting her PhD in child development. She has no criminal record or history. It appears she was one of many signers of an op-ed in a college newspaper. The courts are already involved here, but it's very concerning. It's very concerning because there appears to be a total ignoring of due process, which is so foundational to our democracy and our rule of law in this country, and it also sends such a chill to students everywhere, including foreign students. Massachusetts is a place where we benefit from foreign students coming from all over the world to do research, to study and to start companies, in addition to winning Nobel Prizes. And this is really important, because when I- when I talk about Donald Trump's failed America first agenda, we show this is what I'm talking about--",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: -- Governor, thank you so much--",
      "GOV. MAURA HEALEY: -- They're not going to go to the United States. They're going to go elsewhere--",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: -- Thank you so much there, I'm sorry we have to leave it there--",
      "GOV. MAURA HEALEY: -- We need to do better--",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: -- but I appreciate you so much this Sunday to share some of your time with us. Thank you, Governor. And we'll be right back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with EPA administrator Lee Zeldin that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 20, 2025.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin. Administrator Zeldin, thank you so much for spending some of your morning with us. I want to start with what your office called the most momentous day in the history of the EPA, and that is when the EPA announced 31 deregulatory actions just last month. That's a long list, but some of the things that stood out are, you're reconsidering regulations on power plants, on mercury and air Toxic Standards that target coal-fired power plants and on wastewater regulations for the development of oil and gas. The mission statement of the EPA is to protect human health and the environment. Can you assure the American public that all this deregulation is not going to have an adverse impact on people and the environment?",
      "EPA ADMINISTRATOR LEE ZELDIN: Absolutely, we have to both protect the environment and grow the economy. It's what the American people demanding- demanding of us. They want us to make sure that we are applying common sense. Over the course of the last couple years of the Biden administration, there were a lot of regulations that were brought over the finish line that were targeting entire industries. And when the American public went to vote last November, they were talking about economic concerns, about struggling to make ends meet. That includes the cost of being able to heat their home. The choice of whether or not to be able to heat their home or fill up their fridge with groceries or afford prescription medication. The ability to get jobs. What we've also heard are the costs of compliance, which amount into the trillions and what that does to the American economy as well. So going into this process, I don't prejudge outcomes- \u00a0not allowed to under the Administrative Procedures Act. We will have a process that includes public comment, and we would encourage the public to weigh in when they have that opportunity.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Last month, you also announced that your agency is proposing changing the Waters of the U.S., and of course, those are subject to regulation under the Clean Water Act and historically set standards that the EPA can address pollutants in our drinking water, including forever chemicals known as PFAS. I bring that up because during your time as a congressman, you advocated for legislation to address those dangerous PFAS in our water. Can you talk about the specifics of what waters could be now excluded from EPA regulation and why?",
      "LEE ZELDIN: Okay, so the first thing on the \"Waters of the U.S.\", the United States Supreme Court, in a decision called Sackett, put out prescriptive language saying what should be considered a water of the U.S., and what we're going to do is get the federal regulation in line with the Supreme Court decision that came out right now. Across the country, the map of 50 states are operating under different definitions of what is a water of the US. And there are farmers and ranchers and other landowners that and they don't know whether or not water on their land is a water of the US. They have to go hire an attorney or someone else to tell them whether or not they have waters on their property. So on that front, we want a simple definition for the entire country, so that people understand whether or not there's a water of the U.S. on their property. It's also important to some governments that weighed in as well, with regards to PFAS, very important issue, and we have to ensure that we are tackling it. I was a member of the PFAS task force when I was a member of Congress. I represent in the district with a bunch of PFAS issues. I've heard some feedback from members of Congress as it relates to PFAS. One example is that there are compliance states coming up where there are local water municipalities that are saying that they're going to have trouble meeting those particular deadlines, and they're looking for assistance. So I've heard that from members of Congress. Now, that feedback from members of Congress, it's important, something else they talk about is called passive receivers. So a local water municipality would have to pay for the PFAS cleanup, and then they pass it off to their consumer. And that is against the principle of polluter pays. Instead of making Americans pay to clean up PFAS from their own drinking water, the responsible party should be paying, and in many cases, the responsible party is the federal government.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I want to turn to also the $20 billion worth of clean energy grants that you terminated because just last week, a federal judge ruled that the government must unfreeze that money because the administration did not offer sufficient evidence for waste, fraud and abuse. Now the ruling has been stayed while the appellate court looks into the case further. But can you talk about what this judge has says is a lack of evidence. Because there are several ongoing investigations to look for that waste, fraud and abuse, but they haven't concluded. So why did you freeze the money before those investigations wrapped?",
      "LEE ZELDIN: And I'm glad you pointed out that the circuit court then stopped what the district court was saying. So, self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients, lack of sufficient EPA oversight, these were all concerns that we had. First were- had the alarm raised when a Biden EPA political appointee in December was on video saying that they were tossing gold bars off the Titanic, rushing to get billions of dollars out the door before Inauguration Day. And also said, with an eye towards getting themselves jobs at recipient NGOs. So for example, as it relates to unqualified recipients, there was one recipient NGO that only received $100 in 2023, they got $2 billion in 2024. They also have in their grant agreement requirement to complete a training in 90 days called \"how to develop a budget.\" They were amending the account control agreements days before the inauguration, reducing EPA oversight. There's all sorts of questions that you can ask me as relates to where this money goes, because the $20 billion goes through eight pass through entities, EPA isn't even a party to the account control agreements once it goes to the other entities, including many other pass throughs. If you ask me, what happens to that money, basic questions, $20 billion, I couldn't even provide answers to you. Now, I owe it to you, to the American public, to Congress, to be able to tell them where that money goes. The idea that we're going to play along with tossing gold bars off the Titanic is something that I will not go along with. I have a zero tolerance for any waste and abuse. It is my duty to ensure that I'm an exceptional steward of tax dollars. It is my responsibility to make- make sure we have more oversight of those funds.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: You bring up the gold bars because of that Project Veritas video where one former EPA advisor used that phrase, but you're not banking all of these cuts based on that one assertion, are you?",
      "LEE ZELDIN: So it's interesting because, you know, you asked me, I brought up one- one exact- piece of example as it relates to that video. I talk about unqualified recipients. I talk about an NGO that's brand new that received $100 and they get 2 billion. I talk about how their grant agreement tells them that they have 90 days to complete training called \"How to develop a budget.\" I talk about how they're amending account control agreements just days before the election--",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And the judge says that's not sufficient evidence.",
      "LEE ZELDIN: Oh no, it's actually worse than that. In the judge's opinion, she doesn't even reference it. She ignores it. Now this is one of the problems with district court judges across this entire country. They were not elected President of the United States. It is important for us to be able to fulfill our constitutional duties, to follow our statutory obligations, and it is important to be a responsible steward of tax dollars. But what shouldn't happen is ignore all of the evidence and then just say, there is no evidence. The 39-page opinion of the district court doesn't even reference any of that. And if we had more time and you said, hey Lee, why don't you provide for me 15 more examples of evidence right now, and it's up to you. I don't know how much time you have. But I could just keep going of all the evidence and talk about self dealing, conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients and reduced oversight.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Administrator, I will get that from your team, and I appreciate it. We will also be watching that case as it unfolds closely. Thank you so much, and Happy Easter to you.",
      "LEE ZELDIN: Thank you.",

      "WEIJIA JIANG: And we turn now to Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen. Senator, thank you so much for joining us this morning. You're just back from El Salvador, and I want to pick up where we left off with Camilo, because the White House is using these new details to build its case that Abrego Garcia should stay where he is and not come back to the U.S. Your response?",
      "SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, Weijia it's good to be with you and these- his case is, of course, separate than the case of the Venezuelans that you were talking about earlier.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Yes.",
      "SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: And in Abrego Garcia's case, the Trump administration admitted in federal court that he'd been wrongfully abducted and sent to a prison in El Salvador. But rather than fixing the problem, as the Supreme Court has said, in terms of his need to be- use their efforts to to facilitate his release, they reprimanded the lawyer who made that case. So, they need to bring him home. Now, with respect to these other facts. I say, put up or shut up in court, as you just heard in your last conversation, they have not done that and I do want to just read one sentence from the federal district court who said, and I quote, \"that the administration has presented no evidence linking Abrego Garcia to MS-13, or to any other terrorist activity,\" unquote. Go to court, stop tweeting and put up or shut up in front of the judges.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: You bring that up because that is why the administration says that they have deported Abrego Garcia. And you have previously said that when you talk to him, he was not informed about why he was deported or detained. Did you tell him why the administration says they did what they did?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I did not go over all the facts of his case, other than to say that the courts of the United States had determined that he had been wrongfully detained and deported. He has no news of his case. He did tell me that when he was taken to the Baltimore detention facility, he wanted to make one phone call to let people know exactly what was happening in terms of his detention there, and he was not able to make it. He did not know at that time that they were going to send him back to El Salvador, where, as you say, a federal immigration judge had- had prohibited, prohibited the administration from sending him.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: You also said that you did not directly ask Abrego Garcia whether he is a member of MS-13, which, of course, the Trump administration has designated as a terrorist group. I wonder why because that is all we are hearing from the White House and you know, he hasn't been able to speak for himself. So did you ask him?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, I know his answer. His answer he has made repeatedly, including in court, which is that he is not. I was not there to litigate all the details of his case. I was there to make sure that he was still alive and check on his health. That's what I promised his wife and family that I would try to do, and that is what I did.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Since he was deported, there have been a lot of questions about his welfare and where exactly he is and you broke the news that he is no longer at CECOT, the maximum security prison, but rather transferred. Do you know why he was transferred and how long he'll stay at this less restrictive prison?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I don't know why he was transferred. I mean, CECOT was a traumatizing experience, as was being sort of abducted from the United States illegally, without knowing why. He did say that he felt threatened by other prisoners at CECOT, not those who were in his immediate cell, but taunts from others. So he is now at a place in Santa Ana, and I believe I was the first to learn that he had been transferred.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I want to show our viewers some pictures that the president of El Salvador, Bukele, showing you and Abrego Garcia sitting around what appears to be margaritas. You have blamed him for trying to deceive people with props. After he posted those images, he also posted, quote, \"I love chess.\" Do you have any concerns that the Salvadoran government used you as a pawn to make their point that Abrego Garcia is doing well and that he should stay where he is?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: No, in fact, the El Salvadoran government tried really hard not to let me see him, but I think they realized that that was not a good look at the end of the day. I had press conferences in El Salvador with local press and made the point that El Salvador was violating international law by not allowing anyone to reach him, not his wife, not his lawyers, nobody. They realized that was a bad look. So I'm glad I met him, that was the purpose of my visit. They go to great lengths to deceive people, and that's what you saw, because they got these government guys, essentially told the waiters to bring these drinks that appear to look like margaritas to the table. No one touched them. I can go into the details about how their whole scheme was set up, but the reality is, if you look at the photos when I first sat down, and the ones at the end, you can see that that was all staged. They're trying to create the impression that you know this is a guy in paradise when, in fact, he's been in one of the most notorious prisons in the world.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, the Trump administration has made abundantly clear that they have no intention of bringing him back to the United States. And in fact, the- the official White House account posted a picture that says exactly that based on their own edits. Is it fair to say that Abrego Garcia will remain in El Salvador as long as Trump is president, or unless Trump changes his mind?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: No, because the Supreme Court of the United States and the other courts have said that the administration has to facilitate his return. As of right now, they are in defiance of that court order. They're not doing anything. I want to be really clear, this is not a case about just one man whose constitutional rights are being ignored and disrespected. Because when you trample on the constitutional rights of one man, as the courts have all said is happening in this case, you threaten the constitutional rights of every American. I would think that conservatives and libertarians would recoil at the idea that someone has lost his liberty without due process. That's my focus. My focus is not on one man. It's on making sure one man's rights are secured so that we can uphold the rule of law.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Senator Van Hollen, thank you. We hope to see you back soon and Happy Easter.",

    "summary": "In a brief order, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in Texas' Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order from this court.\"",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday temporarily blocked the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law.",
      "In a brief order, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order from this court.\"",
      "The high court acted overnight following an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union, contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798. The Supreme Court had said earlier in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given \"a reasonable time\" to contest their pending removals.",
      "\"These men were in imminent danger of spending their lives in a horrific foreign prison without ever having had a chance to go to court,\" ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt told CBS News in a statement on Saturday. \"We are relieved that the Supreme Court has not permitted the administration to whisk them away the way others were just last month.\"",
      "Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. Alito wrote in his dissent, joined by Thomas, that \"the court hastily and prematurely granted unprecedented emergency relief.\" He argued that the high court's intervention was inappropriate because it was unclear that the court had jurisdiction and that there was \"little concrete support\" for the allegation that the migrants were in imminent danger of removal. He also noted that the Supreme Court heard only from the ACLU, and not the government, before acting.",
      "\"In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,\" Alito wrote.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on Saturday responded to the Supreme Court's order on X, claiming that the men being held were \"foreign terrorists.\"",
      "\"They were arrested in diligently planned and executed raids recently carried out by Departments of Justice and Homeland Security,\" Miller said.",
      "\"We are confident we will ultimately prevail against the onslaught of meritless litigation brought by radical activists who care more about the rights of these terrorist aliens than those of the American people,\" Leavitt wrote in a separate post.",
      "On Friday, two federal judges refused to step in as lawyers for the men launched a desperate legal campaign to prevent their deportation. Early Saturday, the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals refused to issue an order protecting the detainees from being deported.",
      "The administration is expected to return to the Supreme Court quickly in an effort to persuade the justices to lift their temporary order.",
      "The ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet facility and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "In an emergency filing early Friday, the ACLU said it heard from lawyers and relatives of some of the men held at the detention center in Ansen, Texas, that immigration authorities were accusing the men of being members of the Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang President Trump has made into a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration. The organization, citing lawyers and family members, said some of them had been given notices telling them they were slated to be deported under the wartime law.",
      "Citing the March 15 deportations of scores of migrants who were taken to El Salvador's notorious Center for the Confinement of Terrorism, or CECOT, mega-prison, the ACLU implored U.S. District Court Judge James Wesley Hendrix to act quickly.",
      "\"(G)iven the brutal nature of the Salvadoran prison where other Venezuelan men were sent under the (Alien Enemies Act) last month, the irreparable harm to them is manifest,\" the ACLU's emergency motion said.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act in March\u00a0to order officials to immediately detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua, arguing that they were invading or staging an incursion into the U.S.",
      "The act has only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended the AEA gave it the power to swiftly remove immigrants it identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status.",
      "Following the unanimous high court order on April 9, federal judges in\u00a0Colorado,\u00a0New York and southern Texas\u00a0promptly issued orders barring the removal of detainees under the AEA until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court.",
      "But there had been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is located 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state.",
      "Judge Hendrix, a Trump appointee, this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported. He also balked at issuing a broader order prohibiting the removal of all Venezuelans in the area under the act because he said removals hadn't started yet.",
      "But the ACLU's Friday filing included sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday.",
      "An attorney for the Legal Aid Society said her client refused to sign papers he was given by the detention facility staff because they were in English and he could not understand what they said.",
      "Gelernt said in a Friday evening hearing before District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, D.C., that the administration initially moved Venezuelans to its south Texas immigration facility for deportation. But since a judge banned deportations in that area, it has funneled them to the Bluebonnet facility, where no such order exists. He said witnesses reported the men were being loaded on buses Friday evening to be taken to the airport.",
      "With Hendrix not agreeing to the ACLU's request for an emergency order, the group turned to Boasberg, who initially halted deportations in March. The Supreme Court ruled the orders against deportation could only come from judges in jurisdictions where immigrants were held, which Boasberg said made him powerless on Friday.",
      "\"I'm sympathetic to everything you're saying,\" Boasberg told Gelernt. \"I just don't think I have the power to do anything about it.\"",
      "Boasberg this week found there's probable cause that the Trump administration committed\u00a0criminal contempt\u00a0by ignoring his order to turn around the planes carrying more than 200 Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador. He was concerned that the paper that ICE was giving those held did not make clear they had a right to challenge their removal in court, which he believed the Supreme Court mandated.",
      "Drew Ensign, an attorney for the Justice Department, disagreed, saying that people slated for deportation would have a \"minimum\" of 24 hours to challenge their removal in court. He said no flights were scheduled for Friday night and he was unaware of any Saturday, but the Department of Homeland Security said it reserved the right to remove people then.",
      "ICE said it would not comment on the litigation.",
      "Also Friday, a Massachusetts judge made permanent his temporary ban on the administration deporting immigrants who have exhausted their appeals to countries other than their home countries unless they are informed of their destination and given a chance to object if they'd face torture or death there.",
      "Some Venezuelans subject to Trump's Alien Enemies Act have been sent to El Salvador and housed in its\u00a0notorious\u00a0main prison.",

    "published": "Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:49:08 -0400",
    "summary": "The meeting came after Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met Saturday with the Vatican's No. 2 official amid tensions for the Trump administration's crackdown on migrants.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance met with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Easter Sunday, a spokesperson for the vice president said, in a rare meeting after the two men have\u00a0tangled sharply over immigration\u00a0and the Trump administration's plans to deport migrants en masse.",
      "Francis has made caring for migrants a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative U.S. Catholic Church.",
      "Francis also changed church teaching to say that capital punishment is inadmissible in all cases.",
      "Meanwhile, Vance had defended the administration's America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin as \"ordo amoris.\" He has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care \u2014 to family first, followed by neighbor, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere.",
      "In a Feb. 10 letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance's understanding of the concept.",
      "\"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups,\" he wrote. \"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan,' that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"",
      "Vance has\u00a0acknowledged Francis' criticism\u00a0but has said he would continue to defend his views. During a Feb. 28 appearance at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Vance didn't address the issue specifically but called himself a \"baby Catholic\" and acknowledged there are \"things about the faith that I don't know.\"",
      "Vance was spending Easter weekend in Rome with his family and attended Good Friday services in St. Peter's Basilica after meeting with\u00a0Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni.\u00a0On Saturday, the Vances got a private tour of the Sistine Chapel, and the vice president met with the Vatican's No. 2 official.",
      "The Holy See reaffirmed good relations with Vance after the Saturday meeting, but noted \"an exchange of opinions\" over current international conflicts, migrants and prisoners.",
      "The Vatican stated that Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met with the secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and the foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Gallagher.",
      "The Holy See has responded cautiously to the Trump administration, keeping with its tradition of diplomatic neutrality, expressing alarm over the administration's crackdown on migrants and cuts in international aid.",
      "Those concerns were reflected in the Vatican's statement on Saturday, which said the talks were cordial and that it expressed satisfaction with the administration's commitment to protecting freedom of religion and conscience.",
      "\"There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,\" the statement said. \"Finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the State and the Catholic Church in the United States, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged.\"",
      "The reference to \"serene collaboration\" appeared to refer to Vance's accusation that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was\u00a0resettling \"illegal immigrants\"\u00a0to get federal funding. Top U.S. cardinals have pushed back strongly against the claim.",
      "\"It is clear that the approach of the current U.S. administration is very different from what we are used to and, especially in the West, from what we have relied on for many years,\" Parolin told La Repubblica daily on the eve of Vance's visit.",
      "The vice president's office confirmed the meeting between Vance and Parolin, saying they \"discussed their shared religious faith, Catholicism in the United States, the plight of persecuted Christian communities around the world, and President Trump's commitment to restoring world peace.\"",
      "There was no mention of the details offered by the Vatican.",

      "\"This morning I called Congresswoman Barbara Lee to congratulate her on becoming the next Mayor of Oakland,\" Taylor said in a statement. \"Thanks to the heart, grit, and vision of our fearless team and supporters, we built a movement that resonated across Oakland, echoing the national dialogue about the waning relevance of a Democratic \u00a0Party that puts old-guard politics over improving the lives of everyday people. I pray that Mayor-Elect Lee fulfills her commitment to unify Oakland by authentically engaging the 47% of Oaklanders who voted for me and who want pragmatic results-driven leadership.\"",
      "The Alameda County Registrar of Voters released the latest election numbers on Friday, and the update showed Lee was ahead of Taylor by almost 5,000 votes. According to the county registrar, Lee has 50.6% of the vote, and a candidate needs 50% plus one vote to win. The next election update will be on April 25.",
      "\"While I believe strongly in respecting the democratic voting process and ballots will continue to be counted through Tuesday, the results are clear that the people of Oakland have elected me as your next Mayor. Thank you, Oakland,\" Lee said in a statement.",

She earned an undergraduate degree from Mills College in Oakland and a master's degree in social work from UC Berkeley.",

      "\"We intend to hit the ground running,\" Lee said.",
      "Lee and Taylor were widely considered the frontrunners in the race, which featured a crowded field of 10 candidates. The race was triggered after\u00a0voters recalled Sheng Thao from the mayor's office last year.",

      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's chief of staff, Joe Kasper, ordered an investigation into unauthorized disclosures in March. His memo said the investigation would seek \"a complete record\" of leaks and use polygraph tests if necessary.",
      "The two now-fired officials are Hegseth's senior advisor Dan Caldwell and deputy chief of staff Dan Selnick, the sources said. Both were put on administrative leave earlier this week pending the leak investigation, CBS News reported. Politico was first to report their termination.",
      "A third official, Colin Carroll, the chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense, was also put on administrative leave this week amid the investigation.",

      "After the meeting, Araghchi said the two countries agreed to have another round of negotiations in Oman on April 26. But experts will meet there in the days before.",
      "\"The talks were held in a constructive environment and I can say that is moving forward,\" Araghchi told Iranian state television. \"I hope that we will be in a better position after the technical talks.\"",

    "summary": "A tranche of records on Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 killing are being unsealed at the urging of the senator's son, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday started releasing the first tranche of records on Democratic Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 assassination, with roughly 10,000 pages of previously classified records.",
      "The disclosure \u2014 ordered by President Trump within days of taking office and backed by the senator's son, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 could reignite speculation about the decades-old killing, as the younger Kennedy insists his father's convicted assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, might be innocent.",
      "A CBS News review found the documents include scans of handwritten notes by convicted assassin Sirhan, witness interviews, crime scene and autopsy photos, FBI memos related to Sirhan and his whereabouts before the shooting, correspondence to the government from the American public in reaction to the assassination, and interviews with Sirhan's family.",
      "Many of the details shared in the files were already known.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the release, which began Friday, comes after an effort done in conjunction with the National Archives and other agency officials to scan and upload more than 10,000 pages, which will be available for the American people to view online \"to fulfill President Trump's maximum transparency promise.\"",
      "The records will be published with limited redactions for privacy reasons, such as to shield Social Security numbers, she said.",
      "Gabbard said that an additional 50,000 pages of files related to Robert F. Kennedy's killing were discovered during searches of CIA and FBI warehouses for documents that had not been turned over to the Archives. Agencies are working to make those documents available and will continue searching government facilities for more, according to the director of national intelligence.",
      "What did the RFK files say?",
      "The documents released so far appear to include Justice Department and FBI memos, as well as photos of evidence collected during the investigation into Robert F. Kennedy's assassination and clippings from news reports. Some scanned records are difficult to read, as are handwritten notes included in the tranche.",
      "Some of Sirhan's apparent notes viewed by CBS News include messages like \"RFK must be disposed of like his brother was\" and \"My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more [and] more of an unshakeable obsession.\" Other notes from Sirhan expressing hatred for Robert F. Kennedy have been publicly known for decades and were referenced at his trial.",
      "Also in the files: A 1968 FBI memo that offered an assessment of Sirhan, including that he fell from a horse and sustained a head injury in 1966, and family members said his behavior changed markedly afterward.",
      "A June 12 FBI memo describes Robert F. Kennedy's widow Ethel Kennedy's \"distraught\" reactions to the shooting, with one ambulance worker recounting she told him, \"keep your hands off him,\" and another witness saying she knocked over a TV news camera and hit a reporter in the chest at the hospital.",
      "Some of the documents detail eyewitness interviews about both Sirhan and the shooting. A few of those records touch on longstanding conspiracy theories about the assassination. There are references to witnesses seeing a woman in a polka-dot dress or somebody shouting \"we shot him,\" which often features in theories about the shooting, though other witnesses say they didn't spot anybody matching that description.",
      "What could the new RFK files reveal?",
      "It's unclear what new information on the 1968 slaying could emerge from the disclosures, several experts told CBS News before the documents were released. Robert F. Kennedy's killing was primarily investigated and prosecuted by local officials in Los Angeles, and files from that investigation \u2014 along with many records from a parallel FBI probe \u2014 have been publicly available in California's state archives for decades with few omissions. It's not clear if other federal agencies hold records tied to the assassination.",
      "The administration has also vowed to release files on Rev. Martin Luther King's 1968 assassination, and it published troves of declassified files on President John F. Kennedy's 1963 killing in March.",
      "Why did Trump release RFK files \u2014 and is RFK Jr. involved?",
      "Mr. Trump ordered his administration to unseal records on King, John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy in late January. In an April 10 cabinet meeting, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the King and Robert F. Kennedy files would be ready within days, including what she described as decades-old documents that \"have never been scanned or seen before.\"",
      "\"Nearly 60 years after the tragic assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, the American people will, for the first time, have the opportunity to review the federal government's investigation thanks to the leadership of President Trump,\" Gabbard said in a statement. \"My team is honored that the President entrusted us to lead the declassification efforts and to shine a long-overdue light on the truth.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-ukraine-war-russia-rubio-says-us-may-move-on-peace-efforts-not-our-war/",
    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 20:01:25 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump could give up on efforts to end the war in Ukraine \"in a matter of days,\" Rubio says, highlighting the administration view that it's \"not our war.\"",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014\u00a0U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the U.S. may \"move on\" from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days. Months of efforts by the White House have failed to bring an end to the fighting, despite repeated promises by President Trump before he took office that he would use his skills as a negotiator to end the war immediately.",
      "Rubio spoke in Paris after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials produced outlines for steps toward peace and appeared to make some long-awaited progress. A new meeting is expected next week in London, and Rubio suggested that could be decisive in determining whether the Trump administration continues its involvement.",
      "\"We are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,\" Rubio told reporters upon departure. \"Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on.\"",
      "\"It's not our war,\" Rubio said. \"We have other priorities to focus on.\" He said the U.S. administration wants to decide \"in a matter of days.\"",
      "His remarks contrasted starkly with the stance of the Biden administration, during which then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned not long after the war began that Russia's autocratic President Vladimir Putin was determined \"to reconstitute the Soviet empire. Short of that, he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc. And short of that, he'd like to make sure that all of these countries are somehow neutral.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also warned, including in multiple interviews with CBS News, that Putin is intent on expanding Russia's borders by force \u2014 and breaking the security bonds forged among Western democracies during World War II, of which the U.S.-led NATO alliance has been the most tangible.",
      "\"For him, we are a satellite of Russian Federation. At the moment, it's us, then Kazakhstan, then Baltic states, then Poland, then Germany. At least half of Germany,\" Zelenskyy told CBS News' Charlie D'Agata about one year ago. \"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members.\"",
      "Zelenskyy called Russia's invasion a war \"against the democracy, against the values, against the whole world,\" acknowledging even then that some in the West might be tired of hearing that message, \"but only those are tired who are not at war, who don't know what war is, and who have never lost his or her children.\"",
      "\"If we do not stand firm, he will advance further,\" Zelenskyy reiterated in an interview with 60 Minutes just this month. \"It is not just idle speculation; the threat is real. Putin's ultimate goal is to revive the Russian empire and reclaim territories currently under NATO protection. Considering all of this, I believe it could escalate into a world war.\"",
      "Trump says \"we have a minerals deal\" with Ukraine",
      "Rubio's comments on Friday came hours after the U.S. and Ukraine seemingly neared a long-delayed deal to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's vast mineral resources, which has been intertwined with President Trump's peace push.",
      "\"We have a minerals deal,'' Mr. Trump said Thursday, and Ukraine's economy minister said Friday that the two countries had signed a memorandum of intent ahead of a possible fuller agreement later.",
      "The deal, which Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said she signed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is expected to pave the way for significant investments, infrastructure modernization and long-term cooperation.",
      "Work toward the mineral deal had stalled in February following a contentious Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Negotiations have since resumed.",
      "Rubio on the dialogue with Russia, and Europe",
      "Despite apparent growing U.S. impatience with the peace efforts, Rubio called Thursday's Paris talks constructive. \"Nobody rejected anything, nobody got up from the table or walked away.\"",
      "Rubio didn't single out Russia or Ukraine as blocking peace efforts. He said he informed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about the outlines that emerged when they spoke after the Paris talks, but wouldn't say how Lavrov reacted.",
      "When asked about Rubio's comments on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that \"fairly complex\" negotiations were ongoing between Russia and the U.S. He did not give details but said no direct talks between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were scheduled in the coming days.",
      "\"Russia is striving toward resolving this conflict, securing its own interests, and is open to dialogue. We are continuing to do this,\" he said.",
      "In its readout on the call with Rubio, the Kremlin said Lavrov had confirmed Moscow's \"readiness to continue working together with American colleagues to reliably eliminate the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis.\"",
      "Putin and his deputies have consistently claimed those root causes are Zelenskyy's actions and NATO's eastward expansion \u2014 misleading narratives that Mr. Trump himself has at times espoused about the full-scale invasion Putin launched on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "After weeks of tension with European allies, Rubio told reporters in Paris that the European negotiators proved helpful. \"The U.K. and France and Germany can help us move the ball on this.\"",
      "During a meeting on Friday with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome, Vice President JD Vance also spoke about the ongoing negotiations with Ukraine and Russia, saying he wouldn't \"pre-judge them, but we feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war to a close.\"",
      "European concerns are growing, however, about Mr. Trump's readiness to draw closer to Russia. These talks were the first time since his inauguration that top American, Ukrainian and European officials met to discuss an end to the war, which has posed the biggest security challenge to Europe since World War II.",
      "The meetings addressed hypothetical security guarantees for Ukraine in the future, but Rubio wouldn't discuss any possible U.S. role in that. Some kind of U.S. support for Ukraine is seen as crucial to ensuring that Russia would not attack again if and when a peace deal is reached.",
      "Rubio and presidential envoy Steve Witkoff have helped lead U.S. efforts to seek peace, and Witkoff has met three times with Putin, Rubio said. Several rounds of negotiations have been held in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Moscow has effectively refused to accept a comprehensive ceasefire that Mr. Trump has pushed and Ukraine has endorsed. Russia has made it conditional on a halt in Ukraine's mobilization efforts and Western arms supplies, which are demands rejected by Ukraine.",
      "Deadly Russian strikes on Ukraine continue",
      "Russia, meanwhile, has kept up a series of deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities, according to officials there, wounding scores of civilians days after missiles killed at least 34 during Palm Sunday celebrations in the northern city of Sumy.",
      "One person died and 103 others, including eight children, were wounded as Russia hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, early on Friday, its mayor Ihor Terekhov reported. He said cluster munitions struck a \"densely populated\" neighborhood four times.",
      "Russian drones also targeted a bakery in Sumy, less than a week after the deadly Palm Sunday strike there, killing a customer and wounding an employee, the regional prosecutor's office said. Photos released by the agency showed rows of Easter cakes stacked inside a devastated building, covered in thick dust, as a huge hole gaped in the wall behind them and rubble piled up on the floor.",
      "Last Sunday's strike on Sumy, resulting in mass casualties, was the second large-scale missile attack to claim civilian lives in just over a week. Some 20 people, including nine children, died on April 4 as missiles struck Zelenskyy's hometown of Kryvyi Rih.",

Shapley was a supervisory special agent in his 14th year at the IRS when he came forward in a 2023 interview with CBS News chief investigative correspondent Jim Axelrod. He alleged internal misgivings about improper pressure to go easy on former President Joe Biden's son.",

The IRS agents alleged the Department of Justice \"slow-walked\" the investigation and told them not to probe leads related to Joe Biden. They were removed from the case and temporarily sidelined with pay.\u00a0 Hunter Biden later pled guilty to tax crimes and was pardoned by his father.",
      "Shapley and another agent who said they faced retaliation after blowing the whistle to Congress and speaking out to CBS News about their investigation have already retained high ranking positions in the Trump administration.

FDA is actively working to ensure continuity of operations during the reorganization period and remains committed to ensuring critical programs and inspections continue,\" an FDA spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Some FDA employees have been working on a possible shift of the agency's routine food efforts to states for years, one current and one former official said, which could free up resources to focus on higher priority and foreign inspections. The FDA already outsources some routine food inspections through contracts with 43 states and Puerto Rico.",
      "\"There's so much work to go around. And us duplicating their work just doesn't make sense,\" one former FDA official, who worked on the plans before leaving the agency and spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "Multiple federal health officials said that the state work currently is often reserved for lower-risk inspections. A third of routine food safety inspections were done by states over recent years, a Government Accountability Office report said earlier this year.",
      "The FDA is ultimately responsible for the safety of much of the U.S. food supply that's distributed over state lines, like packaged products, seafood, eggs and produce. Some kinds of meat are regulated by a different agency inside the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Some higher-risk routine food inspections would likely remain at the FDA under the plans, two officials said. For example, agency staff currently conduct annual visits to infant formula manufacturers, which are overseen separately as \"critical foods\" inspections. States would also not be able to take on the work of routine inspections in foreign food facilities.",
      "It is unclear what would happen for the states that do not have contracts with the FDA to conduct food inspections, which range from Hawaii to Delaware.",
      "In addition to routine inspections, the FDA also does other kinds of inspections in response to issues, like a visit to a Colorado onion processor last year linked to the McDonald's Quarter Pounders outbreak that turned up dozens of violations.",
      "Internal planning around the possibility of outsourcing its routine inspections first picked up after 2010, the former FDA official said, when the agency was working on implementing major food safety legislation passed that year.",
      "The official likened the plans to the FDA's Grade A Milk Safety Program, where states fund the majority of oversight work themselves and have agreements with the agency to standardize how the industry is regulated.",
      "Some states and advocacy groups have called for years for the FDA to move its routine food inspections out to states. States can often do inspections at a lower cost than the FDA, while meeting the same standards, they have argued.",
      "\"FDA audits have determined states inspections to be high quality, and the costs show them to be a good economic value. There is significant cost to managing two systems also,\" said Steve Mandernach, executive director of the Association of Food and Drug Officials, in a statement.",
      "Mandernach drew a parallel to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, under which hospitals and nursing homes are largely inspected by state agencies but overseen by the federal government.",
      "He also pointed to how the FDA regulates produce farms. The FDA has agreements with most states to pay for routine inspections conducted by local agriculture departments, where they often handle inspections and enforcement themselves.",
      "\"Further, we implemented this type of program with produce already and it has been successful, expanding and leveraging those lessons can only provide greater value to the taxpayers, increase oversight of manufacturers, and improve food safety,\" he said.",
      "Ending the FDA's work to do its own routine food safety inspections might also help alleviate an issue elsewhere at the agency: a backlog of inspections overseas, as well as in other markets like medical products.",
      "In the past, FDA inspectors had been trained to do multiple kinds of inspections, officials said, instead of specializing only in food safety inspections.",
      "Steep layoffs at the office's support staff is expected to result in cutbacks to the number of inspections that can be done by the agency, CBS News previously reported. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has also greenlighted plans to hire contractors to attempt to plug the hole left by the laid-off workers.",
      "\"In theory, relying on states to do more routine food inspection work could lead to better food safety,\" said Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, in an email to CBS News.",
      "Gremillion cautioned that a transition in how food inspections are done by the FDA would take significant time and resources.",
      "\"So far, this Administration has acted with reckless disregard for how its policies will affect the detection and prevention of foodborne illness, and any plans to replace federal food inspectors with some other workforce deserves suspicion,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 09:05:36 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal judge said he could recommend criminal prosecutions against the Trump administration, setting up an unprecedented showdown.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg threatened on Wednesday to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for defying a court order to return Venezuelan migrants en route to a Salvadoran prison last month \u2014 possibly setting the stage for an unprecedented showdown between President Trump and the judicial branch.",
      "Boasberg, who said the government \"deliberately flouted\" his orders, warned if the administration doesn't change course, he could hold hearings, recommend criminal charges and hire a private attorney to prosecute the case if the Department of Justice refuses.",
      "Why could Judge Boasberg hold the Trump administration in contempt of court?",
      "In a searing written decision, Boasberg said the Trump administration showed a \"willful disregard\" for his orders not to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The government has cited the 18th-century law to fly hundreds of alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador, whose government is holding scores of U.S. deportees in a notorious maximum-security prison. The Trump administration has touted the deportations as ridding the U.S. of foreign gang members, but an analysis by \"60 Minutes\" last week showed that 75% of the men sent to CECOT in El Salvador had no criminal records. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. It was unclear if any criminal record existed for the other 3%.",
      "Some of those migrants sued to prevent their removal last month, and Boasberg quickly ordered the government verbally to return the migrants to the United States, even if that requires officials to \"turn a plane around.\" The judge later issued a written order barring the administration from removing migrants under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Boasberg wrote Wednesday the government disobeyed those orders by not returning the migrants to the United States. Since then, he said he's given officials \"ample opportunity\" to explain what happened, but found their responses unsatisfactory.",
      "The Trump administration has denied violating the judge's order, and White House communications director Steven Cheung said the government will appeal Boasberg's ruling. \"The President is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,\" he wrote in a statement.",
      "As it pursues its appeal, the Justice Department has asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to\u00a0pause the district court's order, arguing that Boasberg's decision was \"fundamentally misconceived from the start, needlessly prompting a constitutional confrontation over criminal contempt that never should have arisen.\"",
      "What is contempt of court?",
      "Under federal law, criminal contempt of court is defined as disobeying a federal court's \"lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"",
      "As with any criminal case, prosecutors would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant \u2014 in this case, potentially a federal official \u2014 willfully violated an order, says Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner.",
      "Contempt cases are extremely rare, according to Epner. He said that during his three-year stint as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, he can't recall anyone even threatening to bring a criminal contempt of court case, much less actually bringing charges.",
      "\"In my experience as a lawyer over the last 30 years, even the hint of being held in contempt by a judge is ordinarily enough in order to cause litigants to correct their behavior,\" Epner said.",
      "What happens next in this case?",
      "Before moving forward, Boasberg gave the government an opportunity to \"purge\" its alleged contempt, saying the government could take the migrants back into U.S. custody so they can potentially seek relief from a court. If the administration decides to go down that route, he gave officials one week to file court papers \"explaining the steps they have taken and will take.\"",
      "Boasberg said he is also open to other solutions.",
      "Otherwise, Boesberg says the Trump administration has one week to give the court the names of whoever \"made the decision not to halt the transfer\" of the migrants covered by his orders. If needed, Boasberg said he'll hold hearings or order depositions to gather more details.",
      "After that, Boasberg said he could recommend a criminal prosecution for contempt of court, though it's unclear who the defendant would be.",
      "However, Boasberg can't necessarily force charges to be brought. Federal prosecutions are generally handled by the Department of Justice, which has the power to decide which cases it pursues, making it highly unlikely the Trump administration will choose to criminally charge its own officials. Epner told CBS News he \"cannot imagine a circumstance\" where the DOJ chooses to bring those charges.",
      "Can Boasberg appoint a private lawyer to prosecute the administration?",
      "It's complicated. Boasberg notes that if the Justice Department decides not to bring contempt charges, he has the right to appoint a private attorney to step in and prosecute the case. That option isn't unheard-of: In one well-known 2023 case, the Supreme Court chose not to strike down a contempt conviction against lawyer Steven Donziger that was prosecuted by private attorneys.",
      "But that route is extremely unusual and would almost certainly face legal pushback, Epner says. In the small handful of situations where judges have appointed lawyers to step in and act as prosecutor, it has generally been because the DOJ simply decided bringing contempt charges wasn't worth its time, according to Epner. Boasberg's case is far thornier because it would involve a direct confrontation with federal officials.",
      "\"Actually trying to prosecute a criminal contempt here would be a mess because all of these issues would have to be unpacked,\" Epner said.",
      "Any effort to prosecute Trump administration officials privately could reach the Supreme Court, and Epner argues \"all evidence is that they are bending over in every possible supine position to avoid a showdown with Donald Trump.\" The court has already weighed in, overturning Boasberg's order on the grounds that cases should have been brought in another court district.",
      "For those reasons, Epner thinks it's unlikely that Boasberg will go with private attorneys, saying, \"it is literally setting up a constitutional crisis.\"",
      "Could the Trump administration face other contempt charges?",
      "It's unclear, though the administration has run into resistance from federal judges in other cases.",
      "Judge Paula Xinis has ordered the government to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who the Trump administration conceded was mistakenly sent to the same Salvadoran prison as the Venezuelan migrants. In a hearing Tuesday, Xinis said the administration \"has not yet fulfilled the mandate, the order, that I issued,\" and ordered expedited discovery in the case, saying, \"there will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers have suggested the government be held in contempt. Xinis said Tuesday, \"I will have the record before me to call it like I see it\" before ruling on contempt.",

    "story": [
      "Dakota Meyer, a Marine who was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism in the Afghanistan War but later became a sharp critic of the Biden administration over its chaotic withdrawal from that conflict, is reenlisting in the military and will serve in the Marine Reserves.",
      "In a briefing with reporters on Thursday before his reenlistment ceremony, 36-year-old Meyer said he is returning to military service after 15 years out of uniform because he felt he \"had more to give.\" He's also close to President Trump's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth.",
      "But Meyer said he would refrain from politics while in uniform.",
      "\"The great part about being in the reserves is I'm still a citizen when I'm not on orders,\" he said. \"When I'm on orders I'll comply obviously with whatever the standard is.\"",
      "In brief remarks during the ceremony, Hegseth said Meyer's reenlistment is \"not common practice\" and the Marine Corps \"doesn't do things like this lightly,\" but praised Meyer's \"uncommon valor.\" Hegseth said the reenlistment shows \"you're never too old, you're never too experienced, you've never done too much that you can't continue to contribute.\"",
      "Originally from Kentucky, Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor, the military's highest honor, by then-President Barack Obama in 2011 for his heroics in Afghanistan when he charged five times in a Humvee into heavy gunfire to rescue comrades under attack by Taliban insurgents.",
      "On Sept. 8, 2009, Meyer was part of a security team supporting a patrol moving into a village in the Ganjgal Valley. Suddenly, the lights in a nearby village went out and gunfire erupted. About 50 Taliban insurgents on mountainsides and in the village had ambushed the patrol.",
      "His actions during the six-hour attack and firefight saved the lives of 36 people, both Americans and Afghans. He killed at least eight Taliban insurgents. Firing from a gun turret on top of a Humvee driven by a fellow Marine, he provided cover for his team, allowing many to escape likely death.",
      "Meyer described the events in a 2011 interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" telling correspondent David Martin, \"I didn't think I was going to die. I knew I was.\"",
      "Four American soldiers died in the ambush: 1st Lt. Michael Johnson, 25, from Virginia Beach, Virginia; Staff Sgt. Aaron Kenefick, 30, of Roswell, Georgia; Corpsman James Layton, 22, of Riverbank, California; and Edwin Wayne Johnson Jr., a 31-year-old gunnery sergeant from Columbus, Georgia. A fifth man, Army Sgt. Kenneth W. Westbrook, 41, of Shiprock, New Mexico, died later from his wounds.",
      "After leaving the military, Meyer remained in the spotlight. In 2016 he married former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's daughter, Bristol, and they had two children. Years later, in 2019, he told \"60 Minutes\" about his experience with a\u00a0new post-traumatic stress disorder treatment.",
      "He's been outspoken about the jailing of another Marine \u2014 Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller \u2014 who criticized the Biden administration for the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan in social media posts while in uniform, which is a violation of military conduct.",

      "Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele also posted photos\u00a0of the meeting, but suggested Abrego Garcia will remain incarcerated by his government, which is being paid by the United States to hold deportees: \"Now that he's been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody.\"",

      "\"We still have so many questions, hopes, and fears. I will continue praying and fighting for Kilma's' return home,\" Vasquez wrote.",
      "White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai called Van Hollen's visit \"truly disgusting,\" writing, \"Chris Van Hollen has firmly established Democrats as the party whose top priority is the welfare of an illegal alien MS-13 terrorist.\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers have strongly denied any connections to MS-13.",
      "The surprise meeting with Van Hollen marks Abrego Garcia's first known appearance since last month, when his deportation to El Salvador's notorious Terrorism Confinement Center drew national attention and sparked a legal standoff with the Trump administration.",
      "The administration admitted in court papers Abrego Garcia was sent to El Salvador \u2014 along with hundreds of other Salvadoran and Venezuelan migrants \u2014 due to an \"administrative error.\" U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, and the Supreme Court backed up that order, but he has remained in El Salvador since then, with Xinis suggesting the government hasn't complied with her order and demanding regular updates on his status.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed back, arguing it's up to El Salvador to decide whether to return Abrego Garcia \u2014 an argument an appeals court called \"shocking\" on Thursday. The government has also alleged Abrego Garcia is linked to Salvadoran gang MS-13, citing a confidential informant, though his attorneys have denied that allegation and noted Abrego Garcia has not been charged or convicted of any crimes.",
      "Abrego Garcia, 29, was born in El Salvador but entered the United States illegally in 2011 at the age of 16. He was arrested outside a Maryland Home Depot in 2019, but a judge barred the government from deporting him to El Salvador, warning he could be persecuted by gangs in his home country. Years later, in March of this year, he was detained by immigration agents in Maryland and sent to the Salvadoran detention center, known as CECOT.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case is at the center of a controversial push by the Trump administration to send scores of migrants \u2014 including accused members of MS-13 and Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua \u2014 to CECOT using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which allows the president to deport citizens of an enemy nation during an \"invasion or predatory incursion.\" The gambit has been challenged in court, with opponents decrying conditions in CECOT and\u00a0arguing the government is denying migrants the right to due process. A \"60 Minutes\" report found most of the 238 Venezuelans sent to CECOT on several planes last month had no apparent criminal record. But the Trump administration has defended its use of the law, arguing it is cracking down on gang violence.",
      "Van Hollen's meeting with Abrego Garcia\u00a0came after the senator was turned away Thursday at a military checkpoint near CECOT. He said he was about three kilometers from the notorious supermax prison, when he was stopped by soldiers, who he said were ordered to prevent him from going toward the prison.",

      "There has been vigorous debate in scientific circles about whether the planet K2-18b, which is 124 light years away in the Leo constellation, could be an ocean world capable of hosting microbial life, at least.",
      "Using the James Webb Space Telescope, a British-U.S. team of researchers detected signs of two chemicals in the planet's atmosphere long considered to be \"biosignatures\" indicating extraterrestrial life.",
      "On Earth, the chemicals dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide are produced only by life, mostly microscopic marine algae called phytoplankton.",
      "The researchers emphasized caution, saying that more observations were needed to confirm these findings, and that they were not announcing a definitive discovery.",
      "But the implications could be huge, according to Nikku Madhusudhan, a Cambridge University astrophysicist and lead author of the study, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "Madhusudhan told BBC News that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there,\" he said. \"I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "But outside experts pointed to disputes over previous discoveries about the exoplanet, adding that these chemicals could have been created by unknown means having nothing to do with life.",
      "\"Goldilocks\" zone",
      "More than eight times the mass of Earth and 2.5 times as big, K2-18b is rare among the roughly 6,000 exoplanets discovered so far in that it orbits its star in a habitable or \"goldilocks\" zone.",
      "This means it is neither too hot nor too cold to have liquid water, considered the most important ingredient for life.",
      "Telescopes observe such far-off exoplanets when they cross in front of their star, allowing astronomers to analyze how molecules block the light streaming through their atmosphere.",
      "In 2023, the Webb telescope detected methane and carbon dioxide in K2-18b's atmosphere, the first time such carbon-based molecules were detected on an exoplanet in a habitable zone.",
      "It also detected weak signals of the chemical DMS, leading astronomers to turn Webb towards the planet again a year ago, this time using its mid-infrared instrument to detect different wavelengths of light.",
      "They found much stronger signs of the chemicals, though still well below the \"five sigma\" threshold of statistical significance scientists seek for such discoveries.",
      "Even if the results are confirmed, it would not necessarily mean that the planet is home to life.",
      "Last year, scientists found traces of DMS on a comet, which suggested it can be produced in non-organic ways and is perhaps not a \"biosignature.\"",
      "However the concentration of the chemical observed on K2-18b appears to be thousands of times stronger than levels on Earth, likely suggesting a biological origin, Madhusudhan said.",
      "\"Hellishly hot\"",
      "K2-18b has long been considered the premier candidate for a \"hycean planet\" \u2014 an ocean world bigger than Earth with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.",
      "Hycean planets, much like Earth, are covered in oceans and have atmospheres rich with hydrogen, an element that is essential for life. Many of the planets are bigger and hotter than Earth \u2014 up to 2.6 times larger than our planet and reaching atmospheric temperatures up to nearly 200 degrees Celsius, or 392 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "These planets would not be expected to be home to intelligent alien life, but rather tiny microbes similar to those in Earth's oceans billions of years ago.",
      "\"Hycean planets open a whole new avenue in our search for life elsewhere,\" Madhusudhan said previously.",
      "Some research has questioned whether the currently proposed hycean planets are too close to their stars to support liquid water \u2014 including K2-18b, which orbits its star every 33 days.",
      "Raymond Pierrehumbert, a planetary physics professor at Oxford University, has conducted separate research indicating K2-18b is too hot for life.",
      "If the planet did have water, it would be \"hellishly hot\" and uninhabitable, he told AFP, adding that oceans of lava were more plausible.",
      "Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science at MIT, called for patience, pointing to previous claims of water vapor in K2-18b's atmosphere that turned out to be a different gas.",
      "Madhusudhan estimated that it would take just 16 to 24 more hours of Webb's time to reach the five-sigma threshold, which could happen in the next few years.",
      "The current three-sigma is comparable to the odds of flipping a coin 10 times and getting the same result each time, Cambridge University statistician Stephen Burgess explained.",
      "Five sigma would be getting that result after 20 flips, and would mean \"we can be very confident that this observation isn't just a chance finding,\" he said.",
      "Even beyond K2-18b, Madhusudhan said Webb and future telescopes could allow humanity to discover life outside our home planet sooner than one might think.",
      "\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering,\" he said.",

      "\"The very first thing I'm going to do when I get to Earth will probably be to empty the contents of my stomach,\" he said, prompting laughter. \"It's a physiological thing, it affects different people different ways. Some people can land and go out and eat pizza and dance. When I land, it takes me about 24 hours to feel like I'm a human being again.\"",
      "With the on-time landing, mission duration stood at 220 days and nearly nine hours, spanning 3,520 orbits and 93.3 million miles since launch last Sept. 11 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Ovchinin has now logged 595 days in space over four flights, followed closely by Pettit, whose total stands at 590 days over four flights of his own. Vagner's total after two station visits stands at 416 days.",
      "The world record for most cumulative time in space is held by cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who spent nearly 1,111 days in orbit over five missions. The U.S. record is held by astronaut Peggy Whitson. She spent 675 days in space over four flights.",
      "As for Pettit's age, John Glenn, the first American in orbit, was 77 when he flew aboard the space shuttle in 1998 as a NASA spaceflight participant. He holds the record as the oldest person to fly in orbit.",
      "The Soyuz crew's return to Earth marked the final chapter in an extended crew rotation that began with launch of SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov on March 14.",
      "Crew 10's arrival at the station cleared the way for Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams to return to Earth four days later.",
      "The Russians then launched replacements for Pettit's crew\u00a0\u2014 Soyuz commander Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim \u2014 on April 8, clearing the way for Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit to return to Earth Saturday.",
      "In a brief ceremony Friday, Ovchinin turned command of the station over to Onishi.",
      "\"It's a great honor for me to accept the command of the ISS,\" Onishi said. \"I feel so special that I am taking over the command from you because it's been almost nine years since we met here in 2016 during Expedition 48. At that time, both of us were rookies and here we are two veterans who are ISS commanders.\"",
      "\"Human space flight is not easy. Only continuous dedication from generation to generation made it possible for human beings to get here. Now today, we have four rookies (on board). I'm sure one day they will come back and become commanders ... that's how we will continue to develop human space flight,\" Onishi said.",
      "The ISS has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since Nov. 2, 2000. Scheduled for retirement in five years, the lab is facing problems on multiple fronts, ranging from air leaks in the Russian segment to uncertain funding, spare parts shortages and resupply delays.",
      "\"Spaceflight is difficult and very risky,\" Rich Williams, a member of NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, told the group in a public meeting Thursday. \"The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence.\"",
      "\"The ISS management, crew and support personnel always make spaceflight look easy. Spaceflight is anything but easy, and the increasing risks attending the ISS program are making it harder,\" Williams said.",
      "The air leaks in the Zvezda module's aft docking compartment are presumably the results of metal fatigue and repeated pressure cycles as visiting Soyuz crew ships and Progress cargo freighters come and go.",
      "\"Primary risk mitigation activities at this point include application and patching materials to known cracks and limiting ... pressurization cycles to try to limit stress and fatigue,\" Williams said. \"The ISS program is monitoring this closely, and the panel considers this one of our highest concerns.\"",
      "NASA has hired SpaceX to build a U.S. deorbit vehicle, or USDV, to drive the million-pound space station back into the atmosphere in 2030 to ensure it breaks up over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from shipping lanes and populated areas. The USDV is expected to arrive at the lab in 2029.",
      "\"Delivering and utilizing this USDV capability is critical to ensuring that the deorbit debris risk meets the established government public safety standards,\" Williams said. \"If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude.\"",
      "He said NASA and Russian space officials are working \"to address the challenges associated with achieving a safe deorbit capability, both for end-of-life as well as a risk-managed deorbit for contingencies.\"",
      "The major problem facing the ISS is what Williams called \"a large ISS budget shortfall.\" NASA's fiscal 2024 budget included nearly $1 billion for station operations and maintenance with another $1.6 billion earmarked for crew launches and resupply missions.",
      "\"It is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle has safely re-entered, not only to assure safety of day-to-day operations in a high-risk environment, but also to ensure controlled, safe deorbit within debris footprint requirements for the sake of public safety,\" Williams said.",
      "In summary, he said, \"the panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risks attending the program over the next several years.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 12:06:46 -0400",
    "summary": "A British-U.S. team of researchers detected signs of two chemicals in the planet's atmosphere long considered to be \"biosignatures\" indicating extraterrestrial life.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Thursday that they had detected the most promising \"hints\" of potential life on a planet beyond our solar system, though other scientists expressed skepticism.",
      "There has been vigorous debate in scientific circles about whether the planet K2-18b, which is 124 light years away in the Leo constellation, could be an ocean world capable of hosting microbial life, at least.",
      "Using the James Webb Space Telescope, a British-U.S. team of researchers detected signs of two chemicals in the planet's atmosphere long considered to be \"biosignatures\" indicating extraterrestrial life.",
      "On Earth, the chemicals dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide are produced only by life, mostly microscopic marine algae called phytoplankton.",
      "The researchers emphasized caution, saying that more observations were needed to confirm these findings, and that they were not announcing a definitive discovery.",
      "But the implications could be huge, according to Nikku Madhusudhan, a Cambridge University astrophysicist and lead author of the study, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "Madhusudhan told BBC News that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there,\" he said. \"I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "But outside experts pointed to disputes over previous discoveries about the exoplanet, adding that these chemicals could have been created by unknown means having nothing to do with life.",
      "\"Goldilocks\" zone",
      "More than eight times the mass of Earth and 2.5 times as big, K2-18b is rare among the roughly 6,000 exoplanets discovered so far in that it orbits its star in a habitable or \"goldilocks\" zone.",
      "This means it is neither too hot nor too cold to have liquid water, considered the most important ingredient for life.",
      "Telescopes observe such far-off exoplanets when they cross in front of their star, allowing astronomers to analyze how molecules block the light streaming through their atmosphere.",
      "In 2023, the Webb telescope detected methane and carbon dioxide in K2-18b's atmosphere, the first time such carbon-based molecules were detected on an exoplanet in a habitable zone.",
      "It also detected weak signals of the chemical DMS, leading astronomers to turn Webb towards the planet again a year ago, this time using its mid-infrared instrument to detect different wavelengths of light.",
      "They found much stronger signs of the chemicals, though still well below the \"five sigma\" threshold of statistical significance scientists seek for such discoveries.",
      "Even if the results are confirmed, it would not necessarily mean that the planet is home to life.",
      "Last year, scientists found traces of DMS on a comet, which suggested it can be produced in non-organic ways and is perhaps not a \"biosignature.\"",
      "However the concentration of the chemical observed on K2-18b appears to be thousands of times stronger than levels on Earth, likely suggesting a biological origin, Madhusudhan said.",
      "\"Hellishly hot\"",
      "K2-18b has long been considered the premier candidate for a \"hycean planet\" \u2014 an ocean world bigger than Earth with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.",
      "Hycean planets, much like Earth, are covered in oceans and have atmospheres rich with hydrogen, an element that is essential for life. Many of the planets are bigger and hotter than Earth \u2014 up to 2.6 times larger than our planet and reaching atmospheric temperatures up to nearly 200 degrees Celsius, or 392 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "These planets would not be expected to be home to intelligent alien life, but rather tiny microbes similar to those in Earth's oceans billions of years ago.",
      "\"Hycean planets open a whole new avenue in our search for life elsewhere,\" Madhusudhan said previously.",
      "Some research has questioned whether the currently proposed hycean planets are too close to their stars to support liquid water \u2014 including K2-18b, which orbits its star every 33 days.",
      "Raymond Pierrehumbert, a planetary physics professor at Oxford University, has conducted separate research indicating K2-18b is too hot for life.",
      "If the planet did have water, it would be \"hellishly hot\" and uninhabitable, he told AFP, adding that oceans of lava were more plausible.",
      "Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science at MIT, called for patience, pointing to previous claims of water vapor in K2-18b's atmosphere that turned out to be a different gas.",
      "Madhusudhan estimated that it would take just 16 to 24 more hours of Webb's time to reach the five-sigma threshold, which could happen in the next few years.",
      "The current three-sigma is comparable to the odds of flipping a coin 10 times and getting the same result each time, Cambridge University statistician Stephen Burgess explained.",
      "Five sigma would be getting that result after 20 flips, and would mean \"we can be very confident that this observation isn't just a chance finding,\" he said.",
      "Even beyond K2-18b, Madhusudhan said Webb and future telescopes could allow humanity to discover life outside our home planet sooner than one might think.",
      "\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering,\" he said.",

      "Unique design of Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft",
      "Blue Origin's spacecraft carries a crew of six and is fully autonomous, not controlled by a pilot on board.",
      "The crew capsule sits atop a liquid-hydrogen-fueled booster, which launches straight upwards, reaching a velocity of about 2,200 mph and subjecting the passengers to 3G \u2014 three times the normal force of gravity \u2014 before main engine cutoff, about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight.",
      "At an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule is then released to continue soaring out of the lower atmosphere on its own, while the reusable booster heads back down to Earth to land on a nearby pad.",
      "About three-and-a-half minutes after lifoff, the crew capsule reaches a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles \u2014 the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale, an international body that certifies aerospace records, considers the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The crew experiences weightlessness from the moment the capsule separates from the booster until it arcs over the top of the trajectory and begins its descent. Moments after separating from the booster, passengers are able to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth.",
      "After a few extraordinary minutes, though, it's time to strap in for the return home.",
      "\"It's about three minutes before the astronauts will get a warning to get back into their seats. And at that point, they have about 30 seconds. It's not going to be a rush, it's going to be very leisurely. All they have to do is be sitting in the seat and then as the G forces come on, our reentry will naturally push them back in the seat, so they have plenty of time to buckle back in,\" Gary Lai, a former Blue Origin engineer who helped design the New Shepard, said in an earlier interview with CBS News.",
      "Plunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, briefly subjecting the passengers to more than five times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl to slow the descent to about 16 mph. An instant before touchdown, pressurized nitrogen gas thrusters fire to slow the descent to walking pace.",
      "The New Shepard vehicle has a number of safeguards built in. It is equipped with a \"full envelope escape system\" that would propel the crew capsule away from a malfunctioning booster at any point from the launch pad on up, using an Aerojet Rocketdyne solid-fuel rocket motor embedded in the capsule.",
      "\"It will activate in a fraction of a second, it will light off and propel the capsule away from the booster to safety,\" Lai explained. \"Once it's far away, parachutes will deploy and we will execute a normal landing.\"",
      "The system is also designed to ensure a survivable landing even if two of the main parachutes fail to open and fully inflate.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/googles-digital-ad-network-illegal-monopoly-federal-judge/",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The ruling involving Google's online ad technology follows a similar case last year in which Google's search engine was declared a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Google has been branded an abusive monopolist by a federal judge for the second time in less than a year, this time for illegally exploiting some of its online marketing technology to boost the profits fueling an internet empire currently worth $1.8 trillion.",
      "The ruling issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia comes on the heels of a separate decision in August that concluded Google's namesake search engine has been illegally leveraging its dominance to stifle competition and innovation.",
      "After the U.S. Justice Department targeted Google's ubiquitous search engine during President Donald Trump's first administration, the same agency went after the company's lucrative digital advertising network in 2023 during President Joe Biden's ensuing administration in an attempt to undercut the power that Google has amassed since its inception in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called remedy hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Brinkema's 115-page decision centers on the marketing machine that Google has spent the past 17 years building around its search engine and other widely used products and services, including its Chrome browser, YouTube video site and digital maps.",
      "The system was largely built around a series of acquisitions that started with Google's $3.2 billion purchase of online ad specialist DoubleClick in 2008. U.S. regulators approved the deals at the time they were made before realizing that they had given the Mountain View, California, company a platform to manipulate the prices in an ecosystem that a wide range of websites depend on for revenue and provides a vital marketing connection to consumers.",
      "The Justice Department lawyers argued that Google built and maintained dominant market positions in a technology trifecta used by website publishers to sell ad space on their webpages, as well as the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of consumers, and the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions in fractions of a second to match buyer and seller.",
      "After evaluating the evidence presented during a lengthy trial that\u00a0concluded just before Thanksgiving last year,\u00a0Brinkema reached a decision that rejected the Justice Department's assertions that Google has been mistreating advertisers while concluding the company has been abusing its power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers forced to rely on its network for revenue.",
      "\"For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.\" Brinkema wrote. \"Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anticompetitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features.\"",
      "Despite that rebuke, Brinkema also concluded that Google didn't break the law when it snapped Doubleclick nor when it followed up that deal a few years later by buying another service, Admeld.",
      "The Justice Department \"failed to show that the DoubleClick and Admeld acquisitions were anticompetitive,\" Brinkema wrote. \"Although these acquisitions helped Google gain monopoly power in two adjacent ad tech markets, they are insufficient, when viewed in isolation, to prove that Google acquired or maintained this monopoly power through exclusionary practices.\"",
      "That finding may help Google fight off any attempt to force it to sell its advertising technology to stop its monopolistic behavior.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools,\" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \"Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\"",
      "Analysts such as Brian Pitz of BMO Markets had been predicting that Google would likely lose the case, helping to brace investors for the latest setback to the company and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose shares declined 1% in afternoon trading. Alphabet's stock has plunged by 20% so far this year.",
      "As it did in the search monopoly case, Google and its corporate parent Alphabet vehemently denied the Justice Department's allegations. Their lawyers argued the government largely based its case on an antiquated concept of a market that existed a decade ago while underestimating a highly competitive market for advertising spending that includes the likes of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Comcast.",
      "The market as drawn in the Justice Department's case didn't include ads that appear on mobile apps, streaming television services, or other platforms to which internet users have increasingly migrated, prompting Google lawyer Karen Dunn to compare the government's definition a \"time capsule with a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster video card\" during her opening statement\u00a0when the trial began last September.",
      "At trial, the Justice Department's lawyers emphasized the harm to news publishers that has arisen from Google's alleged dominance of the marketplace. Witnesses from Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, and News Corp., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, testified about the difficulties they have faced and what they said was a lack of alternatives to Google's ad tech. Those companies rely on online advertising to fund their news operations and make their articles free to consumers on the internet, government lawyers have argued.",
      "Now, government is in position to try to dismantle that byzantine ad system. When the case was filed more than two years ago during the Biden administration, the Justice Department asserted Google should be forced to sell, at a minimum, its Ad Manager product, which includes the technology used by website publishers and the ad exchange.",

      "Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday in a Washington, D.C., courtroom to defend his social media company from federal allegations that the technology giant is a monopoly.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is facing off with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, for Day one of a landmark antitrust trial that could result in the company's breakup. For Zuckerberg, the case could determine whether the business empire he started building while still a student at Harvard University will be forced to break apart.",
      "The trial will be the first big test of the FTC's willingness under President Trump to challenge Big Tech, a long-time target of Republicans. The lawsuit was initially filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Mr. Trump's first term, before being amended in 2021.",
      "In its\u00a0complaint, the FTC accuses Meta of \"anticompetitive conduct,\" alleging that the company's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp gives it excessive control of the social media market.",
      "\"There's nothing wrong with Meta innovating,\" said Daniel Matheson, lead attorney for the FTC in his opening statements for the agency Monday, \"It's what happened next that is a problem.\"",
      "During his testimony Monday, Zuckerberg defended his decision to buy Instagram and pushed back against FTC claims that he did not invest in developing the app.",
      "Purchased by Facebook in\u00a02012\u00a0and\u00a02014, respectively, Instagram and WhatsApp have grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "To restore competition, Meta must part ways with Instagram and WhatsApp, the government agency says in\u00a0court filings. The FTC also wants Meta to provide the government with prior notice for any future mergers and acquisitions.",
      "With the landmark trial underway, here's what you need to know.",
      "How long will the Meta trial last, and who will testify?",
      "The trial, which begins Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg will preside over the case, which could see a range of witnesses including Meta CEO and founder Zuckerberg; former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; former Meta Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer; Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom; and executives from rival social media platforms.",
      "What is happening in court today?",
      "The FTC and Meta made their opening arguments on Monday, with witness testimony expected to start in the afternoon.",
      "In his opening statement, lead FTC attorney Matheson said Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market.",
      "Meta said the company \"did nothing wrong\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta attorney Mark Hansen said in his opening statement that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech company's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove Meta is a monopoly.",
      "If Meta had monopoly power, it would exercise control over pricing in the social media space, Hansen said. But Meta's services are free, he noted. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when [Meta] has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said.",
      "After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. His\u00a0testimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012.",
      "Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop.",
      "Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app.",
      "According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads.",
      "In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",
      "\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"",
      "\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",
      "\"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The FTC did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "When did this case get started?",
      "The history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020 during President Trump's first term in office.",
      "In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly.",
      "But the federal judge later cleared the path for the case to proceed after the FTC introduced more evidence in an amended complaint, according to The Washington Post.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said Sunday that he can \"absolutely\" guarantee Trump administration deregulations won't have an adverse health impacts on people and the environment.",
      "\"We have to both protect the environment and grow the economy,\" Zeldin said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "As part of President Trump's pledge to unleash American energy, Zeldin announced in March that the EPA would reconsider rules across a number of sectors, including regulations on power plants, on mercury and air toxic standards that target coal-fired power plants and on wastewater regulations for the development of oil and gas. The Trump administration touted the 31 deregulatory actions as the \"most momentous day\" in EPA history.",
      "The decisions are the start of what's expected to be a yearslong effort to repeal or revise dozens of environmental rules, much to the dismay of climate experts and advocates.",
      "Zeldin, who formerly represented New York in the House, said at the time of the announcement that \"today the green new scam ends,\" while pledging that the EPA will do its part to \"usher in the golden age of American success.\"",
      "On Sunday, Zeldin told senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang on \"Face the Nation\" that the American people want the administration to \"make sure that we are applying common sense,\" arguing that regulation brought over the finish line during the Biden administration was too broad and targeted entire industries.",
      "\"When the American public went to vote last November, they were talking about economic concerns, about struggling to make ends meet,\" Zeldin added. \"What we've also heard are the costs of compliance, which amount into the trillions and what that does to the American economy as well.\"",
      "Zeldin said he doesn't prejudge outcomes, noting that there will be a process on the deregulatory actions that includes public comment, while encouraging Americans to \"weigh in when they have that opportunity.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chris-van-hollen-interview-kilmar-abrego-garcia-visit/",
    "published": "Sun, 20 Apr 2025 13:41:37 -0400",
    "summary": "Sen. Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week, where he met with Abrego Garcia after he said his attempts were repeatedly turned down by the Salvadoran government.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Sunday that El Salvador \"tried really hard\" to prevent him from seeing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, before the government reversed course late last week.",
      "\"I think they realized that that was not a good look at the end of the day,\" Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia is a 29-year-old Salvadoran national who lived in Maryland who was sent last month to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison as part of a White House effort, although the administration later admitted in court that Abrego Garcia was mistakenly among those deported. The case has come to the fore in recent weeks amid simmering tensions between the federal judiciary and the Trump administration's sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week, where he met with Abrego Garcia on Thursday after he said his attempts were repeatedly turned down by the Salvadoran government.",
      "Van Hollen noted that he held press conferences in El Salvador, where he made the point that the government was \"violating international law by not allowing anyone to reach him,\" adding that \"they realized that was a bad look.\"",
      "After Van Hollen was allowed to meet with Abrego Garcia, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele was the first to announce the meeting, writing in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was \"now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador,\" alongside photos that showed the two men sitting at a table with drinks that resemble margaritas. The president later wrote, \"I love chess.\"",
      "Van Hollen said of the Salvadoran government, \"they go to great lengths to deceive people,\" outlining how drinks were brought to the table as photos were taken during his meeting with Abrego Garcia, adding that \"no one touched them.\"",
      "\"The reality is, if you look at the photos when I first sat down and the ones at the end, you can see that that was all staged,\" Van Hollen said. \"They're trying to create the impression that, you know, this is a guy in paradise, when in fact he's been in one of the most notorious prisons in the world.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011 and was arrested in 2019. When he was released from immigration custody, an immigration judge granted him withholding of removal \u2014\u00a0 a legal status that forbids the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "Van Hollen said Sunday that Abrego Garcia has since been transferred from CECOT to a facility in Santa Ana. Trump administration officials have since acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "Still, a fierce legal battle has ensued around efforts to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. The administration was ordered earlier this month to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador, before the Supreme Court ruled that the judge's decision properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release, while the scope should be clarified. On Thursday, a federal appeals court rejected a request from the Trump administration to pause the district judge's order, writing that the government's assertions in the case should be \"shocking\" to all Americans.",
      "Meanwhile, the White House and Bukele have made clear that they don't intend to bring Abrego Garcia back, despite the orders, while Trump administration officials have repeatedly claimed that he is a member of the gang MS-13. Van Hollen stressed that the administration hasn't presented evidence to link Abrego Garcia to MS-13 or other terrorist activity, while urging officials to \"put up or shut up in court.\"",
      "\"Go to court, stop tweeting, and put up or shut up in front of the judges,\" Van Hollen added.",
      "The Maryland Democrat said he did not travel to El Salvador to litigate the details of Abrego Garcia's case, but rather \"to make sure that he was still alive and check on his health.\" But he argued that the case is also much bigger than one man.",
      "\"This is not a case about just one man whose constitutional rights are being ignored and disrespected, because when you trample on the constitutional rights of one man \u2014 as the courts have all said is happening in this case \u2014 you threaten the constitutional rights of every American,\" Van Hollen said.",

    "summary": "In a brief order, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in Texas' Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order from this court.\"",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday temporarily blocked the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law.",
      "In a brief order, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order from this court.\"",
      "The high court acted overnight following an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union, contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798. The Supreme Court had said earlier in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given \"a reasonable time\" to contest their pending removals.",
      "\"These men were in imminent danger of spending their lives in a horrific foreign prison without ever having had a chance to go to court,\" ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt told CBS News in a statement on Saturday. \"We are relieved that the Supreme Court has not permitted the administration to whisk them away the way others were just last month.\"",
      "Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. Alito wrote in his dissent, joined by Thomas, that \"the court hastily and prematurely granted unprecedented emergency relief.\" He argued that the high court's intervention was inappropriate because it was unclear that the court had jurisdiction and that there was \"little concrete support\" for the allegation that the migrants were in imminent danger of removal. He also noted that the Supreme Court heard only from the ACLU, and not the government, before acting.",
      "\"In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,\" Alito wrote.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on Saturday responded to the Supreme Court's order on X, claiming that the men being held were \"foreign terrorists.\"",
      "\"They were arrested in diligently planned and executed raids recently carried out by Departments of Justice and Homeland Security,\" Miller said.",
      "\"We are confident we will ultimately prevail against the onslaught of meritless litigation brought by radical activists who care more about the rights of these terrorist aliens than those of the American people,\" Leavitt wrote in a separate post.",
      "On Friday, two federal judges refused to step in as lawyers for the men launched a desperate legal campaign to prevent their deportation. Early Saturday, the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals refused to issue an order protecting the detainees from being deported.",
      "The administration is expected to return to the Supreme Court quickly in an effort to persuade the justices to lift their temporary order.",
      "The ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet facility and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "In an emergency filing early Friday, the ACLU said it heard from lawyers and relatives of some of the men held at the detention center in Ansen, Texas, that immigration authorities were accusing the men of being members of the Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang President Trump has made into a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration. The organization, citing lawyers and family members, said some of them had been given notices telling them they were slated to be deported under the wartime law.",
      "Citing the March 15 deportations of scores of migrants who were taken to El Salvador's notorious Center for the Confinement of Terrorism, or CECOT, mega-prison, the ACLU implored U.S. District Court Judge James Wesley Hendrix to act quickly.",
      "\"(G)iven the brutal nature of the Salvadoran prison where other Venezuelan men were sent under the (Alien Enemies Act) last month, the irreparable harm to them is manifest,\" the ACLU's emergency motion said.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act in March\u00a0to order officials to immediately detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua, arguing that they were invading or staging an incursion into the U.S.",
      "The act has only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended the AEA gave it the power to swiftly remove immigrants it identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status.",
      "Following the unanimous high court order on April 9, federal judges in\u00a0Colorado,\u00a0New York and southern Texas\u00a0promptly issued orders barring the removal of detainees under the AEA until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court.",
      "But there had been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is located 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state.",
      "Judge Hendrix, a Trump appointee, this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported. He also balked at issuing a broader order prohibiting the removal of all Venezuelans in the area under the act because he said removals hadn't started yet.",
      "But the ACLU's Friday filing included sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday.",
      "An attorney for the Legal Aid Society said her client refused to sign papers he was given by the detention facility staff because they were in English and he could not understand what they said.",
      "Gelernt said in a Friday evening hearing before District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, D.C., that the administration initially moved Venezuelans to its south Texas immigration facility for deportation. But since a judge banned deportations in that area, it has funneled them to the Bluebonnet facility, where no such order exists. He said witnesses reported the men were being loaded on buses Friday evening to be taken to the airport.",
      "With Hendrix not agreeing to the ACLU's request for an emergency order, the group turned to Boasberg, who initially halted deportations in March. The Supreme Court ruled the orders against deportation could only come from judges in jurisdictions where immigrants were held, which Boasberg said made him powerless on Friday.",
      "\"I'm sympathetic to everything you're saying,\" Boasberg told Gelernt. \"I just don't think I have the power to do anything about it.\"",
      "Boasberg this week found there's probable cause that the Trump administration committed\u00a0criminal contempt\u00a0by ignoring his order to turn around the planes carrying more than 200 Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador. He was concerned that the paper that ICE was giving those held did not make clear they had a right to challenge their removal in court, which he believed the Supreme Court mandated.",
      "Drew Ensign, an attorney for the Justice Department, disagreed, saying that people slated for deportation would have a \"minimum\" of 24 hours to challenge their removal in court. He said no flights were scheduled for Friday night and he was unaware of any Saturday, but the Department of Homeland Security said it reserved the right to remove people then.",
      "ICE said it would not comment on the litigation.",
      "Also Friday, a Massachusetts judge made permanent his temporary ban on the administration deporting immigrants who have exhausted their appeals to countries other than their home countries unless they are informed of their destination and given a chance to object if they'd face torture or death there.",
      "Some Venezuelans subject to Trump's Alien Enemies Act have been sent to El Salvador and housed in its\u00a0notorious\u00a0main prison.",

      "The quiet city of Medford, Oregon was shaken by Maggie Friar's desperate 911 call in the early morning hours of Oct. 2, 2017.",
      "MAGGIE FRIAR to 911: I don't know where my ex-husband or my oldest daughter is.",
      "911 OPERATOR: I understand that.",
      "MAGGIE FRIAR to 911: Something happened at the house. Something happened over there.",
      "Maggie Friar's ex-husband, Aaron Friar, and their 15-year-old daughter Ellen, nicknamed Ellie, were missing.",
      "MAGGIE FRIAR (to 911): My concern is for the both of them. We don't know where they are \u2026",
      "Maggie Friar: You can only imagine \u2026 all the things that were running around in my mind. I didn't know who was dead, and who was alive.",
      "When Medford Police Officer Logan Boyd arrived at Aaron Friar's house, he found a gruesome scene: blood spattered walls, shattered glass, and a trail of blood \u2014 to nowhere.",
      "OFFICER BOYD (bodycam/outside by the front door): It starts from there, kinda goes all the way out in the dirt.",
      "DETECTIVE: Goes out towards the carport.",
      "OFFICER BOYD: Yeah.",
      "DETECTIVE: That's not good.",
      "This led investigators to notice what also was missing: Aaron Friar's car \u2014 seen on a neighbor's security camera leaving the Friar home around 5:30 that morning.",
      "Officer Logan Boyd: We're kind of dealing with what I would describe as like a two-headed monster.",
      "A FATHER AND DAUGHTER DISAPPEAR",
      "An all-hands-on-deck call went out to every Medford Police detective, including to Det. Bill Ford.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: We didn't know at that particular time whether this was a missing person case or a kidnapping. \u2026 We just didn't know.",
      "Det. Shannon Reynolds, Ford's colleague and wife of 20 years, had a different take.",
      "Det. Shannon Reynolds: In my mind, I automatically assumed that the 15-year-old daughter was the victim \u2026 of a \u2026 homicide.",
      "Natalie Morales: So, a case like this \u2014 where did this one sort of fit in?",
      "Det. Shannon Reynolds: Probably one of the most interesting, heinous crimes I've seen in my career.",
      "Investigators hoped Ellie's younger sister, 11-year-old Sierra, might shed light on the unknown. Reynolds, who specializes in crimes against children, was tasked with interviewing her.",
      "Det. Shannon Reynolds: Sierra wasn't like outright crying, but you could tell, she was worried.",
      "Natalie Morales: Who was she worried about?",
      "Det. Shannon Reynolds: Her dad and Ellie.",
      "Sierra Friar: I try not to really think about that time a lot, but \u2026",
      "Sierra, 18 years old at the time of this exclusive interview, still finds it difficult to speak about the day her father and sister vanished.",
      "Sierra Friar: I was, you know, just a child and, um \u2014 I'm sorry. (cries)",
      "The second of three girls, Sierra says she loved being in the middle.",
      "Sierra Friar: I get to be an older sister and a younger sister, so I get like the best of both worlds. \u2026 I like the connection and the bonds that we have.",
      "Sierra says her older sister Ellie loved music and could play many instruments \u2014 a skill Ellie seemed to have picked up from their father.",
      "Sierra Friar: One time, he tried to teach me how to play the drums, but I wasn't very good at it, so. (smiles)",
      "In 2016, Sierra's parents, Maggie and Aaron Friar, ended their marriage. Sierra says the divorce took a toll on her and her sisters.",
      "Sierra Friar: It affected us a lot. It was actually not a very great experience for everyone involved.",
      "Sierra says that when her parents separated, her dad moved into that small two-bedroom house. Maggie and Aaron Friar shared custody, and the girls would stay with their dad every other weekend. In September 2017, Sierra decided to live with her dad full-time.",
      "Sierra Friar: I wanna be around him and fill my life with him.",
      "Then, around 5:30 a.m. on Oct. 2, 2017, the Friar family was forever broken. Sierra was asleep in the bedroom she shared with her younger sister.",
      "Sierra Friar: I woke up and it was just pitch black. \u2026 I remember waking up \u2026 \u00a0to \u2014 like a dinging noise over and over and over again \u2026 then I heard \u2026 glass shatter. \u2026 And I heard the fight that occurred.",
      "The sound was coming from the living room.",
      "Natalie Morales: So then what does she hear? Because she really is sort of an earwitness to all that happened.",
      "Det. Shannon Reynolds: Yes. Yes. \u2026 She heard her dad yell the f-word. \u2026 She heard dragging. She heard things being moved.",
      "Sierra Friar: After that, it was completely silent.",
      "Natalie Morales: Did she have any idea what was going on at the time?",
      "Det. Shannon Reynolds: No. \u2026 She was frightened enough to stay in her room until \u2026 she felt like it was OK to come out.",
      "When Sierra finally did come out, she found that horrific scene.",
      "Natalie Morales: Had to be so scary, though.",
      "Det. Shannon Reynolds: So scary.",
      "Sierra told Reynolds that before leaving her room, she had seen something out of her bedroom window.",
      "Shannon Reynolds: She \u2026 could see people walking back and forth.",
      "Sierra saw two young men outside of her dad's house \u2014 one was a person Sierra didn't know. The second was someone Sierra immediately recognized. It was Gavin MacFarlane.",
      "Sierra Friar: He was Ellen's boyfriend at the time. \u2026 This was her big love. \u2026 According to her, he was a great guy. But according to my parents, he was not a great guy.",
      "Det. Shannon Reynolds: Sierra insinuated this was a little bit of a forbidden love. Dad had forbade \u2026 Ellie from seeing Gavin.",
      "This was the break investigators had been hoping for.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: Once we have a name: Gavin MacFarlane. Now we got a picture. \u2026 Now we know who we're looking for.",
      "The search for Aaron and Ellie Friar \u2014 and now Gavin MacFarlane \u2014 was on.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: We probably had \u2026 70, 75 people out on the streets of Medford.",
      "Ellie and Aaron Friar's phones were found in the house. Investigators now began tracking MacFarlane's phone.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: We started getting cellphone tower hits up in the East Medford area.",
      "Patrol officers immediately headed in that direction.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: A patrol sergeant locates the car. \u2026 That was huge.",
      "As the officers approached Aaron Friar's vehicle, they realized that something wasn't right.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: We could see \u2026 there was blood on the outside of the bumper that had been dripping down \u2026 When this trunk is opened up \u2026 there is large amounts of blood. I mean it is soaked into the carpet.",
      "But no Aaron Friar \u2014 and no Ellie. But the car was still warm, so the police knew they were close.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: We had tons of people up there driving around, looking for them.",
      "And then, just an hour later, investigators couldn't believe who they found next.",
      "THE SEARCH FOR AARON FRIAR",
      "Then just four hours after that 911 call reporting her missing, Medford Police found Ellie Friar. She was alive, seemingly unharmed, and had been walking down a busy street with Gavin MacFarlane.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: They're walking down the sidewalk.",
      "Natalie Morales: In plain sight.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: Plain sight. \u2026 So, now we know Ellie is safe.",
      "Which made two things clear: Aaron Friar was the victim, and, based on all that blood in his car and at the house, time was quickly running out to find him.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: We had Aaron \u2026 out there, either seriously injured or deceased.",
      "Walking along with MacFarlane and Ellie, was someone investigators hadn't been looking for.",
      "OFFICER (bodycam): Do you have ID with your name on there?",
      "RUSSELL JONES: Uh, no. I don't \u2014 I hardly ever carry my ID around.",
      "OFFICER: OK.",
      "He turned out to be Russell Jones, a friend of \u00a0MacFarlane's.",
      "RUSSELL JONES (bodycam/in police car): I won't make it hard on you.",
      "OFFICER: (laughs) Alright.",
      "Jones had apparently made an impression on Sierra, says Reynolds. He matched the description of that second young man she saw at her father's house that morning.",
      "Natalie Morales: So, she got a really good \u2014",
      "Det. Shannon Reynolds: Yes.",
      "Natalie Morales: \u2014 look at this person.",
      "Det. Shannon Reynolds: Yes.",
      "Investigators now had a witness placing MacFarlane and Jones at the crime scene. Ford says he wasn't sure what to make of Ellie being found with them.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: That doesn't mean that Ellie is involved in something.",
      "But Ford says that she, MacFarlane, or Jones might hold the key to finding Aaron Friar.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: Ellie, Gavin, and Russell are separated, detained, and transported to the Medford Police Department for questioning.",
      "Det. Stephanie Jackson was tasked with getting Ellie Friar's account of the previous 24 hours.",
      "DET. STEPHANIE JACKSON (interrogation): So what have you been up to today?",
      "ELLIE FRIAR:\u00a0 I haven't been home and now I'm really concerned about what's been going on.",
      "DET. STEPHANIE JACKSON: Mm-hmm. Where were you?",
      "ELLIE FRIAR: Out.",
      "Ellie was saying everything had seemed normal when she left her father's house for a long walk.",
      "DET. STEPHANIE JACKSON (interrogation): And you were walking down the street, it sounds like today?",
      "ELLIE FRIAR: Mm-hmm.",
      "DET. STEPHANIE JACKSON: Who were you with?",
      "ELLIE FRIAR: I was with my friends.",
      "According to Ellie, she had run into those \"friends\"\u2014 MacFarlane and Jones\u2014only by chance not long before being spotted by police.",
      "DET. STEPHANIE JACKSON (interrogation): And so everybody's really concerned \u2026 because we actually don't know where your dad is right now.",
      "ELLIE FRIAR: That's really \u2026 disturbing to hear. \u2026 Maybe he was looking for me.",
      "DET. STEPHANIE JACKSON: We are very worried about your dad.",
      "ELLIE FRIAR: So am I.",
      "Ellie was saying she had no idea where her father was or what happened at the house.",
      "DET. STEPHANIE JACKSON (interrogation): So where did all the blood come from in your house?",
      "ELLIE FRIAR: I don't know.",
      "Around that time, Ford was preparing to interrogate the other two detainees. Strategically, he decided to let Gavin wait in a holding cell and began interviewing Russell.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: He's a talker \u2026 very, very talkative. \u2026 so I kind of knew \u2026 he would \u2026 have a hard time keeping his mouth shut.",
      "DET. BILL FORD (interrogation):\u00a0 Spin around in the chair there and face me, so I can talk to ya.",
      "RUSSELL JONES: Yeah, I have nothing to hide \u2026",
      "Jones was ready to talk. But he wanted something first: a cigarette.",
      "RUSSELL JONES (interrogation): I talk better when I have a cigarette.",
      "Ford took him outside.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: Just kind of smokin' and jokin' is what we call it.",
      "The camera didn't record audio, but Ford says Jones began telling him that he and MacFarlane had gone over to the Friar house early that morning.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: He told us that he was trying to help get Ellie out of a bad situation.",
      "That \"bad situation,\" according to Jones, was Aaron Friar.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: And the first thing that he tells us is, \"he's not a good person.\"",
      "Natalie Morales: Aaron Friar is not a good person?",
      "Det. Bill Ford: Correct.",
      "He didn't elaborate further about Aaron Friar, but Jones was claiming he and MacFarlane were only there to secretly move Ellie out.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: So, the next thing I tell him is \"look, Russell, we got detectives out there right now pulling video from every house, the alleys \u2026 So if this ain't the truth \u2026 you need to be truthful with me right now.\" And he looks me square in the eyes and he says, \"Well, 95% of it's the truth and \u2026 5% of it is a lie.\" So, I'm thinking automatically, what's the lie here?",
      "Ford decided it was time for a new tactic and tried appealing to Jones's conscience.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: I look at him and I'm like, \"You know, Russell, I don't want a child to find Aaron \u2026 out there somewhere, come across something like that.\" \u2026 I said, \"Can you take us to Aaron?\" \u2026 he didn't beat an eye. He's just like, \"Yeah, I'll take you to him.\"",
      "The veteran detective wasted no time.",
      "Det. Bill Ford (to Morales): We load Russell up. He's actually sitting in the seat that you're sitting in now.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: We got him handcuffed in front. \u2026 he's basically telling us, OK, turn right, turn left.",
      "They were ascending a rural mountain pass 20 miles outside town.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: And then all of a sudden Russell says \"Stop.\" \u2026 \"Stop right here.\"",
      "THREE SUSPECTS, THREE DIFFERENT STORIES",
      "DET. FORD (bodycam at the site where Aaron Friar's body was found): Where did you stop your car and back up?",
      "RUSSELL JONES: Uh \u2014 Probably right where that rock is.",
      "DET. FORD: Right here in this green tarp?",
      "Natalie Morales\u00a0(at the site where Aaron Friar's body was found): Do you see the body right away?",
      "Det. Bill Ford: You could see the tarp; you couldn't see any portion of the body.",
      "Detectives descended the wooded ravine and pulled back that tarp revealing that, just six hours after that 911 call, they had found Aaron Friar.",
      "Det. Ford: It was \u2026 obvious that he was deceased.",
      "Natalie Morales: When you found out your husband was dead, what did you think?",
      "Maggie Friar: Uh \u2026 I was completely shocked; I didn't know what to think.",
      "Maggie Friar says the police hadn't yet told her Ellie was in their custody being questioned \u2014 or even that she had been found.",
      "Maggie Friar: I was very worried about the fate of my daughter. \u2026 I had no idea if my daughter was even alive, too.",
      "Maggie Friar then faced the unimaginable task of sharing the news of Aaron's death with their two younger daughters. The reality was almost too much for then-11-year-old Sierra.",
      "Sierra Friar: I just really didn't wanna believe it for a really long time.",
      "While investigators began processing the scene, Ford drove Russell Jones back to police headquarters. He says Jones was claiming that all he had done was help dispose of Aaron Friar's remains.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: He's like \u2026 I'm not gonna be a witness against Gavin.",
      "Russell was saying Gavin MacFarlane was Aaron Friar's killer, but that MacFarlane had been provoked.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: His story was \u2026 that Aaron had a rifle and was pointing it at Gavin.",
      "Natalie Morales: So making it seem like a self-defense \u2026 because of \u2014 he had a gun pointed at him.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: Exactly.",
      "Back at the station, Ford returned Jones to the interrogation room, while detectives gathered for a briefing.",
      "That's when Russell began taunting them through the camera.",
      "RUSSELL JONES (alone in interrogation room): you're listening in on my conversations, aren't you?",
      "RUSSELL JONES (alone in interrogation room): I can still twist your little mind. Don't piss me off.",
      "Natalie Morales: This, I imagine, got everybody to stop what they were doing and gather around the monitor \u2014",
      "Bill Ford: Yeah.",
      "Natalie Morales: \u2014 and watch this.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: Yeah. That's what you do.",
      "RUSSELL JONES (alone in interrogation room): So we can play it the easy way or the hard way.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: He would go into these rants and \u2026 making demands and stuff.",
      "RUSSELL JONES (alone in interrogation room): Gavin and Ellie are to be released to me.",
      "And Jones was claiming he still hadn't been totally truthful.",
      "RUSSELL JONES\u00a0 (alone in interrogation room): And Mr. Ford, you want the whole story? 'Cause I did miss a few parts.",
      "For her part, Ellie was now saying Jones was the one responsible.",
      "ELLIE FRIAR (interrogation): I believe that Russell's the one that killed my father.",
      "With the conflicting claims, Ford decided it was finally time to interview MacFarlane.",
      "GAVIN MACFARLANE (interrogation): I know I'm in serious trouble, aren't I?",
      "DET. BILL FORD: Well, we need to figure out what happened.",
      "MacFarlane started by saying how volatile Aaron Friar could be.",
      "GAVIN MACFARLANE (interrogation): He's threatened my life \u2026 He's like, no, stay away from my daughter. \u2026 I'm gonna kill you.",
      "One month earlier, MacFarlane had called the police claiming Aaron Friar had shown up at his house, banging on his door, threatening to kill him.",
      "GAVIN MACFARLANE (interrogation): I don't know what caused him to not like me anymore.",
      "Detectives discovered at least one reason: MacFarlane's age. He was 19 years old, dating 15-year-old Ellie. And making things worse, MacFarlane was now claiming Ellie was going to have his baby.",
      "DETECTIVE: She told you she was pregnant?",
      "GAVIN MACFARLANE (interrogation): I've known for about two weeks now.",
      "While MacFarlane was admitting to having a sexual relationship with a minor \u2014 itself a crime \u2014 he was accusing Aaron Friar of being the one who had been abusive to Ellie.",
      "GAVIN MACFARLANE (interrogation): The anger had just been building up 'cause of the things that Ellie had been telling me.",
      "DET. BILL FORD: Mm-hmm.",
      "GAVIN MACFARLANE: I was just trying to protect Ellie.",
      "DET. BILL FORD: OK.",
      "GAVIN MACFARLANE: And my possible child.",
      "MacFarlane was claiming he and Jones had gone to the house that morning, but unlike what Jones said \u2014 that Aaron Friar had not confronted him with a gun. Instead, MacFarlane was saying Aaron Friar had been in the living room asleep on the couch and that MacFarlane had crept in armed with a baseball bat. Then, MacFarlane made a startling admission.",
      "GAVIN MACFARLANE (interrogation): \u00a0I just acted on instinct.",
      "DET. BILL FORD: OK. Tell us what happened.",
      "GAVIN MACFARLANE: I just swung the bat downwards. It was dark, I couldn't see.",
      "DET. BILL FORD: How many times do you think you hit him?",
      "GAVIN MACFARLANE: Like five or six maybe.",
      "DET. BILL FORD: Five or six times?",
      "GAVIN MACFARLANE: Yeah.",
      "The physical evidence would back up MacFarlane's story. Aaron Friar had died from blunt force trauma to his head, and a bloodied baseball bat was recovered from a tree branch above where his remains had been found.",
      "Testing would confirm the blood was Aaron Friar's.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: And he demonstrated for us in the interview room. \u2026 how hard he swung it down on \u2026 Aaron's head.",
      "GAVIN MACFARLANE (demonstrating during interrogation): I went over the shoulder the first time. And then I started going up above my head.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: I mean, there were five distinct blows to his head.",

      "Det. Bill Ford:\u00a0 It fractured his skull. Caved his skull into his brain.",
      "GAVIN MACFARLANE (interrogation): \u00a0I'm \u2014 I'm really sorry. (crying)",
      "And investigators soon found evidence that Aaron's murder had been meticulously plotted for weeks. They discovered notes \u2014 some in Russell's handwriting \u2014 at Gavin's house.",
      "Det. Bill Ford: We found \u2026 several murder plans. \u2026 And they actually had plan A, plan B, there were multiple plans. And I think ultimately, they come up with the bat.",
      "Natalie Morales: And based on what you could see from the planning \u2026 who's the mastermind of all of this?",
      "Det. Bill Ford: Ellie, believe it or not.",
      "Ford says he believes it was Ellie who wanted Aaron Friar murdered, pointing to messages Ford says she sent to MacFarlane. In one she says, \"We need to make sure he's dead by the time we leave his house.\" And in another, she asked \"You want to kill him now dont you\"\u2026 and then \"\u2026You can kill him in less than a min, right?\"",
      "Det. Bill Ford: She's pushing it all. \u2026 She wants to be with Gavin. \u2026 She wants to be out from underneath the authority of her father.",
      "GAVIN MACFARLANE (interrogation): Ellie wanted me to kill him, but I didn't want to.",
      "Ford says Ellie might have made up those abuse allegations possibly as a way to motivate MacFarlane to kill her father.",

Some people can land and go out and eat pizza and dance. When I land, it takes me about 24 hours to feel like I'm a human being again.\"",
      "With the on-time landing, mission duration stood at 220 days and nearly nine hours, spanning 3,520 orbits and 93.3 million miles since launch last Sept. 11 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Ovchinin has now logged 595 days in space over four flights, followed closely by Pettit, whose total stands at 590 days over four flights of his own. Vagner's total after two station visits stands at 416 days.",
      "The world record for most cumulative time in space is held by cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who spent nearly 1,111 days in orbit over five missions. The U.S. record is held by astronaut Peggy Whitson. She spent 675 days in space over four flights.",
      "As for Pettit's age, John Glenn, the first American in orbit, was 77 when he flew aboard the space shuttle in 1998 as a NASA spaceflight participant. He holds the record as the oldest person to fly in orbit.",
      "The Soyuz crew's return to Earth marked the final chapter in an extended crew rotation that began with launch of SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov on March 14.",
      "Crew 10's arrival at the station cleared the way for Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams to return to Earth four days later.",
      "The Russians then launched replacements for Pettit's crew\u00a0\u2014 Soyuz commander Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim \u2014 on April 8, clearing the way for Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit to return to Earth Saturday.",
      "In a brief ceremony Friday, Ovchinin turned command of the station over to Onishi.",
      "\"It's a great honor for me to accept the command of the ISS,\" Onishi said. \"I feel so special that I am taking over the command from you because it's been almost nine years since we met here in 2016 during Expedition 48. At that time, both of us were rookies and here we are two veterans who are ISS commanders.\"",
      "\"Human space flight is not easy. Only continuous dedication from generation to generation made it possible for human beings to get here. Now today, we have four rookies (on board). I'm sure one day they will come back and become commanders ... that's how we will continue to develop human space flight,\" Onishi said.",
      "The ISS has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since Nov. 2, 2000. Scheduled for retirement in five years, the lab is facing problems on multiple fronts, ranging from air leaks in the Russian segment to uncertain funding, spare parts shortages and resupply delays.",
      "\"Spaceflight is difficult and very risky,\" Rich Williams, a member of NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, told the group in a public meeting Thursday. \"The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence.\"",
      "\"The ISS management, crew and support personnel always make spaceflight look easy. Spaceflight is anything but easy, and the increasing risks attending the ISS program are making it harder,\" Williams said.",
      "The air leaks in the Zvezda module's aft docking compartment are presumably the results of metal fatigue and repeated pressure cycles as visiting Soyuz crew ships and Progress cargo freighters come and go.",
      "\"Primary risk mitigation activities at this point include application and patching materials to known cracks and limiting ... pressurization cycles to try to limit stress and fatigue,\" Williams said. \"The ISS program is monitoring this closely, and the panel considers this one of our highest concerns.\"",
      "NASA has hired SpaceX to build a U.S. deorbit vehicle, or USDV, to drive the million-pound space station back into the atmosphere in 2030 to ensure it breaks up over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from shipping lanes and populated areas. The USDV is expected to arrive at the lab in 2029.",
      "\"Delivering and utilizing this USDV capability is critical to ensuring that the deorbit debris risk meets the established government public safety standards,\" Williams said. \"If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude.\"",
      "He said NASA and Russian space officials are working \"to address the challenges associated with achieving a safe deorbit capability, both for end-of-life as well as a risk-managed deorbit for contingencies.\"",
      "The major problem facing the ISS is what Williams called \"a large ISS budget shortfall.\" NASA's fiscal 2024 budget included nearly $1 billion for station operations and maintenance with another $1.6 billion earmarked for crew launches and resupply missions.",
      "\"It is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle has safely re-entered, not only to assure safety of day-to-day operations in a high-risk environment, but also to ensure controlled, safe deorbit within debris footprint requirements for the sake of public safety,\" Williams said.",
      "In summary, he said, \"the panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risks attending the program over the next several years.\"",

      "Chabba is survived by his wife and two children.",
      "\"Tiru Chabba's family is going through the unimaginable now,\" Sellers said in a statement. \"Instead of hiding Easter eggs and visiting with friends and family, they're living a nightmare where this loving father and devoted husband was stolen from them in an act of senseless and preventable violence.\"",
      "\"We ask you to keep his family in your thoughts and prayers as we fight to ensure they see justice that honors the memories of Mr. Chabba and all the victims of Thursday's shooting.\"",

      "A judge says a former roommate of four University of Idaho students who were killed in 2022 can testify about seeing an intruder with \"bushy eyebrows\" around the time of the crime.",
      "Defense attorneys for Bryan Kohberger had asked 4th District Judge Steven Hippler during a hearing earlier this month to bar any evidence referencing \"bushy eyebrows,\" because they say the roommate's description is unreliable and irrelevant to the case.",

      "When asked to enter a plea to the charges, Kohberger stood silent, prompting the judge to enter a not guilty plea on his behalf.",
      "The roommate told police she saw someone wearing black clothing and a ski mask inside the home she shared with four roommates sometime before 4:19 a.m. on the day of the killings, according to court documents.",
      "She was intoxicated at the time, and told police she couldn't remember any other facial characteristics but that the intruder's bushy eyebrows stood out in her memory.",
      "Kohberger's defense attorneys noted that the roommate also constantly questioned what she saw, that her attention was influenced by sleepiness and alcohol, and that her opportunity to see the intruder was seconds at most.",
      "Allowing her to testify about bushy eyebrows when she couldn't provide enough details to allow a police artist to do a composite sketch would be unfair and prejudicial, causing a jury to believe Kohberger is guilty because of his eyebrows, his attorneys said.",
      "But the judge disagreed.",
      "\"There is a large gulf between a finding that a witness is not competent to testify about what they personally witnessed, and simply allowing impeachment by vigorous cross-examination,\" Hippler wrote. \"This is a matter for cross-examination.\"",
      "Hippler also said that if Kohberger is convicted, his defense team can't use his medical diagnoses to explain his \"courtroom demeanor\" unless Kohberger takes the stand during the penalty phase.",
      "Prosecutors had asked the judge to bar any testimony during the penalty phase about Kohberger's autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as the developmental coordination disorder that Kohberger may have experienced in childhood.",
      "The prosecution team said they didn't want mental conditions to be used to try to limit Kohberger's culpability if he is convicted.",
      "But the defense team said they didn't plan on doing that at all, and that instead his autism spectrum diagnosis would be used to explain some of Kohberger's courtroom demeanor, like his tendency to hold eye contact for longer than expected, his ability to sit very still and his stoicism.",
      "The judge said he hadn't noticed any strange behavior.",
      "\"Not once has the Court perceived Defendant to be acting in an odd or incongruent manner or otherwise demonstrating signs at counsel table that would warrant any explanation to the jury. His demeanor has been entirely appropriate,\" Hippler wrote.",
      "Introducing evidence about the autism spectrum diagnosis would likely confuse the jury and take up an undue amount of time in an already long trial, he said.",
      "Still, the judge said, Kohberger's demeanor might become relevant if he takes the stand to testify. Kohberger's OCD diagnosis also might be relevant at some point, Hippler said, particularly since the defense team has said it causes Kohberger to experience sleep difficulties that led to a habit of nighttime driving and running to decompress.",
      "If those scenarios arise during the trial, the judge said the attorneys should bring up the matter to him \u2014 outside the presence of the jury \u2014 so he can make a decision on whether the evidence should be introduced at that time.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday started releasing the first tranche of records on Democratic Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 assassination, with roughly 10,000 pages of previously classified records.",
      "The disclosure \u2014 ordered by President Trump within days of taking office and backed by the senator's son, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 could reignite speculation about the decades-old killing, as the younger Kennedy insists his father's convicted assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, might be innocent.",
      "A CBS News review found the documents include scans of handwritten notes by convicted assassin Sirhan, witness interviews, crime scene and autopsy photos, FBI memos related to Sirhan and his whereabouts before the shooting, correspondence to the government from the American public in reaction to the assassination, and interviews with Sirhan's family.",
      "Many of the details shared in the files were already known.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the release, which began Friday, comes after an effort done in conjunction with the National Archives and other agency officials to scan and upload more than 10,000 pages, which will be available for the American people to view online \"to fulfill President Trump's maximum transparency promise.\"",
      "The records will be published with limited redactions for privacy reasons, such as to shield Social Security numbers, she said.",
      "Gabbard said that an additional 50,000 pages of files related to Robert F. Kennedy's killing were discovered during searches of CIA and FBI warehouses for documents that had not been turned over to the Archives. Agencies are working to make those documents available and will continue searching government facilities for more, according to the director of national intelligence.",
      "What did the RFK files say?",

Kennedy's assassination and clippings from news reports. Some scanned records are difficult to read, as are handwritten notes included in the tranche.",

Kennedy have been publicly known for decades and were referenced at his trial.",
      "Also in the files: A 1968 FBI memo that offered an assessment of Sirhan, including that he fell from a horse and sustained a head injury in 1966, and family members said his behavior changed markedly afterward.",

Kennedy's widow Ethel Kennedy's \"distraught\" reactions to the shooting, with one ambulance worker recounting she told him, \"keep your hands off him,\" and another witness saying she knocked over a TV news camera and hit a reporter in the chest at the hospital.",
      "Some of the documents detail eyewitness interviews about both Sirhan and the shooting. A few of those records touch on longstanding conspiracy theories about the assassination. There are references to witnesses seeing a woman in a polka-dot dress or somebody shouting \"we shot him,\" which often features in theories about the shooting, though other witnesses say they didn't spot anybody matching that description.",
      "What could the new RFK files reveal?",
      "It's unclear what new information on the 1968 slaying could emerge from the disclosures, several experts told CBS News before the documents were released. Robert F. Kennedy's killing was primarily investigated and prosecuted by local officials in Los Angeles, and files from that investigation \u2014 along with many records from a parallel FBI probe \u2014 have been publicly available in California's state archives for decades with few omissions. It's not clear if other federal agencies hold records tied to the assassination.",
      "The administration has also vowed to release files on Rev. Martin Luther King's 1968 assassination, and it published troves of declassified files on President John F. Kennedy's 1963 killing in March.",
      "Why did Trump release RFK files \u2014 and is RFK Jr. involved?",
      "Mr. Trump ordered his administration to unseal records on King, John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy in late January. In an April 10 cabinet meeting, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the King and Robert F. Kennedy files would be ready within days, including what she described as decades-old documents that \"have never been scanned or seen before.\"",
      "\"Nearly 60 years after the tragic assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, the American people will, for the first time, have the opportunity to review the federal government's investigation thanks to the leadership of President Trump,\" Gabbard said in a statement. \"My team is honored that the President entrusted us to lead the declassification efforts and to shine a long-overdue light on the truth. I extend my deepest thanks for Bobby Kennedy and his families' support.\"",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he's \"very grateful\" for the release.",
      "The health secretary \u2014 who was 14 years old when his father was assassinated \u2014 has shown an interest in the case for years, doubting the conclusion that Sirhan was responsible for his father's killing. Breaking with many of his siblings, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. backed Sirhan's 2021 request for parole after meeting with Sirhan in prison.",
      "Who killed RFK?",
      "Sirhan was arrested shortly after the 1968 assassination, which took place at the Ambassador Hotel while Robert F. Kennedy was running for president, and convicted of murder. He has admitted to killing the senator and linked it to Robert F. Kennedy's backing of Israel, though at other points, he has denied responsibility or said he couldn't remember the incident.",
      "Sirhan's requests for parole have been repeatedly rejected. California's parole board backed his 2021 bid for early release, but California Gov. Gavin Newsom overrode their decision.",
      "Still, the case has drawn waves of public attention, as some critics \u2014 including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 claim Sirhan didn't fire the fatal shots or other parties were involved in the killing. Skeptics typically cite issues with eyewitness testimony or the alleged presence of extra bullets at the crime scene \u2014 though other researchers have backed the view that Sirhan acted alone.",

    "summary": "Trump administration economist Kevin Hassett said Powell's removal is being studied by the president and his team.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump and his team are studying whether firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is an option, according to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett.",
      "Though appointed by the president and approved by Congress, the Federal Reserve chair is an independent\u00a0role. Powell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017 and was renominated to serve another 4-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "\"The President and his team will continue to study that matter,\" Hassett said when asked during a press gaggle on Friday if removing Powell from his post was likely.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday took aim at Powell\u00a0in a social media post, writing that the Fed should be cutting interest rates, and adding that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\"",
      "In a speech delivered on Wednesday, Powell\u00a0warned\u00a0that the Trump administration's trade war could result in a combination of higher inflation and slower growth. That economic mix describes stagflation \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that characterizes periods when economic growth falters while price hikes accelerate.",
      "On Wednesday, Powell also reiterated that the central bank plans to hold interest rates steady for now, also sparking pushback from Mr. Trump.",
      "\"He's too late. Always too late. A little slow and I'm not happy with him. I let him know it and \u2014 if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday at the White House.",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "A landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 1935 affirmed Congress' authority to create independent federal agencies whose board members could only be forced out before their terms expired \"for cause.\"",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he\u00a0wouldn't step down\u00a0if asked by the president, who has previously criticized his performance. Powell has also noted that presidents may not legally fire or demote the Fed chair.",
      "But Mr. Trump this week fired two Democrats on the board of another financial regulator, the National Credit Union Administration, reported Reuters on Wednesday. And in March, the White House dismissed two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, which historically has operated as an independent, bipartisan commission.",
      "Even if Mr. Trump were able to remove Powell, it's not clear that doing so would change the direction of the central bank's decisions on interest rates. Those calls are made by the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC \u2014 a 12-member group tasked with setting monetary policy \u2014 and not at Powell's discretion.",
      "Who would replace Powell?",
      "Fed governor Kevin Warsh, 55, is a former Morgan Stanley executive who was nominated to the Fed's board of governors by President George W. Bush.",
      "Mr. Trump is considering selecting Warsh as Powell's replacement, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0on Thursday. However, Warsh has advised Mr. Trump to allow Powell to remain through the end of his term, the publication added.",
      "Widely respected, Warsh is considered to be even more hawkish \u2014 or willing to allow interest rates to remain high to control inflation \u2014 than Powell, according to a January blog post\u00a0by Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff.",

    "summary": "The meeting came after Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met Saturday with the Vatican's No. 2 official amid tensions for the Trump administration's crackdown on migrants.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance met with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Easter Sunday, a spokesperson for the vice president said, in a rare meeting after the two men have\u00a0tangled sharply over immigration\u00a0and the Trump administration's plans to deport migrants en masse.",
      "Francis has made caring for migrants a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative U.S. Catholic Church.",
      "Francis also changed church teaching to say that capital punishment is inadmissible in all cases.",
      "Meanwhile, Vance had defended the administration's America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin as \"ordo amoris.\" He has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care \u2014 to family first, followed by neighbor, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere.",
      "In a Feb. 10 letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance's understanding of the concept.",
      "\"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups,\" he wrote. \"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan,' that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"",
      "Vance has\u00a0acknowledged Francis' criticism\u00a0but has said he would continue to defend his views. During a Feb. 28 appearance at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Vance didn't address the issue specifically but called himself a \"baby Catholic\" and acknowledged there are \"things about the faith that I don't know.\"",
      "Vance was spending Easter weekend in Rome with his family and attended Good Friday services in St. Peter's Basilica after meeting with\u00a0Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni.\u00a0On Saturday, the Vances got a private tour of the Sistine Chapel, and the vice president met with the Vatican's No. 2 official.",
      "The Holy See reaffirmed good relations with Vance after the Saturday meeting, but noted \"an exchange of opinions\" over current international conflicts, migrants and prisoners.",
      "The Vatican stated that Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met with the secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and the foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Gallagher.",
      "The Holy See has responded cautiously to the Trump administration, keeping with its tradition of diplomatic neutrality, expressing alarm over the administration's crackdown on migrants and cuts in international aid.",
      "Those concerns were reflected in the Vatican's statement on Saturday, which said the talks were cordial and that it expressed satisfaction with the administration's commitment to protecting freedom of religion and conscience.",
      "\"There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,\" the statement said. \"Finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the State and the Catholic Church in the United States, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged.\"",
      "The reference to \"serene collaboration\" appeared to refer to Vance's accusation that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was\u00a0resettling \"illegal immigrants\"\u00a0to get federal funding. Top U.S. cardinals have pushed back strongly against the claim.",
      "\"It is clear that the approach of the current U.S. administration is very different from what we are used to and, especially in the West, from what we have relied on for many years,\" Parolin told La Repubblica daily on the eve of Vance's visit.",
      "The vice president's office confirmed the meeting between Vance and Parolin, saying they \"discussed their shared religious faith, Catholicism in the United States, the plight of persecuted Christian communities around the world, and President Trump's commitment to restoring world peace.\"",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a temporary \"Easter truce\" in the three-year conflict in Ukraine that will last until midnight Sunday.",
      "\"On humanitarian grounds, today from 6 p.m. to midnight from Sunday to Monday, the Russian side announces an Easter truce,\" Putin said in a televised statement released by the Kremlin. The statement has been translated. \"For this period, I order to stop all fighting. We assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example. At the same time, our troops should be prepared to reflect possible violations of the truce and provocations by the enemy, any aggressive actions.\"",
      "Putin first announced the ceasefire in a meeting with Chief of the General Staff Velary Gerasimov, the Kremlin Press Service said.",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said in a translated statement that the ceasefire is imposed \"for humanitarian purposes and will be observed by the Russian Unified Group of Troops (forces) provided that it is mutually respected by the Kiev regime.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said if Russia is genuinely ready to observe a full and unconditional ceasefire, Ukraine will mirror that approach and strike only in defense.",
      "He said such a gesture, particularly over the Easter weekend, could reveal Moscow's true intentions.",
      "\"If a full ceasefire truly takes hold, Ukraine proposes extending it beyond Easter Day on April 20,\" Zelenskyy said on Telegram. \"That will reveal Russia's true intentions, as 30 hours are enough for headlines, but not for genuine confidence-building measures.\"",
      "Zelenskyy added that, according to military reports, Russian assaults and artillery fire continued along parts of the 600-mile-long front line.",
      "In response to the ceasefire announcement, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Kyiv had in March \"agreed unconditionally to the U.S. proposal of a full interim ceasefire for 30 days,\" which Russia rejected.",
      "\"Putin has now made statements about his alleged readiness for a ceasefire. 30 hours instead of 30 days,\" Sybiha continued, writing on X. \"Unfortunately, we have had a long history of his statements not matching his actions.\"",
      "Previous attempts at holding ceasefires for Easter in April 2022 and Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 were not implemented after both sides failed to agree on them. Ukraine last month agreed to President Trump's proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire, only for Putin to reject it.",
      "Russia and Ukraine conduct prisoner exchange",
      "Also Saturday, Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner swap that was mediated by the United Arab Emirates, Russian state news agency TASS reported.",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense said 246 Russian service members were returned from territory controlled by Kyiv, and that as a \"gesture of goodwill,\" 31 wounded Ukrainian prisoners of war were transferred in exchange for 15 wounded Russian soldiers in need of urgent medical care.",
      "Zelenskyy said 277 Ukrainian \"warriors have returned home from Russian captivity.\" He thanked the United Arab Emirates for mediating the exchange.",
      "It was the largest exchange since Russia invaded Ukraine over three years ago.",
      "Announcement follows frustration from Trump administration",
      "The announcement came the day after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said President Trump's administration was ready to \"move on\" from peace talks between Russia and Ukraine if progress was not made in the coming days. Rubio made the comments in Paris, after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials.",
      "\"We are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,\" Rubio told reporters while departing Paris. \"Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on.\"",
      "\"It's not our war,\" Rubio added. \"We have other priorities to focus on.\" He said the U.S. administration wants to decide \"in a matter of days.\" Another meeting is expected next week in London.",
      "Later Friday, Mr. Trump echoed Rubio's frustrations with the pace of the talks. When asked about Rubio's comments on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that \"fairly complex\" negotiations were ongoing between the U.S. and Russia, though he said no direct talks between Mr. Trump and Putin were scheduled for the coming days.",
      "Fighting before ceasefire",
      "Earlier Saturday, Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces pushed Ukrainian forces from one of their last remaining footholds in Russia's Kursk region. Russian forces took control of the village of Oleshnya, on the border with Ukraine, the ministry said. Gerasimov said Russian troops had retaken 99% of the territory seized by Ukraine.",
      "\"In the areas of the Kursk region where Ukraine armed force mounted an incursion, the main part of the territory... is now liberated. That's 1,260 square kilometres, 99.5 percent,\" Gerasimov told Putin.",
      "The Associated Press was unable to immediately verify the claim. In the same statement where he reacted to the ceasefire, Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian forces \"continued their activity\" and are \"maintaining their positions\" in the Kursk region. He also said that military forces \"advanced and increased our zone of control\" in Belgorod, a Russian city about 24 miles from the Russia-Ukraine border.",
      "According to TASS, Russia is still fighting to push Ukrainian forces out of the village of Gornal, some 7 miles south of Oleshnya.",
      "\"The Russian military has yet to push the Ukrainian armed forces out of Gornal ... in order to completely liberate the Kursk region. Fierce fighting is underway in the settlement,\" the agency reported, citing Russian security agencies.",

      "Pettit, Soyuz MS-26/72S commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Ivan Vagner undocked from the Russian Rassvet module at 5:57 p.m. EDT, setting up a parachute-assisted landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan near the town of Dzhezkazgan at 9:20 p.m. EDT \u2014 6:20 a.m. local time Sunday, Pettit's birthday, at the landing site.",
      "Russian recovery crews and NASA personnel rushed to the spacecraft, opened the top hatch and helped carry the returning crew members to nearby recliners where flight surgeons carried out initial health checks.",
      "Ovchinin and Vagner appeared to be in good spirits, smiling, chatting with support crews and enjoying drinks and snacks. Pettit, however, looked disoriented as he was carried from the descent module, letting his head fall back and closing his eyes as he was moved to his recliner. He was not seen again on the landing site video.",
      "But there were no indications of any sort of major problem, medical or otherwise. From Kazakhstan, Ovchinin and Vagner will head back to Star City near Moscow, while Pettit will be flown to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for more detailed tests and the start of physical re-habilitation.",
      "In an April 16 interview with KOIN-TV in Portland, Oregon, Pettit said he had more difficulty than most when returning to gravity after a long stay in space.",
      "\"The very first thing I'm going to do when I get to Earth will probably be to empty the contents of my stomach,\" he said, prompting laughter. \"It's a physiological thing, it affects different people different ways. Some people can land and go out and eat pizza and dance. When I land, it takes me about 24 hours to feel like I'm a human being again.\"",
      "With the on-time landing, mission duration stood at 220 days and nearly nine hours, spanning 3,520 orbits and 93.3 million miles since launch last Sept. 11 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Ovchinin has now logged 595 days in space over four flights, followed closely by Pettit, whose total stands at 590 days over four flights of his own. Vagner's total after two station visits stands at 416 days.",
      "The world record for most cumulative time in space is held by cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who spent nearly 1,111 days in orbit over five missions. The U.S. record is held by astronaut Peggy Whitson. She spent 675 days in space over four flights.",
      "As for Pettit's age, John Glenn, the first American in orbit, was 77 when he flew aboard the space shuttle in 1998 as a NASA spaceflight participant. He holds the record as the oldest person to fly in orbit.",
      "The Soyuz crew's return to Earth marked the final chapter in an extended crew rotation that began with launch of SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov on March 14.",
      "Crew 10's arrival at the station cleared the way for Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams to return to Earth four days later.",

      "In a brief ceremony Friday, Ovchinin turned command of the station over to Onishi.",
      "\"It's a great honor for me to accept the command of the ISS,\" Onishi said. \"I feel so special that I am taking over the command from you because it's been almost nine years since we met here in 2016 during Expedition 48. At that time, both of us were rookies and here we are two veterans who are ISS commanders.\"",
      "\"Human space flight is not easy. Only continuous dedication from generation to generation made it possible for human beings to get here. Now today, we have four rookies (on board). I'm sure one day they will come back and become commanders ... that's how we will continue to develop human space flight,\" Onishi said.",
      "The ISS has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since Nov. 2, 2000. Scheduled for retirement in five years, the lab is facing problems on multiple fronts, ranging from air leaks in the Russian segment to uncertain funding, spare parts shortages and resupply delays.",
      "\"Spaceflight is difficult and very risky,\" Rich Williams, a member of NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, told the group in a public meeting Thursday. \"The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence.\"",
      "\"The ISS management, crew and support personnel always make spaceflight look easy. Spaceflight is anything but easy, and the increasing risks attending the ISS program are making it harder,\" Williams said.",
      "The air leaks in the Zvezda module's aft docking compartment are presumably the results of metal fatigue and repeated pressure cycles as visiting Soyuz crew ships and Progress cargo freighters come and go.",
      "\"Primary risk mitigation activities at this point include application and patching materials to known cracks and limiting ... pressurization cycles to try to limit stress and fatigue,\" Williams said. \"The ISS program is monitoring this closely, and the panel considers this one of our highest concerns.\"",
      "NASA has hired SpaceX to build a U.S. deorbit vehicle, or USDV, to drive the million-pound space station back into the atmosphere in 2030 to ensure it breaks up over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from shipping lanes and populated areas. The USDV is expected to arrive at the lab in 2029.",
      "\"Delivering and utilizing this USDV capability is critical to ensuring that the deorbit debris risk meets the established government public safety standards,\" Williams said. \"If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude.\"",
      "He said NASA and Russian space officials are working \"to address the challenges associated with achieving a safe deorbit capability, both for end-of-life as well as a risk-managed deorbit for contingencies.\"",
      "The major problem facing the ISS is what Williams called \"a large ISS budget shortfall.\" NASA's fiscal 2024 budget included nearly $1 billion for station operations and maintenance with another $1.6 billion earmarked for crew launches and resupply missions.",
      "\"It is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle has safely re-entered, not only to assure safety of day-to-day operations in a high-risk environment, but also to ensure controlled, safe deorbit within debris footprint requirements for the sake of public safety,\" Williams said.",
      "In summary, he said, \"the panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risks attending the program over the next several years.\"",

      "Oman's Foreign Ministry said in\u00a0a statement on X\u00a0on Saturday that the sides agreed to keep talking to seek a deal that ensures Iran is \"completely free of nuclear weapons and sanctions, and maintaining its ability to develop peaceful nuclear energy.\"",
      "That the talks are even happening represents a historic moment, given the decades of enmity between the two countries since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis. Mr. Trump, in his first term, unilaterally withdrew from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018, setting off years of attacks and negotiations that failed to restore the accord that drastically limited Tehran's enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.",
      "At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran's nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue an atomic weapon.",
      "\"I'm for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. \"I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.\"",
      "Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei told Iranian state TV the talks were \"indirect\" with the delegations in \"different halls\" at the embassy. He earlier wrote Saturday on X that Iran \"always demonstrated, with good faith and a sense of responsibility, its commitment to diplomacy as a civilized way to resolve issues.\"",
      "\"We are aware that it is not a smooth path, but we take every step with open eyes, relying also on the past experiences,\" Baghaei added.",
      "Araghchi met Saturday morning with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani ahead of the talks with Witkoff.",
      "Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, also met Tajani on Saturday. Grossi's agency would likely be key in verifying compliance by Iran should a deal be reached, as it did with the 2015 accord Iran reached with world powers.",
      "Tajani said Italy was ready \"to facilitate the continuation of the talks even for sessions at the technical level.\"",
      "A diplomat deal \"is built patiently, day after day, with dialogue and mutual respect,\" he said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014\u00a0U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the U.S. may \"move on\" from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days. Months of efforts by the White House have failed to bring an end to the fighting, despite repeated promises by President Trump before he took office that he would use his skills as a negotiator to end the war immediately.",
      "Rubio spoke in Paris after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials produced outlines for steps toward peace and appeared to make some long-awaited progress. A new meeting is expected next week in London, and Rubio suggested that could be decisive in determining whether the Trump administration continues its involvement.",
      "\"We are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,\" Rubio told reporters upon departure. \"Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on.\"",
      "\"It's not our war,\" Rubio said. \"We have other priorities to focus on.\" He said the U.S. administration wants to decide \"in a matter of days.\"",
      "His remarks contrasted starkly with the stance of the Biden administration, during which then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned not long after the war began that Russia's autocratic President Vladimir Putin was determined \"to reconstitute the Soviet empire. Short of that, he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc. And short of that, he'd like to make sure that all of these countries are somehow neutral.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also warned, including in multiple interviews with CBS News, that Putin is intent on expanding Russia's borders by force \u2014 and breaking the security bonds forged among Western democracies during World War II, of which the U.S.-led NATO alliance has been the most tangible.",
      "\"For him, we are a satellite of Russian Federation. At the moment, it's us, then Kazakhstan, then Baltic states, then Poland, then Germany. At least half of Germany,\" Zelenskyy told CBS News' Charlie D'Agata about one year ago. \"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members.\"",
      "Zelenskyy called Russia's invasion a war \"against the democracy, against the values, against the whole world,\" acknowledging even then that some in the West might be tired of hearing that message, \"but only those are tired who are not at war, who don't know what war is, and who have never lost his or her children.\"",
      "\"If we do not stand firm, he will advance further,\" Zelenskyy reiterated in an interview with 60 Minutes just this month. \"It is not just idle speculation; the threat is real. Putin's ultimate goal is to revive the Russian empire and reclaim territories currently under NATO protection. Considering all of this, I believe it could escalate into a world war.\"",

      "Rubio's comments on Friday came hours after the U.S. and Ukraine seemingly neared a long-delayed deal to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's vast mineral resources, which has been intertwined with President Trump's peace push.",
      "\"We have a minerals deal,'' Mr. Trump said Thursday, and Ukraine's economy minister said Friday that the two countries had signed a memorandum of intent ahead of a possible fuller agreement later.",
      "The deal, which Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said she signed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is expected to pave the way for significant investments, infrastructure modernization and long-term cooperation.",
      "Work toward the mineral deal had stalled in February following a contentious Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Negotiations have since resumed.",
      "Rubio on the dialogue with Russia, and Europe",
      "Despite apparent growing U.S. impatience with the peace efforts, Rubio called Thursday's Paris talks constructive. \"Nobody rejected anything, nobody got up from the table or walked away.\"",
      "Rubio didn't single out Russia or Ukraine as blocking peace efforts. He said he informed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about the outlines that emerged when they spoke after the Paris talks, but wouldn't say how Lavrov reacted.",
      "When asked about Rubio's comments on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that \"fairly complex\" negotiations were ongoing between Russia and the U.S. He did not give details but said no direct talks between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were scheduled in the coming days.",
      "\"Russia is striving toward resolving this conflict, securing its own interests, and is open to dialogue. We are continuing to do this,\" he said.",
      "In its readout on the call with Rubio, the Kremlin said Lavrov had confirmed Moscow's \"readiness to continue working together with American colleagues to reliably eliminate the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis.\"",
      "Putin and his deputies have consistently claimed those root causes are Zelenskyy's actions and NATO's eastward expansion \u2014 misleading narratives that Mr. Trump himself has at times espoused about the full-scale invasion Putin launched on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "After weeks of tension with European allies, Rubio told reporters in Paris that the European negotiators proved helpful. \"The U.K. and France and Germany can help us move the ball on this.\"",
      "During a meeting on Friday with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome, Vice President JD Vance also spoke about the ongoing negotiations with Ukraine and Russia, saying he wouldn't \"pre-judge them, but we feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war to a close.\"",
      "European concerns are growing, however, about Mr. Trump's readiness to draw closer to Russia. These talks were the first time since his inauguration that top American, Ukrainian and European officials met to discuss an end to the war, which has posed the biggest security challenge to Europe since World War II.",
      "The meetings addressed hypothetical security guarantees for Ukraine in the future, but Rubio wouldn't discuss any possible U.S. role in that. Some kind of U.S. support for Ukraine is seen as crucial to ensuring that Russia would not attack again if and when a peace deal is reached.",
      "Rubio and presidential envoy Steve Witkoff have helped lead U.S. efforts to seek peace, and Witkoff has met three times with Putin, Rubio said. Several rounds of negotiations have been held in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Moscow has effectively refused to accept a comprehensive ceasefire that Mr. Trump has pushed and Ukraine has endorsed. Russia has made it conditional on a halt in Ukraine's mobilization efforts and Western arms supplies, which are demands rejected by Ukraine.",
      "Deadly Russian strikes on Ukraine continue",
      "Russia, meanwhile, has kept up a series of deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities, according to officials there, wounding scores of civilians days after missiles killed at least 34 during Palm Sunday celebrations in the northern city of Sumy.",
      "One person died and 103 others, including eight children, were wounded as Russia hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, early on Friday, its mayor Ihor Terekhov reported. He said cluster munitions struck a \"densely populated\" neighborhood four times.",
      "Russian drones also targeted a bakery in Sumy, less than a week after the deadly Palm Sunday strike there, killing a customer and wounding an employee, the regional prosecutor's office said. Photos released by the agency showed rows of Easter cakes stacked inside a devastated building, covered in thick dust, as a huge hole gaped in the wall behind them and rubble piled up on the floor.",
      "Last Sunday's strike on Sumy, resulting in mass casualties, was the second large-scale missile attack to claim civilian lives in just over a week. Some 20 people, including nine children, died on April 4 as missiles struck Zelenskyy's hometown of Kryvyi Rih.",

      "A soldier from Virginia who died on D-Day has been accounted for 81 years after he was killed, officials said in a news release.",
      "U.S. Army Sgt. Ivor D. Thornton, 34, landed on Omaha Beach in Normandy with Company H, 2nd Battalion, 116th Infantry Regimental Combat Team, 29th Infantry Division as part of the second wave of the invasion, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. D-Day, or Operation Overlord, was a massive Allied invasion of northern France by air and sea during World War II. The operation, on June 6, 1944, marked the beginning of the liberation of Europe from Hitler's rule.",
      "The company disembarked from their landing craft at around 7 a.m. Fellow soldiers observed Thornton wading ashore, but he was not seen again after that, the DPAA said. The day after the invasion, Thornton's unit searched for him, but he was not found. He was officially listed as missing in action. His name was engraved on the Walls of the Missing at the Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France.",
      "On June 8, 1944, two days after D-Day, graves registration personnel recovered a set of remains from Omaha Beach that they were unable to identify, the DPAA said. The remains were interred at U.S. Military Cemetery Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer, near Omaha Beach, and marked as X-159 St. Laurent.",
      "In 1945, an attempt was made to identify the unknown remains, but the effort was unsuccessful, the DPAA said. Analysts with the American Graves Registration Command failed to identify the remains again in 1947. Two years later, in 1949, a board of officers from the command recommended the remains be declared unidentifiable.",
      "In April 2022, two families, including Thornton's, requested that X-159 be disinterred. The families asked that the remains be compared to those of Thornton and another soldier. The remains were exhumed in September 2023 and transferred to the DPAA laboratory. Scientists conducted dental and anthropological analyses and mitochondrial DNA analysis, the DPAA said.",
      "Those efforts finally identified the remains as belonging to Thornton. A rosette will be placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing to indicate that he has been accounted for, the DPAA said, and he will be buried at the Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C.",

    "summary": "U.S. airstrikes targeting an oil port held by Yemen's Houthi rebels killed dozens and wounded more than 100 others, the group says.",
    "story": [
      "Dubai, United Arab Emirates \u2014 U.S. airstrikes targeting the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen's Houthi rebels killed 58 people and wounded 126 others, the group said Friday, marking what appeared to be the single-deadliest known attack under President Trump's new campaign targeting the rebels.",
      "Assessing the toll of Mr. Trump's campaign, which began March 15, has been incredibly difficult as the U.S. military's Central Command so far hasn't released any information on the campaign, its specific targets and how many people have been killed. Meanwhile, Yemen's Houthi rebels strictly control access to areas attacked and don't publish information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites.",
      "But the strike on the Ras Isa oil port, which sent massive fireballs shooting into the night sky, represented a major escalation of the American campaign. The Houthis also immediately released graphic footage of those killed in the attack.",
      "The war in Yemen, meanwhile, was further internationalized as the U.S. alleged a Chinese satellite company was \"directly supporting\" Houthi attacks, something Beijing didn't immediately acknowledge.",
      "The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel aired graphic footage of the aftermath of the attack on Ras Isa port, showing corpses strewn across the site. It said paramedic and civilians workers at the port had been killed in the attack, which sparked a massive explosion and fires.",
      "In a statement, Central Command said \"U.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years.\"",
      "\"This strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully,\" it added. It didn't acknowledge any casualties and declined to comment when asked by The Associated Press regarding civilians reportedly being killed.",
      "The Ras Isa port, a collection of three oil tanks and refining equipment, sits in Yemen's Hodeida governorate along the Red Sea. NASA satellites that track forest fires showed an intense blaze early Friday morning at the site just off Kamaran Island, targeted by intense U.S. airstrikes over the last few days.",
      "The Ras Isa port also is the terminus of an oil pipeline stretching to Yemen's energy-rich Marib governorate that's still held by allies of Yemen's exiled government. The Houthis expelled that government from Yemen's capital, Sanaa, back in 2015. However, oil exports have been halted by the decadelong war and the Houthis have used Ras Isa to bring in oil.",
      "The Houthis and Iran denounced the U.S. attack.",
      "\"This completely unjustified aggression represents a flagrant violation of Yemen's sovereignty and independence and a direct targeting of the entire Yemeni people,\" the Houthis said in a statement carried by the SABA news agency they control. \"It targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades.\"",
      "Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Tehran \"strongly condemned the barbaric U.S. air strike,\" calling it \"an example of aggressive crime and a blatant violation of the fundamental principles of the U.N. Charter,\" according to French news agency AFP.",
      "On April 9, the U.S. State Department issued a warning about oil shipments to Yemen.",
      "\"The United States will not tolerate any country or commercial entity providing support to foreign terrorist organizations, such as the Houthis, including offloading ships and provisioning oil at Houthi-controlled ports,\" it said.",
      "The attack follows Israeli airstrikes on the Houthis that previously hit port and oil infrastructure used by the rebels after their attacks on Israel.",
      "U.S. says Chinese satellite image provider is aiding Houthis",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce in a briefing with journalists accused Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. Ltd., a commercial satellite image provider, of \"directly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on U.S. interests.\"",
      "Bruce didn't elaborate in detail, but acknowledged a story by The Financial Times that quoted anonymous American officials saying the firm linked to the People's Liberation Army has provided images enabling the rebels to target U.S. warships and commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea corridor.",
      "\"Beijing's support, by the way, of that company, the satellite company, even after we've engaged in discussions with them about this ... certainly contradicts their claims of being peace supporters,\" Bruce said.",
      "Chinese officials and the company, known by the acronym CGSTL, couldn't be immediately reached for comment. Chinese state media didn't acknowledge the accusation. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned CGSTL in 2023 for allegedly providing satellite images to the Russian mercenary force the Wagner Group as it fought in Ukraine as part of Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "An AP review has found the new U.S. operation against the Houthis under Mr. Trump appears more extensive than the one under former President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.",
      "The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \"Israeli\" ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip as that war grinds on. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.",
      "The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. That's greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it. The Houthis also launched attacks targeting American warships, without success.",
      "The U.S. campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has also linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program. A second round of negotiations between Iran and the U.S. is due to happen Saturday in Rome.",
      "The stakes of the negotiations couldn't be higher for the two nations\u00a0closing in on half a century of enmity. Mr, Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",

      "The Democratic senator shared a photo with Abrego Garcia at what appears to be a restaurant.",
      "\"I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar,\" Sen. Van Hollen said. \"Tonight I had that chance. I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.\"",

      "Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele also posted photos\u00a0of the meeting, but suggested Abrego Garcia will remain incarcerated by his government, which is being paid by the United States to hold deportees: \"Now that he's been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez, said in a statement after the meeting her \"prayers have been answered.\"",
      "\"We still have so many questions, hopes, and fears. I will continue praying and fighting for Kilma's' return home,\" Vasquez wrote.",
      "White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai called Van Hollen's visit \"truly disgusting,\" writing, \"Chris Van Hollen has firmly established Democrats as the party whose top priority is the welfare of an illegal alien MS-13 terrorist.\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers have strongly denied any connections to MS-13.",
      "The surprise meeting with Van Hollen marks Abrego Garcia's first known appearance since last month, when his deportation to El Salvador's notorious Terrorism Confinement Center drew national attention and sparked a legal standoff with the Trump administration.",
      "The administration admitted in court papers Abrego Garcia was sent to El Salvador \u2014 along with hundreds of other Salvadoran and Venezuelan migrants \u2014 due to an \"administrative error.\" U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, and the Supreme Court backed up that order, but he has remained in El Salvador since then, with Xinis suggesting the government hasn't complied with her order and demanding regular updates on his status.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed back, arguing it's up to El Salvador to decide whether to return Abrego Garcia \u2014 an argument an appeals court called \"shocking\" on Thursday. The government has also alleged Abrego Garcia is linked to Salvadoran gang MS-13, citing a confidential informant, though his attorneys have denied that allegation and noted Abrego Garcia has not been charged or convicted of any crimes.",
      "Abrego Garcia, 29, was born in El Salvador but entered the United States illegally in 2011 at the age of 16. He was arrested outside a Maryland Home Depot in 2019, but a judge barred the government from deporting him to El Salvador, warning he could be persecuted by gangs in his home country. Years later, in March of this year, he was detained by immigration agents in Maryland and sent to the Salvadoran detention center, known as CECOT.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case is at the center of a controversial push by the Trump administration to send scores of migrants \u2014 including accused members of MS-13 and Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua \u2014 to CECOT using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which allows the president to deport citizens of an enemy nation during an \"invasion or predatory incursion.\" The gambit has been challenged in court, with opponents decrying conditions in CECOT and\u00a0arguing the government is denying migrants the right to due process. A \"60 Minutes\" report found most of the 238 Venezuelans sent to CECOT on several planes last month had no apparent criminal record. But the Trump administration has defended its use of the law, arguing it is cracking down on gang violence.",
      "Van Hollen's meeting with Abrego Garcia\u00a0came after the senator was turned away Thursday at a military checkpoint near CECOT. He said he was about three kilometers from the notorious supermax prison, when he was stopped by soldiers, who he said were ordered to prevent him from going toward the prison.",
      "Van Hollen left for El Salvador on Wednesday, intending to check on Abrego Garcia's well-being. He provided updates on his journey.",

    "story": [
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is meeting at the White House on Thursday with President Trump, in what her aides have called a high-stakes \"commercial peace mission.\"",
      "European leaders are hoping Italy's right-wing premier\u00a0can position herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and the European Union, which Mr. Trump and his top aides have bashed as a deadbeat, if not abusive partner on defense and trade.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday that \"of course\" there will be a trade deal with the EU, amid the 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Asked if the EU is on his priority list of nations for reaching trade deals, Mr. Trump said, \"Everybody's on my priority list.\"",
      "The president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal.",
      "The hope not only in Rome, but in EU capitals across the 27-nation bloc is likely that Meloni can persuade Mr. Trump not to impose the steep tariff hikes he's threatened, which could devastate European economies. A reporter asked Meloni if she believes the U.S. is a reliable partner.",
      "\"If I wouldn't think it's a reliable partner, I wouldn't be here,\" Meloni responded.",
      "Meloni said she's \"here to find the best way to make us both stronger.\"",
      "\"The goal for me is to make the West great again,\" Meloni said. \"And I think we can do it together.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he believes there have been trade calls with the EU already, and the U.S. is trying to work with the world's 15 largest economies first. The president said \"tariffs are making us rich.\"",
      "Meloni and Trump seem to \"get along great\"",
      "Meloni has positioned herself as the European leader Mr. Trump is most likely to listen to. The two have developed a relationship based on shared political and ideological affinities on issues including immigration and LGBTQ rights.",
      "Meloni was the only European leader to be invited to Mr. Trump's inauguration in January, and he has praised her multiple times, calling her a \"fantastic leader and person,\" and someone he could potentially work with to \"straighten out the world a little bit.\"",
      "After the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris last year, which both leaders attended, Mr. Trump was quoted by the New York Post as saying: \"I was with her a lot\" and \"we get along great.\"",
      "But the Italian leader will have to try to balance that budding special relationship with her mandate to protect the interests not only of her own nation's economy, but the EU's, with which Italy's financial future is inextricably linked.",
      "Europe has hope, and anxiety, over the Trump-Meloni meeting",
      "Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed strategies on how to approach her meeting with Mr. Trump during multiple phone calls ahead of the trip, according to a commission spokesperson.",
      "Von der Leyen herself has not yet been granted a meeting with Mr. Trump, despite repeated requests. Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.",
      "Meloni has gently chided the sweeping tariffs on the EU as \"wrong,\" but she's been one of the voices urging the continental bloc not to impose retaliatory measures, insisting that a calm response focused on negotiations would bring a more constructive resolution.",
      "The White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.",
      "\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"",
      "Not all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however.\u00a0 Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"",
      "In other European capitals, there was clear anxiety over the possibility that the White House could use the meeting to try to undermine EU unity.",
      "\"If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,\" the French government's Minister for Industry and Energy, Marc Ferracci, said last week, adding: \"Europe is only strong if it is united.\"",
      "The French news agency AFP said a government spokeswoman later stressed that any voices capable of encouraging dialogue between Washington and the EU were to be welcomed. That statement echoed the remarks by the EU spokesperson on Monday, who noted the close coordination between Meloni and Von der Leyen ahead of the Italian leader's trip to Washington and said the \"outreach is very welcome.\"",
      "After her brief visit to Washington the Italian leader will return home, where she's expected to meet on Friday with Vice President JD Vance during his visit to the Italian capital and the Vatican.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin have met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office since he took office for his second term, but those encounters all came prior to the massive tariffs announcement on April 2.",

Sullivan, originally from Tennessee, was abducted at gunpoint\u00a0during a prayer meeting at his church in South Africa on the evening of April 10.",
      "According to a statement issued by the the South African Police Service, a specialized unit dedicated to serious crime, known as the Hawks, they led the operation to rescue the 45-year-old.",
      "The American was abducted from his Fellowship Baptist Church in Motherwell Township, outside the coastal city of Gqeberha, and was rescued from a safehouse being used by his captors in that city.",
      "\"The operation followed verified intelligence wherein a coordinated team (of several police units) moved swiftly to the identified location,\" police said. \"As officers approached the house, they observed a vehicle on the premises. The suspects inside the vehicle upon seeing law enforcement allegedly attempted to flee and opened fire on the team. The officers responded with tactical precision, leading to a high-intensity shootout in which three unidentified suspects were fatally wounded.\"",

      "\"It may be claimed to be an adventure trip, but the fact is that there has been a violation of Indian laws. Outsiders meeting Sentinelese could endanger the tribe's survival,\" said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity as he isn't authorized to speak about the case under investigation.",

The inhabitants use spears and bows and arrows to hunt the animals that roam the small, heavily forested island. Deeply suspicious of outsiders, they attack anyone who lands onto their beaches.",
      "In 2018, John Allen Chau, an American missionary who landed illegally on the beach was killed by North Sentinelese Islanders who apparently shot him with arrows and then buried his body on the beach. In 2006, the Sentinelese had killed two fishermen who had accidentally landed on the shore.",

      "The young American had twice attempted to visit the island in the past, and left a can of Diet Coke and a coconut as offering for the tribe this time after he failed to contact the Sentinelese.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/guantanamo-trump-migrants-without-criminal-records/",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 07:05:13 -0400",
    "summary": "A government memo obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "A government memo obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay, allowing officials to send non-criminal detainees there despite a vow to hold \"the worst\" offenders at the naval base.",
      "As part of his aggressive crackdown on immigration, President Trump in late January directed officials to convert facilities inside the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into holding sites for migrants living in the country illegally. At the time, Mr. Trump said \"the worst\" migrants would be held at the base, directing officials to make space for \"high-priority criminal aliens.\"",
      "But a previously undisclosed agreement between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense indicates that the Trump administration gave officials wide-ranging discretion to decide who to send to Guantanamo Bay, enacting criteria not predicated on the severity of detainees' criminal history or conduct. In fact, the memo does not mention any criminality assessment. [Read the full memo at the bottom of this story.]",
      "Instead, the agreement, signed on March 7 by top DHS and Pentagon officials, says the departments agreed to use the Guantanamo base to detain migrants with final deportation orders who have \"a nexus to a transnational criminal organization (TCO) or criminal drug activity.\"",
      "Officials defined \"nexus\" in broad terms. A nexus can be satisfied, the memo says, if migrants with final deportation orders are part of a transnational criminal group or if they paid one \"to be smuggled into the United States.\" The latter condition could be used to describe many of the migrants and asylum-seekers who have illegally crossed the U.S. southern border, as criminal groups in Mexico largely control the illicit movement of people and drugs there.",
      "Migrants who overstayed a visa are not eligible to be sent to Guantanamo Bay, the document says. But if the nature of a migrant's entry is unclear, the memo allows officials to assume that the person paid a criminal group to enter the U.S. and to send them to Guantanamo if they hail from a nation \"where the preponderance of aliens from that country enter the United States in that fashion.\"",
      "The conditions for transferring migrants to Guantanamo, as outlined in the memo, seem to be at odds with statements by Mr. Trump and high-ranking members of his administration that have suggested the base would be used as a detention site for dangerous criminals.",
      "Theresa Cardinal Brown, a former U.S. immigration official during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said the memo's rules \"apply very broadly to any immigrant who came to the U.S. via the U.S.-Mexico border.\"",
      "\"It's very well known that almost every immigrant who makes it to the U.S.-Mexico border would have to pay some sort of money to the cartels that control the territory on the Mexican side, directly or indirectly,\" she said.",
      "Cardinal Brown added that the rules do not appear to include \"any individualized assessment\" to determine whether migrant detainees pose a threat, before transferring them to Guantanamo.",
      "Department of Defense spokeswoman Kingsley Wilson confirmed the existence of the memo, saying it \"strengthens DoD and DHS collaboration by clarifying roles and responsibilities, and fostering efficient and coordinated operations at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to DHS representatives for comment.",
      "The Guantanamo operation is not the only Trump administration immigration effort to face scrutiny over who exactly has been targeted. In mid-March, for example, the administration deported 238 Venezuelans to El Salvador, so they could be imprisoned inside that country's infamous mega-prison. The Trump administration said they were all criminals and gang members, but a \"60 Minutes\" investigation did not find a criminal record for 75% of the Venezuelan deportees.",
      "A high-profile yet largely secretive operation",
      "The Trump administration first began sending migrants to Guantanamo in February, initially only transferring Venezuelans there, including men it accused of having ties to the Tren de Aragua prison gang. The first group of Venezuelan detainees was eventually flown to Honduras, where the Venezuelan government picked them up so they could be transported back to their homeland.",
      "Since then, the administration has sporadically flown migrants from different countries to the base, before transferring them back to the U.S. or other nations. Administration officials have regularly touted the flights to Guantanamo but have provided limited details about the operation, including on costs and who is eligible to be sent to the base.",
      "What has been publicly revealed, by CBS News and other media outlets, is that officials have transferred both detainees considered to be \"high-threat\" and \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo, including migrants whose relatives have denied allegations of gang membership and criminality.",
      "Government guidelines define migrant detainees as posing a \"high\" threat if they have violent or serious criminal records, histories of disruptive conduct or alleged gang ties. Low-risk detainees are defined as migrants who face deportation because they are in the U.S. illegally but who lack any serious criminal record \u2014 or any at all.",
      "Those sent to Guantanamo and considered to be \"high-threat\" migrants have been held at Camp VI, a section of the post-9/11 prison that still houses roughly a dozen terrorism suspects. Migrant detainees deemed to pose a \"low\" risk have been transferred to the base's Migrant Operations Center, a barrack-like facility that has historically housed asylum-seekers intercepted at sea.",
      "Wilson, the Department of Defense spokeswoman, said there are currently 42 migrants detained at Guantanamo, 32 of them housed at the Migrant Operations Center and 10 so-called \"high-threat\" detainees held at Camp VI.",
      "The March 7 memo obtained by CBS News sheds light on other aspects of operations at Guantanamo. For example, it confirms the migrant detainees transported there remain in the legal custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even though the military is providing access to its facilities to detain them.",
      "As part of the agreement, DHS also accepted the conditions at Camp VI and the Migrant Operations Center as adequate to hold migrant adults, noting it would not transfer children to the base. The department agreed to send ICE officers or contractors to the base, including to oversee security at the Migrant Operations Center.",
      "The memo makes DHS responsible for providing detainees services like recreation and religious accommodations; determining whether migrants get access to lawyers; and administering \"involuntary medical treatment,\" such as force-feeding during hunger strikes.",
      "The agreement also charges DHS with overseeing the transfer of detainees from and to Guantanamo, requiring the department to relocate migrants from the base no more than 180 days after their deportation orders are issued.",
      "The military, as stipulated by the agreement, is principally responsible for providing security at Camp VI and in the perimeter of the facilities. It also agreed to provide toilets and hygiene facilities, as well as medical care to both ICE personnel and detained migrants.",
      "The memo says the Department of Defense committed to erect tents at the base to hold additional detainees, though those sites have not been used to detain migrants yet. The agreement notes, however, that those tents \"do not have power, lighting, or heating/air conditioning.\"",
      "The effort to hold migrants at Guantanamo faces legal challenges by advocates, including at the American Civil Liberties Union, the Trump administration's chief adversary in federal court.",
      "The ACLU alleged in court filings that migrants were initially held incommunicado at Guantanamo, without access to relatives or lawyers. The administration subsequently said it took steps to give migrant detainees access to lawyers.",
      "The ACLU has also described detention conditions at Guantanamo as deplorable, citing declarations from migrants held there. In one of those declarations, a Venezuelan man previously held at the base said he went on a hunger strike after feeling he had been \"kidnapped.\"",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the lead architect of the Trump administration's immigration agenda, said earlier this week there are no plans to stop using Guantanamo to detain migrants.",
      "\"It's wide open,\" Miller said on Fox News. \"Gitmo is open.\"",

      "Fox News correspondent Chanley Painter reports on growing concerns from lawmakers and travelers as the deadline to use REAL ID-compliant licenses for air travel gets closer.",
      "Due to a security law passed 20 years ago, many Americans are now required to update their driver\u2019s license or identification cards to become REAL ID-compliant \u2014 or they won\u2019t be able to board U.S. flights.",
      "With the deadline fast approaching on May 7, some conservatives have called on President Donald Trump to do away with the inconvenient requirement that they say violates civil liberties.",
      "What is REAL ID, and why does it matter?",
      "On May 7, federal agencies, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), will no longer accept driver\u2019s licenses or ID cards that do not have a star in one of the upper corners to represent their REAL ID verification. To become REAL ID-verified, applicants have to provide additional verifying information like Social Security numbers.",
      "Flyers who don\u2019t have REAL ID verification on their license should plan to use a passport, a passport card, a permanent resident card, military ID or an enhanced driver\u2019s license offered by some states.",

      "Sample driver's license with REAL ID. The star in the top right corner signifies REAL ID.\u00a0 (DC DMV\u00a0)",
      "Will travelers get turned away at the airport without a REAL ID?",
      "The TSA says it will begin \"phased enforcement\" on May 7, but it\u2019s unclear whether that means turning away travelers without proper documentation or subjecting them to additional security screening.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in an FAQ on its website\u00a0that travelers without \"a REAL ID-compliant license or acceptable alternative beginning May 7, 2025, will not be permitted through the security checkpoint.\"",
      "In a federal rule established this year, the TSA says its \"phased approach\" could last two years, with the potential to issue warnings to people without REAL ID verification.",
      "Access to other federal facilities and nuclear power plants will also require a REAL ID, according to DHS.",
      "How do you get a REAL ID?",
      "Drivers who have recently renewed their driver\u2019s license may already have a REAL ID. Check for the star in the upper right or left corner. Otherwise, check with your local Department of Motor Vehicles office on how to get a REAL ID or make an appointment to get a new license.",
      "You\u2019ll need documentation to show your full legal name, date of birth, Social Security number and lawful status, as well as two proofs of address. If you don\u2019t have your Social Security card, you can provide a W-2 or pay stub with your name and Social Security number on it.",

      "Why is this happening?",
      "Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed the REAL ID Act in 2005 after the 9/11 Commission warned that it was too easy for bad actors to obtain a driver\u2019s license.",
      "Implementation of the law has been marred by delays in getting all 50 states and U.S. territories to implement the new requirements and start issuing advanced identification, which the federal government estimated would cost $11 billion in 2007.",

      "What's the backlash?",
      "Some on the right have cried foul, and questioned why, if\u00a0previous administrations have delayed the implementation, it is necessary now.",
      "When Homeland Security Secretary\u00a0Kristi Noem posted a video reminding Americans of the May 7 deadline, former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin responded:\u00a0\"Or what??

      "Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., argued in an X post, \"As long as the pilot\u2019s door is locked and no one has weapons, why do you care that someone who flies has government permission? REAL ID provides no benefit, yet presents a serious risk to freedom. If a person can\u2019t be trusted to fly without weapons, why are they roaming free?\"",
      "Massie took shots at Trump in a follow-up post: \"REAL ID is a 2005 George Bush-era Patriot Act overreach that went completely unenforced until Trump got into office. Let me guess: he\u2019s playing 4D chess and I should just go along with it?\"",

      "A person plugging in a USB flash drive to a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why target USB flash drives?",
      "USB drives are ubiquitous in workplaces, especially in environments with air-gapped systems or restricted internet access, such as those in government and energy sectors. This makes them an easy target for data theft and malware propagation. Often, these drives store sensitive files that are not available on networked systems.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",

      "How hackers are targeting your USB drives",
      "As reported by\u00a0Kaspersky's Securelist, a cybersecurity research platform, hackers are using USB drives to spread malware in ways that can easily bypass traditional security systems. One group, known as GOFFEE, kicks off its attacks with targeted phishing emails. These emails often carry infected RAR files or Office documents with harmful macros. Once opened, they install sneaky programs like PowerModul and PowerTaskel on the victim\u2019s system.",
      "These tools don\u2019t just sit around. They lay the groundwork for more attacks. PowerModul, in particular, plays a big role. It\u2019s a PowerShell script introduced in 2024 that talks to a command-and-control (C2) server. From there, it can download and run other tools, including two especially dangerous ones, FlashFileGrabber and USB Worm.",
      "FlashFileGrabber is made to steal data from USB drives. It can either save stolen files locally or send them back to the hacker's server. Then there\u2019s USB Worm, which infects any USB drive it finds with PowerModul, turning that drive into a tool for spreading malware to other systems.",
      "What makes this method effective is that USB drives are often shared between people and offices. That physical movement allows the malware to spread even without an internet connection. The malware hides original files on the USB and replaces them with malicious scripts disguised as normal-looking shortcuts. When someone clicks one of these, they unknowingly trigger the infection.",

      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "4 practical ways to stay safe from USB-targeted attacks",
      "1. Don\u2019t plug in unknown USB drives:\u00a0It might sound obvious, but this is one of the most common ways malware spreads. If you find a USB drive lying around or someone gives you one you weren\u2019t expecting, avoid plugging it into your system. Attackers often rely on human curiosity to get the malware onto your machine.",
      "2.\u00a0Be extra cautious with email attachments:\u00a0GOFFEE\u2019s campaigns often begin with phishing emails carrying malicious RAR files or Office documents with macros. Always double-check the sender\u2019s address and never open unexpected attachments, especially if they ask you to \"enable macros\" or come from unknown contacts. When in doubt, confirm through a different channel.",
      "3. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many attacks like GOFFEE\u2019s start with emails that look legitimate but contain malicious links. These links might lead you to fake login pages or silently download malware that sets the stage for USB-targeting tools like PowerModul.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Scan USB drives before use:\u00a0The USB Worm infects USB drives by hiding original files and planting malicious scripts disguised as shortcuts, which trigger PowerModul when clicked. FlashFileGrabber also steals files silently from USBs, often going unnoticed. Always scan USB drives with updated antivirus software before opening any files. Use a reputable security tool to check for hidden scripts, unusual shortcuts or unexpected executables. If files appear renamed or hidden, don\u2019t click them until verified safe.",
      "DATA REMOVAL DOES WHAT VPNS DON\u2019T: HERE\u2019S WHY YOU NEED BOTH",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Cybercriminals thrive where convenience meets oversight. However, it\u2019s worth considering why USBs remain such a soft target. They\u2019re not just storage but a cultural artifact of workplaces, especially in high-stakes sectors like energy or government, where offline data transfer feels safer than the cloud. But that trust is a blind spot. Attackers like GOFFEE don\u2019t need zero days because they can exploit human habits such as sharing drives, skipping scans and clicking without thinking.",

This often involves selling stolen information to scammers or hackers who use it for fraudulent activities, such as running credit fraud schemes. Since many forms of identity theft revolve around credit accounts, it\u2019s crucial to take action if your or a loved one\u2019s personal data has been exposed.",

      "If managing this process feels overwhelming, consider using an identity theft protection service. These services can handle placing and managing security freezes on your behalf, saving you time and ensuring the process is done correctly. Many of these services also offer additional features, such as credit monitoring and alerts, to help you stay on top of potential threats to your personal information. Taking this step can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind that your financial information is secure.",

      "Some credit cards include RFID chips that make contactless payments easy and convenient. However, this same feature can be exploited if someone with the right equipment gets close enough to scan your card without your knowledge. Using\u00a0RFID-blocking gear such as a wallet, card sleeve or passport holder is a simple and affordable way to prevent this type of theft. These items are widely available and effective at blocking unauthorized scans.",
      "Limiting the number of cards you bring reduces the risk of your wallet being lost or stolen. Ideally,\u00a0take only one or two credit cards that you plan to use during your trip. Keep any backup cards in your hotel safe and store a secure digital record of your card details in a\u00a0password manager. This can be helpful if you need to cancel or replace a card while you\u2019re abroad. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Most credit card companies offer instant notifications through their mobile apps. Turning on transaction alerts ensures you\u2019ll be notified the moment your card is used, allowing you to spot suspicious activity quickly. If your card issuer offers the ability to lock your card directly from the app, enable that feature as well, so you can act immediately if anything looks off.",

If you're not planning to use a card for a day or two, consider locking it until you're ready to make a purchase. This simple habit adds an extra layer of protection. If someone tries to use the card while it\u2019s locked, the transaction will be declined.",

      "At its core, 3D digital twin technology creates a virtual replica, or \"digital twin,\" of a real-world environment or event. In the context of sports, this means replicating entire stadiums and live games with incredible accuracy. For example, Arcturus places cameras around the edges of baseball stadiums to capture real-time action and generate a 3D digital clone of the game. Fans can then pinch, zoom and view the game from any angle in the stadium, offering an unprecedented level of immersion.",

By creating virtual replicas of players using biomechanical and physiological data, teams can simulate match scenarios, track fatigue levels and prevent injuries with precision. Coaches can use digital twins to simulate different game strategies without risking player fatigue or injury.",

To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the LSC breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the LSC breach, including Social Security numbers, insurance info and even medical IDs. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Keep tabs on your medical records:\u00a0The LSC breach included lab results, diagnoses and treatment data, making medical identity theft a growing concern. Someone could use your info to get care or prescriptions under your name. Regularly review your medical records and insurance claims. If anything looks off, report it to your provider or insurer immediately.",
      "6. Watch out for suspicious snail mail: After the LSC data breach, attackers may use your stolen information to send official-looking letters by post, posing as healthcare providers, insurers or even government agencies. These letters might ask you to call a number, visit a website or provide additional personal information. Just because it arrives in your mailbox doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s trustworthy. Always verify the source by looking up contact details independently and avoid responding directly to unsolicited mail asking for sensitive information.",
      "7. Use multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable\u00a0MFA on all critical accounts like email, banking apps and healthcare portals. Look in account settings under \"security\" or \"login options\" to activate it. MFA ensures that even if hackers have your password, they\u2019ll need another verification method (like a text code) before accessing your account.",
      "8. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year, or more frequently if you're concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "9. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "11. Secure your online accounts: Review security settings across all important accounts (email, especially). Update recovery options like backup emails or phone numbers and log out of devices you don\u2019t recognize. Compromised accounts can lead hackers straight into other parts of your digital life.",
      "By following these steps, you\u2019ll be taking comprehensive action against potential threats stemming from the LSC data breach.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",

      "The LSC breach isn\u2019t just another headline. It\u2019s a serious reminder of how exposed we really are. When personal, medical and financial information is stolen, the consequences are immediate and long term. Identity theft, fraudulent transactions and misuse of health data are all very real risks.

    "story": [
      "From face recognition to dynamic lock, there are options you may be unfamiliar with.",
      "Windows 11 is the latest and greatest operating system from Microsoft, but it has its flaws, so much so that even four years after its release, some people are sticking with older versions. Windows 10 remains the operating system of choice for many, even though Microsoft has shifted its focus entirely to Windows 11. In fact, the Redmond-based company will end security updates for Windows 10 this October.",
      "If that\u2019s not enough to push you toward upgrading, the latest news might be. The 240 million Windows 10 users are vulnerable to dozens of security vulnerabilities, six of which are reportedly already being exploited by bad actors.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "A person typing on a Windows laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Critical Windows 10 security flaws exploited",
      "The vulnerabilities in question were part of a recent Microsoft Patch Tuesday update, a monthly release where the company addresses security flaws. In this case, six specific exploits were identified as being actively used by hackers to target Windows 10 systems. These exploits are particularly alarming because they are already in the wild, meaning attackers are leveraging them to compromise systems before all users have had a chance to update their devices.",
      "The affected population, estimated at 240 million, refers to users whose PCs cannot upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations, such as lacking TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) or other system requirements.",
      "The six exploits include a mix of flaws that allow hackers to achieve various malicious outcomes, such as executing arbitrary code, escalating privileges to take full control of a system or bypassing security features.",
      "For example, one exploit might overload system memory to overwrite critical data (a buffer overflow), while another could allow attackers to access sensitive information by exploiting a flaw in the Windows Kernel. These vulnerabilities are especially dangerous because they can be triggered remotely or through seemingly innocuous actions, like opening a malicious file or mounting a compromised virtual hard disk.",
      "Windows laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC",
      "A fix is there (for now)",
      "Microsoft has released patches to address these issues, and\u00a0America\u2019s Cyber Defense Agency has urged users to update their systems immediately, ideally by this month, or risk severe consequences. The agency even suggested turning off unpatched computers as a precaution. Updating to the latest Windows 10 patch is the simplest and most effective way to protect against these exploits right now.",
      "However, a bigger problem looms later this year. Microsoft will officially end free security updates for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025. After that, systems running Windows 10 will no longer receive critical security patches, unless users enroll in Microsoft\u2019s Extended Security Updates (ESU) program.",
      "This ESU program will be available to individual users for the first time and will cost $30 per device for one additional year of updates. It\u2019s designed to give users more time to transition, especially those who can\u2019t upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations. While this offers a temporary reprieve, it's not a long-term solution; the ESU program will only extend support for a limited time (typically three years in enterprise settings) and prices may increase annually.",
      "The scale of the problem remains significant. Millions of devices lack the hardware requirements for Windows 11, such as TPM 2.0 and newer CPUs, making the shift costly or impractical for some. Analysts warn this could contribute to a surge in electronic waste, unless recycling and repurposing efforts improve dramatically.",

Strong antivirus software can act as a second line of defense, detecting and neutralizing malware that exploits vulnerabilities before they cause harm. Look for solutions with real-time protection and frequent updates to tackle emerging threats. While this won\u2019t fix unpatched system flaws after October 2025, it can reduce risks from common attack vectors like phishing or malicious downloads.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Limit exposure:\u00a0Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",
      "3) Plan for the future:\u00a0The clock is ticking on Windows 10\u2019s security updates. If your hardware can\u2019t handle Windows 11, weigh your long-term options. Buying a new PC might be inevitable, but you could also explore alternatives like Linux, which offers free, secure operating systems (e.g., Ubuntu or Linux Mint) that run well on older hardware.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The road ahead for Windows 10 users is anything but smooth. With critical vulnerabilities emerging and official support coming to an end, millions are being pushed into a difficult decision. They can upgrade their hardware, pay for temporary patches or continue using increasingly vulnerable systems. As October draws closer, the risks will only increase. Updating your system is essential, but it\u2019s just a short-term measure. Now is the time to start preparing for what comes after, before the window of protection closes for good.",

      "Picture this: A dairy barn full of cows being milked, fed and cleaned up after, but there\u2019s no farmer in sight. Sounds a bit unusual, right? Well, it\u2019s not as far-fetched as you might think. Thanks to cutting-edge agricultural robotics, this kind of scene is becoming more common. At this farm, a team of autonomous robots is taking care of all the essential chores, completely changing the way dairy farming works.",

      "The rise of robotic dairy farms",
      "In a dairy barn managed by robots, cows can choose to be milked whenever they like, which is often more frequent than the twice-a-day schedule in traditional farms. This increased frequency is more comfortable for the cows and can lead to roughly a 10% increase in milk production.",
      "Lely, established in 1948 in the Netherlands, introduced its first Astronaut milking robot in the early 1990s. Since then, the company has developed various robotic systems that assist with cleaning, feeding and ensuring cow comfort. Today, Lely is focused entirely on robots for dairy farms, with approximately 135,000 units deployed worldwide.",

These tasks include milking, feeding and manure management. Lely's robots automate these tasks, allowing dairy farmers to focus on other aspects of their business and enjoy a more flexible lifestyle. The Astronaut A5 milking robot, for example, uses a laser-guided robot arm to clean the cow's udder before attaching teat cups. It also monitors milk output and collects data on 32 parameters, including milk quality and cow health indicators.",

Lely believes that robots will enable small dairy farms to continue scaling sustainably. While dairy robots are expensive, Lely argues that they pay for themselves over time through increased milk production and lower labor costs. Other robots, such as the Vector mobile robot for continuous feeding and feed pushing, and the Discovery Collector, a robotic manure vacuum, further reduce labor needs.",
      "AI also plays a critical role in optimizing feeding systems, reducing waste and improving sustainability, which are key factors in modern dairy farming.

This includes modifying the robots' design and programming, such as adding contact-sensing bumpers and relocating emergency stop buttons. Engineers have also had to consider the social dynamics within a herd. For example, the Discovery Collector robot had to be programmed to assert its dominance within the herd to avoid being blocked by cows.",

      "While the potential of quantum internet is exciting, there are still hurdles to overcome. The technology is still in early development, with most experiments confined to research labs. Unlike the traditional internet, quantum networks need specialized equipment to keep signals strong across cities or even countries. Developing this technology requires massive investments and breakthroughs before quantum internet can become widely available. Another key challenge is the transition from today\u2019s internet to quantum internet.",
      "Since most existing technology is built for current networks, the shift won\u2019t happen overnight. Instead, hybrid systems that combine elements of both traditional and quantum communication can serve as a bridge, helping businesses, governments and everyday users to adapt without disrupting the current digital infrastructure.",
      "Despite these challenges, progress is happening. Major countries, including the U.S., are investing heavily in quantum research, and scientists have successfully demonstrated that the technology works. While it may take years before quantum internet reaches everyday users, these breakthroughs are laying the foundation for a safer, more private digital future.",
      "Ways to stay safe while surfing the internet",
      "While quantum internet is a ways away, it's important to stay safe on the internet we use today. Until that new technology arrives, here are a few ways to protect yourself online.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Until a more secure internet becomes available, it's important to use tools that help protect against everyday threats like unsafe links and malware. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Be careful when using public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi remains one of the easiest ways for hackers to access your data.\u00a0The temptations and risks of free Wi-Fi make it important to think twice before connecting to an unsecured network. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts or entering personal details unless you're using a VPN or other form of encryption.",
      "3) Use a VPN: Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Until more advanced security becomes mainstream,\u00a02FA is a simple way to protect your accounts. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second step to log in, like a code sent to your phone. For even stronger protection, consider using a\u00a0security key that plugs into your device.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Quantum internet represents a large shift in how we think about communication, privacy and security. By harnessing the power of physics, it promises to create a network that\u2019s faster, more secure and more private than anything we\u2019ve seen before. While the technology is still emerging, it has the potential to change the internet forever.",

      "A new way to explore the outdoors",
      "CORLEO isn\u2019t your typical off-road vehicle. Instead of wheels, it has four robotic legs that move independently, allowing it to handle uneven ground like rocks, grass and steep inclines. Kawasaki says the design was inspired by the skeletal structure of lions. The name CORLEO is derived from Cor Leonis, the brightest star in the constellation Leo. Riders mount it like they would a horse, but instead of gripping handlebars or using pedals, you control CORLEO with your body. Lean forward, and it moves ahead. Shift your weight to the side, and it adjusts its steps accordingly.",
      "CORLEO is also environmentally friendly. It uses a battery paired with a 150cc hydrogen engine. The hydrogen engine generates electricity, which is stored in the battery. Kawasaki has been pushing hydrogen-powered vehicles for years, and CORLEO is their latest effort to combine sustainability with innovation.",

    "published": "Sat, 19 Apr 2025 04:00:30 -0400",
    "summary": "A California trial lawyer breaks down an analysis of what the judge in the Menendez brothers resentencing hearings is considering when factoring in a potential prison release.",
    "story": [
      "A California legal analyst and trial lawyer says there are many factors a judge will consider on whether Erik and Lyle Menendez are fit to be released from prison.",
      "LOS ANGELES \u2013 As the fate of the Menendez brothers is paused for another month, a legal analyst and trial lawyer says the fact that their freedom is even a discussion is thanks to a new law signed in by Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "Roger Bonakdar, a California-based attorney, shared with Fox News Digital that after nearly 35 years behind bars, Erik and Lyle Menendez were given new hope to leave prison behind thanks to former Los Angeles County George Gascon and the passing of AB 600.",
      "The law allows individuals who remain incarcerated under sentences that were imposed when harsher, less flexible laws were in effect, to petition for a review of their sentences, so they can benefit from more recent legislative reforms that focus on rehabilitation, according to the law's text.",
      "\"What's happening is that the prior DA Gascon, infamous for certain policies and practices that he instituted in LA County which many credit with the explosion of violent crime and theft in LA, had filed a motion with the court to have the Menendez brothers re-sentenced,\" Bonakdar explained.",
      "MENENDEZ BROTHERS CASE: WHAT'S NEXT FOR KILLERS AFTER DEFENSE, DA SPAR OVER RESENTENCING",
      "Lyle, left, and Erik Menendez sit with defense attorney Leslie Abramson, right, in Beverly Hills Municipal Court during a hearing, Nov. 26, 1990.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Nick Ut)",
      "Bonakdar said that Gascon's argument was that the Menendez brothers are \"allegedly no longer a threat to the community and that they've served their debt to society,\" because of their ages at the time of their conviction and sentence.",
      "\"Gascon also apparently made a point of their defense, which didn't fly at trial, about their alleged sexual abuse at the hands of their now-murdered father. So, what's happening now is that the current DA has sought leave of court to withdraw or to take back Gascon's motion because he doesn't believe that the Menendez brothers are worthy or deserving of re-sentencing, and that's what's before the court.\"",
      "Bonakdar said what makes this hearing even more interesting is that the judge's powers are \"pretty broad\" and he can \"re-sentence them based on an offense that they weren't convicted of.\"",
      "\"The judge can even sentence them according to what is called a lesser included offense. That means an offense that acts are part of, or otherwise included in, the charge they went to trial on, which could include second-degree murder, even voluntary manslaughter, arguably under the statute. I would imagine the judge would be hard-pressed to go that far. But the powers that are given to a judge under the new statute are pretty sweeping. His discretion is very broad.\"",
      "The Menendez brothers and their supporters have been pushing for a resentencing hearing, saying the brothers were unfairly convicted to life in prison in 1996 for murdering their two parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills home in 1989.",
      "MENENDEZ BROTHERS ATTORNEY'S FOCUS ON GRISLY PHOTOS PART OF STRATEGIC DEFENSE PLAY TO FREE KILLERS: EXPERTS",
      "Lyle and Erik Menendez are seen as young men with their mugshots overlayed. The brothers are currently serving life sentences for the murders of their parents, Jos\u00e9 and Mary Louise \"Kitty\" Menendez in 1996.\u00a0 (Ronald L. Soble/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)",
      "Their first trial ended in a mistrial, when jurors couldn't agree on their fate. After a second trial in the mid-1990s, in which some of their evidence about the alleged sexual abuse was excluded, jurors agreed with prosecutors that their motive was greed.",
      "If the judge decides to resentence the Menendez brothers, it will then be up to the state parole board to consider their release.",
      "Because they were under 26 years old at the time of the murders, under current California law, new sentences of 50 years to life would immediately make them eligible for a parole hearing.",
      "\"If this goes fully their way, they could be granted parole and be released. Their sentence could be commuted,\" Bonakdar said. \"And the reason for that is there have been certain changes in California law which allow certain offenders, if they were young enough at the time they were convicted to seek re-sentencing under these compassionate release rules that say that, for example, if you were under the age of 26 at the the time of the commission, or if you had certain other mitigating circumstances, you're eligible to apply to the court for relief.\"",
      "Bonakdar added that what's unique here is that Gascon affirmatively filed for the relief, and that the judge rejected current DA Nathan Hochman's attempt to pull back Gascon's motion.",
      "MENENDEZ BROTHERS' AUNT HOSPITALIZED AFTER DA SHARES GRAPHIC PHOTOS IN COURT: 'THERE WAS NO WARNING'",
      "\"This is pretty important because under the new law, it says that where the government, where the prosecutor moves for the release, it actually entitles the defendant, the convict, to the benefit of a presumption, meaning that the person who's seeking the reduction of sentence starts off with a presumptive that they are eligible or that they should be granted parole. So that's something that's pretty unique and is not clear from what the judge ruled when rejecting Hochman's request to withdraw that initial motion,\" Bonakdar said.",
      "What also sets this whole hearing and saga apart from others is that the Menendez brothers \"definitely have a leg up over your average criminal defendant,\" Bonakdar said.",

      "\"First of all, obviously they had resources going into this. They had hired top flight lawyers. They threw everything in the kitchen sink at this trial,\" Bonakdar said about their trials in the '90s. \"They went the distance and even testified in their criminal trials. So it's not surprising that a defendant who had that level of resources and put in that level of effort might be seeking relief now.\"",
      "Bonakdar said that the biggest thing, though, is that Gascon affirmatively filed the motion.",
      "\"There is the argument that these defendants could have sought the clemency otherwise or filed a motion based on the change in the statute. The fact that Gascon, the former district attorney, filed this independently and affirmatively on behalf of these defendants really gives them a leg up going into the hearing. Most other defendants won't have that benefit,\" Bonakdar explained.",

      "Hochman has strongly opposed the resentencing, put in motion by Gascon, but said he would consider it if both brothers \"sincerely and unequivocally admit, for the first time in over 30 years, the full range of their criminal activity and all the lies that they have told about it.\"",
      "He said in a previous statement that the brothers \"have chosen to stubbornly remain hunkered down in their over 30-year-old bunker of lies, deceit, and denials,\" and that it's up to the court to factor in whether the \"lack of acceptance of responsibility for their murderous actions\" is enough to decide whether the Menendez brothers pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the community.",
      "Bonakdar said, in his opinion and viewpoint, that there are \"aggravating factors out there that the judge could consider and probably should\" before making his decision in May.",
      "\"Premeditated murder is an extremely serious and obviously by its nature, violent offense. And particularly, if you've got the mental ability to process the idea of murdering both your parents in cold blood, that's a grave public safety concern,\" Bonakdar said. \"The arguments on the other side are that at some point, time does heal wounds and that people can be rehabilitated and everyone is worthy of redemption. This is the argument that will be made on behalf of the Menendez brothers. While that may be true in some instances, I guess that remains to be seen for the Men\u00e9ndez boys.\"",

    "summary": "The Hamas terrorist organization is said to be struggling with a financial crisis amid Israel\u2019s current campaign. The crisis comes amid rising protests, against the group&apos;s rule.",
    "story": [
      "For the first time since Hamas seized power 18 years ago, Gazans are speaking out against Hamas at great personal risk, Fox News' Mike Tobin reports.",
      "Amid Israel\u2019s ongoing military campaign against Hamas terrorists in Gaza, the terror group is reportedly facing an unprecedented financial crisis.",
      "Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that salary payments to many Hamas government employees have ceased, and even senior officials received only half of their usual pay during Ramadan. Terrorists, who once earned $200 to $300 a month, are struggling to get paid as the IDF tightens its grip, and the flow of humanitarian aid has been cut off since the collapse of the ceasefire.",
      "Dr. Michael Milstein, head\u00a0of the Forum for\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0Studies at Tel Aviv University, said that while financial difficulties are mounting, Hamas operatives are motivated more by ideology than money. \"It\u2019s not just about a paycheck,\" Milstein said. \"Hamas provides essential supplies like food, water and medical care to families, which is crucial in today\u2019s Gaza.\" Despite the squeeze, Milstein noted that Hamas has weathered similar financial crises in the past without collapsing.",
      "ISRAEL LAUNCHES NEW GROUND OPERATION IN GAZA",
      "Israeli troops encircle Tel al-Sultan in Gaza.\u00a0 (IDF)",
      "\"Two days ago, the IDF killed the battalion commander of the Sajia area for the fifth time. Today, there\u2019s a new battalion commander. They fill the ranks. Hamas had 25,000 military operatives on October 7, and today it has a similar number, even though it lost twenty thousand. They manage with fewer experienced operatives, including children recruited from refugee camps, but manpower is always available in Gaza. As for weapons other than rockets, there is no problem\u2014RPGs, explosives, and rifles are available,\" Milstein added.",
      "Mkhaimar Abusada, a Gazan political analyst and currently a visiting scholar at Northwestern University, emphasized that Hamas will likely find ways to recover. \"Hamas has survived despite external financial pressures for nearly two decades,\" Abusada said. \"They\u2019ve bypassed sanctions and continue to exploit black market activities and taxes on merchants.\" While money may not drive Hamas fighters, Abusada suggested that the financial squeeze would complicate their operations but not lead to the group's collapse.",
      "Protesters spoke out against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. (Fox News)",
      "Before the war, according to the same Wall Street Journal article, Qatar provided Hamas with monthly transfers of $15 million, helping to build a stockpile of around $500 million, much of it stored in Turkey. However,\u00a0Israel\u2019s tightened blockade\u00a0has limited access to these funds, forcing Hamas to rely on new income sources, such as black-market activities and taxes. \"Still, Hamas continues to manage through illicit financial flows, circumventing Israel, U.S., and international sanctions with relative ease,\" Abusada said.",
      "Amid the financial crisis, protests against Hamas have started to gain traction. Initially small, demonstrations in Gaza City and surrounding areas have called for an end to Hamas\u2019 rule, with some protesters shouting, \"Hamas out!\" Abusada noted that these protests, originally anti-war and anti-Israel, have taken on anti-Hamas slogans. However, Hamas has responded violently. \"Hamas has made it clear that dissent will be crushed,\" he said, adding that some protesters have been tortured to death for their involvement.",

      "\"The amount of hatred Gazans have has increased a thousandfold since October 7,\" said Milstein, \"and it\u2019s all directed toward Israel and Hamas, both regarded as evil.\"",
      "Milstein said that while protests show unrest, they lack leadership and organization. \"Hamas has violently suppressed protests, and if this continues, they may die out,\" he said, pointing to a recent protest in Beit Lahiya that quickly dwindled.",

This is part of Israel Katz\u2019s Ministry of Defense plan to encourage those who wish to permanently relocate, aligning with President Trump\u2019s vision for the relocation of Gazans.",
      "\"The destruction of homes, schools, and hospitals, along with a lack of basic needs, has driven many to leave Gaza,\" Abusada said. \"But options are limited\u2014Europe is not open to large numbers of refugees from Gaza.\"",

We have the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. We shouldn\u2019t send prisoners to foreign countries, in my judgment.\u201d",

      "\u201cI call them homegrown criminals. I mean the home \u2014 the homegrown ones, the ones that grew up and something went wrong,\u201d Trump said, adding: \u201cWe are looking into it and we want to do it. I would love to do that.\u201d",

      "Deporting Abrego Garcia \u201cwas a screw-up,\u201d Kennedy told Welker, but added that he wasn\u2019t concerned about the administration doing anything similar in the future.",

      "The GOP senator, who made headlines earlier this year with his remarks about the need for Trump administration officials to follow court orders, told Welker that he doesn\u2019t believe the administration is ignoring federal judicial rulings in this case. Democrats, who point to judicial decisions that ordered the Trump administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d Abrego Garcia\u2019s return to the U.S., are alleging the contrary.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe that President Trump will defy a federal judge\u2019s order. If he does, I\u2019ll call him out on it,\u201d Kennedy told Welker, adding: \u201cI love the rule of law. I love it like the devil loves sin.\u201d",
      "Kennedy also spoke about Trump\u2019s comments this past week about Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, including the president\u2019s remarks that he is \u201cnot happy\u201d with Powell and that the chair\u2019s termination \u201ccannot come soon enough.\u201d",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman,\u201d Kennedy told Welker. \u201cI think the Federal Reserve ought to be independent.\u201d",
      "The senator also offered some advice to the two men following a week of Trump lobbing barbs at Powell, saying, \u201cI think that Jay Powell and President Trump need to sit down and, once again, have a hug and a cup of hot cocoa and work it out.\u201d"

      "Titled \u201cNotice of Termination of Parole,\u201d the email declared: \u201cIf you do not depart the United States\u00a0immediately\u00a0you will be subject to potential law enforcement actions that will result in your removal from the United States \u2014 unless you have otherwise obtained a lawful basis to remain here.\u201d It also states that \u201cany benefits you receive in the United States connected with your parole \u2014 such as work authorization \u2014 will also terminate.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo not attempt to remain in the United States \u2014 the federal government will find you,\u201d the email, a copy of which was reviewed by NBC News, concludes.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security email was intended for the millions of people living in the U.S. who fled unrest in countries such as Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and Nicaragua.",
      "But in the days following the email\u2019s distribution, shocking reports surfaced that U.S. citizens in Massachusetts, Arizona and Connecticut all received the notices.",
      "Nicole Micheroni, an immigration attorney from Boston and a U.S.-born citizen, said she received the notice last week.",
      "\u201cAt first I thought it was for a client, and then I kind of laughed about it a little bit, and then I was a little concerned,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a range of emotions that happened pretty quickly.\u201d",
      "A senior DHS official said in a statement that Customs and Border Protection was \u201cmonitoring communications and will address any issues on a case-by-case basis.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf a non-personal email \u2014 such as an American citizen contact \u2014 was provided by the alien, notices may have been sent to unintended recipients,\u201d the official said.",
      "Micheroni and other immigration experts agree that U.S. citizens who receive the email should not legitimately worry that they could face deportation.",
      "\u201cThis email was specifically addressed to people that entered the United States on parole, and parole means that the United States has agreed to let you into the United States and you don\u2019t otherwise have a visa or a reason to be here,\u201d Micheroni said. \u201cSo, if you\u2019re a U.S. citizen, you shouldn\u2019t be entering the United States on parole.\u201d",
      "Still, experts caution that U.S. citizens should take steps to protect themselves in the unlikely event that they are approached by immigration authorities contesting their citizenship.",
      "Kristen Harris, an immigration attorney in Chicago, advised that U.S. citizens who receive the notice should immediately seek counsel from an immigration attorney.",
      "\u201cThere is certainly no legal effect under current statute or regulation for a citizen to be \u2018parole terminated\u2019 given that especially a U.S. citizen would never, ever have been paroled in his or her life,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, given how ... fluid the current administration\u2019s interpretation is of existing law, I think checking in with private immigration council would actually be advisable.\u201d",
      "In recent weeks, the Trump administration and immigration authorities have stepped up efforts to deport noncitizens.",
      "Last month, the administration defied a judge\u2019s order and sent hundreds of men to a high-security prison in El Salvador, claiming they were all members of a Venezuelan gang known as Tren de Aragua. Some relatives of the men sent to the megaprison have strongly disputed claims that their family members are part of the gang.",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvador immigrant living in Maryland under a court-issued protective order, was among those sent to the prison in what federal officials called\u00a0an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d The administration has repeatedly\u00a0defied or ignored a court order\u00a0to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.",
      "Trump has also\u00a0floated the idea of deporting U.S. citizens\u00a0convicted of certain crimes in recent weeks.",
      "Harris and Micheroni recommend that U.S. citizens who receive the notice collect their documentation, including birth certificates and U.S. passports, to prove they are U.S. citizens in case they are approached by immigration authorities.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to cause people to panic, but I think if you find yourself accidentally on a list, it\u2019s not crazy, but just make sure you have some documentation prepared somewhere,\u201d Micheroni said.",
      "The attorneys also raised concerns that U.S. citizens could unintentionally be grouped with noncitizens in other scenarios.",
      "The New York Times recently reported that the Trump administration is moving to cancel the Social Security numbers of deported migrants by adding them to a list of deceased individuals, effectively blacklisting them from making or spending money.",
      "Micheroni said she logged on to her online Social Security account in recent days and confirmed that it remains active.",
      "\u201cThis particular email is hopefully not connected to the Social Security Administration canceling Social Security numbers, just because it sounds like this email went out to so many different people,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is a concern, and I think broader issues, errors like this or accidentally putting people on the wrong list has very serious consequences.\u201d",
      "Not all experts recommended taking action.",
      "Jonathan A. Grode, an immigration lawyer in Philadelphia, said U.S. citizens should largely ignore the notices if they receive them. Grode also received the email in recent days and didn\u2019t give it any attention.",
      "\u201cI know that I\u2019m a U.S. citizen, not on parole. I\u2019m not doing anything about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a good little giggle and deleted it.\u201d",
      "He suggested that the government likely knew it accidentally had American citizens on the list of email recipients but did not take steps to address the issue.",
      "\u201cThis is a government of sledgehammers, not scalpels, right? I personally believe that the United States is a very mature and effectuated country, and moves should be taken thoughtfully, pragmatically and carefully,\u201d he said. \u201cThis government does not share that opinion.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey want to be agents of change, and their way of doing it is very big and very bold and very aggressive,\u201d he added."

    "story": [
      "MIAMI \u2014 After Florida International University\u2019s police department entered into an agreement with the federal government to carry out immigration enforcement on campus, some students say they are terrified.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s scary and nerve-racking,\u201d said an undergraduate at the university.",
      "The student, who's not being identified because he lacks legal immigration status, told NBC News he came to the U.S. when he was 5 with his family after they were threatened by gangs in their native El Salvador. He said he was very focused in middle school and high school and took many Advanced Placement classes, knowing he had to work harder to have a shot at college.",
      "Now, the student is not sure if he'll continue at FIU next year. For now, he said he\u2019s avoiding certain parts of the university he considers risky. \u201cI've been trying to not go to the main areas of campus where police are,\u201d the student said.",
      "FIU is one of a number of universities in Florida that have signed agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under the 287(g) program, which trains local law enforcement officers to interrogate immigrants and detain them for potential deportation.",
      "In addition to FIU, the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida State University in Tallahassee, the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, and the University of South Florida in Tampa have in place agreements with ICE.",
      "Florida is the state with the most local agencies signing 287(g) agreements, including all of Florida\u2019s 67 county sheriffs. Dozens of cities have signed on, including some with large immigrant populations like Hialeah, Miami Springs and West Miami.",
      "It's part of Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' sweeping immigration measures, which are aligned with President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to carry out the largest deportation effort in U.S. history.",
      "\u201cFlorida is setting the example for states in combating illegal immigration and working with the Trump administration to restore the rule of law,\u201d\u00a0DeSantis said in February about the agreements with ICE.\u00a0\u201cBy allowing our state agents and law enforcement officers to be trained and approved by ICE, Florida will now have more enforcement personnel deputized to assist federal partners. That means deportations can be carried out more efficiently, making our communities safer as illegal aliens are removed.\u201d",
      "At FIU, where over 63% of the student population is Hispanic or Latino, the cooperation has alarmed many. Early in the week, many FIU students on campus seemed unaware of the new collaboration with ICE, but among those at risk of deportation, the fear is palpable.",
      "Faculty and students have mobilized and held protests against FIU\u2019s decision to collaborate with ICE. At a protest Tuesday, students held a banner that read \u201cNo ICE @FIU.\u201d",
      "In an emailed statement, FIU said their police department \u201chas signed a cooperation agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in compliance with Governor Ron DeSantis\u2019 directive to law enforcement agencies.\u201d",
      "ICE did not immediately respond to a request to comment.",
      "On Friday at a faculty senate session, professors issued a resolution asking FIU President Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez and the campus police chief to withdraw from the agreement with ICE. Nu\u00f1ez was DeSantis' former lieutenant governor who became FIU\u2019s acting president in February, following a board vote requested by the governor.",
      "\u2018I try to act normal\u2019",
      "After nearly four years as an undergraduate at FIU, a student said he was looking over his shoulder.",
      "The student requested anonymity because he lacks legal immigration status. He came with his parents from Central America when he was 9.",
      "\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m being persecuted even though I haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel more anxious. I don\u2019t know why but I see more police on campus recently. I try to act normal and dress nice.\u201d",
      "The student said that when he and other undocumented students found out about the collaboration, \u201ceveryone was scared. People cried. Everyone feels it\u2019s unfair.\u201d",
      "One FIU professor described the atmosphere as \"reminiscent\" of Latin American universities and what it was like in the Soviet Union. The professor's name is being withheld because they're not authorized to speak in areas outside their expertise.",
      "\u201cThis is how it used to be in Latin America. The government would look into the university to make sure that you were towing the line,\u201d the professor said. \u201cWe\u2019re going in that direction now.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe campus police is here to protect students from crime. They are not supposed to enforce the policy of the federal government. Immigration policy is federal policy,\u201d the professor said.",
      "The cooperation with ICE comes as the Trump administration has cracked down on some foreign students, revoking their visas and ordering them to leave the country immediately. At least 36 students in Florida have been stripped of their visas, 18 at FIU.",
      "The administration's actions are a stark departure from the policy set in place over a decade ago that restricted federal immigration agencies from carrying out immigration enforcement in sensitive locations like schools and churches. The Trump administration ended that guidance in January, making students on college campuses potential immigration enforcement targets.",
      "Universities in Florida have seen a number of changes under DeSantis. Teaching critical race theory has been banned; centers to promote center-right ideas have been created; a recent law limits the content taught at public universities; and multiple faculty members have been terminated after the state adopted post-tenure reviews of professors.",
      "The Dream.US, an organization that awards college scholarships to  \"Dreamers\" \u2014  young adults who've been in the U.S. since they were very young but lack legal immigration status \u2014 announced it's withdrawing scholarships for hundreds of students in eight Florida universities. Gaby Pacheco, president of Dream.US, cited Florida's  decision to end in-state tuition for students without legal immigration status \u2014 which takes effect in July \u2014\u00a0as well as the universities' 286(g) agreements with ICE. \u201cWe do not feel our students will be safe on campus,\" Pacheco told the Miami Herald.",
      "Melissa Tavara and Katerin Crespo, both theater majors at FIU, said they worried about how the campus police will carry out their new duties as they walked across campus on a recent afternoon. Both are U.S. citizens but worry about racial profiling.",
      "\u201cHow else would you look for these students,\u201d said Tavara.",
      "Crespo said, \u201cThis creates fear. It\u2019s an international school. We are supposed to be a melting pot.\u201d"

      "TEL AVIV \u2014The Israeli Defense Forces faulted a series of \"professional failures\" and \"breaches of order\" in the March 23 incident in which Israeli soldiers killed 15 Palestinian aid workers in Gaza, an event that sparked widespread condemnation and calls for an independent investigation.",
      "In the summary of an internal report on the killings and a briefing to foreign media on Sunday, the IDF said it \u201cregrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians\u201d and announced that it had discharged the field commander leading the implicated unit and formally reprimanded a senior officer.",
      "The report and the IDF\u2019s rare acceptance of blame marks the culmination of a weeks-long scandal that had heaped further criticism on Israel\u2019s military just days after it broke a two-month ceasefire agreement with Hamas and restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The controversy around the killings worsened after United Nations personnel recovered the bodies from a shallow mass grave near the scene of the incident, and cell phone footage found on one of the corpses revealed serious inconsistencies in the IDF\u2019s original version of events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a chain of professional mistakes but with no ethical gaps,\u201d said Brigadier General\u00a0Ephraim Defrin, the newly appointed IDF spokesperson, in a presentation to reporters Sunday evening. \u201cThere was never any intention to deceive the public.\u201d",
      "Some initial reports from Palestinian examiners claimed that some of the medics had been found with their arms bound. However, other Palestinian medics said there was no evidence that the medics had been restrained before they were shot execution-style, a claim also denied by the IDF.",
      "In a statement issued after the bodies were found, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said the targeting of the medics \u201ccan only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law, which the occupation continues to violate before the eyes of the entire world.\u201d",
      "The aid workers included paramedics, civil defense staff and a U.N. employee.",
      "Israel previously said its soldiers shot and killed individuals they considered to be \u201cterrorists\u201d who were \u201cadvancing suspiciously.\u201d The IDF also claimed that vehicles that were approaching its position lacked headlights or emergency signals. At the time, Israeli forces reported that they killed nine militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad.",
      "The military later walked that back after video footage from the Palestine Red Crescent emerged that challenged its version of events. NBC News reviewed footage from the phone of a paramedic who was killed, showing an ambulance with its headlights and emergency lights flashing at the moment the soldiers opened fire. The vehicle was clearly marked with the insignia of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Flashing lights from two other vehicles are also visible in the video.",
      "The investigation revealed \u201cseveral professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident,\u201d the IDF said.",
      "But the public report and presentation, which were led by retired Major General Yoav Har-Even, and that he said was conducted \u201coutside the chain of command,\u201d did not answer all of the questions surrounding the shootings.\u00a0It did not provide evidence to back up the Israeli military\u2019s contention that six of the 15 slain emergency workers were actually Hamas operatives, nor did it explain why the number of slain medics who the IDF considered terrorists had changed",
      "The report and presentation also left unclear why one of the surviving medics, Asaad al-Nassasra, was detained by the IDF and still remains in their custody.",
      "Alongside the report summary, Har-Even showed a video presentation that featured aerial surveillance of the early-morning shootings, including night-vision reconnaissance footage.",
      "The probe found that troops were hampered by poor visibility and misidentified ambulances and rescue vehicles as threats during a mission targeting Hamas operatives, according to Sunday's report. Har-Even laid partial blame on the soldiers\u2019 night vision goggles for leading to what he called the \u201ctragic and undesirable result of a complex combat situation.\u201d The goggles\u2019 limited peripheral perspective, among other factors, made it difficult for the soldiers to recognize the trucks as civilian emergency vehicles despite their flashing emergency lights, he said.",
      "Another strike on a U.N. vehicle resulted from a breach of operational rules, the IDF\u2019s report says.",
      "The field commander in charge of the operation on the ground, who the report did not name but whom IDF public relations officers identified as a major, was dismissed in part for \u201cproviding an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief.\u201d",
      "The commanding officer of the 14th Brigade\u00a0received a formal reprimand that will appear in his personnel file, the report summary stated, both because of his \u201coverall responsibility\u201d for the shooting and his \u201cmanagement of the scene afterward.\u201d"

    "published": "Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "A small number of people who have been fully vaccinated against measles may get sick if exposed to the virus, research finds. Why do these infections happen?",
    "story": [
      "More than 800 people in the U.S. have had measles since the beginning of the year, according to NBC News data. The majority of cases are in West Texas, where an outbreak that shows no signs of abating began in January.",
      "Nearly all of the cases are among people who haven\u2019t been vaccinated, but 3% of the identified cases are so-called breakthrough infections. People got sick despite being either partially or fully vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot.",
      "Infectious diseases doctors are at pains to emphasize that the MMR vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines on the market, but as Rodney Rohde, a professor at Texas State University explains, a small number of people who are fully vaccinated may get sick during a large outbreak.",
      "One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective at preventing measles, with the second dose increasing that to 97%.",
      "\u201cThe vaccine is highly effective,\u201d said Rohde. \u201cBut it means that after two doses, while 97 out of 100 people will develop strong immunity and be protected if exposed to measles, the remaining three out of 100 could still be vulnerable.\u201d",
      "The latest outbreak has seen claims circulating on social media from people who say they are fully vaccinated and still contracted a breakthrough infection, making them seriously unwell, something Rohde said is \u201cslightly possible.\u201d \u201cThey could fall into one of those small percentages that got the full vaccine but just didn\u2019t respond,\u201d he says.",
      "However, he said, it\u2019s also plausible that those people may not have realized they weren\u2019t fully vaccinated against measles. Research suggests that when breakthrough infections occur, the MMR vaccine still tends to provide some partial protection. \u201cIf someone vaccinated does get measles, it\u2019s often a milder version, sometimes called modified measles,\u201d says Rohde. \u201cA rash can still occur, but it may be less widespread [across the body], fainter or atypical, meaning it doesn\u2019t follow the classic pattern of starting at the hairline and spreading downwards. Fever is also less common or lower-grade. In classic measles, fevers can spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, but in modified cases, it\u2019s often milder or absent.\u201d",
      "According to Rohde, the same is true for other common measles symptoms:",
      "CoughRunny noseConjunctivitis, or red eyes",
      "Cough",
      "Runny nose",
      "Conjunctivitis, or red eyes",
      "\u201cThey may still occur, but are often less intense,\u201d he says. \u201cKoplik spots, which are tiny white spots in the mouth, are less commonly seen. Breakthrough cases are also generally less contagious, but still a potential source of transmission.\u201d",
      "People are contagious four days before and four days after the rash begins, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The rash usually appears 14 days after exposure.",
      "Rohde also suggests that people experiencing severe symptoms from a breakthrough infection may have just had a single vaccine dose, which still offers significant protection, but not quite as much as the full two-dose regimen. \u201cThese cases can be closer to classic measles than in two-dose breakthroughs, with a high fever which may last longer,\u201d he says. \u201cThe rash is usually a more typical measles rash and can be more extensive than in fully vaccinated breakthrough cases. They are also more likely to get possible complications.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s still the question of why these infections happen.",
      "As Rohde and others explain, there may be a number of reasons, ranging from the timing of vaccination to genetic variability in the immune response.",
      "Measles vaccine immunity is mostly stable",
      "While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called for the public to get vaccinated against measles, he also claimed in an interview with CBS News that \u201cthe vaccine wanes very quickly.\u201d",
      "Vaccine experts counter that the MMR shots offer lifelong protection.",
      "\u201cIf immunity waned a lot, you would see a lot of cases in vaccinated people in older age groups, and we\u2019re not seeing that in this Texas outbreak or any others in the recent past,\u201d said Scott Weaver, a microbiology and immunology professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who also works with the Global Virus Network coalition of experts. \u201cPeople seem to be solidly protected, and almost everybody for life, as far as we can tell.\u201d",
      "Unlike influenza or Covid, measles is a very stable virus that has evolved little to evade vaccine-induced immunity over time. In 2021, Mayo Clinic researchers published a study concluding that there\u2019s a near-zero probability of a novel measles virus naturally emerging with the capability of circumventing the MMR vaccine.",
      "While the virus isn\u2019t changing, it appears that in some rare cases, the body\u2019s own immune system can slowly stop producing antibodies against the virus. Based on international studies, scientists have concluded that it is possible for some children vaccinated against measles to lose their protection over the course of two decades.",
      "\u201cBecause measles is highly infectious, this waning is expected to cause some breakthrough infections,\u201d said Alexis Robert, a researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who authored a paper on long-term vaccine protection in 2024.",
      "All people respond to either vaccines or natural infections a little bit differently, according to Weaver.",
      "The MMR vaccine, which works by presenting the immune system with a live but weakened version of the measles virus, trains the body\u2019s immune cells to recognize different parts of the virus\u2019 proteins called epitopes and generate antibodies against them in the future, he said.",
      "An epitope refers to small segments of amino acids on a protein\u2019s structure that the immune system\u2019s antibodies learn to recognize and bind to, should the virus attempt to invade again in future.",
      "It\u2019s not unexpected that a few people respond poorly to any vaccine, Weaver said.",
      "\u201cSome people have a very robust response because they respond to many different [viral] epitopes, and some people, just by chance, have immune cells that can\u2019t recognize as many of those epitopes,\u201d he said. \u201cDifferences in our genetic makeup determine how many different epitopes we respond to and develop immune memory against.\u201d",
      "After measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 and no longer considered a public health threat, research into the virus slowed. With vaccine hesitancy rising and the U.S. close to losing its measles elimination status, some scientists see the need to study and monitor the rare cases of breakthrough infections.",
      "\u201cWhile transmission patterns show measles outbreaks are driven by groups of unvaccinated individuals, especially among children, a potential risk of infection years after vaccination still impacts what strategy is most effective and the coverage needed to eradicate measles,\u201d Robert said.",
      "How quickly does the measles vaccine take effect?",
      "Timing can also make a difference.\u00a0A child who had just received the MMR vaccine will still be vulnerable to measles within the first couple of weeks, especially during an intense outbreak where a lot of virus is circulating, Rohde said.",
      "\u201cIn most cases, the human immune system takes roughly two weeks to develop enough protection against the measles virus and many other pathogens,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you were exposed just before or after getting the vaccine, your body may not be at full strength.\u201d",
      "In some cases, for example people who are either born with a weakened immune system or develop conditions such as autoimmune diseases or blood cancers, the body may not mount as effective an immune response against measles, resulting in breakthrough infections.",
      "\u201cThere are people who just have an overall immune system that\u2019s just not as effective against many different infectious agents,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cWe know about people who are immune compromised for certain reasons, like they\u2019re HIV-infected, they\u2019re under chemotherapy for cancer, things like that, but there are some people who are just born with immune systems that don\u2019t function quite as well.\u201d",
      "Another plausible explanation is that people may have received a defective MMR vaccine, although Weaver said this is unlikely in the United States, where quality controls tend to be fairly stringent.",
      "\u201cIn the cases of measles, it\u2019s a live virus, so that virus could become less infectious if it\u2019s not stored properly and that could lead to less [immune] response,\u201d he said.",
      "When you might need a measles booster",
      "Whether you\u2019re more vulnerable to developing a breakthrough measles infection could also depend on when you were born. Before the first measles vaccines were developed in the 1960s, virtually everyone contracted the virus during childhood, providing those who survived with lifelong immunity.",
      "However, people who were born between 1957 and 1968 received a first-generation measles vaccine made using an inactivated virus that did not work so well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone born within this time frame should get at least one MMR dose.",
      "Between 1968 and 1989, most people received only a single MMR dose, making them slightly less well protected compared with people who got the standard two doses in the past 36 years.",
      "Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, suggested that if someone who got only a single dose is near a current measles outbreak or is traveling internationally to a country where the virus is endemic, it could be worth checking with with a doctor about getting another dose.",
      "\u201cEven if you\u2019re truly immune and you get another dose of MMR, there\u2019s no harm to that,\u201d Schaffner said."

    "story": [
      "In the coming weeks, Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs will go on trial in separate Manhattan courtrooms. The two defendants face different charges, different judges and different potential punishments.",
      "But the proceedings will share at least one element in common: testimony from a clinical and forensic psychologist named Dawn Hughes.",
      "The upcoming court cases will not be the first time Hughes has played a key role in dramatic legal sagas at the nexus of celebrity and power in the post-#MeToo era. In recent years, Hughes has taken the witness stand in other high-profile sexual misconduct trials that drew national attention.",
      "When the NXIVM sex cult leader Keith Raniere went on trial in 2019, Hughes was on hand to explain to jurors how serial sexual abusers \u201cgaslight\u201d their victims. Two years later, Hughes testified at R. Kelly\u2019s federal trial, telling jurors that the R&B singer had subjected victims to \u201cpsychological entrapment.\u201d",
      "Raniere was found guilty of racketeering, sex trafficking and possession of child pornography. R. Kelly was convicted in 2021 on one count of racketeering and eight counts of violating the Mann Act, a law that bars transporting people across state lines \u201cfor any immoral purpose.\u201d",
      "Hughes reached a new level of national awareness after testifying at the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial. She took the stand in May 2022, during the second month of the case, and rendered her professional judgment in no uncertain terms.",
      "\u201cMs. Heard was the victim of intimate partner violence,\u201d Hughes told jurors inside a wood-paneled courtroom in Fairfax County, Virginia. She had based that assessment in part on the nearly 30 hours she spent evaluating Heard, Depp\u2019s ex-wife. He vehemently denied her abuse claims.",
      "Heard ultimately lost the defamation case. Yet the outcome of the Depp-Heard trial evidently did nothing to diminish Heard\u2019s lawyer\u2019s esteem for Hughes. In an interview, Elaine Charlson Bredehoft described Hughes as \u201can outstanding expert \u2014 probably the best expert I\u2019ve had in 40 years of practice.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s extremely detailed. She\u2019s extremely thorough. When she goes in to talk about any aspect of the case, she\u2019s researched it thoroughly and she\u2019s reviewed all the evidence,\u201d Bredehoft added. \u201cShe\u2019s able to talk to a jury in lay person\u2019s terms \u2026 to be able to communicate some of these very difficult areas like domestic violence and rape.\u201d",
      "Hughes declined an interview request, saying in an email that she does \u201cnot speak with the press or media regarding ongoing matters.\u201d",
      "Hughes\u2019 professional specialties include interpersonal violence, traumatic stress and anxiety disorders, according to her website. She keeps an independent practice in New York City, where she is a clinical assistant professor of psychology at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital \u2013 Weill Cornell Medical College.",
      "Elizabeth Geddes, a former federal prosecutor who was part of the legal team that secured a conviction against R. Kelly in Brooklyn in 2021, said Hughes is skilled at explaining to jurors what many perpetrators of sexual abuse have in common \u2014 as well as behaviors commonly exhibited by victims of sexual misconduct.",
      "\u201cProsecutors rely on individuals like Dr. Hughes to help the jurors understand certain behaviors that may not come across at first glance,\u201d such as abusers\u2019 typical tactics for maintaining control over victims and why some victims do not immediately report assault or harassment to law enforcement officials, Geddes said.",
      "Geddes added that Hughes\u2019 extensive experience \u2014 something Geddes tapped as she sought to put R. Kelly behind bars \u2014 gives Hughes \u201ca lot of credibility\u201d with juries.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers have forcefully resisted prosecutors\u2019 plans to call Hughes as an expert witness. In a 35-page motion filed earlier this month, the rapper\u2019s team asked a judge to block her from taking the stand, arguing in part that her testimony would be \u201cadvocacy masquerading as expertise\u201d and must be \u201cexcluded in its entirety.\u201d",
      "Sign up for the \u201cDiddy on Trial\u201d newsletter for key developments and analysis",
      "Combs\u2019 team\u2019s motion includes the federal prosecutors\u2019 expert witness disclosure filing, which says Hughes\u2019 \u201ctestimony is expected to explain how the overarching dynamic of victimization is an abuse of power and control where the perpetrator engages in self-centered behavior to satisfy his own goals and desires regardless of the needs, wants, and well-being of the victim.\u201d",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian, who is overseeing the Combs case, said Friday he plans to rule on the scope of Hughes\u2019 testimony next week.",
      "In the Weinstein case, Judge Curtis Farber ruled that Hughes can provide testimony about the psychological and traumatic effects of rape and sexual assault.",
      "It remains to be seen how Weinstein\u2019s and Combs\u2019 lawyers will attempt to puncture Hughes\u2019 expertise as they defend their clients. Weinstein faces one count of rape in the third degree and two counts of criminal sexual act in the first degree. Combs faces charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and conspiracy to engage in prostitution.",
      "Both men have pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations of sexual misconduct.",
      "In at least one respect, Hughes is likely aware that testifying during megawatt trials might come at a cost. When she took the stand amid the Depp-Heard case, her WebMD profile was flooded with negative reviews. The social web was dominated by pro-Depp sentiment at the time, and the reviews accused Hughes of being biased against men.",
      "She never publicly addressed the digital firestorm. The reviews were taken down after they became the subject of news reports."

      "Self-defense classes geared toward LGBTQ people can be found sprinkled across the United States, and instructors and students say the skills these classes provide are giving attendees a boost of confidence and a sense of community in a fraught political environment.",
      "\u201cPretend someone\u2019s coming for you. How would you kick them if you were fighting for your life?\u201d an instructor at Queer Fight Club in St. Louis asked attendees during a recent self-defense class.",
      "Tori Lohmann, who is nonbinary, was among the nine students in the class. Lohmann said they never imagined joining a self-defense group but found themselves drawn to Queer Fight Club six months ago because of a lack of self-confidence stemming from the current political climate.",
      "\u201cI just felt so angry all the time about the state of the world,\u201d Lohmann, 26, told NBC News.",
      "Lohmann\u2019s concerns come at a time when heated rhetoric, federal policies and state legislation targeting the LGBTQ community \u2014 and particularly transgender and gender-nonconforming people \u2014\u00a0are on the rise. The American Civil Liberties Union has tracked 569 anti-LGBTQ state bills in 2025 so far, and since coming into office in January, President Donald Trump has signed several executive orders aimed at the trans and nonbinary community, including one that proclaims the U.S. government will only recognize two unchangeable sexes, male and female.",
      "Since attending Queer Fight Club twice a month starting in January and learning skills like a two-punch combo, various kicks and how to block hits, Lohmann said they \u201cfeel so much more confident in myself.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot just my ability to protect myself, but also to protect my community members,\u201d they added.",
      "\u2018You need to be prepared\u2019",
      "Mixed martial artist Mad Green, who founded Queer Fight Club in 2023, said they were inspired to create a self-defense group specifically tailored to LGBTQ people\u00a0after observing a lack of self-defense skills in the community. They wanted to share their knowledge and prepare other queer people for potential altercations.",
      "\u201cA lot of people, if they haven\u2019t been in a physical altercation, don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Green said, adding that it might be more likely than many people want to believe. \u201cYou need to be prepared for it.\u201d",
      "According to crime data published by the FBI last year, violent crime in the U.S. decreased by an estimated 3% from 2022 to 2023, while hate crime offenses increased by about 3.7% during the same period. Sexual orientation and gender identity were the third and fourth most common bias motivations in 2023, after race/ethnicity and religion.",
      "Queer Fight Club has a \u201cpay what you can\u201d policy, but Green said they ask those who can afford it to pay $15 a class to help pay for equipment and the cost of renting out a gym space.",
      "For the first year, Green said, there were about 20 people taking their biweekly self-defense classes. Since the November election, however, there\u2019s been increased interest in self-defense from the local queer community due to a \u201crefreshed fear\u201d around personal safety, and they\u2019ve had about 300 new people join at least one of their classes, Green said.",
      "\u201cMy favorite thing about fight club is seeing someone come in for the first time, and then they throw a punch, and they\u2019re like, \u2018I didn\u2019t know I could do that,\u2019\u201d Green said. \u201cJust letting people know that they can is really empowering by itself.\u201d",
      "\u2018Space for everyone to feel welcomed\u2019",
      "Andrew Degar and his wife, Sarah, founded the nonprofit Third Ward Jiu-Jitsu in Houston in 2019 after noticing a need for a more inclusive mixed martial arts space.",
      "\u201cWe were both coaching at an MMA gym and just hated the toxicity of the culture, and we wanted to open a space for everyone to feel welcomed and included,\u201d Degar said.",
      "The couple has been providing free self-defense classes to those in the Houston area since they first started their organization. They added classes specifically geared toward the LGBTQ community in August 2023, and Degar said they now have queer people from around the state who travel to take them.",
      "\u201cPeople are looking for a safe space,\u201d Degar said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for trustworthy people, and we are recognized as a resource in the queer community in Texas.\u201d",
      "Degar said Third Ward Jiu-Jitsu incorporates various scenarios during self-defense classes that focus on de-escalating conflicts while ensuring readiness in a variety of situations.",
      "\u201cWe go into how you may be feeling unsafe from someone you don\u2019t know, then we will even go as far as someone who\u2019s trying to harm you. Here\u2019s how we can attack back,\u201d he said.",
      "\u2018Protecting ourselves and each other\u2019",
      "Even in a state like New York, which is known to be among the most progressive when it comes to LGBTQ rights, reported hate crimes have surged in recent years. A report published by the Office of the New York State Comptroller last year found reported hate crimes increased nearly 70% from 2019 to 2023, with anti-LGBTQ crimes among the most common.",
      "Groups like Fearless Queers, which has been organizing self-defense pop-up classes throughout New York City since 2022, want LGBTQ people \u2014 and particularly trans people, who are more likely to be victims of violent crime \u2014 to feel less vulnerable in this environment.",
      "Co-founder Chrissy Rose said she also wants those who attend a Fearless Queers session \u201cto see capable queer and trans fighters leading their class.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want them to see the possibility that they can defend themselves and above all that they are worth that fight,\u201d she said.",
      "Rose and her co-founder, Tara Bankoff, who are both experienced in martial arts, said they\u2019ve seen demand for their classes rise this year, and they now serve hundreds of New Yorkers every month.",
      "Their main priorities, Rose said, are to ensure their classes are accessible and free, and to encourage attendees to trust themselves.",
      "While the group hosts various pop-ups for self-defense fundamentals and open-mat sessions for drills and solo practice, Rose said classes focus heavily on verbal techniques to avoid both victimization and criminalization.",
      "\u201cTrans women are stereotyped as being aggressive, meaning that if they defend themselves, they have a much higher risk of being criminalized or just socially punished for doing so than, say, a cisgender woman does,\u201d Rose explained. \u201cWe deprioritize striking and emphasize grappling and verbal self-defense in our curriculum for that reason.\u201d",
      "New York City resident Alexis Gee, who is nonbinary, said she reached out to Fearless Queers in November after feeling afraid and unprotected.",
      "\u201cIn communities like ours, we have to be vigilant about protecting ourselves and each other, and I didn\u2019t feel like that was something I was equipped to do,\u201d Gee, 32, said.",
      "In January, Gee had the courage to attend her first Fearless Queers class and has been going consistently since then.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to be alone in our fear, and we don\u2019t have to be aggressive and angry in order to feel protected,\u201d Gee said. \u201cWe just need to know who our allies are and how to reach them.\u201d"

      "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Bowen Yang defended \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d star Aimee Lou Wood after the actress criticized the comedy show for a sketch that mocked her appearance.",
      "Last weekend\u2019s \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d parody, a prerecorded political spoof dubbed \u201cThe White Potus,\u201d ridiculed members of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and inner circle. In one scene, Sarah Sherman, who portrays Wood\u2019s \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d character Chelsea, displayed a large set of false teeth while speaking in an exaggerated British accent.",
      "The sketch came less than a week after the season finale of the popular HBO show, a social satire that follows a dysfunctional group of wealthy guests staying at a luxury resort. Hours after the \u201cSNL\u201d parody aired, Wood shared via a series of Instagram stories that she found the sketch \u201cmean and unfunny.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch a shame cuz I had such a great time watching it a couple weeks ago,\u201d Wood wrote.\u00a0\u201cYes, take the piss for sure \u2014 that\u2019s what the show is about \u2014 but their must be a cleverer, more nuanced, less cheap way?\u201d",
      "Yang told Extra on Thursday that Wood\u2019s reaction to the sketch was \u201ccompletely valid.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith parody, you kind of forget the sort of human, emotional cost that it sort of extols on someone,\u201d Yang said, adding that \u201ceveryone at \u2018SNL\u2019\u201d is a fan of Wood\u2019s and the show.",
      "Wood also shared on Instagram that messages of support have poured in from viewers, and that she\u2019s received \u201capologies from SNL\u201d as well.\u00a0Representatives from \u201cSNL\u201d were not immediately available for comment.",
      "In the scene that made her teeth the butt of the joke, Jon Hamm, who plays Robert F. Kennedy Jr., frantically suggests taking fluoride out of the drinking water \u2014 something the real Kennedy has stated he\u2019s pursuing \u2014\u00a0before expressing worries about what that might \u201cdo to people\u2019s teeth.\u201d",
      "The sketch then cuts to Sherman\u2019s Chelsea, who shows off her enlarged teeth as she responds, \u201cFluoride? What\u2019s that?\u201d",
      "In a follow-up Instagram story, Wood said she\u2019s happy to have \u201ctaken the piss out of [her] when it\u2019s clever and in good spirits.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut the joke was about fluoride. I have big gap teeth not bad teeth,\u201d Wood wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t mind caricature \u2014 I understand that\u2019s what \u2018SNL\u2019 is. But the rest of the skit was punching up and I/Chelsea was the only one punched down on.\u201d",
      "In the days following the \u201cSNL\u201d parody, Wood posted an Instagram story thanking Sherman for sending along a bouquet of flowers as an apology. The \u201cSNL\u201d comedian had been getting backlash on social media for her portrayal of Wood\u2019s Chelsea.",
      "Yang said in his interview with Extra that the episode was a reminder that \u201cparody can go too far sometimes, and that we as comedians can take account for that instead of banging our foot and saying that we should be allowed to say whatever we want.\u201d",
      "Wood has previously expressed her frustration with the conversation around her teeth, which have become a subject of intrigue among some viewers who say they pose a refreshing contrast to the look of Hollywood veneers.",
      "She told GQ earlier this month that while she\u2019s glad her teeth are \u201csymbolizing rebellion and freedom\u201d for some, she\u2019s growing tired of the discussion.",
      "\u201cThe whole conversation is just about my teeth, and it makes me a bit sad because I\u2019m not getting to talk about my work. They think it\u2019s nice because they\u2019re not criticizing.\u201d Wood said. \u201cAnd, I have to go there. \u2026 I don\u2019t know if it was a man would we be talking about it this much? It\u2019s still going on about a woman\u2019s appearance.\u201d"

      "President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0is registering the worst economic approval numbers of his presidential career amid broad discontent over his handling of tariffs, inflation and government spending, according to the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey.",
      "The survey found that the boost in economic optimism that accompanied Trump\u2019s re-election has disappeared, with more Americans now believing the economy will get worse than at any time since 2023 and with a sharp turn toward pessimism about the stock market.",
      "More from CNBC",
      "Nearing retirement? These strategies can protect savings from tariff volatility Top Wall Street analysts like these dividend-paying energy stocks Marijuana holiday 4/20 coincides with Easter and Passover this year. Here\u2019s what to know",
      "Nearing retirement? These strategies can protect savings from tariff volatility",
      "Top Wall Street analysts like these dividend-paying energy stocks",
      "Marijuana holiday 4/20 coincides with Easter and Passover this year. Here\u2019s what to know",
      "The survey of 1,000 Americans across the country showed 44% approving of Trump\u2019s handling of the presidency and 51% disapproving, slightly better than CNBC\u2019s final reading when the president left office in 2020. On the economy, however, the survey showed Trump with 43% approval and 55% disapproval, the first time in any CNBC poll that he has been net negative on the economy while president.",
      "Trump\u2019s Republican base remains solidly behind him, but Democrats, at minus-90 net economic approval, are 30 points more negative than their average during his first term, and independents are 23 points more negative. Blue collar workers, who were key to the president\u2019s election victory, remain positive on the Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, but their disapproval numbers have shot up by 14 points compared to their average for his first term.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump was re-elected specifically to improve the economy, and so far, people are not liking what they\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Jay Campbell, partner with Hart Associates, the Democratic pollster on the survey.",
      "The poll was conducted April 9-13 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",
      "The results show that Trump has so far been able to convince only his base that his economic policies will be good for the country over time: 49% of the public believe the economy will get worse over the next year, the most pessimistic overall result since 2023. That figure includes 76% of Republicans who see the economy improving. But 83% of Democrats and 54% of independents see the economy getting worse. Among those believing the president\u2019s policies will have a positive impact, 27% say it will take a year or longer. However, 40% of those who are negative about the president\u2019s policies say they are hurting the economy now.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a turbulent, kind of maelstrom of change when it comes to how people feel about what\u2019s going to happen next,\u201d said Micah Roberts, managing partner with Public Opinion Strategies, the Republican pollsters for the survey. \u201cThe data \u2026 suggests more than ever that it\u2019s the negative partisan reaction that\u2019s driving and sustaining discontent and trepidation about what comes next.\u201d",
      "While partisanship is the most significant part of the president\u2019s negative showing, he loses some support among Republicans in key areas like tariffs and inflation, and has seen a notable deterioration among independents.",
      "Tariffs look to be a substantial part of the overall public\u2019s discontent. Americans disapprove of across-the-board tariffs by a 49 to 35 margin, and majorities believe they are bad for American workers, inflation and the overall economy. Democrats give tariffs a thumbs down by an 83-point margin and independents by 26 points. Republicans approve of the tariffs by a 59-point spread \u2014 20 points below their 79% net approval of the president.",
      "Large majorities of Americans see Canada, Mexico, the E.U. and Japan as more of an economic opportunity for the United States rather than an economic threat. In fact, all are viewed more favorably than when CNBC asked the question during Trump\u2019s first term. The data suggest the public, including majorities of Republicans, do not embrace the antipathy the president has expressed toward those trading partners. On China, however, the public sees it as a threat by a 44% to 35% margin, substantially worse than when CNBC last asked the question in 2019.",
      "The president\u2019s worst numbers come on his handling of inflation, which the public disapproves of by a 37% to 60% margin, including strong net negatives from Democrats and independents. But at 58%, it\u2019s the lowest net positive approval from Republicans for any of the issues asked about the president. Fifty-seven percent of the public believes we will soon be, or are currently in, a recession, up from just 40% in March 2024. The figure includes 12% who think the recession has already begun.",
      "The public also disapproves of the president\u2019s handling of federal government spending, 45% to 51%, and foreign policy, 42% to 53%.",
      "Trump\u2019s best numbers come on immigration, where his handling of the southern border is approved by a 53% to 41% margin, and deportation of undocumented immigrants is approved 52% to 45%. The president achieved a slight majority of support from independents on deportations and 22% support from Democrats on the southern border. While still modest, it\u2019s the best-performing issue for Trump among Democrats.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans have turned more negative on the stock market than they\u2019ve been in two years. Some 53% say it\u2019s a bad time to invest, with just 38% saying it\u2019s a good time. The numbers represent a sharp turnaround from the stock market optimism that greeted the president\u2019s election. In fact, the December survey represented the sharpest swing toward market optimism in the survey\u2019s 17-year history and the April survey is the sharpest turn toward pessimism.",
      "The president\u2019s troubles with his approval rating do not appear to be translating for now into significant potential gains for Democrats. Asked about congressional preference, 48% of the public supports Democratic control and 46% supports Republican control, barely changed from CNBC\u2019s March 2022 survey."

      "\u201cI call them homegrown criminals. I mean the home \u2014 the homegrown ones, the ones that grew up and something went wrong,\u201d Trump said, adding: \u201cWe are looking into it and we want to do it. I would love to do that.\u201d",
      "Kennedy also spoke to moderator Kristen Welker about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who the Trump administration admits was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, even as it alleges that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang. (Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife and attorneys deny the allegation.)",
      "Deporting Abrego Garcia \u201cwas a screw-up,\u201d Kennedy told Welker, but added that he wasn\u2019t concerned about the administration doing anything similar in the future.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see any pattern here. I\u2019ve been listening to my Democratic friends say for, I don\u2019t know, since God was a child, that Trump is a threat to democracy. I don\u2019t see any pattern here. I see a screw-up,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "The GOP senator, who made headlines earlier this year with his remarks about the need for Trump administration officials to follow court orders, told Welker that he doesn\u2019t believe the administration is ignoring federal judicial rulings in this case. Democrats, who point to judicial decisions that ordered the Trump administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d Abrego Garcia\u2019s return to the U.S., are alleging the contrary.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe that President Trump will defy a federal judge\u2019s order. If he does, I\u2019ll call him out on it,\u201d Kennedy told Welker, adding: \u201cI love the rule of law. I love it like the devil loves sin.\u201d",
      "Kennedy also spoke about Trump\u2019s comments this past week about Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, including the president\u2019s remarks that he is \u201cnot happy\u201d with Powell and that the chair\u2019s termination \u201ccannot come soon enough.\u201d",
      "Federal Reserve chairs are typically appointed by presidents and confirmed by the Senate to serve four-year terms, boosting their independence from the current administration in power.",
      "Powell was first nominated by Trump during his first term, in 2017, and he was nominated to serve a second term by then-President Joe Biden in 2022.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman,\u201d Kennedy told Welker. \u201cI think the Federal Reserve ought to be independent.\u201d",
      "The senator also offered some advice to the two men following a week of Trump lobbing barbs at Powell, saying, \u201cI think that Jay Powell and President Trump need to sit down and, once again, have a hug and a cup of hot cocoa and work it out.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Jason Isaacs isn\u2019t planning on getting an honorary degree from Duke anytime soon.",
      "Isaacs appeared on the April 17 episode of SiriusXM\u2019s \u201cLiterally! with Rob Lowe\u201d podcast and chatted with the show's host about the unexpected controversy between \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d and the North Carolina-based university.",
      "After Rob Lowe shared that his son, Matthew Lowe, attended Duke University for college, Isaacs asked whether or not he had seen \u201cthe fuss online\u201d about his character wearing a Duke T-shirt.",
      "During Season 3 of the HBO hit, Isaacs' character Timothy Ratliff  learns while on vacation that he is under investigation for alleged financial crimes back in the United States. At one point, while wearing a Duke T-shirt, he contemplated a murder-suicide scene with himself and his family, with depictions shown on-screen of his violent ideations.",
      "The scene prompted a statement from Duke University, who claimed that the show did not have the authorization to use the college's logos in the show.",
      "Isaacs responded to the controversy on the podcast, explaining the backstory behind why he was wearing the T-shirt in the first place.",
      "He shared that both his character and his older son, Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger) were alumni of Duke, while his wife, Victoria (Parker Posey) and daughter Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook) were alums of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This led to their younger son Lochlan (Sam Nivola) to struggle with his decision on which college to attend.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re thinking about costumes, I\u2019m talking to Alex, the wonderful Emmy-winning costume designer, I said maybe he wears a Duke T-shirt to sleep in,\u201d Isaacs explained. \u201cSo, we got a Duke T-shirt to wear when I\u2019m sleeping and I\u2019m pretty sure they got it cleared because as you know you don\u2019t ever go on television without getting all of the logos cleared.\u201d",
      "He went on to explain the scene and subsequent controversy, adding, \u201cThere are scenes in it in which I am suicidal and even homicidal, and they are the ones in which I am wearing my Duke T-shirt because it\u2019s bedtime.\u201d",
      "\u201cWell, someone at Duke decided that was really untoward and was not happy with the association,\u201d Isaacs continued. \u201cOther people online were pointing out that there are real life alumni of Duke\u2019s to be far more worried about than a fictional alumni.\u201d",
      "Not everyone was unhappy with Isaacs\u2019 character, though.",
      "The actor recalled being in Virginia and explained that people had driven in from Durham, North Carolina to see him at a convention.",
      "\u201cThey drove just to tell me that they thought my accent was accurate and I shouldn\u2019t listen to people who don\u2019t know what a Durham, North Carolina accent is,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they brought me Duke T-shirts, so now I have a selection of Duke T-shirts. I didn\u2019t wear one today. If I\u2019d known, I\u2019d have it on now, but I am intending to wear them whenever there\u2019s a camera around. So sorry, Duke. There goes my honorary degree.\u201d",
      "When Lowe pointed out that Duke was in the Final Four during March Madness, Isaacs joked, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if I went on and sang the national anthem?\u201d",
      "At the time of Duke\u2019s initial statement, Frank Tramble, vice president for communications, marketing and public affairs at Duke, Frank Tramble, told TODAY.com in a statement that Duke did not \u201capprove the use of its marks\u201d in \u201cThe White Lotus.\u201d",
      "\u201cDuke appreciates artistic expression and creative storytelling, but characters prominently wearing apparel bearing Duke\u2019s federally registered trademarks creates confusion and mistakenly suggests an endorsement or affiliation where none exists,\u201d the statement read. \u201c\u2019The White Lotus\u2019 not only uses our brand without permission, but in our view uses it on imagery that is troubling, does not reflect our values or who we are, and simply goes too far.\u201d",
      "This story references\u00a0suicide. If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.\u00a0Call or text 988 or chat at\u00a0988lifeline.org."

But for their latest project, supernatural thriller \u201cSinners,\u201d the actor takes on a challenge he has never encountered before in their history of working together: playing twins.",
      "In Coogler\u2019s horror epic, which is set in 1930s Mississippi, Jordan leads an impressive cast, including stars like Wunmi Mosaku\u00a0and Hailee Steinfeld, as he portrays twins Smoke and Stack. \u201cSinners\u201d shows Jordan's twins make a mysterious and unexpected return to their roots after spending time in Chicago among local gangsters. The powerful brothers have a reputation that precedes them, invoking feelings of fear, admiration and love in each character they encounter.",
      "While Smoke, who mostly wears shades of blue in the flick, has a cutthroat attitude and a hardness to him, Stack, donning suits with red accessories and gold in his teeth, is slightly more playful and trusting.",
      "To make each twin come alive on screen, the actor had to film scenes multiple times as he transformed into each brother between takes. Jordan tells TODAY.com what he did to prepare for the double role and how he was able to develop each character, which had subtle but impactful differences.",
      "\u201cRyan had these two brothers, the twins Noah and Logan Miller, and they were like twin consultants,\u201d he shares. \u201cSo I got an opportunity to talk with them about their experiences growing up as twins and the psychology behind it.\u201d",
      "He said the Millers helped him get into the mindset he needed to convincingly play twins with an unbreakable bond.",
      "\u201cThey walked me through, like, a twin meditation, that got into just the psyche of them and that bond and that connection,\u201d Jordan continues.",
      "With the Millers' insight, the actor then worked to form Smoke and Stack\u2019s separate identities. For both brothers, the 38-year-old star used a southern twang. Jordan explains to TODAY.com how he was able to refine the accent.",
      "The \u201cCreed\u201d star said he worked with a \u201cdialect coach, who helped break down the more physical element of them all, of how they walked, and talked, and their mannerisms and all sorts of things that you guys get a chance to see on the screen.\u201d",
      "Jordan also credits Coogler\u2019s script \u2014 which includes moments where Smoke and Stack reveal hints about their dark past \u2014 for assisting him in perfecting the characters. Additionally, there are scenes with Steinfeld\u2019s character Mary and Mosaku\u2019s character Annie that inform the audience how Smoke and Stack have changed since they were last in town.",

      "\u201cThere was definitely a song that we played, Michael and I, around some of our scenes,\" Mosaku says. \"We played Sade\u2019s \u2018By Your Side.\u2019 That\u2019s a song that we used to get into a moment together.\u201d",

      "Blue Origin's all-female crew successfully made it to space, but when it comes to whether they are considered astronauts, former federal guidelines are bringing them back down to Earth.",
      "Earlier this week, Blue Origin's star-studded female flight crew, which included singer Katy Perry and journalist Gayle King, reached the edge of space and entered orbit. Their automated flight marked a milestone for commercial space travel but also sparked controversy and discussion along the way, especially over what it truly takes to earn the title of \"astronaut.\"",
      "In an April 17 post on X, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy described the team as \"brave and glam\" but underscored why the team lacks the achievements and criteria it takes to be recognized by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as astronauts, a designation that has a high bar.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. commercial space industry is an inspiring project which showcases American ingenuity and exceptionalism,\u201d Duffy wrote in his post. \u201cBut the last FAA guidelines under the Commercial Space Astronaut Wings Program were clear: Crewmembers who travel into space must have \u2018demonstrated activities during flight that were essential to public safety, or contributed to human space flight safety.\u2019\u201d",
      "The flight's six women \u2014 which, in addition to Perry and King, included aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen,\u00a0film producer Kerianne Flynn, and journalist Lauren S\u00e1nchez,\u00a0who is notably engaged to Blue Origin founder\u00a0Jeff Bezos \u2014 are highly accomplished in their respective fields.",
      "But when it comes to their space journey, Duffy says they do not meet the FAA\u2019s criteria.",
      "\u201cThe crew who flew to space this week on an automated flight by Blue Origin were brave and glam, but you cannot identify as an astronaut,\u201d continued Duffy\u2019s post about the proper terminology regarding what they achieved. \u201cThey do not meet the FAA astronaut criteria.\u201d",
      "Who is considered an astronaut?",
      "The answer to this varies depending on who you ask.",
      "The FAA's now-retired Commercial Space Astronaut Wings Program required travelers to meet two standards: flown at least 50 miles  above Earth and performed duties essential to public or human spaceflight safety.",
      "The FAA\u2019s Commercial Space Astronaut Wings Program was established in 2004 and\u00a0officially ended in 2021 in anticipation of the commercial space tourism era. Still, the Wings Program continues to maintain a complete list of FAA Commercial Space Astronaut Wings recipients. Bowe, Nguyen, Flynn, King, Perry, and S\u00e1nchez are all recognized on the website\u00a0but are not listed as recipients of the FAA's Commercial Space Astronaut Wings, as none of them held operational roles while on board.",
      "Outside FAA standards, NASA defines an astronaut as someone selected to join its astronaut corps and who has made \"star sailing\" their profession.",
      "Meanwhile, Merriam-Webster also uses profession as a defining factor, noting the term refers to \"a person whose profession is to travel beyond Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\" In its broader definition, the dictionary defines an astronaut as \"any person who travels beyond the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\""

      "HBO describes the show as \u201ca realistic examination of the challenges facing health care workers in today\u2019s America as seen through the lens of the frontline heroes working in a modern-day hospital in Pittsburgh.\u201d",
      "Noah Wyle, the show's lead, who previously starred on \"ER,\" told Variety in January that Dr. Joe Sachs, who was a technical advisor on \"ER,\" helped with \"The Pitt\" to ensure the writing was accurate.",
      "\"He puts everything into making sure that the realism is on the page, on the stage, and making sure that the community that he comes from is being honored and the stories that they want told are being depicted,\" Wyle said.",
      "And viewers are loving it. Doctors even told The New York Times that they feel \u201cseen\u201d by the series.",
      "But one plot line in particular has prompted feedback from a particular group of health professionals: social workers.",
      "Episode 7 addresses what's known as the mandatory reporting process, after the wife of a patient shares with a doctor that she suspects her husband is abusing their daughter.",
      "In most states, including Pennsylvania, people in certain professions \u2014 such as health care workers \u2014 are required by law to report suspected cases of child abuse or neglect, according the National Association of Mandated Reporters. How to report the suspected abuse depends on the state, but it's often by phone or online.",
      "In the episode, Susan Dunn (Jessica Morris) arrives to the hospital with her adolescent daughter, Alana (Ivy George), as her husband, Silas (Tyler Poelle), is taken into surgery. After medical tests reveal he has high levels of the hormone progesterone, Susan admits to giving it to him.",
      "\u201cI put it in his coffee every morning. I thought if I could kill his libido, he\u2019d stop. ... I think he\u2019s molesting our daughter,\" Susan tells Dr. Trinity Santos, played by Isa Briones.",
      "Santos reports this claim to Dr. Michael \u201cRobby\u201d Robinavitch, played by Wyle, including some additional details from Susan about what exactly she believes Silas is doing to their daughter. Susan also says Alana's behavior has changed and she's struggling in school.",
      "\"It's grooming, and we are mandated reporters of child abuse in Pennsylvania,\" Santos says.",
      "The hospital's social worker, Kiara, played by Krystel McNeil, disagrees, though. \"There's nothing to report unless we have proof,\" Kiara says. \"Right now, it's all speculative.\"",
      "\"We can't do anything unless the daughter comes forward,\" Kiara adds. \"We can try to talk to her.\"",
      "But this is a less-than-accurate portrayal of how the mandatory reporting process usually works.",
      "A TikTok by social worker Rachel LaPointe explains what would have happened in real life.",
      "\u201cIn the vast majority of states, it's only the suspicion of child abuse that kickstarts your mandate to report,\" LaPointe explains. \"A parent saying they believe this is going on inside of their home is absolutely enough suspicion to qualify.\"",
      "Bambi Fisher, director of Women and Children\u2019s Health in the Department of Social Work Services at Mount Sinai Kravis Children\u2019s Hospital, agrees. She tells TODAY.com that this portrayal is \"absolutely incorrect\" if the daughter is a minor. (The show doesn't state how old she is, but the actor who plays her is currently 17.)",
      "\"I think any social worker who's been trained by child protection protocols would disagree\" with \"The Pitt's\" portrayal, Fisher says. \"The mandate is suspicion of abuse and neglect, and we 100% are not investigators.\"",
      "Instead, Fisher says that a hospital social worker's responsibility is to file a report to Child Protection Services if there is any abuse suspicion. CPS then has the option of \"accepting or not accepting a report.\" If accepted \u2014\u00a0which Fisher believes this case would be \u2014 it would then be investigated by CPS, not the mandatory reporter.",
      "\"If a parent came to us and said exactly what (the mom) said ... those are all big red flags,\" Fisher adds.",
      "The mandated reporting process depends on the state but usually involves calling the mandated reporter number, explaining the circumstances and then sharing where the child lives, their age and if there are any other siblings in the home.",
      "\"It's a very scripted form,\" Fisher explains.",
      "In the episode, instead of reporting the abuse suspicions, Robinavitch and Kiara recommend Susan speak with someone about her feelings and talk to Alana, and they offer to connect her with law enforcement.",
      "\"Hopefully now that it's out in the open, she'll take the necessary steps to handle this the right way,\" Robinavitch tells Santos.",
      "While Fisher says the recommendation to have the mom speak to someone is \"very helpful,\" she reiterates that with kids under 18, the protocol isn't allowing the family to decide whether to contact law enforcement. It's reporting the suspected abuse to CPS.",
      "\"The Pitt\" wraps up this arc with Santos confronting Silas while he's still in his hospital bed. She delivers a monologue where she calls him \"child molester\" and threatens to involve the police and kill him if he doesn't stop touching his daughter.",
      "It's a powerful scene, but this moment in particular concerned LaPointe.",
      "\"If you are ever in a comparable situation, do not do that,\" she says in the TikTok. \"That is actually an incredibly dangerous thing to do, as that man was about to go home with his wife and daughter without any real discussion of safety plans or what happens next. 'The Pitt' created a scenario where this daughter is actually in far more danger when she goes home because of the actions of the doctors.\"",
      "\"Maybe that's the point, but they never acknowledged it as wrong, and they never brought it back up again,\" LaPoint continues. \"At the end of the day, that's never how people who are trained in trauma-informed care would've handled that.\"",
      "Fisher adds that if the mandated reporting had been done correctly, Alana \"wouldn\u2019t necessarily be allowed to go home without Child Protection saying the child\u2019s safe to go home.\u201d",
      "Despite its mischaracterization of mandatory reporting in Episode 7, both Fisher and LaPointe are still big fans of \"The Pitt.\"",
      "LaPointe even starts her TikTok saying how she's \"obsessed\" with the show and that the only reason she's posting the feedback is that Wyle has said he wants the show to be as accurate as possible.",
      "Fisher agrees. \"Even if there were issues with Episode 7 ... the portrayal of the social worker as critical to the whole team was very positive,\" she says."

      "The characters spend the early hours of the evening in pure revelry, dancing and singing along to Sammie\u2019s music before an uninvited guest named Remmick (O\u2019Connell) asks to be invited in. He is denied, but ominously waits outside.",
      "Each time a character leaves the juke joint, they return changed and suddenly need approval to re-enter. Sensing an otherworldly presence, Annie quickly realizes that Remmick is a vampire who bites and creates more blood-thirsty creatures whenever a guest leaves the safety of the jukebar.",
      "Remmick later turns Mary into a vampire, who in turn does the same to her former lover Stack. Soon, more guests are turned into the undead and only a handful of humans remain.",
      "Who dies in 'Sinners'?",
      "Ultimately, everyone who is bitten and turned into a vampire dies, but some of those vampires do live on, which viewers learn in a post-credits scene.",
      "Leading up to the climatic battle, Smoke, Annie, Delta Slim, Pearline, Grace and Sammie decide to think of a plan while Remmick and the other vampires await their demise. After a desperate Grace welcomes the vampires in, the others, armed with stakes and holy water, fight for their lives.",
      "Annie is bitten and Smoke stabs her in the heart, at her request, before she becomes a vampire. Pearline is also killed and Grace is burned alive trying to defend herself against a vampire who has taken over her husband\u2019s body. Delta Slim chooses to sacrifice himself to give Smoke and Sammie time to escape.",
      "Before the credits officially roll, viewers learn that Smoke and Sammie are the only humans left standing.",
      "Lindo spoke to TODAY.com about his character\u2019s fate and why it was honorable given Delta Slim\u2019s backstory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very heroic thing to do, but it\u2019s also a sacrifice that\u2019s necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to, as I see it (and) as Delta Slim sees it, preserve the future of the music and the future of the culture, it has to be done.\u201d",
      "Miller, who was also interviewed by TODAY.com, chimed in and added that Delta Slim\u2019s death represents \u201cthe redemption of whatever ills that he may have, that he may be carrying.\u201d",
      "Lindo agreed, saying his character felt compelled to save Sammie.",
      "\u201cThe fact is part of my (character\u2019s) alcoholism comes out of the guilt that I feel at not being able to have saved my friend who I talked about in the car,\" he explained. \"So it is redemptive. I couldn\u2019t save him, but I will save the young preacher boy, the young one, the young pup who\u2019s carrying the tradition forward.\u201d",
      "Who survives in 'Sinners'?",
      "As the last humans standing, Smoke and Sammie attempt to flee but vampire Stack catches them. Smoke and Stack fight and Smoke appears to get the upper hand before the scene cuts to show Sammie, who jumped out a window and injured his leg, being surrounded by Remmick and all the vampires.",
      "While Remmick tries to drown and kill Sammie, the young musician reaches for his guitar \u2014 which the twins gave to him \u2014 and smashes it into Remmick\u2019s head. The metal plate on the guitar lodges in Remmick\u2019s head and kills him as the sun rises and turns all the other vampires into ashes.",
      "Sammie returns home and the scene of him walking into the church service replays. Meanwhile, Smoke, who also survived, stays at the juke joint and waits for the man who sold him the old mill to arrive. He shoots the landowner and all the Ku Klux Klan members after previously learning from Remmick that they had planned to ambush Smoke, Stack and their friends the next morning.",
      "During the shootout, one bullet hits Smoke and he slowly dies before being greeted by an apparition of Annie and their child, who died years ago.",
      "Sammie now becomes the only human survivor. However, once the post-credits roll, viewers learn that Stack and Mary, who are both vampires, have survived as well.",
      "What do the two post-credits scenes mean?",
      "\u201cSinners\u201d waits until a post-credits scene to reveal if Sammie chose to rebuke music like his father asked.",
      "As the credits roll, viewers see an older Sammie playing music at a dive bar with his band in the \u201890s. The musician chose to continue to pursue his love of music despite that traumatic night.",
      "In a second post-credits scene, the older version of Sammie sits at a bar before two familiar faces join him: Stack and Mary. It is revealed that Mary ran off and evaded the sunlight before Remmick and the others were burned years ago.",
      "Stack sits by Sammie\u2019s side and shares that he made a deal with Smoke during their fight to leave Sammie alone. Sammie tells them that he was having the best day of his life before the bloodbath. Stack agrees, pointing out that it was the last moment he felt sunshine and saw his brother.",
      "Stack and Mary then leave, leaving the door open for a potential sequel."

      "After three seasons of \u201cBosch: Legacy\u201d on Prime Video \u2014 the popular show with a strong fan base has finally come to an end.",
      "As a spinoff of \u201cBosch,\u201d which ran for seven seasons on Prime Video, \u201cBosch: Legacy\u201d was launched in 2022 and became a fan favorite in its own right. The franchise is based on author Michael Connelly\u2019s Harry Bosch novels, which follows gritty Los Angeles Police detective Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver), who solves crimes while also dealing with his unresolved past.",
      "In \u201cBosch: Legacy,\u201d we see Bosch retired from the force, and now working as a private investigator. His daughter Maddie (Madison Lintz) is a LAPD patrol officer, and Season One ends with her dramatic kidnapping. In Season 2, fans see Bosch race against time to save his daughter, eventually rescuing her in the Mojave Desert. Season 2 ends with Maddie receiving a phone call from an inmate who tells that her that her kidnapper has been killed in prison, at the request of her father.",

      "What happens in the final season of \u2018Bosch: Legacy\u2019?",
      "In the final season of \u201cBosch: Legacy,\u201d Harry is seen dealing with a multitude of issues, including the suspicion of murder after an inmate calls his daughter, Maddie, to tell her that he put a hit out on her kidnapper in prison.",
      "He's also confronted with his past decisions after a solider tells Maddie that her father tortured and killed an enemy bomber during his military service in Afghanistan. Welliver tells TODAY.com that after all these \"things come to light\" a \"strain is placed\" on his and Maddie's relationship.",
      "\u201cMaddie, knowing who her father is, is deeply confused. And so what happens is that there is an investigation that is opened up. Is there any fact?\u201d Welliver asks, rhetorically. \u201cSo, Maddie has to juggle who she knows her father to be.\u201d",
      "Amid the investigations looking into his past, Bosch is also working on investigations of his own: he's trying to figure out what happened to a family that disappeared.",
      "\u201cHarry also is hired by a woman from Ireland whose entire family has gone missing, which is her daughter, son in law, and her two grandchildren. They\u2019ve just vanished into thin air,\u201d Welliver explains. \u201cAnd as Bosch navigates every case, they all become personal, but this one involves children and a family, and I would say we see Harry brought to the absolute edge, looking into the abyss in this.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Honey Chandler (Mimi Rogers) is campaigning to become district attorney and must deal with rising threats to her hopes for office.",
      "Welliver says that this season finds Bosch at the crossroads of his sense of right and wrong.",
      "\u201cWhere we find him now in this final season, there\u2019s some questions that have arisen. Has he in fact, compromised his moral compass?\u201d",
      "What happens in the final episode of \u2018Bosch: Legacy\u2019?",
      "In the final episode of \"Bosch: Legacy,\" Bosch and Detective Renee Ballard (Maggie Q) are both working to catch the \"Flower Girls\" killer. \"I made a promise to these girls Mads, I'm going to see it through,\" he tells Maddie in the episode, when she reminds him he's retired.",
      "With Maddie's help, Bosch connects a local firehouse to the crimes, and a specific fireman named Jeremy McKee fits the bill. They get a DNA sample with the help of Maddie and her partner. At the same time, Bosch's associate Mo is breaking into the suspect's house for intel. Mo then finds the address of where the killer will strike next, and they apprehend McKee and save his would-be victim.",
      "In the final scene, Bosch and Ballard go for a walk, and have a moment where he praises her for her work. \"Maybe someday down the line we'll get to work together again,\" he says in the episode.",
      "Ballard then compliments Bosch's works, but adds says that some of the  \"darkness\" in their line of work has gotten into Harry. She tells him to \"be safe,\" and walks away.",
      "The scene ends with Harry walking off alone downtown as the camera captures the city in the background.",
      "Does Bosch die in \u2018Bosch: Legacy\u2019?",
      "No, Harry Bosch does not die in the final episode. But Welliver says that the series ending doesn\u2019t provide much closure.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re left at the end of the season, in the final episode, there\u2019s always a kind of \u2014 there\u2019s always a lack of resolution to a certain degree that we leave emotionally Harry with. And I think in that regard, that remains consistent,\" Welliver says. \"But as far as there being ... any kind of genuine closure, or the audience going, 'Well, what\u2019s next?' We don\u2019t know. So with that being said, It\u2019s Hollywood \u2014 stranger things have happened.\"",
      "Will there be another season of \u2018Bosch: Legacy\u2019?",
      "While another season of \"Bosch: Legacy\" has not been confirmed, a spinoff of \"Bosch\" has been confirmed, which will follow Bosch\u2019s protege, Renee Ballard (Maggie Q). We get introduced to Ballard before the series wraps up, setting her up for her own show.",
      "\u201cBallard is also a character in Michael Connelly\u2019s books, and she and Harry cross paths, and then he becomes sort of a mentor,\u201d Welliver tells TODAY.com. \u201cHis relationship to her is almost sort of quasi-paternal. We don\u2019t get to go that deep into the relationship, but we do introduce them and connect them in a way that certainly springs off the character of Ballard, so we know who she is.\u201d",
      "As far as Welliver officially reprising his role for a new spinoff, the actor says never say never.",
      "When asked if he would go back to the role, Welliver offered a simple answer: \u201cIt\u2019s a very immediate, \u2018Yes,\u2019 he tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"Because I have such a strong connection and kinship to that, to that character. So we\u2019ll see, you never know,\u201d he adds.",
      "After the season finale, Welliver said in an interview with TV Insider, published April 17, that he would make an appearance on the Maggie Q's \"Bosch\" spinoff.",
      "\"I will just say there is some crossover, for lack of a better term,\" he said before teasing that the new series will involve Ballard being \"kicked to cold case which isn\u2019t like moving higher up on the ladder in RHD (Robbery-Homicide Division).\"",
      "Maggie Q noted that she and Bosch both \"hate injustice and there were some injustices that Ballard faced in RHD.\"",
      "\"She stood up for herself and there was consequences or that,\" she told the outlet. \"That\u2019s a very Bosch move in terms of what they will sacrifice for a greater good.\"",
      "Welliver concurred, adding that Ballard will now have to lean on people who are outside of her department for help.",
      "\"There\u2019s a lot of people in the system that she can\u2019t trust,\" he said. \"And funnily enough, the guy that she came into this not trusting is probably the most trusted person that she can rely on. And he\u2019s not even in the department.\""

      "\u201cI had to convince everybody about this,\u201d Minear said. \u201cThe network was not like, \u2018Yeah, get rid of him, it\u2019ll save us money.\u2019 It was nothing like that. I had to pitch this at the highest levels and just walk through the whole story and try to infect them \u2014 funny choice of words, given the storyline \u2014 because, as I pitched it, you could understand, as a writer, how suddenly the whole world felt more alive. It felt more real because this thing had happened.\u201d",
      "Minear also shared why it had to be Bobby who died in the dramatic episode.",
      "\"Well, I think it needed to be Bobby for a lot of reasons,\" he told Variety. \"The first reason is that it made sense. It didn\u2019t feel arbitrary, because if you track the tragic arc of his character, of where he started, and how he came to L.A. looking for atonement, it just makes a kind of tragic sense for his character in a way it wouldn\u2019t for another character.\"",
      "The showrunner also noted that the show had the intent to leave the season with a bang.",
      "\"I just didn\u2019t want to go small,\" he said. \"Not that any of the characters are small, but Bobby\u2019s death affects every single character\u2019s story in a way that really no other character death would.\"",
      "Will Peter Krause return to '9-1-1' ?",
      "Though the finality of Bobby's death appears to be certain, Minear tells Variety that Peter Krause is still likely to appear on a future episode.",
      "\"Well, I will say that Episode 15 is not Peter Krause\u2019s final appearance this season,\" he teased without sharing details.",
      "In a March interview with People, Angela Bassett, who plays Bobby's wife, Athena, talked about her relationship with Krause on the show.",
      "When asked if she could envision a world where their characters don't exist, she said, \"Absolutely not. It would be so different.\"",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even know what the show would be like without them together. It\u2019s hard to imagine,\" she added."

      "The episode was part of a special crossover with \u201cLaw & Order\u201d and \u201cSVU\u201d titled \u201cPlay with Fire.\u201d Stabler popped up near the end of the event on \u201cSVU.\u201d",
      "Chris Meloni tells TODAY.com he \u201cabsolutely\u201d sees his character, Stabler, as a protector, but that\u2019s not the only character he views in that role.",
      "\u201cI feel as though you have to give the caveat that does not diminish Mariska \u2014 Benson\u2019s own agency and toughness and street savvy,\u201d he says.",
      "Benson teams up with Lt. Jessica Brady (Maura Tierney), and their squads work together to solve some gruesome murders. The most recent victim is Detective Maria Recinos, whom Benson once saved when Recinos was just a young girl.",

      "Benson approaches the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle and knocks on the window asking who the driver is and why he\u2019s talking to her son. The car pulls away before she can get any sort of answer.",

      "Enter her longtime partner, Stabler, who approaches the driver of the vehicle while he\u2019s using a urinal in the men\u2019s room. This isn\u2019t the first time Benson has called on Stabler to protect her son. In Season 24, she asked him to safely bring Noah home after a threat from a gang. Benson also said at the time there was no one she trusted more to keep her son safe than Stabler.",
      "Stabler takes the adjacent urinal and says, \u201cYou might not know me, but I know you \u2014 and not in a vague kind of way.\u201d",
      "Stabler continues to list off the man\u2019s name and life history before sliding over and slamming him up against the wall, noting he\u2019s aware Gomez \u201cowns\u201d the man.",
      "\u201cYou and I are just going to cut through the noise,\u201d Stabler continues, further pressing the guy into the wall.",

      "While Stabler is happy to act as protector, Meloni points out the role is a mutual one for Stabler and Benson.",

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014The Israeli Defense Forces faulted a series of \"professional failures\" and \"breaches of order\" in the March 23 incident in which Israeli soldiers killed 15 Palestinian aid workers in Gaza, an event that sparked widespread condemnation and calls for an independent investigation.",
      "In the summary of an internal report on the killings and a briefing to foreign media on Sunday, the IDF said it \u201cregrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians\u201d and announced that it had discharged the field commander leading the implicated unit and formally reprimanded a senior officer.",
      "The report and the IDF\u2019s rare acceptance of blame marks the culmination of a weeks-long scandal that had heaped further criticism on Israel\u2019s military just days after it broke a two-month ceasefire agreement with Hamas and restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The controversy around the killings worsened after United Nations personnel recovered the bodies from a shallow mass grave near the scene of the incident, and cell phone footage found on one of the corpses revealed serious inconsistencies in the IDF\u2019s original version of events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a chain of professional mistakes but with no ethical gaps,\u201d said Brigadier General\u00a0Ephraim Defrin, the newly appointed IDF spokesperson, in a presentation to reporters Sunday evening. \u201cThere was never any intention to deceive the public.\u201d",
      "Some initial reports from Palestinian examiners claimed that some of the medics had been found with their arms bound. However, other Palestinian medics said there was no evidence that the medics had been restrained before they were shot execution-style, a claim also denied by the IDF.",
      "In a statement issued after the bodies were found, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said the targeting of the medics \u201ccan only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law, which the occupation continues to violate before the eyes of the entire world.\u201d",
      "The aid workers included paramedics, civil defense staff and a U.N. employee.",
      "Israel previously said its soldiers shot and killed individuals they considered to be \u201cterrorists\u201d who were \u201cadvancing suspiciously.\u201d The IDF also claimed that vehicles that were approaching its position lacked headlights or emergency signals. At the time, Israeli forces reported that they killed nine militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad.",
      "The military later walked that back after video footage from the Palestine Red Crescent emerged that challenged its version of events. NBC News reviewed footage from the phone of a paramedic who was killed, showing an ambulance with its headlights and emergency lights flashing at the moment the soldiers opened fire. The vehicle was clearly marked with the insignia of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Flashing lights from two other vehicles are also visible in the video.",
      "The investigation revealed \u201cseveral professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident,\u201d the IDF said.",
      "But the public report and presentation, which were led by retired Major General Yoav Har-Even, and that he said was conducted \u201coutside the chain of command,\u201d did not answer all of the questions surrounding the shootings.\u00a0It did not provide evidence to back up the Israeli military\u2019s contention that six of the 15 slain emergency workers were actually Hamas operatives, nor did it explain why the number of slain medics who the IDF considered terrorists had changed",
      "The report and presentation also left unclear why one of the surviving medics, Asaad al-Nassasra, was detained by the IDF and still remains in their custody.",
      "Alongside the report summary, Har-Even showed a video presentation that featured aerial surveillance of the early-morning shootings, including night-vision reconnaissance footage.",
      "The probe found that troops were hampered by poor visibility and misidentified ambulances and rescue vehicles as threats during a mission targeting Hamas operatives, according to Sunday's report. Har-Even laid partial blame on the soldiers\u2019 night vision goggles for leading to what he called the \u201ctragic and undesirable result of a complex combat situation.\u201d The goggles\u2019 limited peripheral perspective, among other factors, made it difficult for the soldiers to recognize the trucks as civilian emergency vehicles despite their flashing emergency lights, he said.",
      "Another strike on a U.N. vehicle resulted from a breach of operational rules, the IDF\u2019s report says.",
      "The field commander in charge of the operation on the ground, who the report did not name but whom IDF public relations officers identified as a major, was dismissed in part for \u201cproviding an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief.\u201d",
      "The commanding officer of the 14th Brigade\u00a0received a formal reprimand that will appear in his personnel file, the report summary stated, both because of his \u201coverall responsibility\u201d for the shooting and his \u201cmanagement of the scene afterward.\u201d"

      "\u201cHe likes to help a lot, and I let him help me and carry things on his shoulder,\u201d Ajjour said.",
      "Doctors at Doha\u2019s Hamad Limb Hospital are currently fitting him for protheses, and in another video, he smiles brightly as he tries on a pair of prosthetic arms.",
      "In Gaza, such treatment isn\u2019t possible, and\u00a0Mahmoud is one of at least 1,000 children in the enclave to have lost at least one limb during the war, according to UNICEF, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Many of the children, like many adults, underwent surgery without anesthesia as the health care system buckled under Israel\u2019s siege.",
      "\u201cThe first few days were very difficult,\u201d Ajjour said. Both of his hands were gone, and without anesthetic, Mahmoud was in both physical and existential pain.",
      "\u201cHe would look at his hands and not see them,\u201d the boy\u2019s mother said. \u201cHe would scream and say, \u2018Where are my hands,\u2019 and the first thing he said was, \u2018How will I hug you, how will I pray?\u2019\u201d",
      "These days, Mahmoud is learning how to type on a computer, write and use a phone with his feet. Ajjour said he dreams of going to university and becoming a journalist so he can tell the stories of Gaza\u2019s children."

      "At the funeral in Khan Younis Saturday afternoon, families wept over the bodies of their relatives and cried out in pain. \u201cOmar is gone ... I wish it was me,\u00a8 screamed the brother of one of the victims.",
      "Israel has vowed to intensify attacks across Gaza and occupy large \u201csecurity zones\u201d inside the strip. For six weeks Israel also has blockaded Gaza, barring the entry of food and other goods.",
      "This week, aid groups\u00a0raised the alarm, saying that thousands of children have become malnourished and most people are barely eating one meal a day as stocks dwindle, according to the United Nations.",
      "On Friday, Dr. Hanan Balkhy, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s eastern Mediterranean office, urged the new U.S. ambassador in Israel,\u00a0Mike Huckabee,\u00a0to push the country to lift Gaza\u2019s blockade so medicines and other aid can enter the strip.",

      "The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Most of the hostages have since been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive has since killed over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to\u00a0Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The war has destroyed vast parts of Gaza and most of its food production capabilities. Around 90% of the population is displaced, with hundreds of thousands of people living in tent camps and bombed-out buildings."

      "A haunting portrait of a young Palestinian boy from the Gaza Strip who lost both of his arms in an Israeli strike has been named World Press Photo of the Year for 2025.",
      "Mahmoud Ajjour, 9, was fleeing an Israeli attack in Gaza with his family when he turned back to urge his loved ones to move forward, the World Press Photo organization said in a statement accompanying the picture taken by Palestinian photographer Samar Abu Elouf.",
      "Then he was hit in an explosion, the Netherlands-based nonprofit added.",
      "One of Ajjour's arms was completely severed, while the other was left severely injured and ultimately had to be amputated.",
      "\u201cOne of the most difficult things Mahmoud\u2019s mother explained to me was how when Mahmoud first came to the realization that his arms were amputated,\u201d Abu Elouf said in the statement from World Press Photo. \u201cThe first sentence he said to her was, \u2018How will I be able to hug you?\u2019\u201d",
      "Ajjour's mother, Nour Ajjour recalled that painful moment in a phone interview with NBC News on Friday.",
      "\"The first few days were very difficult. He was in a lot of pain as there was no anaesthetic,\" she said. \"He would look at his hands and not see them. He would scream and say, 'where are my hands?' And the first thing he said was, 'how will I hug you?' and 'how will I pray?'\"",
      "Ajjour was evacuated out of Gaza for treatment in Qatar's capital, Doha, where Abu Elouf took his portrait for The New York Times. The photographer also fled to the city.",
      "Ajjour is one of hundreds of children in Gaza to have lost at least one limb during the war, which has seen more than 51,000 people killed since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave.",
      "UNICEF warned in December 2023 that around 1,000 children in Gaza had seen one or both legs amputated alone since Oct. 7, 2023, when Israel began its military campaign in the enclave following the Hamas-led terror attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "\u201cThese are unbelievable numbers,\u201d Dr. Ahmed Al-Fara,\u00a0head of the pediatric department at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza\u2019s Khan Younis told NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground in an interview earlier this month, noting that thousands of children have also been killed and more still have been left without one or both parents.",
      "Al-Fara said he could not understand \u201cthe silence of the world\u201d in the midst of the widespread devastation in Gaza, where much of the enclave has been destroyed.",
      "Many of the operations children in Gaza have had to undergo have been done without anesthetic, according to UNICEF, with the enclave's health care system also hit hard by Israel's offensive, which it restarted last month after a pause in the fighting.",
      "Talks for a permanent end to the fighting were supposed to begin after the first phase of the ceasefire deal \u2014 in which Hamas released 25 living hostages and the bodies of eight in exchange for around 1,800 Palestinian prisoners and detainees \u2014 ended March 1.",
      "But Israeli forces\u00a0shattered the fragile truce and have since launched airstrikes on the enclave while also resuming military ground operations.",
      "Israel has also barred the entry of medical supplies, along with food, water and other vital aid, during a more than monthlong blockade of the enclave.",
      "Efforts to secure a more permanent ceasefire and secure the release of hostages held in Gaza have so far failed to yield results.",
      "In the meantime, Ajjour is learning how to live without his arms.",
      "\"We all help Mahmoud in everything, in food, drink, clothing and the smallest things.\" But she said her son is also learning to use his feet to do things like writing and playing games on his mobile phone.",
      "His hope now, she said, is to receive prosthetic limbs \u2014 a dream now shared by a growing number of children in Gaza."

      "Little-known artists have long bragged that they\u2019re \u201cbig in Japan,\u201d but a Spanish-language musical juggernaut is sweeping a much bigger market across the East China Sea.",
      "With its Latin beats and pulsating rhythms, reggaeton music has conquered dance floors across the world, but it\u2019s being put to a different use in China: college students are using the strains of J Balvin and Bad Bunny to help them learn Spanish.",
      "According to a study from Barcelona\u2019s Universitat Pompeu Fabra, the number of Chinese students taking its translation and language science classes has risen 37% from five years ago, but China\u2019s formal educational resources for learning Spanish are far less developed than they are for learning English.",
      "Instead, students are turning to social media sites and streaming services such as NetEase Cloud Music (NECM) to engage with digital language content, with translations of reggaeton songs garnering millions of views on the platform.",
      "The UPF study, which was published last month in the journal \u201cLanguage and Intercultural Communication,\u201d says that amateur translators often collaborate with Latin music lovers on the popular streaming site, using various \u201cintercultural mediation strategies\u201d to make it easier for the Chinese public to understand some of reggaeton\u2019s more niche or idiomatic Spanish cultural references without Chinese equivalents.",
      "The report says that around 2 in 3 translators get past the barriers of language and culture by swapping Spanish expressions with other Chinese imagery. The expression \u201cget stood up,\u201d for example, becomes \u201cfree[ing] a dove\u201d \u2014 a Chinese expression for breaking a promise.",
      "Even after they\u2019ve cleared cultural hurdles, users wanting to spread hits such as \u201cDespacito\u201d and \u201cGasolina\u201d to Guangzhou and Chengdu then need to satisfy China\u2019s censors.",
      "As with TikTok, certain words and phrases are redacted on Chinese social media, especially those containing sexual references, which regularly come up in reggaeton songs.",
      "While asterisks placed between Chinese characters by translators can help bypass this censorship, Mandarin phrases and characters are usually not separated by spaces as they are in English. That means starring out frowned-upon language can alter the meanings of lyrics and add an extra challenge to translators.",
      "Using cultural output such as French cinema or Italian cooking is a language learning method that has long been deployed by teachers the world over. Spreading reggaeton to China may be helping drive an interest in Spanish culture \u2014 at least at UPF anyway.",
      "The university's cohort of Chinese students has grown by almost a third to 275 in the past five years.",
      "One of them, whose name the report changes to \u201cBenito,\u201d has 1,300 followers on NECM and his translations have been viewed more than 2 million times."

      "The show will air nonstop for 20 days, following the moose via remote cameras and drones as they journey through forests and swim across the \u00c5ngerman River,\u00a0The Associated Press\u00a0reported.",
      "The series debuted in 2019 on SVT Play and drew about a million viewers in its first year. Last year, viewership exploded to 9 million.",
      "And its fan base is dedicated and massive.",
      "\"I make sure I have coffee, I have snacks. Sleep? Forget it, I don't sleep,\" Ulla Malmgren, 62, said in an interview that aired Wednesday on NBC News' \"TODAY\" show.",

      "The show is an example of the wild success of slow TV \u2014 no plots, no drama, just a front-row seat to Mother Nature. The Giant Panda Cam at the National Zoo, which has attracted over 100 million fans, and the Bald Eagle Cam at Big Bear Valley in California are other examples of the phenomenon.",
      "\"Everyone is so stressed today with the social media and the way we produce everything we do in our life, and this is the total opposite of that,\" Johan Erlag, project manager at SVT, said on \"TODAY.\"",
      "Annette Hill, a media and communications professor at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University, said, \"It gives us a really distinctive type of atmosphere, an almost therapeutic slow atmosphere, and at the same time it helps us to adjust our mood.\"",
      "Producers of the livestream said they had to start shooting a week earlier than planned because of warm weather that bumped up the migration.\u00a0But fear not \u2014 with three weeks left on the migration journey, there's plenty of time to tune in."

      "ROME \u2014 A convalescing Pope Francis appeared on the balcony of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to celebrate Easter services on Sunday, as a cheering and emotional crowd of thousands gathered at the Vatican\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Square.",
      "The crowd erupted when the pontiff, 88, appeared in his wheelchair, looking out over a square awash in daffodils and tulips.",
      "\u201cDear brothers and sisters, happy Easter,\u201d he said, waving and giving his blessing.",
      "In the days leading up to Easter, the Vatican had not confirmed whether the pope would be able to attend the Mass, saying it would depend on his health. This underscored Francis\u2019 continued fragility and the urgency with which many Catholic faithful hoped to see him in his waning years.",
      "On Sunday morning, Francis held a brief private meeting with Vice President JD Vance, who is Catholic. The meeting lasted a few minutes, the Vatican said, long enough for them to exchange Easter wishes.",
      "Last week, Francis publicly rebuked the Trump administration for its immigration crackdown and for slashing international aid, and in February, he had written an unusual open letter to U.S. Catholic bishops saying a \u201cmajor crisis\u201d was taking place in the United States, referring to \u201cthe initiation of a program of mass deportations.\u201d",
      "The pontiff did not lead the Easter Mass, with Cardinal Angelo Comastri, a retired archpriest of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, taking his place and delivering the homily that Francis has prepared.",
      "But after the Mass ended, the pope appeared to rapturous applause as a military band kicked off a round of the Holy See and Italian anthems. Diego Ravelli, master of ceremonies, then delivered the Urbi et Orbi papal address.",
      "During the address, Francis made a strong appeal for peace around the world, particularly in Gaza, where he said \u201cterrible conflict  continues to cause death and destruction,\u201d and called for a ceasefire and the release of all hostages.",
      "The pontiff offered prayer to Christian communities in Ukraine, Israel, Lebanon and Syria, and mentioned the ongoing conflict and suffering in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Sudan, South Sudan, Myanmar, the Sahel and Horn of Africa regions, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.",
      "\u201cI would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFor all of us are children of God!\u201d",
      "After the service, Francis took to his open-topped popemobile to greet crowds in the square, blessing babies and children during the drive.",
      "The Easter week is the most important on the Catholic calendar, but this year it has also been a test of Pope Francis\u2019 health after he spent\u00a0more than five weeks in Rome\u2019s Gemelli Hospital for treatment for pneumonia in both lungs, the most serious health crisis of his 12-year tenure.",
      "According to his doctors, his life was in danger twice during that period, and they considered ending treatment. \u201cWe had to choose whether to stop and let him go, or push forward and try everything,\u201d one of his doctors, Sergio Alfieri, said shortly after the pope was released from the hospital.",
      "Since then, Francis had made only brief public appearances, but they have provided reassuring signs of his recovery. He greeted a crowd in St Peter\u2019s Square on Palm Sunday last weekend, and on Holy Thursday he visited a Roman prison. He also met privately with\u00a0King Charles III and Queen Camilla in the Vatican earlier in the month.",
      "The 88-year-old Francis is entering his\u00a0fifth\u00a0week of convalescence, during which doctors have advised him to avoid crowds.",
      "After Francis was discharged from the hospital in March, the head of his medical team said he would require a further two months of rest, and his doctors said it would take \u201ca lot of time\u201d for his aging body to fully heal.",
      "Throughout his illness, the Vatican maintained that Francis continued to fulfill his duties despite staying out of the public eye.",
      "Notably, he missed the Catholic Church\u2019s jubilee celebration, a significant tradition held every 50 years for the remission of sins, known as the Holy Year.",
      "The pope\u2019s declining health sparked speculation over whether he would retire just as his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, did in 2013.",
      "But despite his ongoing health struggles, there has been no indication from the Vatican that the pope intends to resign."

    "story": [
      "CHITUNGWIZA, Zimbabwe \u2014 A pair of white hands blinding a Black face. A smiling colonizer with a Bible, crushing the skull of a screaming native with his boot. Chained men in gold mines, and a pregnant woman.",
      "These stone sculptures from\u00a0Zimbabwe\u00a0will take center stage at an upcoming exhibition at Oxford University in Britain, aiming to \u201ccontextualize\u201d the legacy of British imperialist Cecil John Rhodes with depictions of religious deception, forced labor and sexual abuse.",
      "Rhodes conquered large parts of southern Africa in the late 19th century. He made a fortune in gold and diamond mining and grabbed land from the local population. His\u00a0grave lies under a slab of stone atop a hill\u00a0in Zimbabwe.",
      "Oxford\u2019s Oriel College, where the exhibition will be held in September, is a symbolic setting. A statue of Rhodes stands there despite protests against it since 2015. Rhodes, who died in 1902, was an Oriel student who left 100,000 pounds (now valued at about 10.5 million pounds, or $13.5 million) to the school. His influence endures through a scholarship for students from southern African countries.",
      "For Zimbabwean stone carvers at Chitungwiza Arts Center near the capital, Harare, the exhibition is more than an opportunity for Western audiences to glimpse a dark history. It is also a chance to revive an ancient but struggling art form.",
      "Stone sculpture, once a thriving local industry, has suffered due to\u00a0vast economic challenges\u00a0and declining tourism.",
      "\u201cThis will boost business. Buyers abroad will now see our work and buy directly from the artists,\u201d said sculptor Wallace Mkanka. His piece, depicting the blinded Black face, was selected as the best of 110 entries and will be one of four winning sculptures on display at Oxford.",
      "Zimbabwe, meaning \u201cHouse of Stone,\u201d derives its identity from the Great Zimbabwe ruins, a 1,800-acre Iron Age city built with precision-cut stones delicately stacked without mortar. It is a UNESCO World heritage site.",
      "The southern African country\u00a0has long used stone sculpture as a form of storytelling\u00a0to immortalize history. The craft survived close to a century of colonial rule that sought to erase local traditions, religion and art forms.",
      "It thrived internationally instead. Thousands of pieces were plundered from Africa. Some later became subjects of repatriation campaigns. Others became prized by tourists and collectors. A permanent collection of 20 Zimbabwean stone sculptures is displayed in a pedestrian tunnel at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, one of the world\u2019s busiest.",
      "At its peak following independence, Zimbabwe\u2019s stone sculpture industry thrived, with local white farmers purchasing pieces for their homes and facilitating international sales.",
      "\u201cCustomers were everywhere. They would pay up front, and I always had a queue of clients,\u201d recalled Tafadzwa Tandi, a 45-year-old sculptor whose work will feature in the Oxford exhibition.",
      "However, the industry has struggled over the past two decades.",
      "Zimbabwe\u2019s global image suffered after controversial land reforms more than two decades ago displaced over 4,000 white farmers to redistribute land to about 300,000 Black families, according to government figures. Late ruler Robert Mugabe\u00a0defended the reforms as necessary to address colonial-era inequities, but they had unintended economic consequences.",
      "\u201cMany of our customers were friends of the farmers. That is where the problem originated from,\u201d said Tendai Gwaravaza, chairman of Chitungwiza Arts Center.",
      "At the center, the sound of grinders filled the air as sculptors carved. Hundreds of finished pieces, ranging from small carvings to life-sized sculptures, waited for buyers.",
      "\u201cThe only solution now is to get out there to the markets ourselves. If we don\u2019t, no one will,\u201d Gwaravaza said.",
      "The Oxford exhibition represents such an opportunity for exposure, he said.",
      "It is the brainchild of the Oxford Zimbabwe Arts Partnership, formed in response to the \u201cRhodes Must Fall\u201d campaign during the\u00a0Black Lives Matter\u00a0protests in the U.S.",
      "The group, consisting of Zimbabwean artists, an Oxford alumnus and a professor of African history, initially envisioned a larger project titled \u201cOxford and Rhodes: Past, Present, and Future.\u201d It included enclosing Rhodes\u2019 statue in glass, installing 100 life-size bronze statues of African liberation fighters and creating a collaborative sculpture using recycled materials to represent the future.",
      "However, the project required an estimated 200,000 pounds, far beyond available resources. Eventually, Oriel College provided 10,000 pounds for a scaled-down exhibition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still my hope that one day it could happen, but for now we have just accepted something very small to make a start and to do something,\u201d said Richard Pantlin, the Oxford alumnus and OZAP co-founder."

      "TEHRAN\u00a0\u2014\u00a0A second round of high-stakes talks between the United States and Iran concluded Saturday in Rome with \"very good progress,\" a senior official in President Donald Trump's administration said.",
      "Talks will continue next week, the official said in a statement.",
      "\u201cToday, in Rome over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,\" the official said. \"We agreed to meet again next week and are grateful to our Omani partners for facilitating these talks and to our Italian partners for hosting us today.\u201d",
      "Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi both arrived late Saturday morning for the negotiations at the Omani Embassy in Rome. The talks took place as both sides sought to ease growing tensions over potential military action and Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.",
      "At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue a nuclear weapon.",
      "Following the talks, Araghchi told Iranian state television they were \"held in a constructive atmosphere\" and \"moving forward.\"",
      "\"There is no reason for too much optimism. We cannot say that we are really optimistic,\" he told the outlet. \"We must be very cautious, but there is no reason for much pessimism either.\"",
      "In a statement, Oman\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Witkoff and Araghchi agreed to enter the next phase of discussions \u201cthat aim to seal a fair, enduring and binding deal.\u201d The statement said the deal will ensure Iran is free of nuclear weapons and lift sanctions against the country while continuing to allow it \u201cto develop peaceful nuclear energy.\u201d",
      "The next round of discussions will take place in Oman\u2019s capital, Muscat, \u201cin the next few days,\u201d according to the country\u2019s foreign ministry.",
      "The talks were mediated by Oman, which also hosted a first round of negotiations between the two men in Muscat last Saturday. That paved the way for another meeting as both countries move toward cautious diplomacy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon,\u201d Trump said Friday. \u201cI want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.\u201d",
      "The New York Times reported Wednesday that Trump had privately waved off Israeli proposals to strike Iranian nuclear sites, preferring instead to pursue a renegotiated deal.",
      "Last week, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a statement that actions taken during the first stage of talks in Oman were \u201cgood,\u201d and must be \u201cpursued carefully.\u201d",
      "The talks represent a historic moment, given the decades of enmity between the two countries since the 1979 Islamic Revolution overthrew a U.S.-backed regime,\u00a0and a U.S. Embassy hostage crisis that same year.",
      "Since then, the U.S. has imposed rounds of crippling economic sanctions on Iran. In 2018, during Trump\u2019s first term, he unilaterally withdrew from an accord Iran had struck with world leaders that had drastically limited Tehran\u2019s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.",
      "The heart of the current talks remains Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment, a key indicator of how close a country may be to developing a nuclear weapon.",
      "Under the 2015 nuclear accord, Iran agreed to cap enrichment at 3.67%, far below the 90% needed for weapons-grade uranium. The limit was intended to ensure the program remained civilian in nature. Formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the deal offered Iran billions in sanctions relief in exchange for curbing its nuclear ambitions.",
      "The deal was signed by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council \u2014 the U.S., Russia, France, China and the United Kingdom \u2014 as well as Germany and the European Union.",
      "But that agreement began to unravel in 2018 when Trump pulled the U.S. out, calling it \u201cthe worst deal ever.\u201d His first administration imposed sweeping sanctions that choked Iran\u2019s economy and isolated its financial and energy sectors.",
      "In turn, Iran rolled back its limits and is believed to have enriched uranium up to 60%, closer to the weapons-grade level of 90%.",
      "Araghchi and Witkoff met in Oman last Saturday in talks both sides described as positive and constructive, though Iran has said since that it has been confused over the mixed messaging by the Trump administration on whether it wants Iran to completely dismantle its entire nuclear program.",
      "Last week, Witkoff posted on X that Iran must \u201cstop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program.\u201d",
      "The previous day, on Fox News, the special envoy had stated that \u201cthe conversation with the Iranians\u201d would focus on limiting uranium enrichment at 3.67 % for civil nuclear purposes.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s apparent contradiction underscores the tensions that have surrounded the current talks, clouded also by lingering suspicion of Trump following the collapse of the JCPOA in 2018. Tehran remains deeply wary.",
      "Further signs of a potential shift emerged during a Friday prayer service in Tehran attended by hard-line clerics and military figures. The message from the imam was revealing: Iran should remain open to negotiations.",
      "As some in the crowd of thousands at the University of Tehran campus chanted \u201cdeath to America,\u201d and the imam warned that talks should be pursued with caution, and that the U.S. and the Trump administration had shown they could not be trusted.",
      "Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if no agreement is reached. Ahead of Saturday\u2019s talks, the U.S. moved a second aircraft carrier into regional waters. The president also threatened to extend tariffs on nations that continue buying Iranian oil, atop the litany of sanctions already in force."

      "A situation report issued late Friday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said frequent strong aftershocks continue to shake central Myanmar almost daily, increasing fear and uncertainty among affected residents,\u00a0disrupting response effort\u00a0s and exacerbating the pressure on already limited resources and services.",
      "\u201cThree weeks after catastrophic twin earthquakes hit Myanmar on 28 March, the worst-affected communities are still without safe shelter, clean water and sanitation, stable electricity, health care and essential services,\u201d the report said.",
      "The epicenter of the 7.7 magnitude quake was near Mandalay, Myanmar\u2019s second-largest city, but it hit a wide swath of the country, causing significant damage to six regions and states including the capital, Naypyitaw.",
      "It also worsened an already dire\u00a0humanitarian crisis\u00a0triggered by the country\u2019s civil war that had internally displaced more than 3 million people and left nearly 20 million in need, according to the United Nations.",
      "A report in the state-run Myanma Alinn newspaper published on Saturday said the quake\u2019s death toll had reached 3,726, with 5,105 people injured and 129 still missing. It said 1,975 international rescuers and medical workers from 25 countries had collaborated with local rescuers in saving 653 people and recovering 753 bodies from under rubble.",
      "Myanma Alinn said 65,096 houses and buildings, 2,514 schools, 4,317 Buddhist monasterial living quarters, 6,027 pagodas and temples, 350 hospitals and clinics, 170 bridges, 586 dams and 203 sections of the country\u2019s main highway were damaged by the earthquake.",
      "Myanmar Fire Services Department, an official emergency services agency operating in many areas of the country, said in statements posted Friday on its Facebook page that rescue workers were carrying out relief, search and cleaning debris from the big buildings, and had returned valuable jewelry, cash, and documents found among the rubble to their owners.",
      "It also said that rescuers recovered two bodies from collapsed buildings in Mandalay.",
      "An official from Myanmar Rescue Federation (Mandalay), which has been operating along with the firefighters, told The Associated Press on Friday that the priority three weeks on from the earthquake was to clear bodies and debris from under bigger buildings, while also providing assistance to the survivors affected by the earthquake.",
      "The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears arrest for speaking without authorization, said the number of bodies recovered daily has decreased to only one or two.",
      "Another emergency services worker in Mandalay, similarly speaking on condition of anonymity, said the number of\u00a0rescue teams operating in Mandalay has been steadily decreasing\u00a0as most of the international rescue teams had returned to their countries after their work to find survivors was considered completed. He said local rescue workers were mainly participating in clearing debris and providing assistance.",
      "The United Nations Development Program earlier this month estimated that at least 2.5 million tons, or roughly 125,000 truckloads, of debris from the quake needs to be removed. It based its estimate on remote sensing analysis of images obtained by satellites.",
      "UN-Habitat, the U.N. agency for human settlements, said in a statement on Friday that its staff and the Myanmar Engineering Society were collaborating in assessing widespread building damage in earthquake-affected regions.",
      "In Naypyitaw, almost all rescuers have ceased their relief efforts, while government buildings that were damaged by the earthquake have not yet been repaired and remain in their post-earthquake condition, said a resident who asked not to be named for security reasons. In residential areas, people have almost completed clearing the debris on their own.",
      "Saturday\u2019s report in Myanma Alinn said Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, head of the military government, told his Cabinet members during a meeting on Friday that the urban layout of Naypyitaw will be redesigned.",
      "Naypyitaw became Myanmar\u2019s capital in 2006 after being built at great expense almost from scratch next to what had once been a logging center inhabited by largely by farmers. It is notable for its grandiose government buildings and under-utilized multi-lane roads."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Marcus Wu\u2019s home racing simulator setup needs one more thing: a manual gearshift. A decade ago, one from a Western brand would have been a no-brainer for gamers like the 12-year-old Hongkonger.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing escalates, the fact that Wu opted for a gearshift from Chinese manufacturer Moza illustrates how far Chinese manufacturers have come in competing with their Western counterparts on affordability and quality.",
      "The deepening economic conflict between the U.S. and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, has the potential to wreak havoc on a complex web of globalized commerce. And Trump\u2019s attempts to claw back manufacturing to American shores could have unintended consequences, including giving Chinese technology manufacturers an edge at a time when American products are already becoming expensive.",
      "Wu and his father-cum-financier, Mingfai, have already made their choice, opting for a Chinese alternative over American brands such as the Oregon-based Thrustmaster. \u201cIf only the price was good but the quality wasn\u2019t, then I wouldn\u2019t have bought this,\u201d the elder Wu said. \u201cBut this is cheaper and works great.\u201d",
      "The duo were browsing Hong Kong\u2019s Sham Shui Po computer market \u2014 a sprawling hub of small tech stores selling everything from computer parts to gaming equipment for casual gamers and enthusiasts alike.",
      "To residents and tourists from mainland China \u2014 a country with a gaming market of half a billion users \u2014 the market is a one-stop shop, featuring top American brands including Dell, Corsair and the Nasdaq-listed Swiss manufacturer Logitech.",
      "Those are just some of the companies competing for market share in a gaming industry that accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates will be worth $300 billion by 2027. According to China\u2019s Game Industry Report, China\u2019s gamers contributed $44 billion in sales revenues to the industry last year.",
      "To be sure, Western brands are still popular when it comes to big-ticket items like monitors, processors and storage devices, but sellers at the market told NBC News that Chinese brands have been knocking it out of the park when it comes to accessories, like mice, keyboards and simulator setups.",
      "\u201cSo many Chinese manufacturers popped up after the pandemic,\u201d said Dennis Leung, a sales assistant at a store that specializes in gaming peripherals. \u201cThey often provide an extremely cheap and bargain price compared to the whole market,\u201d he said.",
      "Standing in front of a table of 30 mice, Leung held up two with identical feel and weight. The Chinese option, which was cheaper and more powerful, had been outselling its Western counterpart, he said.",
      "The Trump administration last week issued a memorandum saying that electronics including computers, smartphones and some components will be temporarily exempt from levies imposed on Chinese imports.",
      "But Trump\u2019s indication that duties on semiconductors and other technology could be on their way means it\u2019s still unclear whether electronics could get more expensive in the U.S. and whether prices of American-made products could go up for the rest of the world, too.",
      "That uncertainty may already be causing nervousness at companies such as Dell \u2014 the $56 billion tech giant has a 20% share of the global gaming market \u2014 as well as the $12 billion market cap for Logitech and specialists such as Corsair, which is worth $630 million.",
      "The administration\u2019s market-roiling tariffs come at a time when the quality of Chinese products has already vastly improved. That\u2019s giving Hong Kong\u2019s vendors a chance to capitalize.",
      "When it comes to buying gaming accessories, shoppers don\u2019t really care where the end product is coming from, Kira Fong, manager of another store in the market, told NBC News. \u201cMost people just look for quality. They still want the best equipment,\u201d he said.",
      "Analysts expect Chinese-made tech products only to get better.",
      "\u201cPeople are choosing more Chinese-made products in each industry, not just personal computers, gaming, smartphones or electric vehicles,\u201d said Xiao Feng Zeng, who analyzes China\u2019s gaming and esports industry at Niko Partners, an Asian and European gaming intelligence firm.",
      "\u201cTheir quality is better and the price is cheaper,\u201d the Shanghai-based vice president said, adding that Trump\u2019s policies will hurt America\u2019s ability to compete for young gamers.",
      "The policies of the president, who refers to himself as \u201cTariff Man,\u201d are already feeding through into higher prices.",
      "Hyte, a gaming PC sister brand of the California-based iBuyPower, said this month on X that while it was standing by increased prices, those prices will not be sustainable long term.",
      "That was not a problem for Marcus Wu, and more importantly his dad, at checkout at the Sham Shui Po market.",
      "With his son excited to go home and play with his new gearshift, Mingfai Wu breathed a sigh of relief.",

      "The incident occurred when a fire started as a woman was cooking on board the vessel, Comp\u00e9tent Loyoko, the river commissioner, told the Associated Press.",
      "Several passengers, including women and children, died after jumping into the water without being able to swim, the report added.",
      "In 2024, at least 78 people drowned when a boat with 278 passengers capsized in Lake Kivu, eastern Congo. In a separate incident,\u00a0at least 22 people died\u00a0after a river boat sank in December in western Congo."

    "summary": "At the world\u2019s largest wholesale market in the Chinese city of Yiwu, U.S. customers have dired President Donald's trumps tariffs takes effect.",
    "story": [
      "YIWU, China \u2014 Hammers, hats and hair clips. Toys, tech, socks, baseball caps and Christmas decorations. If it\u2019s a cheap manufactured product, it may well have come from the world\u2019s largest wholesale market in the Chinese city of Yiwu.",
      "With 75,000 suppliers spread across six buildings, it was once a one-stop shop for American companies, big and small, looking to buy cheap goods and export them back to the U.S.",
      "Today it is on the front line of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, and after he upped U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made goods from 10% to 145%, vendors told NBC News on Wednesday, their once reliable American clients have started to put orders on hold or cancel them altogether.",
      "Nicole Zhang and her husband, Huang Fangchao, whose Yiwu Dowell Accessories Co. makes hair accessories for major brands using machine-cut and hand-finished materials, said around 60 or 70% of her 6 million pieces were destined for the U.S.",
      "But as tariffs have soared, she said American clients like Target have halted orders and put two shipping containers full of her products on hold.\u00a0\u201cThey want to see what is happening in the future,\u201d she said.",
      "After stunning trading partners and global markets in early April, when he announced a raft of \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on imports from more than 180 countries, Trump subsequently paused higher targeted tariffs for 90 days for most countries.",
      "But he did not include China, which was hit hardest of all and has since imposed retaliatory tariffs of up to 125% on U.S. imports.",
      "In Yiwu, the effects have started to take their toll.",
      "Chen Jinsai, a vendor selling press-on nails, said she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d shipped anything to the U.S. \u201cin the first half of this year\u201d mainly \u201cbecause the export taxes have gotten way too high.\u201d",
      "Goods that were ready to be shipped have \u201cjust been sitting there,\u201d she said, adding that customers had not asked them to suck up the extra costs from the tariffs. \u201cIf I had to pay the tax, I\u2019d be losing money. Our prices are already quite low, so the tax is definitely something the customer has to handle themselves,\u201d she said.",
      "It\u2019s a reversal from last year when the provincial, development and reform commission in the district of Zhejiang, where Yiwu is based, reported that the city\u2019s total import and export value reached 668.93 billion yuan ($91 billion), an increase of 18.2% from the previous year.\u00a0With U.S. trade uncertain, some of the traders in Yiwu said they were already focusing on markets in other parts of the world, such as the Middle East and Asia.",
      "Sock vendor Lou Jinling, meanwhile, said only around 10% of her business was in the U.S., \u201cso we\u2019re not heavily affected.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince tariffs, some clients asked me to help share the cost, but I won\u2019t do that because the margin is already very thin,\u201d she said, adding that one of her American customers \u201ctold me he managed to clear out his warehouse stock as people were panic-buying from him.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor us, we have ways of offsetting the losses by selling to other markets,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I feel sorry for everyday Americans, as they are the ones paying for the rising cost.\u201d",
      "One of the people who might have to pay more to import into the U.S. is Vicky Eng, who said she\u2019d noticed her clients back home in the U.S. had become \u201ca lot more hesitant\u201d since the tariffs were introduced.\u00a0Eng, who flew in from Chicago with her sister Vivian Eng, 29, to source hair clips and other accessories for their company, Adorro, said they sold them on to American retailers, mostly in the Midwest and Florida.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t raised prices since the tariffs have been announced because we don\u2019t want to pre-emptively jump the gun with any price increases if it\u2019s not necessary,\u201d Eng, 30, said.",
      "Nonetheless, their clients, she said, were \u201cplacing much smaller volume orders.\u201d",
      "Most of their customers were \u201crelatively small businesses,\u201d Eng said, adding that since the tariffs were introduced, it had become \u201ca little harder\u201d for people to operate.",
      "The Chinese vendors were \u201cjust like us.\u201d she added. \u201cThey can\u2019t have an empty store.\u201d"

      "Scientists have grown a nugget-sized piece of chicken using a new method that can deliver nutrients and oxygen to artificial tissues, marking a major breakthrough in cultured meat.",
      "While labs have been producing lifelike tissues for more than a decade, previous methods only made small, scattered cell balls less than 1 millimeter thick, or about 0.04 inches. It was a challenge to hold the cell groupings together in a way that more closely mimicked the texture of muscle, and the current generation of lab-grown meats are often tiny pieces clumped together around an edible scaffolding.",
      "However, a team of researchers in Japan have achieved new lengths, growing a single, square piece of chicken 2.7 inches (7 centimeters) wide and 0.7 inches (2 centimeters) thick with a new lab tool, according to a paper published Wednesday in the journal Trends in Biotechnology. Weighing in at about a third of an ounce, the artificial chicken muscle is a small bite, but is believed to be the world\u2019s largest chunk of lab-grown\u00a0meat.",
      "The scientists developed a bioreactor that mimicked a circulatory system, using 50 hollow fibers acting like veins to distribute nutrients and oxygen to the meat, keeping cells alive and guiding them to grow in the specified directions.",
      "The bioreactor delivered nutrients and oxygen through the tissue using tiny, precision-laid hollow fibers, using a method that, for the first time, could sustain growth across relatively long cellular distances.",
      "This piece of chicken was not made using food-grade materials, and the scientists have not tasted it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to discover that these tiny fibers can also effectively help create artificial tissues,\u201d Shoji Takeuchi, a co-author of the study and a professor at the University of Tokyo in Japan, said in a statement. Hollow fibers had previously been used in household water filters and dialysis machines for patients with kidney disease.",
      "The new approach, he said, could be a scalable way to produce whole-cut cultured meat, adding that it could yield advancements not just in food production, but also regenerative medicine, drug testing and biohybrid robotics.",
      "The new technology could accelerate the commercial viability of cultured meat, but there are further challenges ahead.",
      "Replicating the texture and taste of whole-cut meat remains \u201cdifficult,\u201d Takeuchi said, adding that larger pieces will also require\u00a0better oxygen delivery.",
      "Additionally, the process of removing tiny hollow fibers that help grow the meat, currently done by researchers manually, needs to be automated, he said, adding that future lab-grown meat will also have to be made with food-grade materials before they can be eaten.",
      "Consumers in the United States have mixed attitudes toward cultured meat. About a third say they are not willing to try cultivated chicken, and 40% reject cultivated pork, according to a 2024 poll conducted by Purdue University in Indiana.",
      "Ethical and environmental concerns may prompt consumers to opt for plant-based meat substitutes, but cultured meat presents a different hurdle to acceptance partly due to perceived food risks, such as its unnaturalness, unfamiliarity and concerns about whether it is safe or healthy to eat, according to a 2022 study.",
      "Currently, there is little cultured meat in the market, but they can be legally sold to consumers in\u00a0three countries: Singapore, the U.S. and Israel. Only two California companies are authorized to sell cultured meat in the U.S., while Florida and Alabama have banned its sales.",
      "In 2013, the world\u2019s first lab-grown burger made from cow stem cells was cooked and publicly tasted in London, to ambivalent reviews."
