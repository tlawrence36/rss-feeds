    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 01:38:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Punxsutawney Phil&rsquo;s team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck&rsquo;s weather verdict as the sun rises",
    "story": [
      "Punxsutawney Phil\u2019s team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck\u2019s weather verdict as the sun rises",
      "Punxsutawney Phil's team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck's weather verdict as the sun rises on Sunday, telling the world whether he is predicting wintry conditions for the next six weeks or the relief of an early spring.",
      "The annual ritual goes back more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in European folklore, but it took Bill Murray's 1993 movie to transform it into what it is today, with tens of thousands of revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States and beyond.",
      "Last year's crowd may have been a record and organizers are bracing for a similar turnout on Sunday.",
      "If the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club members declare Phil did not see his shadow, that is said to usher in an early spring. If he does see it, it's six more weeks of winter, although what that means can be subjective.",
      "Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less than half the time.",
      "Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler's Knob: the faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to confirm their skepticism.",
      "Phil communicates his forecast through \u201cGroundhog-ese\u201d with the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club's leader. It's not as if he speaks in English words.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll like wink, he\u2019ll purr, he\u2019ll chatter, he\u2019ll \u2014 you know \u2014 nod,\u201d Dunkel said.",
      "Attendance is free but it costs $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction is made, some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh. The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.",
      "A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split time between Gobbler's Knob and Phil's longtime home at the town library. The club also is putting up large video screens and more powerful speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the proceedings.",
      "\"It\u2019s a holiday where you don\u2019t really owe anyone anything,\u201d said A.J. Dereume, who among the club's 15-member inner circle serves as Phil's handler. \u201cYou\u2019re grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that\u2019s just fun to believe in.\u201d",
      "Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring, Shadow and Sunny, although his family won't join him on stage for the big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily visits from Dereume and see a veterinarian at least once a year.",
      "The club's lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an \u201celixir of life\u201d that keeps him immortal.",
      "\u201cThere's only one Phil, and it's not something that can be handed down,\u201d Dunkel said. \u201cJust like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, there's only one.\u201d",
      "Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, are being held in many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces."

    "story": [
      "Beyonc\u00e9 winning the trophy for album of the year was the highlight of the Grammy Awards on Sunday, but there were plenty of other key moments",
      "All eyes at the Grammy Awards were on whether the most-nominated artist in the history of the telecast would finally walk away with the coveted album of the year trophy. She did. \u201cWe finally saw it happen,\u201d host Trevor Noah said, almost in relief.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 winning for \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d capped a night that turned into a tribute to a suffering Los Angeles, with city firefighters chosen to reveal the winner of the last award and speeches offering words of encouragement for communities devastated. The Grammys almost veered into a telethon; $7 million was pledged from viewers of the show.",
      "It was also a telecast where the best new artist nominees like Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter were given plenty of time to show why there's a deep well of talent coming up. And there was a shock return for The Weeknd, who had been boycotting the Grammys.",
      "Here are some of the night\u2019s notable moments:",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga were right there, as were Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish, but the honor of opening the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles was given to two local brothers deeply affected by the wildfires: Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith of the band Dawes.",
      "They lost one brother\u2019s home along with their childhood home, instruments and much else. They've advocated for victims, raised money and were included in the FireAid benefit concert on Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey truly epitomize the unique spirit that we are seeing in LA right now,\u201d host Trevor Noah said. \u201cWhat better way to start the Grammy Awards?\u201d",
      "Dawes then played Randy Newman's \u201cI Love L.A.\u201d surrounded by an all-star backing band: John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent.",
      "\u201cLook at these firefighters, ain\u2019t nothin like \u2018em nowhere,\u201d Taylor Goldsmith sang, altering the line: \u201cLook at these women/There ain\u2019t nothing like \u2019em nowhere.\u201d",
      "Doechii won the Grammy for best rap album, only the third woman to win in that category. And, with her mother by her side, she had a strong message for young Black girls.",
      "\u201cI know that there's some Black girl out there, so many Black women out there, that are watching me right now, and I want to tell you: You can do it. Anything is possible. Anything is possible,\u201d she said.",
      "\"Don\u2019t allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you, to tell you that you can\u2019t be here, that you\u2019re too dark, or that you\u2019re not smart enough, or that you\u2019re too dramatic, or you\u2019re too loud. You are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are, and I am a testimony right now. Good night!\u201d",
      "The win caps an astounding few years for the 26-year-old Floridian who mixes R&B, hip-hop, jazz, boundary-pushing sounds and samples, and adds theatricality. She playfully calls herself the \u201cswamp princess.\u201d",
      "Her 2024 mixtape, \u201dAlligator Bites Never Heal\u2033 went to No. 33 on the Billboard 200, No. 9 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop chart and No. 8 on the Top Rap Album chart.",
      "Her Grammy performance of \u201cCatfish\u201d and \u201cDenial Is a River\u201d was electric, with the singer-songwriter backed by over a dozen dancers in matching Thom Browne suits and she eventually stripped down to a white two-piece set.",
      "Chappell Roan was crowned best new artist and then used her speech to demand change in the music business.",
      "\u201cI told myself that if I ever won a Grammy and got to stand up here before the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a livable wage and health care, especially to developing artists,\u201d she said.",
      "Roan began her music career in 2015 when she signed with Atlantic Records, releasing several singles including \u201cPink Pony Club.\u201d In 2020, the label dropped her. She moved back to her hometown to work as a barista before releasing her debut full-length album.",
      "\u201cIt was devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and dehumanized,\u201d Roan said in her speech. \u201cRecord labels need to treat their artists as valuable employees with a livable wage and health insurance and protection.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Roan performed a rocking version of her \u201cPink Pony Club,\u201d joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys as she sang from atop a giant pink horse.",
      "Lady Gaga, accepting the trophy for best pop duo or group alongside Bruno Mars for their chart-topping collab, \u201cDie with a Smile,\u201d gave a shout-out to the trans community, targets of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love,\" Lady Gaga said.",
      "Not long after, Alicia Keys, being honored with The Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, also backed diversity and inclusion programs, another Trump target.",
      "\u201cThis is not the time to shut down the diversity of voices,\u201d said Keys. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen on this stage talented, hardworking people from different backgrounds with different points of view, and it changes the game. DEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift.\u201d",
      "The Grammy Awards had a powerful way to prove that they've changed. They got a surprise endorsement by The Weeknd, who was last on the Grammy stage in 2017.",
      "The pop superstar in 2020 slammed the Grammys, calling them \u201ccorrupt\u201d after he landed zero nominations despite a megahit album. \u201cYou owe me, my fans and the industry transparency,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Grammys CEO Harvey Mason jr., who started in his post in 2020, on Sunday said he understood the criticism and listed all the things the Academy has done to fix it.",
      "\u201cWe have completely re-made our membership, adding more than 3,000 women voting members. The Grammy electorate is now younger, nearly 40% people of color, and 66% of our members are new since we started our transformation,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the past few years, we have listened, we\u2019ve acted and we\u2019ve changed.\u201d",
      "Mason then introduced The Weeknd, who performed two tunes from his just-released album \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d \u2014 \u201cCry For Me\u201d and \u201cTimeless\u201d with special guest Playboi Carti. He wore a long druid's robe and the stage was smoky.",
      "Will Smith, hosting a tribute to the late Quincy Jones, marked his first appearance at a major awards show since since he slapped Chris Rock onstage at the Oscars in 2022.",
      "\u201cIn his 91 years, Q touched countless lives, but I have to say, he changed mine forever. You probably wouldn\u2019t even know who Will Smith was if it wasn\u2019t for Quincy Jones,\" Smith said.",
      "Smith has been banned from film academy ceremonies for 10 years but the Grammys are a different beast. He made no mention of the infamous Slap.",
      "Smith has previously nabbed Grammy wins in the short form music video (\u201cWill 2K\u201d), best rap solo performance (\u201cGetting\u2019 Jiggy Wit It,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d), and best rap performance by a duo or group (\u201cSummertime\u201d as the Fresh Prince with DJ Jazzy Jeff).",

But this year, the gala was less of a party and more of a reflection of what can happen when the music industry comes together to support each other and the community after a disaster."

      "Noah's opening speech was dedicated to those affected by the fires, promising a show that not only celebrates them, but one that also celebrates \"the city that brought us so much of that music.\u201d The Grammys have also allotted ad time to be used by local businesses affected by the fires.",

      "The tears were immediate. \u201cThis category was introduced in 1989. Two women have won, Lauryn Hill \u2014\u201d she said, correcting herself. \u201cThree women have won. Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii.\u201d",
      "Will Smith introduced a tribute to the late, great, legendary producer Quincy Jones. \u201cIn his 91 years, Q touched countless lives, but I have to say he changed mine forever,\u201d he said. \u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t even know who Will Smith was without Quincy Jones.\u201d",

      "The Beatles\u2019 \u201cNow and Then,\u201d which used AI technology, took home best rock performance. Sean Lennon accepted the award on behalf of his father John Lennon. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s the best band of all time,\u201d he said of the Beatles. \u201cPlay the Beatles\u2019 music for your kids. I feel like the world can\u2019t afford to forget.\u201d",
      "Early on, Sabrina Carpenter launched into a medley of her biggest singles of the last year \u2014 a jazzy rendition of \u201cEspresso\u201d into \u201cPlease, Please, Please,\u201d with a brief \u201cEspresso\u201d reprise.",

      "\u201cI really wasn\u2019t expecting this,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is, woo, my first Grammy so I\u2019m going to cry.\u201d (She\u2019s now won two, but the earlier award was handed out a pre-telecast ceremony that many artists don\u2019t attend.)",

      "Film wasn\u2019t the only thing on people\u2019s minds at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, which comes to a close Sunday in Park City, Utah",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Film wasn\u2019t the only thing on people\u2019s minds at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, which comes to a close Sunday in Park City, Utah ( and online ).",
      "The effects of the wildfires in Southern California loomed large, as did the bittersweet knowledge that this year will be the second to last Sundance based in Park City. Some films offered an escape from reality; others were a pointed reminder of the domestic and international political landscape, from transgender rights to the war in Ukraine.",
      "Here are some of the key takeaways from the 41st edition of the festival.",
      "The wildfires were still burning in parts of Los Angeles when Sundance began last week and reminders of its devastation were everywhere, even on screen. Max Walker-Silverman\u2019s \u201cRebuilding,\u201d starring Josh O\u2019Connor as a cowboy who loses his ranch in a wildfire and forms a community with fellow survivors in a FEMA camp, hit close to home for many.",
      "Filmmakers Meena Menon and Paul Gleason lost their home in Altadena where they filmed some of their zombie apocalypse movie \u201cDidn\u2019t Die.\u201d Sundance artist labs head Michelle Satter lost her Palisades home as well. Satter had an audience of Sundance Institute donors in tears early in the festival while accepting an honor at a fundraising gala.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a deeply devastating time for us and so many others, a moment that calls for all of us coming together to support our bigger community,\u201d Satter said. \u201cAs a friend recently noted, and I have to listen to this, \u2018Take a deep breath ... We lost our village, but at the end of the day we are the village.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was a topic bound to come up in nearly every conversation: The festival\u2019s new home in 2027. \u201cWhere do you think it will go? How do you feel about it leaving Park City? What would Sundance in Ohio even look like?\u201d No one had any answers, but everyone had an opinion about the fact that next year will be the last year in which the center of activity is in Park City. Sundance Institute leadership has narrowed the finalist cities to Salt Lake City, Utah, Boulder, Colorado, and Cincinnati, Ohio, and is expected to announce the winner before spring.",
      "Actor Tessa Thompson, who serves on the institute\u2019s board, was hopeful about a new city.",
      "\u201cI think that Sundance has more to do with the spirit and community, and I think that\u2019s evergreen,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cRegardless of where Sundance is, Sundance will always be.\u201d",
      "In the early days of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second administration, politics were also a main topic of private discussions at least. Several films (mostly documentaries) had direct relevance to recent news, like \u201cHeightened Scrutiny,\u201d about transgender lawyer Chase Strangio and the media coverage of transgender issues amid a pending Supreme Court case.",
      "Even \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d filmmaker Bill Condon quoted Trump\u2019s \u201ctwo genders\u201d mandate before his film screened.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a sentiment I think you\u2019ll see that the movie has a different point of view on,\u201d Condon said.",
      "There also wasn\u2019t the spirit of public protest that was unavoidable eight years ago when Trump first took office, when A-listers took to the streets to march for women's rights. But audiences at Q&As for films like \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d about the abusive Alabama prison systems which the AP has reported extensively on, were curious how they could help change things.",
      "There have been essentially two major deals out of the festival so far: Netflix took \u201cTrain Dreams,\u201d Clint Bentley\u2019s lyrical Denis Johnson adaptation, with Joel Edgerton and Felicity Jones, and Neon acquired the Dave Franco and Alison Brie relationship body horror \u201cTogether.\u201d",
      "As always, some films came in with distribution in place: Focus Features with \u201cThe Ballad of Wallis Island\u201d; A24 with \u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You,\u201d \u201cOpus,\u201d and \u201cThe Legend of Ochi\u201d; Bleecker Street with \u201cThe Wedding Banquet\u201d; Nat Geo with the Sally Ride documentary \u201cSally\u201d; MUBI with \u201cMagic Farm\u201d; and Apple with \u201cDeaf President Now!\u201d; HBO Documentary Films with \u201cThe Alabama Solution\u201d and \u201cEnigma.\u201d",
      "Most deals happen after the festival ends, but there have been private grumblings that the market this year was weaker than usual, and the films were not commercial enough. Several insiders singled out Condon\u2019s adaptation of \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d with Jennifer Lopez as being too expensive for anyone but a streaming service. But there are also plenty of deals in the works, some of which will be finalized soon, while others may be settled at the Berlin Film Festival market.",
      "As festival programmers like to say, Sundance isn\u2019t the end of the story for new films \u2014 it\u2019s just the beginning. Last year\u2019s program had over 100 films distributed to audiences through traditional means, and only a small fraction of those were announced during the festival.",
      "Perhaps the biggest discovery of the festival is \u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d from writer-director-star Eva Victor in her feature debut. This funny and quietly piercing film is about Agnes, who was sexually assaulted by her thesis advisor. Instead of making it about depicting the incident itself (Victor keeps the camera firmly planted outside of the home where it occurs, showing the passage of time through light), Victor, who could be the next Greta Gerwig and/or Phoebe Waller-Bridge, stays focused on how it affects Anges.",
      "Filmmaker James Sweeney also scored a big win with \u201cTwinless,\u201d which picked up the U.S. dramatic audience prize and a special award for his star Dylan O\u2019Brien. The movie is about a bromance between two men in a twin bereavement group.",
      "On the documentary side there was much chatter about \u201cAndr\u00e9 Is an Idiot,\u201d a documentary about a \u201cbrilliant idiot\u201d who is dying because he didn\u2019t get a colonoscopy and trying to live out his final days happily.",
      "The in-person experience at Sundance is also a good reminder that reviews are only part of the equation when it comes to judging the response to a film. Hailey Gates\u2019 war satire \u201cAtropia\u201d got mixed reviews from critics, but premiere audiences were very enthusiastic (as was the U.S. dramatic jury who gave it the festival\u2019s top prize ).",
      "As of publication, all are still seeking distribution.",
      "Others that played notably well with audiences and critics include: \u201cIf I Had Legs I'd Kick You,\u201d \u201cDJ Ahmet,\u201d \u201cCactus Pears,\u201d \"2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d \u201cPlainclothes,\u201d \u201cRicky,\u201d \u201cPrime Minister,\u201d \u201cSelena y Los Dinos,\u201d \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d\u201cSLY LIVES!,\u201d \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d \u201cPredators,\u201d \u201cEast of Wall,\u201d \u201cFolktales,\u201d \u201cFree Leonard Peltier,\u201d \u201cPeter Hujar\u2019s Day,\u201d \u201cThe Ballad of Wallis Island\u201d and \u201cTrain Dreams.\u201d",

      "Olivier Dubois, a French journalist, was kidnapped by JNIM, a branch of al-Qaida in Africa's Sahel region, while on his way to interview one of the group's leaders in northern Mali",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- For a foreign correspondent in Mali, the assignment seemed like a dream: as Islamic extremists upended the region, Olivier Dubois, a French journalist, secured a rare interview with a leader of JNIM, an al-Qaida\u2019s affiliate in the Sahel.",
      "Or so he thought. En route to the interview in Gao, northern Mali, in April 2021, Dubois, a correspondent for Lib\u00e9ration and Jeune Afrique publications, was kidnapped.",
      "He spent 711 days in desert captivity, sleeping chained to a tree, eating dried goat meat and plotting his escape. Nearly two years after his release, he recounts his ordeal in a book released Thursday in France that draws heavily on notes Dubois secretly kept during his captivity, written on any scrap of paper he could find.",
      "\u201cOne of the main factors that helped me resist and survive was telling myself that I am a journalist,\u201d Dubois told The Associated Press in the first interview for English-language media since his release. \"Let\u2019s continue to gather information, let\u2019s continue to ask questions and pretend I\u2019m working.\"",
      "The Sahel countries of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger in recent years have been upended by military coups and are now led by military juntas, which struggle against rising extremist violence and have made kidnappings a cornerstone of their strategy in the region.",
      "Upon his release, French media published an investigation revealing that Dubois's fixer had worked with French intelligence, who used him to locate the extremist leader he was trying to interview.",
      "Dubois told the AP he knew his project was risky, but that he trusted his fixer too much and ignored the warning signs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said of the circumstances surrounding his kidnapping. \u201cI think it was a betrayal. But the motive for the betrayal is not yet clear. I have not spoken to my fixer since I have been released.\u201d",
      "Kidnappings have skyrocketed in the Sahel in recent years, according to data from the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED.",
      "JNIM, the Sahelian branch of al-Qaida, has been responsible for most of the 1,468 kidnappings in Sahel and Benin between 2017 and 2025, according to the ACLED. The group relies on ransom money to fund their operations and on the fear they instill on local populations to keep them in check.",
      "Dubois recalled being told he would be \"released quickly\u201d if his family and government did as instructed.",
      "Dubois was released on March 20, 2023, in Agadez, Niger, but details of his release, including whether a ransom was paid, remain undisclosed.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron took to the social platform X to write \u201cOlivier Dubois is free,\" but he did not elaborate on the conditions of the release.",
      "Speaking to the AP, Dubois said that he did not know the details either, but he recalled being told by the rebels that ransoms varied by nationality. As a French citizen, he was worth 10 million euros, he was told. A South African was worth 50 million.",
      "Having covered numerous hostage stories in the region, Dubois knew that even if freed, his ordeal could be lengthy.",
      "In order to stay sane, he became obsessed with plotting an escape. But after the fourth unsuccessful attempt, his captors staged a mock execution and threatened to kill him if he tried again. So instead, Dubois started reading the Quran.",
      "Reading the holy book of Islam served a dual purpose: it occupied his mind, and helped him understand his captors better, be able to discuss with them and build a relationship, so they could treat him more as a human being and less as an anonymous hostage.",
      "Unexpectedly, it also put him on a more spiritual path.",
      "\"I am a former atheist, then an agnostic who thought I\u2019d stop there,\u201d he said. \u201cReading the Quran made me want to read other religious texts. This captivity has been the beginning of a journey that will perhaps lead me to God \u2014 or not.\u201d",
      "Now that his book \u2014 \u201cPrisonnier du d\u00e9sert, 711 jours aux mains d\u2019Al-Qa\u00efda,\u201d which translates in English into \u201cPrisoner of the desert, 711 days in the hands of Al-Qaida\u201d \u2014 is out, Dubois said he was hoping he was ready to go back to journalism and move on.",
      "But the experience still haunts him.",
      "\u201cIt was painful labour,\u201d he said of the writing process. \u201cThe first reflex after finishing it was to distance myself from the story, hoping time will pass and, maybe, all of that will be behind me. But I don't really know if that's possible.\u201d"

      "Khaby Lame, the Senegalese-Italian influencer who ranks as world\u2019s most popular TikTok personality, has been named as a goodwill ambassador by the U.N.'s children\u2019s agency",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- DAKAR, Senegal (AP) \u2014 Khaby Lame, the Senegal-born world\u2019s most popular TikTok personality who never says a word in videos watched by millions of followers, addressed the youth in his native country on Friday when he was appointed as UNICEF goodwill ambassador.",
      "The 24-year-old influencer, who has over 162 million followers, rose to fame with charming videos of his reactions to everyday life in which he never says a word. His following surged during the pandemic, when he was fired from his factory job and used the extra time on his hands to make and upload more videos.",
      "Being a UNICEF ambassador will allow him to \u201csee all the world and its problems,\u201d Lame said, adding that he hoped he could contribute to solving some of them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a true honor to be appointed as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador and be part of an organization that puts children\u2019s rights front and center every day,\u201d Lame said in a statement. \u201cFrom my own experience as a child fearing poverty, struggling to find my passion at school, and losing my job during the COVID-19 pandemic, to finding my place and calling in the world, I know that all children can thrive when they are given a chance and opportunity.\u201d",
      "Senegal is a major source of irregular migration to Europe. Over 60% of Senegalese people are under 25, and 90% work in informal jobs. They have watched for years as money made from natural resources has gone overseas, and many say they have no other choice but to embark on treacherous journeys in rickety fishing boats across the Atlantic.",
      "\u201cI tell them to dream big,\u201d Lame said when asked about his message to Senegal's youth. \u201cTry and do your best to accomplish your dreams, even though there are people telling you that you cannot reach them.\u201d",
      "Lame moved to Italy from his native Senegal when he was an infant with his working class parents, but was only granted Italian citizenship when he was 20.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been in Italy for 20 years since I was only 2 years old,\u201d Lame told The Associated Press in Dakar. Looking sharp in a beige suit and a matching tie, he added: \u201cMy blood is from Senegal, but I feel Senegalese and Italian at the same time.\u201d",
      "Lame's appointment to UNICEF came at the end of a four-day visit to Senegal where he met children and young people who are driving positive change in their communities.",

      "In a stretch of questioning crucial to the defense of A$AP Rocky, his lawyer is challenging the account of his accuser, who says he suffered a hand injury when the hip-hop performer fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021",
      "LOS ANGELES -- In a stretch of questioning crucial to the defense of A$AP Rocky, his lawyer on Friday challenged the account of his accuser, who said he suffered a hand injury when the hip-hop performer fired a gun at him in 2021.",
      "Superstar singer Rihanna, Rocky\u2019s partner and the mother of their two children, watched from the audience as the man who goes by A$AP Relli, a former friend of Rocky, underwent a second day of cross-examination at the Los Angeles trial that left him visibly frustrated and at times angry.",
      "She slipped into court for a third day about 30 minutes into the testimony and sat next to Rocky\u2019s mother after coming in through a public entrance. After the lunch break, she entered the courtroom together with Rocky for the first time. She had been brought in privately, out of view of the public, on her previous visits.",
      "Relli had testified under prosecution questioning that his hand felt hot when Rocky fired at him on a Hollywood street and his hand was grazed. A photo was shown of scrapes that had torn the skin on his knuckles.",
      "He did not seek medical attention until two days later in New York.",
      "\u201cYou waited to fly all the way across country before seeking medical attention?\u201d defense attorney Joe Tacopina asked.",
      "\u201cI had my hand wrapped that night,\u201d Relli said, then acknowledged he had.",
      "He said that after the incident, \u201cI didn't trust LA. I didn't trust nobody.\u201d",
      "Through their opening statement and the cross-examination, Rocky's attorneys have suggested Relli only sought medical attention because the lawyer in a separate civil case where he's seeking money from the rapper, told him he should.",
      "Relli at first denied that he had been acting on his lawyer's advice, but later conceded after hearing his previous testimony.",
      "\u201cYou really don\u2019t care about getting the police involved, your endgame was getting money from Rocky, correct?\u201d Tacopina asked.",
      "Relli answered, \u201cNo. I wanted protection. I wasn\u2019t sure it wouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d",
      "Tacopina also challenged him about the short time he spent at the hospital.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one hour and 36 minutes for a gunshot, yeah?\u201d the lawyer said.",
      "\u201cIt was two days later,\u201d Relli replied.",
      "Anticipating the defense tactic, the prosecution told jurors during their opening statement that for the charges in the case \u2014 two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm \u2014 it doesn't matter whether Relli was injured.",
      "Relli appeared angry and frustrated throughout the testimony. He constantly asked if questions were relevant, muttered to himself, and had to be instructed by the judge to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d After listening to two different recordings of phone calls the defense said were him, he declared both were fake.",
      "Guilty findings on both counts could lead to a maximum of 24 years in prison for Rocky.",
      "That verdict could be a major turning point in the life of the rapper, who this weekend is nominated for his third Grammy Award at a ceremony at Crypto.com Arena just two miles from the trial.",
      "Rocky's attorneys are arguing, in a revelation made just before the trial began, that the gun he fired was a starter pistol that carried only blanks that he had just as a prop for security. They allege Relli knew this.",
      "Relli testified under prosecution questioning that he had not known Rocky to carry a gun.",
      "When Tacopina returned to the question, Relli hedged.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really chill with him every day, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the time I chill with him, I don\u2019t know him carrying guns.\u201d",
      "Tacopina continued, \u201cWell one thing you know, is for sure he doesn't carry a prop gun.\u201d",
      "\u201cWho carries a prop gun?\u201d Relli answered. \u201cWho\u2019s going to come to a situation and carry a prop gun?\u201d",
      "After the jury was dismissed for lunch, a vicious argument broke out between Tacopina and Deputy District Attorney John Lewin over a racy photo of Relli's girlfriend that he showed Relli to identify her.",
      "Lewin argued it was an attempt to inflame the witness, and that the defense's entire case failed to address the actual incident, including \u201cthis prop gun garbage!\u201d",
      "\u201cOh?! Oh!?\u201d Tacopina shouted back. \u201cWe'll see what the jury says at the end!\"",
      "Tacopina then called Relli a perjurer, and said that the prosecutors were abetting him.",
      "As it got even louder and more personal, the judge, who seemed disgusted, walked out.",
      "He had previously instructed the men, who have butted heads often, only to talk to each other on the record. In this case they were, though the cameras had been turned off.",
      "Rocky and Rihanna, both 36, have two sons together: 2-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and 1-year-old Riot Rose Mayers.",

      "There have been plenty of out-of-the-ordinary moments at the ongoing trial of rapper A$AP Rocky",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The trial of rapper A$AP Rocky is progressing according to standard legal procedure, but there have been no lack of unusual moments, from visits from Rihanna to a tough-but-quirky judge and lawyers nearly coming to blows.",
      "Testimony is expected to last another week before jurors will decide Rocky's fate on two counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm. A conviction could lead to up to 24 years in prison for the hip-hop star.",
      "Here are some of the out-of-the-ordinary moments from the first two weeks of the trial, most not captured by the cameras in the courtroom.",
      "From the moment it became clear the case was going to trial, nearly everyone involved was asking the same thing: What about Rihanna?",
      "Editors asked it of reporters, who asked it of lawyers. Even Judge Mark Arnold asked it months ago at a hearing: \u201cWill the mother of his children be there?\u201d",
      "Her name came up constantly during jury selection, when prospective panelists were asked whether her attendance would affect their judgment.",
      "Yet when the singing superstar finally did show up, she was easy to miss.",
      "She didn't appear through the first week, but rumors abounded Wednesday that she might appear, on a short court day with important testimony. Yet there was no sign of her outside or in the halls. (Unlike a nearby civil courthouse, where celebrities like Britney Spears and the Kardashians are smuggled in, Rocky and other defendants must use public entrances and many thought she'd accompany him.)",
      "When the media were allowed in the courtroom, many reporters walked past her without noticing she was already sitting inconspicuously between Rocky's mother and sister. She had been brought in through restricted entrances. She could barely be seen from the media section, and the camera capturing the trial is not allowed to shoot the audience.",
      "Her presence caused a quiet stir once the audience realized it, though it's not clear if the jurors had noticed her.",
      "She appeared again the next day, and it soon felt almost unexceptional that she was there. By Friday, she slipped in about 30 minutes into testimony after coming through a public entrance.",
      "Later that day she entered the courtroom together with Rocky for the first time, down a hallway full of jurors from his and other cases that was abuzz.",
      "Court observers knew that when Deputy District Attorney John Lewin joined the prosecution shortly before trial, that he and Rocky's equally bullish and vocal attorney, Joe Tacopina, were sure to butt heads. They weren't wrong.",
      "Lewin, a dogged prosecutor, is best known for his successful murder prosecution of real estate heir Robert Durst. Tacopina is a New York attorney and frequent TV commentator whose clients have included President Donald Trump.",
      "Their shouting matches began quickly. Soon, without judge or jury present, the two had to be separated by a fellow lawyer when they went nose-to-nose in a faceoff that looked like it might become a fistfight.",
      "\u201cMr. Tacopina started literally screaming at me in the courtroom. He basically appeared to challenge me to a fight,\u201d Lewin told the judge later.",
      "Tacopina responded. \u201cNo one screamed. You weren\u2019t there your honor. Mr. Lewin comes up with his little scolding, bullying attitude.\u201d",
      "Arnold, a former sheriff's deputy, forbade the two from talking to each other except on the record.",
      "Moments later, he said a UFC fight might be warranted. \u201cMaybe we should get an octagon.\u201d",
      "Arnold wasn't wrong either. An even more fierce fight broke out between the two men in front of the judge but off camera a few days later as they argued over evidence. Lewin shouted that the defense assertion Rocky was carrying a prop gun was \u201cgarbage.\"",
      "\u201cOh?! Oh?!\u201d Tacopina yelled. \u201cWe'll see what the jury says at the end!\"",
      "\"The argument grew more out of control and turned to personal insults.",
      "\u201cYou don't know me! But you will learn!\u201d Tacopina yelled.",
      "The judge, disgusted, refused to keep playing referee.",
      "\u201cThat's it, we're off the record,\u201d he said, and walked out.",
      "The testimony of A$AP Relli, Rocky's accuser, was dark and difficult but brought a couple of oddly light moments.",
      "At one point, Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec asked him how far away Rocky was at a certain moment.",
      "\u201cAbout three or four skips,\" Relli said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never heard about anyone estimating with skips,\u201d Przelomiec said.",
      "\u201cWait, what does a skip mean?\u201d the judge asked.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I mean?\u201d Relli asked.",
      "They determined for the record that it was about 7 to 8 feet.",
      "Arnold's long-for-a-judge hair and rugged, bushy mustache evoke a biker, or a cowboy. His nameplate on the bench is a carved wooden log. Relli let him know he liked his style.",
      "As he testified, Arnold told him he clearly had to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d for the court reporter.",
      "Relli said sorry, he was nervous, then looking at the judge said, \u201cI like your bracelet.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat?\u201d Arnold said.",
      "Relli pointed at the silver wristband on the judge's right arm. \u201cYour bracelet.\u201d",
      "\u201cOh,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThank you.\u201d",
      "Rocky\u2019s mother, Renee Black, and his sister, Erika Mayers, garnered their own share of attention even before Rihanna sat between them.",
      "The first day they appeared, Arnold asked Rocky who the women in his section were.",
      "\u201cThat's my mother and my sister,\u201d Rocky said. The judge's marveled at Black's youthful appearance.",
      "\u201cWhat were you, 7 when you had him?\u201d the judge asked. She said she was 26.",
      "\u201cYou are very beautiful,\u201d the judge told her. \u201cThat\u2019s on the record.\u201d",
      "Later, Lewin politely approached the women and talked to them during a break. He said of Rocky, \u201cI just hope he's evaluating everything\u201d in a reference to the deal Rocky turned down \u2014 a recommendation of 180 days in jail and other relatively minor punishments for a guilty plea on one count.",
      "Tacopina angrily brought it up to the judge later, and Lewin explained himself.",
      "\u201cI walked up very kindly to the defendants mother and sister. I said \u2018I am very sorry you have to go through this. I hope that your brother and your son, he\u2019s really evaluated what he\u2019s risking here.\u2019\u201d",
      "During jury selection, when the room was packed with tired and seemingly bored potential jurors being questioned one after another, a woman gave everyone a start when she suddenly shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s a woman taking a picture in that corner!\u201d",
      "She pointed to a door with a small window behind the judge, who pounced into action, his robe flying. He and his clerk opened the door and hurried down the hall behind it, but found no one.",
      "The woman swore she saw someone and tried to justify herself, but Arnold cut her off.",
      "\u201cYou did the right thing!\u201d Arnold said. \u201cYou done good!\u201d",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum, which he said will be renovated and expanded in a major overhaul within the next ten years",
      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron announced Tuesday that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum under a major renovation and expansion of the Paris landmark that will take up to 10 years.",
      "The renovation project, branded \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d will include a new entrance near the River Seine, to be opened by 2031, and the creation of underground rooms, Macron said in a speech from the Louvre room where Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece is displayed.",
      "Macron did not disclose an exact amount budgeted for the project to modernize the most visited museum in the world, plagued with overcrowding and outdated facilities. But it is estimated to reach up to 800 million euros ($834 million).",
      "The Louvre's latest overhaul dates back to the 1980s, when the iconic glass pyramid was unveiled. Now, the museum is not up to international standards anymore.",
      "A look at what's at stake:",
      "Macron said the expansion of the museum will allow the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d to be moved to a new, dedicated room accessible to visitors through a special ticket. That will make the visit simpler for those who want to see the painting and ease the life of other visitors in the rest of the museum, he said.",
      "The \u201cMona Lisa\u201d is now being shown behind protective glass in the museum\u2019s largest room, overcrowded with long, noisy queues of visitors eager to take a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s masterpiece. That makes some other paintings in the room by the greatest Venetian painters like Titian and Veronese go unnoticed by many.",
      "The museum\u2019s latest big renovation in the 1980s was designed to receive 4 million annual visitors.",
      "Last year, the Louvre received 8.7 million visitors, over three-quarters being foreigners mostly from the United States, China and neighboring countries Italy, the UK, Germany and Spain.",
      "Macron said a new entrance for the Louvre will be created near the River Seine by 2031, to be financed by ticket sales, patronage and licensing money from the museum's Abu Dhabi branch.",
      "A design competition is to be staged in the coming months, he said. In addition, some new underground rooms will be created to expand the museum.",
      "A French top official said the cost of the renovation is estimated at 700 to 800 million euros ($730 to 834 million) over the next ten years, including half for the creation of the new entrance. The official could not be named in line with the French presidency\u2019s customary practices.",
      "Macron said ticket prices will be raised for foreign visitors from outside the European Union, up from 22 euros ($23) now. He promised the museum will be safer and more comfortable for both the public and the staff.",
      "Half the Louvre's budget is currently being financed by the French state, including the wages of the 2,200 employees.",
      "The other half is provided by private funds including ticket sales, earnings from restaurants, shops and bookings for special events, as well as patrons and other partners.",
      "The renovation announcement comes after Louvre Director Laurence des Cars expressed her concerns in a note to Culture Minister Rachida Dati earlier this month saying the museum is threatened by \u201cobsolescence.\u201d",
      "According to the document first released by French newspaper Le Parisien, she warned about the gradual degradation of the building due to water leaks, temperature variations and other issues \u201cendangering the preservation of artworks.\u201d",
      "The pyramid that serves at the museum\u2019s entrance, unveiled in 1989 as part of late President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s project, now appears outdated. The place is not properly insulated from the cold and the heat and tends to amplify noise, making the space uncomfortable for both the public and the staff, des Cars stressed.",
      "In addition, the museum suffers from a lack of food offerings and restroom facilities, she said."

      "The singer superstar, who has two toddler sons with the rapper Rocky, sat out of view of the courtroom\u2019s cameras, between Rocky\u2019s mother and sister, in the downtown Los Angeles criminal courthouse. Security brought her in surreptitiously to avoid crowds Wednesday morning.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Athelston Mayers, has been standing trial on two felony charges that he fired a handgun at the former friend, who is known by the name A$AP Relli and was born Terell Ephron. If convicted, Rocky could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "Rihanna watched Wednesday as Relli testified about the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "He had been shouting angrily at Rocky, who was walking away after an initial confrontation and scuffle, when Rocky pulled a gun from his waistband and held it in the air, Relli testified.",

      "The trial's key witness said he grabbed one of their mutual friends who were with Rocky after the first shot was fired and stood behind him for protection. He said he did not see Rocky fire the second shot, and Rocky ran away moments later.",
      "When jurors were being selected, prosecutors asked them whether Rihanna\u2019s connection to the case, especially if she appeared in court, would affect their ability to deliver a guilty verdict.",
      "Nearly all those questioned had heard of her \u2014 far more than had heard of Rocky \u2014 and some described themselves as fans, but all said they felt it would not affect their decisions.",
      "It was not clear whether they could see Rihanna or were aware of her presence as they watched the testimony. She wore a long black dress with buttons on the front that resembled a winter overcoat, and had a pair of glasses on her head that she put on during the prosecution's questioning.",
      "Earlier in the trial, which began on Jan. 21, Relli said he and Rocky, members of A$AP, a crew of creators at a New York high school, had been close but their relationship eroded after Rocky became famous.",
      "He said their relationship had been strained for years and was getting worse in the days leading up to the incident, but he was still \u201cfurious\u201d when Rocky pulled a gun on him after a scuffle that began the moment the two met up near the W Hotel. He dared him to use it.",

      "\u201cOh it was a real gun,\u201d Relli testified Wednesday, saying he knew because of his scraped hand.",
      "He said he felt free to follow and shout at Rocky because \u201cI felt like because he put it away and we\u2019re on a busy street in Hollywood. He\u2019s definitely not gonna shoot it.\u201d",
      "Since the shooting, and his decision to go to police and testify, he has gotten death threats and has been shunned as a snitch, he said, and the modest music management career he built fell apart.",
      "\u201cIt's been a living hell,\u201d Relli said.",
      "About an hour after the shooting, Relli returned to the scene and said he photographed and recovered two shell casings. Earlier, while responding to a report of a shooting, police did not find any.",
      "He sent a text to Rocky that was shown in court saying \"U try killing me.\"",

      "The defense will begin their cross-examination of Relli on Thursday.",
      "Raised in Harlem, Rocky\u2019s rap songs became a phenomenon in New York in 2011. He had his mainstream breakthrough when his first studio album went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2013. The second one, in 2015, did the same.",

Kylie Jenner led a constellation of stars, seated atop two giant interlocking C\u2019s raised like a bridge \u2014 perhaps a metaphor for the house\u2019s transition to its bold new chapter.",
      "Critics expecting an underwhelming, designer-less show were swiftly proven wrong. Chanel\u2019s studio punched above its weight, delivering a collection of striking hues and diverse designs showcasing its couture ateliers\u2019 unrivaled artistry.",
      "For a designer famous for revolutionizing fashion with the use of black, this collection went against the grain. Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel\u2019s lesser-known talent as a colorist took center stage, with joyful pastels, bold tones, midnight blue, and classic black following a complete cycle from day to night \u2014 something like a \u201cgreatest hits\u201d collection on the eve of the reboot.",
      "The runway pieces struck a balance between whimsy and drama. Beyond the house's bread-and-butter tweed skirt suits, leg-of-mutton sleeves brought historical grandeur, evoking a sense of Victorian elegance. Sequins and paillettes shimmered under the bring Grand Palais light. Silk trains in bold red injected a sense of drama. Playful neckties hinted at a 1970s influence.",

      "Incarcerated men in the Alabama prison system risked their safety to feed shocking footage of their horrifying living conditions to a pair of documentary filmmakers",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Incarcerated men in the Alabama prison system risked their safety to feed shocking footage of their horrifying living conditions to a pair of documentary filmmakers. The result is \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City.",
      "Filmmakers Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman became interested in Alabama prisons in 2019. Jarecki, the filmmaker behind \u201cThe Jinx\u201d and \u201cCapturing the Friedmans,\u201d and Kaufman first gained access to the restricted grounds through a visit with a chaplain during a revival meeting held in the prison yards. There men pulled them aside and whispered shocking stories about the reality of life inside: forced labor, drugs, violence, intimidation, retaliation and the undisclosed truths behind many prisoner deaths.",
      "The Associated Press has written extensively about the problems in the state\u2019s prison system, including high rates of violence, low staffing, a plummeting parole rate and the use of pandemic funds to build a new supersized prison.",
      "This process eventually led them to incarcerated activists Melvin Ray and Robert Earl Council (also known as \u201cKinetik Justice\u201d) who had for years been trying to expose the horrifying conditions and deep- seated corruption across the system. They helped feed dispatches to the filmmakers with contraband cellphones.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re deeply concerned for their safety, and we have been since the first time we met them,\u201d said Kaufman. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this work for decades and as you see in the film, they\u2019ve been retaliated against in very extreme ways. But there are lawyers who are ready to do wellness checks and visit them and respond to any sort of retaliation that may come.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday at the first showing of the film, she had Council on the phone listening in. They put the microphone up to the cellphone so that Council could speak.",
      "\u201cWe thank you all for listening, for being interested,\u201d Council said. \u201cOn behalf of the brothers of Alabama, I thank you all.\u201d",
      "Several family members of their incarcerated subjects were also in the audience, including Sandy Ray, the mother of Steven Davis, who died in 2019 at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility, his face beaten beyond recognition. Prison officials said Davis was killed in self-defense because he didn\u2019t put down his weapons. The prisoners tell a vastly different story.",
      "Alelur \u201cAlex\u201d Duran, who spent 12 years in prison in New York, also helped produce the film. Jarecki said they wouldn't have taken on the subject without the expertise of someone who had been incarcerated.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in this film is going on all over the nation,\u201d Duran said.",
      "Also embedded in the story is Alabama\u2019s long history of contracting prisoners to do work at private companies from Burger King to Best Western, an issue that the AP investigated for over two years. The cheap, reliable labor force has generated more than $250 million for the state since 2000 \u2014 money garnished from prisoners\u2019 paychecks, the AP wrote in December. Parole numbers have also plummeted in recent years.",
      "\u201cWe want to show viewers the truth about a system that has been cloaked in secrecy,\u201d Jarecki said. \u201cWe hope the film sparks an effort to allow access for journalists and others so the public can have transparency into how incarcerated citizens are treated and how our tax dollars are being spent. We hope to inspire Alabama\u2019s leadership to acknowledge the crisis and to overhaul its prison system and its use of forced labor.\u201d",
      "The film will have a theatrical release before it debuts on HBO sometime this year, but the specific dates and details are still being worked out. And while it is in its early days, the impact, Jarecki said, has already been seen, including in a class action labor lawsuit.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:02:29 -0500",
    "summary": "William E",
    "story": [
      "William E",
      "NEW YORK -- William E. Leuchtenburg, a prize-winning historian widely admired for his authoritative writings on the U.S. presidency and as the reigning scholar on Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal, has died at 102.",
      "Leuchtenburg died Tuesday at his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, according to his son, Joshua A. Leuchtenburg, who cited no specific cause of death.",
      "A professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina and a published author for more than 70 years, William E. Leuchtenburg was praised for his encyclopedic knowledge and rigorous, but accessible style. He received some of the top awards given to historians, including the Parkman and Bancroft prizes, was a political analyst for CBS and NBC and consulted on several of Ken Burns' PBS documentaries. In 2008, he was given the Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Award for \"Distinguished Writing\" of American history.",
      "Leuchtenburg's notable books include \"Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal\" and \"The Perils of Prosperity,\" a history of the U.S. from World War I to the peak of the Great Depression. Although politically liberal, his expertise called upon by aides to Lyndon Johnson and other Democratic politicians, he was as willing to point out the New Deal\u2019s disappointments as its successes: His scholarship was closely studied by younger FDR historians, from Jonathan Alter to Burns collaborator Geoffrey Ward, who dedicated the 2014 book \u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d to Leuchtenburg. And he was otherwise known for his generosity with Ward and others who sought his expertise.",
      "His most influential work was likely the Bancroft-winning \u201cFranklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal,\u201d published in 1963. Leuchtenburg found that the impact of FDR's vast and unprecedented response to the Depression was limited by political calculation, especially the president's reluctance to challenge racial segregation in the South, and that \u201cIt never demonstrated that it could achieve prosperity\" until the U.S. entered World War II. But he also credited the New Deal with transforming the role of federal government and Roosevelt with reinventing the presidency, using the young medium of radio to convince millions that he knew them personally.",
      "\u201cNothing is glossed over at all,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Charles Poore wrote upon the book\u2019s release. \u201cYou live here through years of tumult and disaster, triumph and ineptitude and daring.\u201d",
      "Leuchtenburg's books on Roosevelt covered his presidency and beyond. \"In the Shadow of FDR,\" published in 1983 and periodically updated, demonstrated how presidents from Truman to George W. Bush attempted to shun and/or embrace Roosevelt's legacy. Leuchtenburg wrote of Roosevelt's immediate successor, Harry Truman, gesturing in the White House to a portrait of FDR and admitting, \"I'm trying to do what he would like.\" He noted the frustration of Republican Dwight Eisenhower and Democrat John F. Kennedy in being compared, unfavorably, to Roosevelt, and how Jimmy Carter began his 1976 presidential run with a speech in Warm Springs, Georgia, where FDR often stayed. At the time of his death, Leuchtenburg was working on an edition that would have included the administration of Joe Biden, who kept a portrait of Roosevelt in the Oval Office.",
      "The 2005 book \"The White House Looks South\" featured sections on Roosevelt, Truman and Lyndon Johnson and told of how each embraced or distanced themselves from the South. Roosevelt, a native of New York, spent so much time in Warm Springs that the state's governor referred to him as our \"fellow-Georgian.\" Johnson, a Texan, alternately identified himself as a Southerner or a Westerner, depending on the intended audience.",
      "In the prologue, Leuchtenburg fondly noted his own journey, remembering visits to baseball spring training camps in Florida, marching with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Montgomery, Alabama, and never failing on New Year's Day to partake of black-eyed peas and collard greens, \"even if they are eaten with a grimace.\"",
      "\"In sum, I am in, but not of, the South,\" he concluded.",
      "He was a popular and rigorous educator \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201cThe Big L\u201d \u2014 who taught at Smith College, Harvard University and Columbia University before settling at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the early 1980s. A former president of the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians, he held such stature that he contributed to later editions of \"The Growth of the American Republic,\" a standard college textbook originally written by Henry Steele Commager and Samuel Eliot Morison. Historians studying under him ranged from Allan Brandt to Howard Zinn.",
      "Leuchtenburg was married twice, most recently to Jean Anne Leuchtenburg, and had three children.",
      "A postal clerk's son born in New York City in 1922, William Edward Leuchtenburg was so fascinated by politics that at age 12, he raised money tutoring neighborhood kids to fund a nine-hour bus ride to Washington, where he would recall his \"wide-eyed\" tour of the White House and the \"brand-new marble palace of the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",
      "His affinity for Roosevelt was lifelong and personal. When he was 10, he sat by the radio and counted delegates as FDR was elected to his first term as president. He was able to afford college with help from a job found through a New Deal program, the National Youth Administration.",
      "Leuchtenburg graduated from Cornell University, received a master's degree and a doctorate from Columbia and worked for a civil rights lobby and other political organizations before deciding to focus on history. His first book, \u201cFlood Control Politics,\u201d came out in 1953, followed five years later by \u201cThe Perils of Prosperity.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Leuchtenburg wrote a short, critical biography of FDR\u2019s predecessor, Herbert Hoover, and the 900-page \u201cThe American President: From Teddy Roosevelt to Bill Clinton.\u201d He continued to work every morning and, at age 101, completed \u201cPatriot Presidents,\u201d the first of a planned multi-volume history that he acknowledged in the book's preface \u201cmay be too ambitious.\u201d"

      "The Grammys will look a little bit different this year",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Grammy Awards will look a little bit different this week.",
      "Each year, the Recording Academy hosts a multitude of events to welcome the music industry during Grammy week and record labels do the same. However, many institutions have canceled their plans \u2014 Universal Music Group, Sony, Spotify, BMG and Warner Music Group among them \u2014 and instead are allocating resources to help those affected by the devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires.",
      "The Grammys will still take place on Sunday at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles but now will focus its attention on helping wildfire victims.",
      "Within days of fires ravaging the Pacific Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods, the Recording Academy and its affiliated MusiCares charity launched the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort with a $1 million dollar donation. According to a letter sent to members on Jan. 13, thanks to additional contributions, they\u2019ve already distributed $2 million in emergency aid.",
      "Once the fund was set up, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason jr. said they began focusing on reformatting what Grammy week would look like \u2014 many conversations conducted \u201con the road, mobile-y, virtually\u201d as staffers had evacuated their homes.",
      "\u201cThat process has really consisted of reaching out to just listen and learn from a lot of people \u2014 state officials, local officials, the governor\u2019s office, the mayor\u2019s office, the fire department. We talked to hotel managers, just really trying to get a grasp on what was happening currently. What did they project was going to happen in the next week to 10 days? Would be safe to have a show?\"",
      "Ultimately, the Recording Academy decided to condense its pre-Grammy week plans to just four events, each featuring a fundraising element.",
      "On Friday, MusiCares, an organization that helps music professionals who need financial, personal or medical assistance, will hold its annual Persons of the Year benefit gala\u2009celebrating the Grateful Dead.",
      "On Saturday, the Special Merit Awards Ceremony and Grammy nominees' reception will still take place, followed by Clive Davis' pre-Grammy fundraising event.",
      "Then the Grammys take the stage on Sunday.",
      "Events like the annual pre-Grammy Black Music Collective event, Grammy advocacy brunch, and others scheduled to take place at the immersive pop-up Grammy house have been canceled.",
      "\u201cWe thought consolidating the events would allow us to have more impact,\u201d Mason explains. \u201cAnd we just don\u2019t feel it was the right time to have social gatherings or places to party or schmooze and just hang out. We wanted to have our events be places that could be purposeful and impactful. Some of the party settings, we decided to fold down into our fundraising efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cObviously, we can\u2019t have a normal show in the midst of people\u2019s belongings being burned or loss of life or other things like that. At the same time, canceling would not have helped,\u201d Mason says.",
      "\u201cWe needed to raise money. We needed to show unity and come together around music. We need to support the city of L.A. (Over) 6,500 people work on our shows and ancillary gatherings. So, once we decided to move forward, it was really a conversation with (Grammy producers) Ben Winston, Raj Kapoor and Jesse Collins and myself. And we started to think about, \u2018How do we make the show have the greatest impact?\u2019\u201d",
      "They decided the path forward was to still give out awards and host performances to give viewers and attendees a bespoke concert experience. But most importantly, the show could raise awareness, drive donations and resources to funds that benefit people in need.",
      "And the conversations are ongoing. \u201cWe have some great things in the show that will definitely help to raise funds,\" he assures. \"It will honor some of the heroes that have been protecting our lives and our homes. It will hopefully shine a light on some people that need more help and more services.\u201d",
      "Don't expect a traditional telethon, but he says the show will feature announcements and activations in the arena.",
      "\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll be talking about things that have been pledged from the sponsors or from the community,\u201d he adds.",
      "\u201cWe know right off the bat that we\u2019ve got almost 3,000 requests for help from our members or people in the music community,\u201d Mason says. \u201cSo that was just in the first few days.\u201d",
      "The immediate needs have been \u201cthe basics,\u201d as he explains. \u201cFood, water, shelter, the bare necessities to live.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe next phase will involve, you know, where they\u2019re going to live, how are they going to replace maybe damaged or destroyed instruments, studios. How will they make a living? I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some mental health component that people may need assistance with. But it\u2019s really across the board. But the early, immediate relief is around just the bare necessities.\u201d",
      "There's no shortage of natural disasters, and they affect the music community too. Mason brings up the COVID-19 pandemic as a recent example. With MusiCares, they were able to contribute \u201cover $40 million to people who needed help.\u201d They have the infrastructure to provide assistance quickly.",
      "However, he notes, the Grammys are the first major award show taking place after the wildfires, which means \u201cthere's no playbook for this.\"",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019ve always said it all changes if the fires were to continue, or possibly got worse, or the winds changed. So, I always want to reserve that right. We\u2019re not going to go blindly forward if things are unsafe or if it feels inappropriate,\" he says.",
      "But consider the fundraising, the economic and financial impacts, and the possibility of unity, \u201cIt all makes sense for us to move forward.\u201d",

      "Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma after Rwanda-backed rebels captured the major city in eastern Congo last week",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma, a major city in eastern Congo, as fighting rages on between government forces and the Rwanda-backed rebels who seized the city of around 2 million people.",
      "\u201cThey will get infected before we can treat them all,\u201d said Florence Douet, an operating room nurse at Bethesda Hospital, as she attended to patients with varying degrees of injuries.",
      "Since the start of the M23 rebels' offensive on Goma on Jan. 26, more than 700 people have been killed and nearly 3,000 have been wounded in the city and its vicinity, officials say. Bethesda Hospital alone said it receives more than 100 new patients each day, overstretching its capacity of 250 beds.",
      "Bethesda is one of several hospitals in Goma that The Associated Press visited that has inadequate personnel and supplies. The city hosts many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced by the conflict, which is one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",
      "As more people arrived at the hospitals with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, many were forced to share beds while others lay on the floor, writhing in pain as they waited for medical attention.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m experiencing this,\" said Patrick Bagamuhunda, who was wounded in the fighting. \u201cThis war has caused a lot of damage, but at least we are still breathing.\u201d",
      "The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012, when they first captured Goma before withdrawing under international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "Unlike in 2012, the rebels say they now plan to march to Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) away, describing the country as a failed state under President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi.",
      "The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia group. Rwanda said the group is \"fully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies the charges.",
      "Medical workers at Kyeshero Hospital in Goma say they are treating an increasing number of patients with bullet wounds.",
      "\"We removed 48 bullets yesterday,\u201d Johnny Kasangati, a surgeon, said Friday as he examined a patient under a tent.",
      "Kyeshero is also severely overcrowded, hitting more than 200% of its capacity on some days, according to Joseph Amadomon Sagara, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, which runs the hospital.",
      "In the past, hospitals in Goma could transport wounded patients by boat to South Kivu's main Bukavu city, 180 kilometers (111 miles) to the south, but transport across Lake Kivu was suspended during the rebellion and roads have been mostly cut.",
      "The fighting in and around Goma has also disrupted supply chains, leading to shortages in medical supplies that aid groups rely on. Some of it previously entered the city through its international airport, which is now under rebel control.",
      "\u201cGoma was cut off from the world. It was a total blackout,\" said Virginie Napolitano, Goma's emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders.",
      "The aid group's stockpiles, along with those of other groups, have been looted.",
      "\"We\u2019re getting by with what we had in the cabinets, but I don\u2019t know for how long,\u201d Napolitano said.",
      "Congo's government has confirmed 773 deaths and 2,880 injured persons at morgues and hospitals. The toll could be higher, it said, citing fears of finding mass graves and more bodies.",
      "The Maternit\u00e9 de la Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Goma was among those struggling to find space for the dead.",
      "\u201cWe had 66 bodies here. Fifty-six were transferred to the provincial hospital, where the morgue has more space than ours,\" said Jules Kafitiye, the hospital's medical director.",
      "\"We need to avoid decomposition due to disease,\u201d he added, pointing to a tent where bodies were being stored.",
      "Scores of bodies lay on streets and in hospitals in Goma after the city's capture, raising fears of disease outbreaks in the region, which is also facing mpox and cholera outbreaks.",
      "The U.N. health body warned last week that repeated mass displacement in Congo has created ideal conditions for the spread of endemic diseases in displacement camps and surrounding communities, including cholera, which saw more than 22,000 infections last year, and measles, which affected close to 12,000 people. The region also battles with chronic child malnutrition.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a fear for the disease to be spreading widely in communities,\u201d said Dr. Boureima Hama Sambo, the World Health Organization\u2019s representative in Congo. \u201cBut at this point, we cannot say because we have not been able to get there.\u201d",

      "The message confirmed Madhuku's fears that Trump's return to office might affect his organization's efforts to save African girls from child marriages.",
      "Many Africans had known that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d outlook meant their continent was likely to be last among his priorities. But they hadn't expected the abrupt halt to foreign aid from the world's largest donor that stops money flowing for wide-ranging projects like disease response, girls' education and free school lunches.",
      "Even after global outrage prompted some exemptions to Trump's order, sub-Saharan Africa could suffer more than any other region as most global aid pauses 90 days for a spending review. The U.S. gave the region more than $6.5 billion in humanitarian assistance last year.",
      "For Madhuku and countless others, the damage has been done. His Platform For Youth and Community Development is one of hundreds of small non-governmental organizations in Africa that receive assistance from the U.S. government \u2014 and ultimately from the American people \u2014 to do good work.",

      "\u201cThe world is baffled,\u201d the health minister of South Africa, the country with the most people living with HIV, said after the U.S. freeze on aid.",
      "The minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, said the U.S. funds nearly 20% of South Africa\u2019s $2.3 billion annual HIV/AIDS program through PEPFAR, and now the biggest response to a single disease in history is under threat.",

      "The Trump administration has warned contractors and staffers with USAID \u2014 the agency responsible for dispersing America\u2019s foreign aid \u2014 they could be disciplined if they speak to anyone outside the agency without top-level approval, and aid groups fear they may permanently lose funds if they speak publicly.",

      "Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16 Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala's team.",
      "Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating film to develop at the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S.",
      "Nome, western Alaska\u2019s largest community, had about 1,400 residents a century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall, before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn't worried. He hadn\u2019t seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had practiced in the area.",
      "Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: \"An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here.\u201d",
      "The first death was a 3-year-old boy on Jan. 20, 1925, followed the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine.",
      "West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to get them to Seattle and then onto a ship for Seward, an ice-free port south of Anchorage. In the meantime, enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital.",
      "It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains that reached Nome.",
      "Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior Alaska, some 675 miles (1,086 kilometers) from Nome via the frozen Yukon River and mail trails.",
      "Thanks to Alaska\u2019s new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers \u2014 many of them Alaska Natives \u2014 with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn\u2019t see the dogs in front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times to minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 51 degrees Celsius).",
      "The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded quilts. Not a single vial broke.",
      "Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog Togo, traveled more than 250 miles (320 kilometers) of the relay, including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound.",
      "After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on Feb. 2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle proclaimed: \u201cDogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken Nome.\u201d",
      "The official record listed five deaths and 29 illnesses. It\u2019s likely the toll was higher; Alaska Natives were not accurately tracked.",
      "Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant, Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was another of Seppala\u2019s dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team.",
      "Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York's Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his neck.",
      "But he and several team members were eventually sold and kept in squalid conditions at a dime museum in Los Angeles. After learning of their plight, an Ohio businessman spearheaded an effort to raise money to bring them to Cleveland. After dying in 1933, Balto was mounted and placed on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",
      "Today, the most famous mushing event in the world is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which is not based on the serum run but on the Iditarod Trail, a supply route from Seward to Nome. Iditarod organizers are nevertheless marking the serum run's centennial, with a series of articles on its website and by selling replicas of the medallions each serum run musher received a century ago, race spokesperson Shannon Noonan said in an email. This year's Iditarod starts March 1.",
      "\u201cThe Serum Run demonstrated the critical role sled dogs played in the survival and communication of remote Alaskan communities, while the Iditarod has evolved into a celebration of that tradition and Alaska\u2019s pioneering spirit,\u201d Noonan said.",

    "story": [
      "A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing through Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing into Egypt on Saturday for treatment",
      "RAFAH CROSSING, Egypt -- A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing to Egypt for treatment through Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing on Saturday, the first opening of the border since Israel captured it nearly nine months ago.",
      "The reopening of the Rafah crossing represents a significant breakthrough that bolsters the ceasefire deal Israel and Hamas agreed last month. Israel agreed to reopen the crossing after Hamas released the last living female hostages in Gaza.",
      "Egypt's Al-Qahera television showed at least two Palestinian Red Cross ambulances pulling up to the crossing gate. Several children were brought out on gurneys and transferred to ambulances on the Egyptian side. From there, they were rushed to hospitals in the nearby Egyptian city of el-Arish and elsewhere. Footage showed one young girl whose foot had been amputated.",
      "Zaher al-Wahidi, an official with Gaza's Health Ministry, said 37 of the children had crossed into Egypt by Saturday evening.",
      "The Health Ministry said around 60 family members were accompanying the children.",
      "The children are the first in what are meant to be regular evacuations of Palestinians through the crossing for treatment abroad.",
      "Over the past 15 months, Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in retaliation for the militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel has decimated Gaza\u2019s health sector, leaving most of its hospitals out of operation even as more than 110,000 Palestinians were wounded by Israel\u2019s bombardment and ground offensives, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.",
      "Remaining facilities are unable to perform many crucial treatments or specialized surgeries for wounds or diseases. Mohammed Zaqout, the director of hospitals in Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, said more than 6,000 patients were ready to be evacuated abroad, and more than 12,000 patients were in urgent need of treatment. He said the small numbers set to be evacuated will not cover the need, \u201cand we hope the number will increase.\u201d",
      "Rafah is Gaza\u2019s only crossing that does not enter into Israel. Israeli forces closed the crossing in early May after seizing it during an offensive on the southern city. Egypt shut down its side of the passage in protest.",
      "Even before the Gaza war began, the Rafah crossing represented a crucial escape valve from the territory, where a 15-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade aimed at containing Hamas undermined health facilities and impoverished the population. Palestinians routinely applied for permission to travel outside the territory for lifesaving treatments not available in Gaza, including chemotherapy.",
      "It took some diplomatic gymnastics to reopen the crossing and overcome security disputes between Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian officials. Hamas had overseen the border since 2007, when it took control of Gaza from its rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, or PA, after winning parliamentary elections in 2006.",
      "Israeli troops remain at the Rafah crossing and in the Philadelphia Corridor, a band of land running the length of the border. Israel has refused to allow Hamas to resume management of the crossing, accusing it of smuggling weapons through tunnels under the border, though Egypt says it destroyed the tunnels from its side and stopped smuggling years ago. Israel also refuses to allow the Palestinian Authority to officially run the crossing.",
      "Instead, the crossing will be staffed by Palestinians from Gaza who previously served as border officers with the PA, but they will not be allowed to wear official PA insignia, a European diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to brief the media. Israel has screened the officers to ensure they have no affiliation with Hamas, the European diplomat added.",
      "European Union monitors will also be present, as they were before 2007.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase of the deal \u2014 which calls for a permanent ceasefire, full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of any remaining hostages \u2014 are supposed to begin Monday. Israel has resisted the notion that the PA would control postwar Gaza."

    "story": [
      "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world\u2019s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rat infestation in many world cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington, and a new study blames climate change, urbanization and other human actions.",
      "A first-of-its-kind examination of trends and reasons in hard-to-count rat populations uses rat sighting reports in 16 cities around the world. In 11 of those cities, rat complaints have increased, according to a study in Friday's journal Science Advances.",
      "Based on individual trends within cities, Washington was by far the leader in rat increases, followed by San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam. Washington's rising rat reporting trend was three times greater than Boston's and 50% more than New York's, the study said. Washington city officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Only three cities saw significant decreasing trends \u2014 New Orleans, Louisville and Tokyo \u2014 with the home of Mardi Gras showing the biggest drop in rat reporting. Experts said the Louisiana city can teach others how to combat the rat problem.",
      "Researchers did a statistical analysis of the rising rat reporting in those cities and concluded that slightly more than 40% of the trend seen is due to warming temperatures from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. And that comes down to sex and food, said study lead author Jonathan Richardson, a biologist at the University of Richmond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these increasing trends in rats in cities that are warming the fastest, probably because this is a small mammal that has physiological challenges in the cold weather months,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf we're warming the climate and winter starts a week or two later and spring arrives a week or two earlier, that's one, two, maybe even three or four weeks across the entire year where those rats can be above ground foraging, acquiring more food and maybe squeezing out one or two more reproductive cycles. \u201d",
      "An extra month may not sound like much, but female rats can have a litter every month. Each litter is eight to 16 baby rats, Richardson said: \u201cThat is a recipe for accelerated population growth.\u201d",
      "Researchers pointed to two other big statistical links \u2014 that fit with known biological issues \u2014 behind more rat reports: the increase in urbanization and more densely populated cities.",
      "Rats like the built-up environment and being near people and their waste, the study and outside scientists said. They essentially eat at the same table as humans, multiple experts said.",
      "\u201cThe rat is the third most successful mammal behind humans and house mice. So it evolved and engineered to live alongside us,\u201d New York City rat czar Kathleen Corradi said during a break at a New Orleans conference on improving pest management. \u201cThey followed humans, Homo sapiens, across the continents and are in every single continent except Antarctica. So it's considered a wicked problem.\u201d",
      "Even though rats are intelligent and highly adaptive, Richardson and other experts said they are a serious problem for people.",
      "\u201cWhen rodent populations are high, people get sick, motor vehicles become disabled, mental health declines, fires are started and foods fouled,\u201d said Houston rat expert Michael Parsons, who wasn't part of the study. People are rightly bothered by rats because of \u201can innate fear caused by an organism that can make us sick.\u201d",
      "Researchers have not had good figures on rats. Because of the way they live and hide, they are not as easily counted as other critters, so this is one of the first attempts to quantify them. The study is not really a count of rats, but of complaints by people.",
      "Because the statistics go back years and only cities that haven't changed their reporting methods were looked at, Richardson said the trends they spotted have scientific merit. Even though Washington has the highest increasing trend that doesn't mean it has more rats or even rat sightings, it is just that the numbers within the city are increasing fastest, he said.",
      "Several outside experts said the study is legitimate, sensible and was sorely needed.",
      "\u201cThis paper is by far the largest data-driven effort to understand changes in urban rat populations ever attempted,\u201d said Drexel University ecology professor Jason Munshi-South, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Looking at the few cities where rat reports are down may help in the fight against rats, Richardson and Corradi said. The answer is not more poison or traps, but prevention, the study said.",
      "\u201cIn New Orleans they make a big effort to get out into neighborhoods and do educational workshops and campaigns to talk to residents about what makes a property less likely to have rats,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "New York City's recently stepped up rat-fighting, which includes replacing garbage in bags on the street with rat-resistant containers, hasn't quite shown up in Richardson's data yet, but rat czar Corradi said early results are encouraging. The city has signed people up for what it calls an elite squad of rat fighters, named \" NYC rat pack.\u201d",
      "It's an uphill battle.",
      "\u201cAs our cities warm, urbanize and (increase in) density, we create more resources for rats which could result in further increases in numbers,\u201d Simon Fraser University health and rat scientist Kaylee Byers said in an email.",
      "We can fight them better, but in the end people \u201cneed to coexist with wildlife in urban environments, even with rats,\u201d University of Michigan conservation scientist Neil Carter said.",
      "\u201cZero rats is impossible,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut I think an expectation that we need to live with the number of rats that we're seeing in many of these cities is also an unhealthy perspective on this problem.\u201d",

      "But countries also pressed WHO at a key budget meeting last Wednesday about how it might cope with the exit of its biggest donor, according to internal meeting materials obtained by The Associated Press. A German envoy, Bjorn Kummel, warned: \u201cThe roof is on fire, and we need to stop the fire as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "For 2024-2025, the U.S. is WHO\u2019s biggest donor by far, putting in an estimated $988 million, roughly 14% of WHO\u2019s $6.9 billion budget.",

      "The document said U.S. funding \u201cprovides the backbone of many of WHO's large-scale emergency operations,\u201d covering up to 40%. It said responses in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan were at risk, in addition to hundreds of millions of dollars lost by polio-eradication and HIV programs.",

      "WHO's executive board, made up of 34 high-level envoys including many national health ministers, was expected to discuss budget matters during its latest session, which opens Monday and is set to run through Feb. 11.",
      "Last week, officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were instructed to stop working with WHO immediately.",

      "Among other health crises, WHO is currently working to stop outbreaks of Marburg virus in Tanzania, Ebola in Uganda and mpox in Congo.",
      "Tedros rebutted Trump\u2019s three stated reasons for leaving the agency in the executive order signed on Jan. 20 \u2014 Trump's first day back in office.

      "A new memo says the Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments, according to a new memo.",
      "The directive signed this week eliminates a rarely used Biden administration policy enacted in October 2022, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and more states began to impose increased abortion restrictions.",
      "Signed on Wednesday by Jeffrey Register, the director of the Pentagon's human resources department, the memo simply shows red lines crossing out the previous regulation and offers no other guidance.",
      "Asked if service members would still be allowed time off to travel at their own expense, the department had no immediate answer.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the policy change \u201cshameful.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur service members go wherever they need to in order to bravely serve our country \u2014 and because President Trump\u2019s extremist Supreme Court overturned Roe, where they and their families are stationed quite literally dictates their access to critical reproductive care,\u201d Warren said in a statement. \u201cNow, Trump is turning his back on our servicemembers \u2014 and our servicewomen in particular \u2014 to score political points. It\u2019s shameful, and will only make our troops and our nation less safe.\u201d",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin instituted the policy in October 2022 to ensure that troops who were assigned to states where abortions or other types of health care such as IVF treatment were no longer provided could still access those services.",
      "The Defense Department on Friday was unable to say how many times the reimbursement policy was used, or the costs. But last March, officials said it had been used by service members or their dependents just 12 times from June to December 2023. And the total cost was roughly $40,000 to cover transportation, lodging and meals.",
      "The policy did not cover the cost of abortions, and it\u2019s not clear how many of the 12 trips were for abortions or other type of reproductive health care, such as IVF treatment. That specific medical information is protected by health privacy law.",
      "In his memo at the time, Austin said service members and their families were worried they may not get equal access to health care, including abortions. And he noted that service members who often must move for various missions or training would be forced to travel farther, take more time off work and pay more to access reproductive health care.",
      "The problem, Austin said, would create extraordinary hardship and \"interfere with our ability to recruit, retain, and maintain the readiness of a highly qualified force.\u201d",
      "He ordered the department to allow troops and dependents, consistent with federal law, to take time off and use official travel to get to other states for reproductive care not available locally. That care includes in vitro fertilization and other pregnancy aids that also may not be accessible close by.",
      "Under federal law, Defense Department medical facilities can perform abortions only when the life of the pregnant person is at risk or in cases of rape or incest, and those instances have been extremely rare. According to the department, there were 91 abortions performed in military medical facilities between 2016 and 2021."

      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",

      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we\u2019ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women\u2019s rights,\u201d the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s indictment could be the first direct test of New York\u2019s shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cWe always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn\u2019t the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That\u2019s why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They\u2019re also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed."

      "Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s famous name, populist stances and loyal following have earned him President Donald Trump's support, but will that get him the votes he needs from the Republican-controlled Senate to become the nation's top health official?",
      "If approved, Kennedy will control a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees food and hospital inspections, hundreds of health clinics, vaccine recommendations and health insurance for roughly half the country.",
      "His confirmation hearings are set before the Senate finance committee on Wednesday and the Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee on Thursday.",
      "Here's what to watch during his confirmation hearings:",
      "Over many years, Kennedy has been clear about his beliefs on vaccines in dozens of interviews, podcasts and social media posts.",
      "He's headed up a nonprofit that has sued the government over its authorizations of vaccines. He's said there is \u201c no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and repeatedly called for further study of routine childhood vaccinations, despite decades of research and real-world use that proves they've safely prevented disease.",
      "But more recently, Kennedy has tried to downplay his past remarks and work, saying he's not anti-vaccine and promising not to \u201ctake away\u201d the shots.",
      "The health committee chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also has expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work. A physician, Cassidy said earlier this month he \u201chad a frank conversation\u201d and \u201cspoke about vaccines at length\u201d with Kennedy. On Tuesday, Cassidy told reporters that he is still unsure if he is backing Trump\u2019s nominee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still working through it,\u201d Cassidy said during a press availability with Louisiana reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI look forward to the hearings and I will allow that to guide my decision.\u201d",
      "The intensity of the questioning on vaccines over the next two days could provide clues for how other Republicans \u2014 like Sen. Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor who represents Kentucky \u2014 might consider Kennedy\u2019s nomination.",
      "Some of the country's most conservative lawmakers have been worried about how Kennedy will handle abortion as health secretary.",
      "Republican Sen. James Lankford, who sits on the finance committee, is expected to grill Kennedy, a longtime Democrat, on the issue during Wednesday's hearing. Lankford is seen as a possible \u201cno\u201d vote over Kennedy's past comments supporting abortion. Last month, the Oklahoma senator said he had a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with Kennedy but stopped short of endorsing.",
      "HHS can influence abortion and reproductive health access in a number of ways, including with millions of dollars in grants it sends to Planned Parenthood and regulations around abortion pills. Under the Biden administration, the agency also said hospitals were required to provide emergency abortions for pregnant women in medical distress.",
      "On Monday, acting HHS Secretary Dorothy Fink signaled the agency is prepared to adopt a tougher stance on abortion under Kennedy. She ordered the agency to investigate all of its programs to make sure no taxpayer money is going toward elective abortions.",
      "Kennedy needs to earn support from nearly all Senate Republicans, but he may also try to pick up a vote or two from the Democratic Party. His closest supporters and advisers have urged followers to call the offices of Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.",
      "Another Democratic senator may also be in play: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who met with Kennedy and has said he's open to supporting Trump's nominees.",
      "An area where Kennedy is trying to find common ground with Democratic senators: food regulations and access to healthier foods. Kennedy has said he supports Medicare and Medicaid helping people pay for healthier foods and gym memberships, an idea Democrats have lobbied for as well. He's also called for a ban on some of the ingredients used in foods, like dyes and additives.",
      "In a letter sent to U.S. senators on Tuesday, Caroline Kennedy shared shocking personal details about her cousin, saying he is not qualified for the health secretary job.",
      "Caroline Kennedy said RFK Jr.'s views on vaccines are a problem, but she also brought up her experiences growing up with him.",
      "A copy obtained by The Associated Press notes that while she admired him for overcoming a drug addiction, she said he has gone on to \u201cmisrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\u201d In an extreme anecdote, she accused him of hosting drug-fueled gatherings in his basement, dorm and garage where he \u201cenjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, another cousin, former Rhode Island congressman and Democrat Patrick J. Kennedy, threw his support behind the health secretary nominee in an opinion piece for The Washington Post on Tuesday. RFK Jr. helped pull him out of addiction, Patrick J. Kennedy said.",
      "\u201cBobby was the first family member to call and offer his personal and public support, even at a time when some in my family criticized me for breaking the so-called family code of silence,\u201d he wrote.",

      "Estimates of prevalence range considerably, depending on how researchers define long COVID in a given study, but the CDC puts it at 17 million adults.",
      "",
      "Despite long COVID's vast reach, the federal government's investment in researching the disease  --  to the tune of $1.15 billion as of December  --  has so far failed to bring any new treatments to market.",
      "",
      "This disappoints and angers the patient community, who say the National Institutes of Health (NIH) should focus on ways to stop their suffering instead of simply trying to understand why they're suffering.",
      "",
      "\"It's unconscionable that more than 4 years since this began, we still don't have one FDA-approved drug,\" said Meighan Stone, executive director of the Long COVID Campaign, a patient-led advocacy organization. Stone was among several people with long COVID who spoke at a workshop hosted by the NIH in September where patients, clinicians, and researchers discussed their priorities and frustrations around the agency's approach to long COVID research.",
      "",
      "Some doctors and researchers are also critical of the agency's research initiative, called RECOVER, or Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery. Without clinical trials, physicians specializing in treating long COVID must rely on hunches to guide their clinical decisions, said Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, chief of research and development with the VA St. Louis Healthcare System.",
      "",
      "\"What [RECOVER] lacks, really, is clarity of vision and clarity of purpose,\" said Al-Aly, saying he agrees that the NIH has had enough time and money to produce more meaningful progress.",
      "",
      "Now the NIH is starting to determine how to allocate an additional $662 million of funding for long COVID research, $300 million of which is earmarked for clinical trials. These funds will be allocated over the next 4 years. At the end of October, RECOVER issued a request for clinical trial ideas that look at potential therapies, including medications, saying its goal is \"to work rapidly, collaboratively, and transparently to advance treatments for long COVID.\"",
      "",
      "This turn suggests the NIH has begun to respond to patients. This has stirred cautious optimism among those who say that the agency's approach to long COVID has lacked urgency in the search for effective treatments. Stone calls this $300 million a down payment. She warns it's going to take a lot more money to help people like Hayes regain some degree of health. \"There really is a burden to make up this lost time now,\" Stone said.",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR via email that it recognizes the urgency in finding treatments. But to do that, there needs to be an understanding of the biological mechanisms that are making people sick, which is difficult to do with post-infectious conditions.",
      "",
      "That's why it has funded research into how long COVID affects lung function, or trying to understand why only some people are afflicted with the condition.",
      "",
      "Good Science Takes Time",
      "",
      "In December 2020, Congress appropriated $1.15 billion for the NIH to launch RECOVER, raising hopes in the long COVID patient community.",
      "",
      "Then-NIH Director Francis Collins, MD, PhD, explained that RECOVER's goal was to better understand long COVID as a disease and that clinical trials of potential treatments would come later.",
      "",
      "According to RECOVER's website, it has funded eight clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment or intervention. Just one of those trials has published results.",
      "",
      "On the other hand, RECOVER has supported more than 200 observational studies, such as research on how long COVID affects pulmonary function and on which symptoms are most common. And the initiative has funded more than 40 pathobiology studies, which focus on the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of long COVID.",
      "",
      "RECOVER's website says this research has led to crucial insights on the risk factors for developing long COVID and on understanding how the disease interacts with preexisting conditions.",
      "",
      "It notes that observational studies are important in helping scientists to design and launch evidence-based clinical trials.",
      "",
      "Good science takes time, said Leora Horwitz, MD, the co-principal investigator for the RECOVER-Adult Observational Cohort at New York University (NYU). And long COVID is an \"exceedingly complicated\" illness that appears to affect nearly every organ system, she said.",
      "",
      "This makes it more difficult to study than many other diseases. Because long COVID harms the body in so many ways, with widely variable symptoms, it's harder to identify precise targets for treatment.",
      "",
      "\"I also will remind you that we're only 3, 4 years into this pandemic for most people,\" Horwitz said. \"We've been spending much more money than this, yearly, for 30, 40 years on other conditions.\"",
      "",
      "NYU received nearly $470 million of RECOVER funds in 2021, which the institution is using to spearhead the collection of data and biospecimens from up to 40,000 patients. Horwitz said nearly 30,000 are enrolled so far.",
      "",
      "This vast repository, Horwitz said, supports ongoing observational research, allowing scientists to understand what is happening biologically to people who don't recover after an initial infection  --  and that will help determine which clinical trials for treatments are worth undertaking.",
      "",
      "\"Simply trying treatments because they are available without any evidence about whether or why they may be effective reduces the likelihood of successful trials and may put patients at risk of harm,\" she said.",
      "",
      "Delayed Hopes or Incremental Progress?",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR that patients and caregivers have been central to RECOVER from the beginning, \"playing critical roles in designing studies and clinical trials, responding to surveys, serving on governance and publication groups, and guiding the initiative.\" But the consensus from patient advocacy groups is that RECOVER should have done more to prioritize clinical trials from the outset. Patients also say RECOVER leadership ignored their priorities and experiences when determining which studies to fund.",
      "",
      "RECOVER has scored some gains, said JD Davids, co-director of Long COVID Justice. This includes findings on differences in long COVID between adults and kids. But Davids said the NIH shouldn't have named the initiative \"RECOVER,\" since it wasn't designed as a streamlined effort to develop treatments.",
      "",
      "\"The name's a little cruel and misleading,\" he said.",
      "",
      "RECOVER's initial allocation of $1.15 billion probably wasn't enough to develop a new medication to treat long COVID, said Ezekiel J. Emanuel, MD, PhD, co-director of the University of Pennsylvania's Healthcare Transformation Institute.",
      "",
      "But, he said, the results of preliminary clinical trials could have spurred pharmaceutical companies to fund more studies on drug development and test how existing drugs influence a patient's immune response.",
      "",
      "Emanuel is one of the authors of a March 2022 COVID roadmap report. He notes that RECOVER's lack of focus on new treatments was a problem. \"Only 15% of the budget is for clinical studies. That is a failure in itself  --  a failure of having the right priorities,\" he told KFF Health News and NPR via email.",
      "",
      "And though the NYU biobank has been impactful, Emanuel said there needs to be more focus on how existing drugs influence immune response.",
      "",
      "He said some clinical trials that RECOVER has funded are \"ridiculous,\" because they've focused on symptom amelioration, for example to study the benefits of over-the-counter medication to improve sleep. Other studies looked at non-pharmacological interventions, such as exercise and \"brain training\" to help with cognitive fog.",
      "",
      "People with long COVID say this type of clinical research contributes to what many describe as the \"gaslighting\" they experience from doctors, who sometimes blame a patient's symptoms on anxiety or depression, rather than acknowledging long COVID as a real illness with a physiological basis.",
      "",
      "\"I'm just disgusted,\" said long COVID patient Hayes. \"You wouldn't tell somebody with diabetes to breathe through it.\"",
      "",
      "Chim\u00e9re L. Sweeney, director and founder of the Black Long COVID Experience, said she's even taken breaks from seeking treatment after getting fed up with being told that her symptoms were due to her diet or mental health.",
      "",
      "\"You're at the whim of somebody who may not even understand the spectrum of long COVID,\" Sweeney said.",
      "",
      "Insurance Battles Over Experimental Treatments",
      "",
      "Since there are still no long COVID treatments approved by the FDA, anything a physician prescribes is classified as either experimental  --  for unproven treatments  --  or an off-label use of a drug approved for other conditions. This means patients can struggle to get insurance to cover prescriptions.",
      "",
      "Michael Brode, MD, medical director for UT Health Austin's Post-COVID-19 Program  --  said he writes many appeal letters. And some people pay for their own treatment.",
      "",
      "For example, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, low-dose naltrexone, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy are all promising treatments, he said.",
      "",
      "For hyperbaric oxygen, two small, randomized controlled studies show improvements for the chronic fatigue and brain fog that often plague long COVID patients. The theory is that higher oxygen concentration and increased air pressure can help heal tissues that were damaged during a COVID infection.",
      "",
      "However, the out-of-pocket cost for a series of sessions in a hyperbaric chamber can run as much as $8,000, Brode said.",
      "",
      "\"Am I going to look a patient in the eye and say, 'You need to spend that money for an unproven treatment'?\" he said. \"I don't want to hype up a treatment that is still experimental. But I also don't want to hide it.\"",
      "",
      "There's a host of pharmaceuticals that have promising off-label uses for long COVID, said microbiologist Amy Proal, PhD, president and chief scientific officer at the Massachusetts-based PolyBio Research Foundation. For instance, she's collaborating on a clinical study that repurposes two HIV drugs to treat long COVID.",
      "",
      "Proal said research on treatments can move forward based on what's already understood about the disease. For instance, she said that scientists have evidence  --  partly due to RECOVER research  --  that some patients continue to harbor small amounts of viral material after a COVID infection. She has not received RECOVER funds but is researching antivirals.",
      "",
      "But to vet a range of possible treatments for the millions suffering now  --  and to develop new drugs specifically targeting long COVID  --  clinical trials are needed. And that requires money.",

For now, though, \"in order to not be absolutely miserable,\" she said she focuses on what she can do, like having dinner with her family.

      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has viewed a deportation flight carrying 43 migrants before it took off from Panama as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration prioritizes stopping people from making the journey to the United States",
      "PANAMA CITY -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio viewed a deportation flight carrying 43 migrants before it took off from Panama on Monday as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration prioritizes stopping people from making the journey to the United States.",
      "On his second and final day in Panama City on a five-nation trip to Central America, Rubio turned his focus from the Panama Canal and Chinese influence to the issue the Republican president has championed most: immigration.",
      "The flight was carrying 32 men and 11 women back to Colombia after they had crossed the Darien Gap and were stopped in Panama. Some of the migrants filed into the plane before Rubio arrived. He viewed the plane and then left the tarmac to give comments in a nearby building. It's unusual for a secretary of state to personally witness such a law enforcement operation, especially in front of cameras.",
      "The State Department said that such deportations send a strong message of deterrence and that the U.S. has provided Panama with financial assistance to the tune of almost $2.7 million in flights and tickets.",
      "\u201cMass migration is one of the great tragedies in the modern era,\" Rubio said. \u201cIt impacts countries throughout the world. We recognize that many of the people who seek mass migration are often victims and victimized along the way, and it\u2019s not good for anyone.\u201d",
      "Monday's flight came as Trump has been threatening action against nations that will not accept deportation flights of their nationals from the United States, and he briefly hit Colombia with penalties last week for initially refusing to accept two flights. Panama has been more cooperative and has allowed flights of third-country deportees to land and sent migrants back before they reach the United States.",
      "Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino reaffirmed that position and agreed Sunday to withdraw from China's Belt and Road development and infrastructure initiative after Rubio warned him to reduce China's role in canal operations or face American retaliation.",
      "Panamanian immigration officials say they have carried out 44 deportation flights carrying nearly 2,000 migrants since signing an agreement with the U.S. for financial support when Mulino entered office last July. The majority of those flown home have been Colombians, followed by Ecuadorians.",
      "Panama said last month that the number of migrants crossing the Darien Gap from Colombia had decreased more than 90% in January compared with the same month a year earlier. The Mulino administration attributes the drop to efforts undertaken to funnel migrants through limited entry points and up patrols in the jungle-clad Darien.",
      "Mulino said Sunday that he had offered Rubio access to an airstrip in the Darien to serve as a bridge for the U.S. to deport migrants from other countries.",
      "But Venezuelans have by far been the majority of migrants crossing the Darien in recent years, and Venezuela is not accepting flights from Panama, either.",
      "Rubio emphasized Panama's cooperation on Monday, noting that migration numbers had fallen dramatically.",
      "\u201cThis is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, of mass migration, which is destructive and destabilizing,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd it would have been impossible to do without the strong partnership we have here with our friends and allies in Panama. And we\u2019re going to continue to do it.\u201d",
      "He also echoed a sentiment that is common in the region but unusual coming from a U.S. official: \u201cWe also understand from the United States that most people who come in here have as a goal, eventually making it to the United States,\" he said. \"So you could say that, at a certain point, our border doesn\u2019t begin at Texas or Mexico. It begins a lot farther down.\u201d",
      "From Panama, Rubio travels to El Salvador, where migration will again be a top agenda item. He will also go to Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.",
      "Rubio's trip comes amid a sweeping freeze in U.S. foreign assistance and stop-work orders that have shut down U.S.-funded programs targeting illegal migration and crime in Central American countries. The State Department said Sunday that Rubio had approved waivers for certain critical programs in countries he is visiting, but details of those were not immediately available.",

      "Pope Francis has convened a high-level summit to demand that children be protected from war, forced labor, trafficking and exploitation",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis convened a high-level summit Monday to demand that children be protected from war, forced labor, trafficking and exploitation, throwing his moral authority behind a global initiative to uphold children's fundamental rights despite the Catholic Church\u2019s own poor record in protecting them from sexual abuse.",
      "Queen Rania of Jordan opened the summit, recalling that the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most widely ratified human rights convention in history but is hardly enforced on an equal plane.",
      "\u201cIn theory, the global consensus is clear: every right, for every child,\u201d she told the gathering in the Apostolic Palace. \u201cYet, so many children around the world are excluded from its promise -\u2013 particularly in warzones. Worse yet, people have grown desensitized to their pain.\u201d",
      "She cited a psychological study on Gaza\u2019s most vulnerable children, after more than a year of living through the Israel-Hamas war, that found 96% believed their death was imminent, and half said they wanted to die. \u201cHow did we let our humanity come to this?\u201d she asked.",
      "Italian Sen. Liliana Segre, a 94-year-old Holocaust survivor, told the gathering that she was denied the right to education when Italy\u2019s fascist-era racial laws went into effect in 1938 and Jewish children were barred from school.",
      "\u201cWe were surrounded by an indifference that sometimes is worse than violence,\u201d she said.",
      "Segre has spent her life teaching today\u2019s youth about antisemitism and the need to not look away when injustices occur, and has paid the price. \u201cI am the oldest woman in the world with a police escort and am insulted and threatened, despite not having done anything,\u201d she said.",
      "Francis, for his part, listed the tragic summary of plights facing hundreds of millions of today\u2019s children: conflicts, homelessness, trafficking and compulsory marriage. He also referred to the 150 million stateless or \u201cinvisible\u201d children who were not registered at birth or have no documents when they migrate.",
      "\u201cThis is an obstacle to their accessing education or health care, yet worse still, since they do not enjoy legal protection, they can easily be abused or sold as slaves,\u201d he said.",
      "He cited Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya children, as well as the undocumented migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexican border. \u201cThose first victims of that exodus of despair and hope made by the thousands of people coming from the South towards the United States of America, and many others,\u201d he said.",
      "Several speakers cited the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, the U.N. treaty ratified by 196 countries which sets out the fundamental rights all children enjoy, including the right to life, nationality, freedom of thought and religion, health and education. It calls for signatories to take all appropriate measures to protect children from harm and to put children\u2019s interests above all else.",
      "The Holy See, a U.N. observer state, ratified the convention in 1990.",
      "In 2014, the committee overseeing its implementation strongly criticized the Holy See for the global sex abuse and cover-up scandal and asked the Vatican to report back on implementing its recommendations by 2017. Countries are frequently late in complying with such recommendations, and the Holy See has yet to submit a new country report.",
      "More recently, a group of U.N. special rapporteurs who monitor specific human rights problems wrote to the Holy See in 2021 expressing concern about \u201cpersistent\u201d cases of abuse, cover-up and obstruction by the Catholic Church in interfering with victims' efforts to pursue justice for their abuse.",

      "BRUSSELS -- Belgium has a new prime minister whose political purpose was long to break up the nation, gut the state structures and give ever more autonomy to his northern Flanders at the cost of everyone else.",
      "Bart De Wever took the oath early Monday, looking straight at King Philippe, the latest monarch of a royal house he so long had little but disdain for because it symbolized the old concept of Belgian unity.",
      "\u201cI swear allegiance to the king,\u201d he said.",
      "It was another indication how times change, and bold demands for Flemish independence have made room for the hope of gradual change and finding a renewed balance between Dutch-speaking Flanders, with 6.7 million people, francophone Wallonia, with 3.7 million, and multilingual Brussels, with 1.2 million.",
      "The prime minister and leading ministers took the oath in Dutch and French while several others on the 15-member team from both sides of the linguistic divide stuck to their own language during a short ceremony at the Royal Palace.",
      "\u201cYou can ... not take part in a government and wait until the system can be taken as a whole. I never believed in that,\u201d he told De Standaard newspaper. \u201cThe other option is to take part when you can, and obtain things for your community, and that is what we did.\"",
      "\u201cWhen you don't take part, you are certainly left emptyhanded,\u201d he added.",
      "Language issues are woven throughout the past century, as the French-dominated nation gradually made way for a balanced political scene while Wallonia's industrial prowess waned and Flanders' economic power rose.",
      "De Wever of the Flemish nationalist N-VA party succeeds Alexander De Croo, who has remained in office as a caretaker since the June elections last year. De Wever will join his fellow European Union leaders at a summit in Brussels later Monday.",
      "\u201cWe will have a government that will clean up the budget, implement a fair social policy, reward work, implement the strictest migration policy ever, abolish the nuclear phase-out, and invest in safety,\u201d N-VA said in a statement.",
      "One issue immediately stood out \u2014 gender balance. When De Croo had achieved quasi parity between men and women on his team, De Wever only has three women on his team of 15, and none among the four vice premiers. He has said he regrets it, but never made it a key point in the coalition talks.",
      "De Wever brought an eclectic mix of five parties together to break a 7-month deadlock in coalition talks. The Flemish nationalist was only given a shot at successfully brokering a coalition because the PS socialists, De Wever's political nemesis, lost their generations-long grip on Wallonia. It allowed him to get a deal with a free-market MR party.",
      "In Flanders, the Vooruit socialist party will have to make sure the cornerstones of Belgium's welfare society survive. The government program is set to cut social benefits in an attempt to tackle the nation\u2019s debt-burdened budget. Overall, the nation has debt totaling just over 100% of GDP, putting it among the worst in the 27-nation EU.",
      "With Vooruit on board, the francophone MR liberals, the centrist CD&V and Engages and the N-VA complete the coalition, controlling 81 of 150 seats in the House for a comfortable majority.",
      "The length of coalition talks highlighted however how difficult it was to bridge fundamental gaps between the different parties."

      "BRUSSELS -- Denmark\u2019s prime minister insisted on Monday that Greenland is not for sale and called for a robust response from her European Union partners should U.S. President Donald Trump press ahead with his threat to take control of the island.",
      "\u201cI will never support the idea of fighting allies. But of course, if the U.S. puts tough terms on Europe, we need a collective and robust response,\u201d Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters in Brussels as EU leaders gathered for defense talks.",
      "Greenland, home to a large U.S. military base, is an autonomous territory of Denmark, a longtime U.S. ally. Last month, Trump left open the possibility that the American military might be used to secure Greenland, as well as the Panama Canal. \u201cWe need Greenland for national security purposes,\u201d he said.",
      "Frederiksen said she has \u201cgreat support\u201d from her EU partners on the fact \u201cthat everybody has to respect the sovereignty of all national states in the world, and that Greenland is today a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. It\u2019s part of our territory and it\u2019s not for sale.\u201d",
      "She acknowledged U.S. concerns about security in the Arctic Region, where Russia and China have been increasingly active.",
      "\u201cI totally agree with the Americans that the High North, that the Arctic region is becoming more and more important when we are talking about defense and security and deterrence,\u201d Frederiksen said, adding that the U.S. and Denmark could have \u201cstronger footprints\u201d in Greenland, in security terms.",
      "\u201cThey are already there and they can have more possibilities,\u201d she said, underlining that Denmark itself can also \u201cscale up\u201d its security presence. \u201cIf this is about securing our part of the world, we can find a way forward,\u201d Frederiksen said.",
      "Last week, her government announced a roughly 14.6 billion kroner (nearly $2 billion) agreement with parties including the governments of Greenland and the Faeroe Islands to \u201cimprove capabilities for surveillance and maintaining sovereignty in the region.\u201d",
      "It would include three new Arctic naval vessels, two additional long-range surveillance drones and satellite capacity, the Defense Ministry in Copenhagen said.",
      "Frederiksen's remarks came as EU leaders met for defense talks but with no clear sign yet from Trump about how he intends to try to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. The Europeans fear that any attempt to pull together a quick deal would not be favorable to Ukraine.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte were set to join the bloc\u2019s 27 leaders at a self-styled \u201cretreat\u201d at Egmont Place in the Belgian capital. The summit agenda focuses on EU-U.S. cooperation, military spending and ramping up Europe\u2019s defense industry.",
      "The meeting comes as Europe\u2019s biggest land conflict since World War II approaches its third anniversary, and with confidence in Trump shaky as he threatens his allies with tariffs. Trump already slapped duties on European steel and aluminum during his first term.",

      "A shortage of infantry troops and supply routes under Russian drone attacks have dealt a blow to Ukrainian forces around the strategic eastern city of Pokrovsk",
      "POKROVSK REGION, Ukraine -- A dire shortage of infantry troops and supply routes coming under Russian drone attacks are conspiring against Ukrainian forces in Pokrovsk, where decisive battles in the nearly three-year war are playing out \u2014 and time is running short.",
      "Ukrainian troops are losing ground around the crucial supply hub, which lies at the confluence of multiple highways leading to key cities in the eastern Donetsk region as well as an important railway station.",
      "Moscow is set on capturing as much territory as possible as the Trump administration is pushing for negotiations to end the war and recently froze foreign aid to Ukraine, a move that has shocked Ukrainian officials already apprehensive about the intentions of the new U.S. president, their most important ally. Military aid has not stopped, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said.",
      "Ukrainian soldiers in Pokrovsk said that Russian forces switched tactics in recent weeks, attacking their flanks instead of going head-on to form a pincer movement around the city. With Russians in control of dominant heights, Ukrainian supply routes are now within their range. Heavy fog in recent days prevented Ukrainian soldiers from effectively using surveillance drones, allowing Russians to consolidate and take more territory.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukrainian commanders say they do not have enough reserves to sustain defense lines and that new infantry units are failing to execute operations. Many pin hopes on Mykhailo Drapatyi, a respected commander recently appointed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as ground forces chief, to shift the dynamic and counterattack.",
      "\u201cThe war is won by logistics. If there is no logistics, there is no infantry, because there is no way to supply it,\u201d said the deputy commander of the Da Vinci Wolves battalion, known by the call sign Afer.",
      "\u201c(Russians) have learned this and are doing it quite well.\"",
      "A combination of factors led Kyiv to effectively lose the settlement of Velyka Novosilka this past week, their most significant gain since seizing the city of Kurakhove in the Donetsk region in January.",
      "Scattered groups of Ukrainian soldiers are still present in Velyka Novosilka\u2019s southern sector, Ukrainian commanders said, prompting criticism from some military experts who questioned why the higher command did not order a full withdrawal.",
      "The road-junction village is 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region, where authorities have begun digging fortifications for the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, anticipating further Russian advances.",
      "Russia amassed a large number of infantry around Velyka Novosilka, soldiers there said. As heavy fog set in in recent days, Ukrainian drones \u201cbarely worked\u201d to conduct surveillance, one commander near Pokrovsk told The Associated Press. Long-range and medium-range surveillance was impossible, he said. He spoke on condition of anonymity in order to speak freely about sensitive military matters.",
      "\u201cBecause of this, the enemy was amassing forces \u2026 taking up positions, digging in. They were very good at it,\u201d he said.",
      "It was at that fateful moment that Russian forces launched a massive attack: Up to 10 columns of armoured vehicles, each with up to 10 units, moved out from various directions.",
      "Key logistics routes along asphalted roads and highways are under direct threat from Russian drones as a result of Moscow's recent gains, further straining Ukrainian troops.",
      "Russian forces now occupy key dominant heights around the Pokrovsk region, which allows them to use drones up to 30 kilometers (18 miles) deep into Ukrainian front lines.",
      "The Pokrovsk-Pavlohrad-Dnipro highway is \u201calready under the control of Russian drones,\u201d said the commander at Pokrovsk\u2019s flanks. Russian forces are less than 4 kilometers ( 2 1/2 miles) away and are affecting Ukrainian traffic, he said. \u201cNow the road is only 10% of its former capacity,\u201d he said.",
      "Another paved highway, the Myrnohrad-Kostyantynivka road, is also under Russian fire, he said.",
      "This also means that in poor weather, military vehicles, including armored personnel carriers, tanks and pickup trucks, have to trudge through the open fields to deliver fuel, food and ammunition, as well as evacuate the wounded.",
      "In a first-aid station near Pokrovsk, a paramedic with the call sign Marik said evacuating wounded soldiers once took hours, now it takes days.",
      "\u201cEverything is visible (by enemy drones) and it is very difficult,\u201d he said.",
      "Ukrainian soldiers in Pokrovsk said shortages of fighting troops are \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and challenges are compounded by newly created infantry units that are poorly trained and inexperienced, putting more pressure on battle-hardened brigades having to step in to stabilize the front line.",
      "Afer, the deputy commander, complained that new recruits are \u201cconstantly extending the front line because they leave their positions, they do not hold them, they do not control them, they do not monitor them. We do almost all the work for them.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause of this, having initially a 2-kilometer area of responsibility, you end up with 8-9 kilometers per battalion, which is a lot and we don\u2019t have enough resources,\u201d Afer said. Drones are especially hard to come by for his battalion, he said, adding they only have half of what they need.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not because they have lower quality infantry, but because they are completely unprepared for modern warfare,\u201d he said of the new recruits.",
      "His battalion has almost no reserves, forcing infantry units to hold front-line positions for weeks at a time. For every one of his soldiers, Russians have 20, he said, emphasizing how outnumbered they are.",
      "Back at the first-aid station, a wounded soldier with the call sign Fish was recovering from a leg wound sustained after he tried to evacuate a fallen comrade. He had moved him from a dugout to load him into a vehicle when the Russian mortar shell exploded nearby.",

The island draws more than 3 million visitors annually to its whitewashed villages built along dramatic cliffs formed by a massive volcanic eruption \u2014 considered to be one of the largest in human history \u2014 more than 3,500 years ago.",
      "That eruption, which occurred around 1620 B.C., destroyed a large part of the island, blanketed a wide area in meters (feet) of ash and is believed to have contributed to the decline of the ancient Minoan civilization, which had flourished in the region.",
      "Although it is still an active volcano, the last notable eruption occurred in 1950.",
      "Prominent Greek seismologist Gerasimos Papadopoulos cautioned that the current earthquake sequence \u2013 displayed on live seismic maps as a growing cluster of dots between the islands of Santorini, Ios, Amorgos, and Anafi \u2014 could indicate a larger impending event.",
      "\u201cAll scenarios remain open,\u201d Papadopoulos wrote in an online post. \u201cThe number of tremors has increased, magnitudes have risen, and epicenters have shifted northeast. While these are tectonic quakes, not volcanic, the risk level has escalated.\u201d",

      "A police officer working on Pakistan\u2019s first polio vaccination drive of the year was shot and killed by unidentified gunmen",
      "ISLAMABAD -- A police officer working on Pakistan's first polio vaccination drive of the year was shot and killed by unidentified gunmen Monday, police said.",
      "Pakistan deployed thousands of police officers to protect health workers who go house-to-house to inoculate children and are targeted by militants who falsely claim the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.",
      "The police officer was killed in Jamrud, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, local police official Jamshed Khan said.",
      "More than 200 polio workers and police assigned for their protection have been killed in Pakistan since the 1990s, according to health officials and authorities. In December, a roadside bomb exploded near a vehicle carrying police officers assigned to protect polio workers in the restive northwest, killing three officers and wounding two others.",
      "Though militant groups have stopped claiming attacks on polio workers and police escorting them, authorities say Pakistani Taliban and other breakaway factions of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, have been behind such attacks. The TTP is an ally of the Afghan Taliban who seized power in Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif launched the vaccination campaign Sunday when he met with medical staff and representatives of international aid agencies and vowed that Pakistan would win the war against polio. The campaign that began Monday aims to vaccinate 44.2 million children younger than 5 and will continue through next Sunday.",
      "Ayesha Raza Farooq, the prime minister\u2019s adviser for polio eradication, urged parents to cooperate with the polio workers to protect their children from the disease.",
      "Polio is an infection caused by a virus that mostly affects children under 5. Most children infected with polio don\u2019t have any symptoms, but it can cause fever, headaches, vomiting and stiffness of the spine. In severe cases, polio can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis within hours, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan are the only two countries where the virus has never been stopped. Pakistan reported one case in January and had 77 cases last year. Afghanistan had 23 cases in 2024, according to WHO data.",
      "Pakistan wants both countries to launch vaccination campaigns simultaneously to eradicate the disease. The Afghan Taliban in September suspended house-to-house polio vaccination campaigns, forcing parents to take children to designated places to inoculate their children.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma after the M23 rebels say they captured the major city in eastern Congo last week",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma, a major city in eastern Congo, as fighting rages on between government forces and the Rwanda-backed rebels who say they captured the city of around 2 million people.",
      "\u201cThey will get infected before we can treat them all,\u201d said Florence Douet, an operating room nurse at Bethesda Hospital, as she attended to patients with varying degrees of injuries.",
      "Since the start of the M23 rebels\u2019 offensive on Goma on Jan. 26, more than 700 people have been killed and nearly 3,000 have been wounded in the city and its vicinity, officials say. Bethesda hospital alone said it receives more than 100 new patients each day, overstretching its capacity of 250 beds.",
      "Bethesda is one of several hospitals in Goma that The Associated Press visited that has inadequate personnel and supplies. The city hosts many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced by the conflict, which is one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",
      "As more people arrived at the hospitals with gunshot wounds or shrapnel injuries, many were forced to share beds while others lay on the floor, writhing in pain from their wounds as they waited for medical attention.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m experiencing this,\" said Patrick Bagamuhunda, who was wounded in the fighting. \u201cThis war has caused a lot of damage, but at least we are still breathing.\u201d",
      "The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012 when they first captured Goma. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "Unlike in 2012, when the rebels first captured Goma and held it for days, they say they now plan to march to Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, which is 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) away, describing the country as a failed state under President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi.",
      "The fighting in Congo is deeply rooted in ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide.",
      "Medical workers at Kyeshero Hospital in Goma say they are treating an increasing number of patients with bullet wounds.",
      "\"We removed 48 bullets yesterday,\u201d Johnny Kasangati, a surgeon at the hospital, said on Friday as he examined a patient under a tent.",
      "Kyeshero is also severely overcrowded, hitting more than 200% of its capacity on some days, according to Joseph Amadomon Sagara, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, which runs the hospital.",
      "In the past, hospitals in Goma could transport wounded patients by boat to South Kivu's main Bukavu city 180 kilometers (111 miles) away, but transport across Lake Kivu was suspended during the rebellion and roads have been mostly amid by clashes.",
      "The fighting in and around Goma has also disrupted supply chains, leading to shortages in medical supplies that aid groups rely on. Some of it previously entered the city through its international airport, which is now under rebel control.",
      "\u201cGoma was cut off from the world. It was a total blackout,\" said Virginie Napolitano, Goma's emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders.",
      "The aid group's stockpiles, along with those of other groups, have also been looted amid the chaos.",
      "\"We\u2019re getting by with what we had in the cabinets, but I don\u2019t know for how long,\u201d Napolitano said.",
      "Congo's government has confirmed 773 deaths and 2,880 injured persons at morgues and hospitals. The toll could be higher, it said, citing fears of finding mass graves and more bodies.",
      "The Maternit\u00e9 de la Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Goma was among those struggling to find space for the dead.",
      "\u201cWe had 66 bodies here. Fifty-six were transferred to the provincial hospital, where the morgue has more space than ours,\" said Jules Kafitiye, the hospital's medical director.",
      "\"We need to avoid decomposition due to disease,\u201d he added, pointing to a tent where bodies were being stored.",
      "Scores of bodies lay on streets and in hospitals in Goma after the city's capture, raising fears of disease outbreaks in the region, which is also facing mpox and cholera outbreaks.",
      "The U.N. health body warned last week that repeated mass displacement in Congo has created ideal conditions for the spread of endemic diseases in displacement camps and surrounding communities, including cholera, which saw more than 22,000 infections last year, and measles, which affected close to 12,000 people. The region also battles with chronic child malnutrition.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a fear for the disease to be spreading widely in communities,\u201d said Dr. Boureima Hama Sambo, the World Health Organization\u2019s representative in Congo. \u201cBut at this point, we cannot say because we have not been able to get there.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u2019s unprecedented freeze on foreign aid has caused chaos and uncertainty in a camp holding thousands of people with alleged links to the Islamic State group in Syria",
      "AL-HOL, Syria -- Ahmad Abdullah Hammoud was lucky to have some food stored to feed his family after a U.S.-funded organization abruptly suspended its aid activities at the sprawling tent camp in northeastern Syria where they have been forced to stay for nearly six years.",
      "His family is among 37,000 people, mostly women and children, with alleged ties to the Islamic State group at the bleak, trash-strewn al-Hol camp, where the Trump administration\u2019s unprecedented freeze on foreign aid caused chaos and uncertainty and worsened the dire humanitarian conditions.",
      "Human rights groups have for years cited poor living conditions and pervasive violence in the camp, which houses mostly wives and children of IS fighters as well as supporters of the militant group.",
      "When the freeze was announced shortly after Trump took office, U.S.-funded aid programs worldwide began shutting down operations, including the organization that runs many operations at al-Hol, which works under the supervision of the U.S.-led coalition formed to fight IS.",
      "The U.S.-based Blumont briefly suspended operations, according to the camp's director. It had been providing essentials such as bread, water, kerosene and cooking gas. Blumont didn't reply to questions.",
      "\u201cWe were troubled when Blumont suspended its activities,\" said Hammoud, who denies links with IS and had been sheltering in an IS-controlled area after being displaced during Syria's civil war.",
      "\u201cBelieve me, we did not find food. Even bread only came at 2 p.m,\u201d said another camp resident, Dirar al-Ali.",
      "Camp director Jihan Hanan told The Associated Press that other aid agencies, including the World Health Organization, had ceased some operations.",
      "\u201cIt is a disgraceful decision,\u201d Hanan said of the Trump administration's action, adding that some residents argued they should be allowed to leave if food cannot be provided.",
      "She said Blumont distributes 5,000 bags of bread daily at a cost of about $4,000, something that local authorities in the Kurdish-run enclave cannot afford.",
      "Hanan said Blumont received a two-week waiver from the Trump administration and resumed work on Jan. 28. It is not clear what will happen once the waiver ends.",
      "Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces that control northeastern Syria, said he has raised the aid freeze issue with officials from the U.S.-led coalition.",
      "\u201cWe are on the verge of finding an alternative to this decision,\u201d Abdi said, adding that an exemption might be issued for northeastern Syria.",
      "The U.S. freeze comes as IS tries to take advantage of the vacuum created by the fall of Assad\u2019s government in early December to insurgents. Another cut in food supplies could lead to riots by camp residents that IS, which has sleeper cells there, could exploit.",
      "Hanan said the camp had received information from the U.S.-led coalition against IS, the Iraqi government and the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led SDF, that IS was preparing to attack the camp after Assad\u2019s fall. Security was increased and the situation is under control, she said.",
      "The SDF runs 28 detention facilities in northeastern Syria holding some 9,000 IS members. Security at al-Hol camp and the detention facilities are not expected to be affected by the U.S. aid freeze, according to Hanan and an official at the largest detention facility in the northeastern city of Hassakeh, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "The main part of al-Hol houses some 16,000 Iraqis and 15,000 Syrians. In a separate, heavily guarded section known as the Annex are another 6,300 people from 42 countries, the vast majority of them wives, widows and children who are considered the most die-hard IS supporters.",
      "The camp has no paved roads and piles of trash. Teenagers and children with almost nothing to do spend their time playing soccer or wandering around.",
      "Children in the Annex threw stones at visiting AP journalists and shouted \u201cYou are a Satan\" and \u201cThe Islamic State is lasting.\u201d",
      "A Chinese woman in the Annex, who identified herself as Asmaa Ahmad and said she came from the western region of Xinjiang, described her husband as \u201can Islamic State martyr\u201d killed in 2019 in the eastern Syrian village of Baghouz, where IS lost the last sliver of land it once controlled.",
      "Ahmad, who is in the camp with her four children, said she does not want to go back to China, fearing persecution. Asked about the temporary loss of U.S. aid, she replied: \u201cSustenance is from God.\u201d",
      "She said she is waiting for IS members to rescue her family one day.",
      "Al-Hol is the most dangerous place in the world, camp director Hanan asserted, adding that countries should repatriate their citizens to prevent children being fed the extremist ideology. \u201cThis place is not suitable for children,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.S. military has been pushing for years for countries who have citizens at al-Hol and the smaller, separate Roj Camp to repatriate them.",
      "\u201cWithout international repatriation, rehabilitation and reintegration efforts, these camps risk creating the next generation of ISIS,\u201d Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, said during a visit to al-Hol in mid-January.",
      "Hanan said that since the fall of Assad, many Syrians in the camp have expressed a desire to return to their homes in areas held by the country\u2019s new rulers. She said camp authorities decided that any Syrian who wants to leave can go.",
      "Even if the camp population drops, \u201cthere will be a disaster\" if U.S. aid is suspended again, she added."

      "Two weeks after the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel took effect, aid is flooding into the Gaza Strip",
      "JERUSALEM -- Two weeks after the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel took effect, aid is flooding into the Gaza Strip, bringing relief to a territory suffering from hunger, mass displacement and devastation following 15 months of war.",
      "But Palestinians and aid workers say it\u2019s still an uphill battle to ensure the assistance reaches everyone. And looming large is the possibility that fighting will resume if the ceasefire breaks down after the six-week first phase.",
      "As part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel said it would allow 600 aid trucks into Gaza each day, a major increase. Israel estimates that at least 4,200 trucks have entered each week since the ceasefire took hold.",
      "Humanitarian groups say aid distribution is complicated by destroyed or damaged roads, Israeli inspections and the threat of unexploded bombs.",
      "On Saturday, Samir Abu Holi, 68, watched over a food-distribution point in Jabaliya, an area in northern Gaza razed to the ground during multiple Israeli offensives, the most recent of which cut off nearly all aid for over a month.",
      "\u201cI have more than 10 children. All of them need milk and food. Before the ceasefire, we used to provide food with difficulty,\u201d he said. \u201cToday there is a little relief.\"",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at the aid situation.",
      "The main U.N. food agency, the World Food Program, said it dispersed more food to Palestinians in Gaza during the first four days of the ceasefire than it did, on average, during any month of the war. Over 32,000 metric tons of aid have entered Gaza since the ceasefire, the agency said last week.",
      "Aid is now entering through two crossings in the north and one in the south. Aid agencies said they are opening bakeries and handing out high-energy biscuits, and Hamas police have returned to the streets to help restore order.",
      "Before the ceasefire, aid organizations said delivery was complicated by armed gangs looting the trucks, attacks on aid workers, arduous Israeli inspections and difficulties coordinating with COGAT, the Israeli military body charged with facilitating aid. Israel blamed the U.N. and humanitarian organizations for failing to deliver aid once it reached Gaza.",
      "There\u2019s now the \u201cpolitical will to make everything else work,\u201d said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians\u2019 right to move freely within Gaza.",
      "\u201cCOGAT is fast-tracking responses to coordination requests. It\u2019s allowing two crossings instead of one to operate in the north. The ceasefire is allowing Hamas forces to operate freely to stop looting \u2026 and the lack of hostilities allow aid agencies to move freely and safely,\u201d Hary said.",
      "Nadine Jomaa, a young woman in Bureij in central Gaza, said the aid is not freely available, and she needs to buy goods in the market, where they are resold for inflated prices. Though prices are coming down, flour and cooking gas still cost roughly triple the amount they did before the war, according to the World Food Program.",
      "Her family is eating only cheap canned goods. \u201cWe need more food, water, household items for the kitchen and bathroom and women\u2019s items,\u201d she said.",
      "Although humanitarian officials have long said the best way to prevent extortion is to flood Gaza with aid, Palestinians in the north say that, so far, the influx appears to have only boosted shadowy middlemen. Residents complain that there are not nearly enough tents entering Gaza while non-essential items such as chocolate, nuts and soda are suddenly ubiquitous.",
      "Ahmed Qamar, 34, who returned to live in the ruins of his former home in Jabaliya, said his area has seen just a few dozen aid trucks.",
      "\u201cHundreds of families here are sleeping in the open and in the cold,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need electricity and shelter, and meanwhile markets are flooded with chocolate and cigarettes.\u201d",
      "Though aid workers say the Israeli inspection process has accelerated, getting certain types of aid into Gaza is still challenging. Some items are deemed \u201cdual-use,\u201d barring them from Gaza because of concerns they could be diverted by militants for military purposes.",
      "Some hospitals and desalination plants still have fuel shortages. And Hamas on Sunday accused Israeli officials of obstructing the delivery of medical supplies and reconstruction machinery.",
      "According to a list circulated to humanitarian groups by COGAT and shared with The Associated Press, desalination and water-collection devices, storage units, tools, tent kits, ovens, water-resistant clothing and equipment for shelter construction teams all require \u201cpre-approval\u201d before entering Gaza. Large tents, sleeping bags, portable toilets, heating pads and vaccines are cleared to enter the strip without Israeli approval.",
      "\u201cWhile aid is getting in in higher numbers, we also know that those restrictions on essential items are persisting,\u201d said Sophie Driscoll, head of communications for the International Rescue Committee in the Palestinian territories.",
      "COGAT acknowledged keeping certain items on the dual-use list but said it is still permitting them into Gaza after screening. The agency said tents are not considered dual-use, and Israel has allowed tens of thousands into Gaza in recent weeks \u201cwithout restriction.\u201d It also said Israel has extended the hours crossings are open and allowed road repairs inside Gaza.",
      "\u201cRegarding the distribution of aid inside Gaza, Israel does not control the situation inside,\" COGAT said.",
      "Roads have been heavily damaged by the war, and unexploded bombs litter the landscape. The U.N. estimates that 5% to 10% of all ammunition dropped in Gaza has failed to detonate, making the territory potentially perilous for civilians and aid workers.",
      "UNMAS, the U.N. agency handling unexploded ordnance, said that since the ceasefire took hold, humanitarian convoys and civilians have reported finding large aircraft bombs, mortars and rifle grenades.",
      "As they return home, many Palestinians are living in areas where the water network has been destroyed. That makes dehydration and the spread of disease due to poor sanitary conditions and limited medical care a threat.",
      "Speaking from southern Gaza, Jonathan Crickx, chief of communications at UNICEF, recalled being on a road where \"thousands and thousands of children and families were walking.\"",

      "North Korea has lashed out at U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio for calling it a \u201crogue\u201d state and warned that such remarks will never contribute to U.S. interests",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In its first direct criticism of the Trump administration, North Korea lashed out at U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio for calling it a \u201crogue\u201d state and warned Monday that such \u201ccoarse and nonsensical remarks\u201d will never contribute to U.S. interests.",
      "The statement is the latest in a series of North Korean signals that it will maintain its tough stance on the U.S. for now, though Trump has said he\u2019s intent on reaching out to its leader Kim Jong Un to revive diplomacy.",
      "\u201cThe hostile words and deeds of the person who is in charge of the U.S. foreign policy served as an occasion of confirming once again the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK which remains unchanged,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said, using the acronym of the country's official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.",
      "\u201cRubio\u2019s coarse and nonsensical remarks only show directly the incorrect view of the new U.S. administration on the DPRK and will never help promote the U.S. interests as he wishes,\u201d it said.",
      "The statement took issue with what the ministry called Rubio\u2019s branding of North Korea as a \u201crogue\u201d state in a media interview. It likely referred to Rubio\u2019s appearance on \u201cThe Megyn Kelly Show\u201d on Jan. 30, in which he called North Korea and Iran \u201crogue states\u201d as he addressed foreign policy challenges.",
      "It was not the first time for U.S. officials to describe North Korea as a rogue state. But the North\u2019s latest statement suggests the country won\u2019t likely quickly embrace Trump\u2019s overture.",
      "During a Fox News interview broadcast on Jan. 23, Trump called Kim \u201ca smart guy\u201d and \u201cnot a religious zealot.\u201d Asked whether he will reach out to Kim again, Trump replied, \u201cI will, yeah.\u201d",
      "Trump's comments raised prospects for a possible revival of diplomacy between the United States and North Korea, as Trump met Kim three times during his first term to discuss how to end Kim's nuclear program. Their earlier high-stakes diplomacy in 2018-19 broke down due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on North Korea, but Trump has still repeatedly boasted of his personal ties with Kim.",
      "North Korea hasn\u2019t directly responded to Trump\u2019s interview comments. But it has maintained its confrontational rhetoric against the U.S. and continued its weapons testing activities. Last week, Kim visited a facility to produce nuclear materials and called for boosting North Korea\u2019s nuclear capability in the face of what he called challenges posed by \u201chostile forces,\u201d an apparent reference to the U.S. and South Korea.",
      "Many experts say Kim likely thinks he now has greater leverage than before because of his expanded nuclear arsenal and deepening military ties with Russia.",
      "The previous diplomacy with Trump likely gave Kim a propaganda coup for winning the much-needed recognition of his government on the world stage. But the eventual collapse of diplomacy was still a huge embarrassment.",
      "Kim has since then focused on perfecting nuclear-capable missiles targeting the U.S. and South Korea.",
      "Last November, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington\u2019s \u201cunchangeable\u201d hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats. During a key political meeting in December, Kim vowed to implement the \u201ctoughest\u201d anti-U.S. policy."

      "Ahead of tariffs starting Tuesday, President Donald Trump posted on social media that he spoke Monday morning with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and would \u201cbe speaking to him again at 3:00 P.M.\u201d But the Republican president also used the post ...",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ahead of tariffs starting Tuesday, President Donald Trump posted on social media that he spoke Monday morning with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and would \u201cbe speaking to him again at 3:00 P.M.\u201d",
      "Trump has said he also would talk Monday with his counterpart in Mexico. Both Canada and Mexico are about to levy their own tariffs in response to U.S. actions.",
      "The Republican president also used his social media post to repeat his complaints that Canada has been uncooperative, despite decades of friendship and partnerships that range from World War II to the response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States.",
      "\u201cCanada doesn\u2019t even allow U.S. Banks to open or do business there,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cWhat\u2019s that all about? Many such things, but it\u2019s also a DRUG WAR, and hundreds of thousands of people have died in the U.S. from drugs pouring through the Borders of Mexico and Canada.\u201d",
      "Financial markets, businesses and consumers are bracing for the impact of the new tariffs that also include an import tax against China. Stock market indices were set for a modest selloff, suggesting some hope that the import taxes that could push up inflation and disrupt global trade and growth would be short-lived.",
      "But the outlook reflected a deep uncertainty about a Republican president who has talked with adoration about tariffs, even saying the U.S. government made a mistake in 1913 by switching to income taxes as its primary revenue source. Trump said Sunday the tariffs would lift if Canada and Mexico did more to crack down on illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling, though there are no clear benchmarks. Trump also said the U.S. can no longer run a trade imbalance with its two largest trade partners.",
      "Mexico is facing a 25% tariff, while Canada would be charged 25% on its imports to the United States and 10% on its energy products. China is facing a 10% additional tariff due to its role in the making and selling of fentanyl, the Trump White House said."

      "Nine months ahead of the 2025 U.N. climate conference known as COP30, prices for lodging are alarming those who want to attend the event in Belem, Brazil\u2019s Amazonian host city",
      "SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Nine months ahead of this year's annual U.N. climate summit, known as COP30, lodging prices in the Brazilian host city of Belem are turning heads\u2014and may soon turn off would-be attendees from the first such meeting in the Amazon rainforest.",
      "With a shortage of housing and high interest, property owners and rental companies are feeling emboldened to charge five-digit rates, even for cramped rooms with shared bathrooms.",
      "On Booking.com, one of the last available hotel rooms listed, a flat apartment, is going $15,266 for one person, up from $158 for the same category currently\u2014a 9,562% increase. A 15-day stay during the conference in November would total $228,992, enough to buy a four-bedroom apartment in one of Belem\u2019s top neighborhoods.",
      "On Airbnb, a room with a shared bathroom in Ananindeua, a poor city near Belem, is listed at $9,320 per day. A comparable room today could be rented for as little as $11 per day. In more upscale neighborhoods, renting an apartment that accommodates eight people costs up to $446,595 for a two-week stay.",
      "\u201cThis one scared me,\" joked local architect and digital influencer Renato Balaguer about a dilapidated apartment listed at $10,000 for an 11-day stay.",
      "\"Look, this is captivity for gringos. False imprisonment is a crime!\u201d said Balaguer in a post that went viral.",
      "President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who champions himself as a protector of the environment, has boasted about hosting the event in the Amazon, which helps regulate the climate by storing large quantities of carbon dioxide, a gas that causes climate change.",
      "This is also a landmark year in the annual process because countries must come forward with updated commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions. What\u2019s more, civic groups are particularly interested in attending because Brazil allows for protests and free expression, which are sharply restricted in the previous three host countries: Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.",
      "Brazil, Latin America's largest and most populous nation, has hosted other world events, such as the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and the 2014 World Cup, with games played in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Manaus, Belo Horizonte and several other cities. Belem, an Atlantic port city that is on the edge of the Amazon rainforest, doesn't have the same infrastructure as other big cities, which has led to many questions about its ability to host COP30.",
      "Officials estimate that about 50,000 people will attend the summit, scheduled to take place Nov. 10-21. Last year in Baku, Azerbaijan, the official tally was 54,148. Before that, in Dubai, attendance reached a record 83,884.",
      "Neither the federal government nor the Para state government responded to questions about the number of rooms currently available in Belem, a bustling and impoverished metropolis of 2.5 million people and the median income is $920 per month.",
      "Those who booked more than a year in advance secured lower prices, but many of those reservations have already been canceled without explanation\u2014a common practice in the hospitality business ahead of major events. Another issue is the increasing prices of accommodations already booked. One European nonprofit reserved a room for $2,000 in December, only to see the price rise to $7,200 two weeks later.",
      "Various groups that often attend the annual summit, including environmental nonprofits, activists, scientists, journalists and businesses, are having to rethink whether they go as the prices rocket up.",
      "\u201cPlanning for COP30 in Belem has been challenging due to limited and expensive accommodations, creating barriers for our participation,\" said Roberta Alves, deputy director of communications at Mercy Corps. The international humanitarian nonprofit has participated in several COPs, focusing its advocacy on financing a transition to green energy, adapting to climate change impacts and how climate change exacerbates conflict.",
      "\u201cWe are awaiting alternative options from the COP30 organizers\u2014critical to ensuring that all voices, especially those from the frontlines of the climate crisis, are included in global conversations,\u201d Alves added.",
      "Owners and property managers offering rentals say the prices are a question of supply and demand, and besides, they also have high costs.",
      "\u201cJust the electricity and water for my house cost 5,000 Brazilian real ($860) per month,\u201d said Gisleno da Silva, who posted the ad for the Ananindeua room for $9,320 per day.",
      "\u201cAt this price, I already have someone interested,\u201d he said, while adding he was open to negotiate.",
      "In the face of mounting criticism, the Brazilian government has said it will provide an additional 26,000 bed spaces. Those will include accommodations in docked cruise ships, public schools, new hotels and military facilities. In a social media post published Friday, COP30 organizers said accredited participants would soon be able to book accommodations on an online platform.",
      "\u201cWe have observed a disproportionate increase in rental prices, which we attribute to real estate speculation. This should stabilize as the government increases the availability of accommodations,\u201d Valter Correia, the special secretary for the event, said in the statement.",
      "Plenty of advocates are defending Belem, saying its challenges are minor compared to the significance of hosting the most important annual climate meeting in the world\u2019s largest rainforest. In an article published in Valor Economico newspaper in December, environmentalist Priscilla Santos, co-founder of the Amazonians for Climate Network, said criticism of Belem \u201cnot only reveals colonialist biases but also undermines an event that could be transformative\u201d for the region. \u201cEveryone wants to \u2018save the Amazon,\u2019 but no one wants to discuss it in the territory?\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, worried about their reputation, some property managers are distancing themselves from the speculation. In an Instagram video that went viral, Fabr\u00edcio de Menezes compared the daily rental price of an apartment in Belem, charging $21,800 during COP, to the much lower rates of the iconic Jumeirah Burj Al Arab in Dubai, which markets itself as the world\u2019s only seven-star hotel.",
      "\u201cI hope this is a joke by the owner,\u201d he said.",
      "Another local property manager, Carlos Netto, said he would never advise a propriety owner to charge such high prices.",
      "\u201cDo you think that gringos are clueless? Where in the world is a 20-day rental is more expensive than the property?\u201d he posted.",

      "NEW YORK -- For Elon Musk fans, it\u2019s the half a trillion-dollar bet.",
      "That is how much the stock market value of Tesla has rocketed since the presidential election, a vertiginous climb uninterrupted in recent days despite a disappointing financial report that would have sunk the stock of nearly any other company.",
      "Investors are wagering that President Donald Trump will help Musk\u2019s company more than hurt it with his plans to take an axe to reams of Washington regulations and wield tariffs to get his way with key trading partners.",
      "Less regulation? Fantastic. Trade war? No biggie.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a golden age for Tesla and Musk,\u201d said Wedbush Securities financial analyst Dan Ives, adding after an investor conference call Wednesday, \u201cThis is the bullish I\u2019ve ever heard Musk.\u201d",
      "Investing in Tesla has long been a gamble. Odds were against Musk creating a successful electric car company, never mind growing it to become the world\u2019s most valuable automaker \u2013 and in the process making himself the world\u2019s richest man. But this latest bet seems particularly risky.",
      "Musk says the true value of company lays in a future of Tesla robots, thousands of them possibly by the end of the year, and in unsupervised, driverless vehicles. He promised in Tesla's investor conference call to start offering such robotaxis in June in Austin, Texas, and across the country by the end of next year.",
      "Speeding all that along will be Trump, or so the story goes, who has given Musk an office in the White House and made him the head of the new Department of Government Efficiency tasked with shrinking the size of the government.",
      "Trump\u2019s new transportation secretary, who can have a big impact on Tesla, is mostly sticking to the script. Sean Duffy has promised to cut excessive regulation on automakers as well as to come up with a single set of federal rules on self-driving technology to replace a patchwork of state-by-state ones that Musk has blasted for holding back development.",
      "Perhaps more importantly, Trump has softened his stance toward China, a big market for Tesla, hitting the country with an additional 10% tariffs starting Saturday, and not the 60% he threatened on the campaign trail. Still, Trump's decision to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as China, should affect Tesla. Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said last week the company should feel an impact to its business because it sources parts from around the globe.",
      "Trump has also vowed to do other things that will hurt Musk\u2019s business.",
      "Tesla sources many of its parts from abroad and so Trump\u2019s decision to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico will hit the company hard if they stick.",
      "Trump also has vowed to eliminate a $7,500 federal tax rebate designed to get people to buy electric vehicles. He\u2019ll also lower emission standards, a potential blow to Tesla\u2019s business of selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to car makers that pollute more and fall short of the requirements. Tesla sold $692 million of these credits i n the last three months of 2024, a 60% jump from a year ago, revenue that nearly all flows straight to Tesla\u2019s bottom line.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear whether the Trump administration will hold off on investigations into Tesla, in particular a technology the company calls Full Self-Driving, a misnomer because the vehicles could require human intervention at any moment. In October, the transportation department\u2019s auto safety regulator, the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration, launched the latest of several probes into the technology after getting reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one that killed a pedestrian.",
      "Transportation Secretary Duffy promised senators at a hearing earlier this month that he would let the Tesla investigations follow the facts \u2014 specifically vowing to buck any political pressure to go easy on the self-described \u201cfirst buddy\u201d of the president.",
      "Musk will need all the regulatory relief and other goodies from Trump that he can get.",
      "In early January, Tesla said sales dropped in 2024, a first in more than a dozen years, as rivals such as BMW, Volkswagen and China\u2019s BYD come out with competitive EVs and steal market share.",
      "Then on Wednesday, Tesla reported revenue, profits and other key measures of financial health for the last quarter of 2024 all fell short of what analysts had expected. The stock climbed higher anyway.",
      "\u201cThings that would hurt other automakers,\u201c marvels Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein, \u201ddon\u2019t seem to impact Tesla.\u201d",
      "Besides the business, Tesla shareholders must always keep one eye on the CEO himself. Lately, that\u2019s meant weighing Musk\u2019s foray into politics.",
      "In Europe, a major market for his cars, Musk has endorsed the far-right Alternative for Germany and called British Prime Minister Keir Starmer an \u201cevil tyrant\u201d who is running a \u201ctyrannical police state.\u201d",
      "On Inauguration Day in the U.S., Musk made a straight-arm gesture during a speech that many interpreted as Nazi salute. He scoffed at the criticism, but the backlash was fierce nonetheless. In Germany, an image of Musk making the salute was projected onto his massive Tesla factory outside Berlin in protest. In Italy, a communist youth group hung an effigy of Musk upside down in the same square in Milan where the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini was strung upside down, too.",
      "\u201cHow many of these Tesla buyers agree with Musk?\u201d said Felipe Munoz, a senior analyst at auto researcher Jato Dynamics. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point of alienating potential customers.\u201d",

Tesla\u2019s total market value has grown to about $1.3 trillion, more than the worth of General Motors, BMW, Ford, Ferrari, Porsche and a dozen other top car makers combined.",

      "With his 70th birthday looming on this year's horizon, Microsoft founder Bill Gates looked inward to open a window into the man behind Windows and other seminal software that turned the personal computer into a household staple.",
      "Gates focuses on the first quarter-century of his life in \u201cSource Code: My Beginnings,\u201d the opening installment in a retrospective trilogy about an insouciant, impertinent and often misunderstood kid who grew up to become a polarizing technology titan before morphing into an influential philanthropist.",
      "In \u201cSource Code,\u201d Gates explores how his childhood quirks, upbringing, friendships and experiences coalesced into shaping his own internal operating system. Along the way, he dissects his brain's unusual wiring, delves into the emotional trauma of his best friend dying while they were both in high school, and revisits the birth of Traf-O-Data, a trailblazing startup that he launched in Albuquerque, New Mexico with another childhood friend, Paul Allen.",
      "Traf-O-Data, conceived to create software for the groundbreaking Altair computer made Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, became Microsoft in 1975 \u2014 a year it booked $16,005 in revenue while Gates and Allen were making $9 per hour.",
      "By 1977, Microsoft had become successful enough to embolden Gates to drop out of Harvard University. In 1979, he had decided to move Microsoft to the Seattle area where he grew up. Although Gates stepped down as Microsoft's CEO 25 years ago, the Windows operating system and other software created under his reign remain the main pillar in a company that now generates $212 billion in annual revenue, boasts a $3.1 trillion market value, and accounts for most of Gates' $100 billion personal fortune.",
      "\u201cSource Code\u201d ends with Gates's drive back to Seattle in 1979, meaning it doesn't touch upon his 1994 marriage to Melinda French, nor their 2021 divorce.",
      "\u201cI am being reflective, which is not my normal mode, but it\u2019s kind of time,\u201d Gates said during an interview about the book with The Associated Press. \u201cAs we went back and got teacher\u2019s comments or people I worked with at Harvard, it was fascinating. I had confused myself into thinking I got straight A\u2019s in ninth grade.\u201d",
      "That might not sound like much of a revelation, but it was a surprise to the cerebral Gates, who paints himself in the book as a \u201cbratty smartass\u201d prone to dismissively sneering, \u201cThat's the stupidest thing I ever heard,\u201d about remarks that seemed nonsensical to him.",
      "Gate's self-portrait is that of a nerd nicknamed \u201cTrey\u201d by his card-playing grandmother because he was the third male on this father's side of the family to be named Bill. He was a pipsqueak who had difficulty making friends and preferred living in his own head before he discovered computers, which became like slot machines that rewarded him for writing elegant lines of code.",
      "When he did talk, the young Gates rocked back and forth like a metronome setting a rhythm for his brain \u2014 a habit that surfaced during parts of his 45-minute interview with the AP.",
      "\u201cIt was a little weird because it was hard to direct my attention,\u201d Gates recalled during the interview. \u201cI had one year in school where they said, \u2018Oh we should put you ahead a couple grades.\u2019 And then another time, they said, \u2018No, we should hold you back.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018Well make up your mind.\u2019 They were a little confounded.\u201d",
      "Although he didn't realize it as a boy, Gates has no doubt he was and still is neurodivergent who channeled that anomaly into learning to program computers at the right time in the right place with the patient support of his late parents (the book is dedicated to them, along with his sister, Kristi and Libby).",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that there was this idea that there are kids that have this kind of unique ability to concentrate but less social skills. I certainly would be included in that,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI encourage people who have strengths and deficits to kind of map their ambition onto something that plays to their strengths. Being able to think just about programming and how you do it better ended up being invaluable for me.\u201d",
      "Gates also had the advantage of growing up in a family that could afford to pay for him to attend a private high school in Seattle. Still, that privilege didn't insulate him from the trauma he experienced when his best friend, Kent Evans, died in a mountain climbing accident in May 1972 \u2014 a year before they were going to graduate.",
      "Evans' death occurred while he and Gates were preparing to spend much of the summer working on a program for their school, but what hurt far more was the loss of someone who understood him and helped give him a sense of purpose for the first time in his life.",
      "\u201cI had no notion of a friend just being gone. It was the only negative thing in my childhood,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt shapes you, that someone can just disappear \u2014 somebody you loved and would have done things with. He would have been part of whatever I ended up going on to do. I give Kent credit, along with Paul (Allen), for setting the direction that I ended up going down.\u201d",
      "Evans' death provided the impetus for Gates to reconnect with Allen, who was already attending college, to help him with his programming projects. Allen, three years older than Gates and a passionate fan of legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, did more than just help with the coding. He also offered Gates some LSD in an attempt to lure his partner down a more psychedelic path.",
      "Gates rebuffed Allen at first but decided to drop acid with a group of high school friends shortly before his 1973 graduation, according to the book.",
      "It wasn't a pleasant experience, a reaction that Gates thought might have been related to the dental surgery he underwent the day after his LSD trip. He tried LSD again with Allen in October 1974 while they were watching an episode of the old \"Kung Fu\" series on TV, and decided he would be better off without psychedelic drugs even though Apple co-founder Steve Jobs contended Microsoft would have created better products had Gates taken more acid.",
      "\"I thought maybe I\u2019d seem cool if I took it, but that didn\u2019t happen,\" Gates said during the interview. \u201cI would say Steve was definitely more hip than I was. He took a lot more acid than I did. He had a sense of style. I had some charisma in terms of motivating engineers and saying this great thing (with personal computers) would happen, but Steve had natural speaking and charisma capabilities, even beyond mine. So I always envied him for the things he did.\"",
      "Gates' mind is now being blown by the recent advances in artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology being planted into Microsoft's software as part of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.",
      "\u201cWhen I finally see ChatGPT-4, where the OpenAI guys show me a very early version, I am just blown away completely,\u201d Gates said. He views AI as an \u201camazing and scary\u201d technology that should be rigorously monitored.",
      "\u201cYou should be nervous. We have to acknowledge that AI is almost uniquely dangerous because it\u2019s unbounded in terms of how good it will get and it\u2019s happening within a generation,\u201d Gates said. \u201cHopefully, the politicians and the technologists will share with each other, and we can shape this thing. We better get on top of that now.\u201d",
      "If nothing else, Gates is hoping \u201cSource Code\u201d will help people see a more human side of him, even if he might never been seen as the cultural tastemaker that Jobs was.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was completely uncool,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut once I got going on Microsoft, I was willing to be pretty monomaniacal. Even people I competed with found it very intimidating how focused I was. I really didn\u2019t goof off in my 20s because my whole thing was having Microsoft move at full speed.\u201d",
      "Perhaps Gates will delve deeper into the monomania that made him so rich, famous and sometimes reviled in the next book about his life \u2014 an installment that he says won't be done until sometime in 2027, at the earliest."

      "A new lawsuit alleges for the first time that people died because of the disastrous 2023 East Palestine train derailment",
      "A lawsuit alleging for the first time that people died because of the disastrous 2023 East Palestine train derailment has been filed ahead of Monday's second anniversary of the toxic crash near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border amid a flurry of new litigation.",
      "On Monday, Vice President JD Vance is also expected to visit the small community near the crash site that he used to represent as a senator, along with President Donald Trump's newly confirmed head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin.",
      "The new lawsuit that will be made public later on Monday contains the first seven wrongful death claims filed against Norfolk Southern railroad \u2014 including the death of a 1-week-old baby. It also alleges the railroad and its contractors botched the cleanup while officials at the EPA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on it and failed to warn residents about the health risks. Many of the other parties in the lawsuit cite lingering, unexplained health problems along with concerns something more serious could develop.",
      "\u201cOur clients want truth. They want transparency,\" attorney Kristina Baehr said about the roughly 750 people she represents. \u201cThey want to know what they were exposed to, which has been hidden from them. They want to know what happened and why it happened. And they want accountability.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit provides some examples of the lingering effects on families, but it doesn't include details about the deaths.",
      "At least nine other lawsuits were filed over the past week by individuals and businesses that argue the railroad's greed is to blame for the derailment and the $600 million class-action settlement doesn't offer nearly enough compensation nor sanction the railroad enough to spur them to prevent future derailments. The dollar amount represents only a small fraction of the $12.1 billion in revenue the railroad generated in each of the past two years.",
      "Dozens of rail cars careened off the tracks on Feb. 3, 2023, after an overheating bearing failed. Several of the cars carrying hazardous materials ruptured and spilled their cargo that caught fire. But the disaster was made worse three days later when officials blew open five tank cars filled with vinyl chloride and burned that toxic plastic ingredient because they feared it would explode.",
      "Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board determined the controversial vent and burn operation never needed to be done because there was evidence the railroad ignored that the tank cars were actually starting to cool off and wouldn't explode. The state and local officials who ultimately made the decision to release and burn the vinyl chloride \u2014 generating a towering plume of thick, black smoke that spread over the town and region \u2014 have said they never heard anything suggesting the tank cars wouldn't explode.",
      "\u201cThe EPA had rules to follow and chose not to follow their own rules. The EPA was too busy trying to get the train back on track to protect the people,\u201d Baehr said.",
      "Officials didn't immediately respond to questions about the new lawsuit and separate federal claims that were filed against the EPA and CDC. But in the past the EPA has defended the agency's role in the vent and burn operation by saying they were only there to advise on the potential consequences and measure the resulting contamination.",
      "Baehr said the EPA and CDC's approach to the derailment followed a similar pattern she's seen in other environmental disasters she\u2019s been involved with like the Navy\u2019s toxic spill of jet fuel that contaminated water in Hawaii. She said the agencies tend to downplay the health risks people face. Residents have expressed frustration with the data the EPA discloses and the refusal of the class-action attorneys to reveal what their own testing expert found.",
      "A spokesperson for Norfolk Southern railroad said she couldn\u2019t comment on the pending litigation. The railroad has agreed to the $600 million class-action settlement with residents who lived or worked within 20 miles of the derailment and a separate settlement with the federal government where Norfolk Southern pledged to pay for the entire cleanup and set up funds to pay for medical exams and drinking water monitoring. But the railroad did not admit any wrongdoing in either settlement.",
      "Some people who lived near the derailment have started to receive payments for personal injuries as part of the class-action settlement, but nearly half of the settlement remains on hold as some residents appeal for higher compensation and more information about the contamination.",
      "So the main payments of up to $70,000 per household won\u2019t go out until the appeal is settled.",
      "The nine other new lawsuits included claims by a pipe manufacturer, dog kennels and a winery that the derailment harmed their businesses in various ways, from staffing shortages to having to shut down or move because of customers' concerns.",
      "One business about a quarter of a mile (0.4 kilometers) from the derailment alleged cleanup work created \u201csmoke, debris and odors\u201d that reached their property and led to routine flooding. The dog breeder who owned a business in neighboring Pennsylvania blamed the toxic chemicals for causing the deaths of at least 116 puppies and three adult dogs.",

      "The High Court in London began a four-day hearing on the financing package on Monday, with Thames Water facing off against smaller creditors who complain that the deal is too expensive and favors bigger investors. Creditors holding about 90% of the company\u2019s debt have already backed the deal.",
      "Without the funding, Thames Water will run out of money in March, which could force the government to temporarily nationalize the company. Both the government and Thames Water say water will continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.",
      "Thames Water, which has about 17 billion pounds ($20.9 billion) of debt and has been repeatedly cited for illegal sewage spills, is at the center of a nationwide backlash over rising water bills as Britain seeks to modernize its water and sewage systems to cope with climate change and a growing population.",
      "The company has been the focus of criticism from consumers and politicians who say Thames Water created its own problems by paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs. Company executives say the fault lies with regulators who kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of the cash it needed to fund improvements.",
      "Ofwat, which regulates water companies in England and Wales, in December approved a 35% increase in Thames Water\u2019s consumer charges over the next five years. The company argued that bills needed to rise 53% in order to finance needed projects and provide the financial returns necessary to attract investors.",
      "The company has until Feb. 18 to appeal the decision."

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump has said he will cut all funding to South Africa and has launched an investigation into the country's policies, claiming that a \u201cmassive\" human rights violation against white people is happening over a new land expropriation law.",
      "Trump made the pledge to stop all future funding on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, writing: \u201cSouth Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY.\"",
      "In South Africa, Trump wrote, a \u201dmassive Human Rights VIOLATION, at a minimum, is happening for all to see,\" without giving details or providing evidence.",
      "\u201cThe United States won\u2019t stand for it, we will act,\u201d Trump added. \"Also, I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!\u201d",
      "The South African government said Monday that the Trump administration needed to have a better understanding of the new law, which is meant to help redress the impact of decades of white minority rule in South Africa under the apartheid regime, which ended in 1994. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement that \u201cthe South African government has not confiscated any land.\u201d",
      "No significant action has been taken since the bill was signed into law.",
      "During the apartheid era, land was taken from South Africa\u2019s Black majority, who were forced to live in areas designated for Blacks only. The law has been debated and considered for years as a means, according to the government, to right historic wrongs.",
      "Elon Musk, who is one of Trump\u2019s close allies, was born and raised in South Africa and has also targeted Ramaphosa\u2019s government, previously accusing it of being anti-white and claiming in 2023 that it was allowing a \u201cgenocide\u201d against white farmers.",
      "Experts in South Africa say that while there are cases of white farmers being killed, it's rather a reflection of the country\u2019s desperately high levels of violent crime across the board, which are some of the worst in the world.",
      "In comments to reporters, Trump said Sunday \u201cthey\u2019re taking away land, they\u2019re confiscating land and actually they\u2019re doing things that are perhaps far worse than that.\u201d",
      "Trump didn't say exactly which policy he was referring to, or which people were being mistreated. But his comments appeared to be in reaction to the new land law that South Africa passed last month that gives the government scope to acquire land from private parties if it's in the public interest.",
      "The law has been criticized by some interest groups in South Africa as opening the way to seize land from some of the country's white minority. However, the government says people's rights are still protected and land can only be taken in specific circumstances where it's not being used productively and it's in the public interest that the land is redistributed. The race of the land owner isn't a factor.",
      "Ramaphosa's office released a statement Monday, saying: \"The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the constitution.",
      "\u201cSouth Africa, like the United States of America and other countries, has always had expropriation laws that balance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.\u201d",
      "South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said that the Trump administration should use the investigation it says it is launching \u201cto deepen their understanding of South Africa\u2019s policies as a constitutional democracy. Such insights will ensure a respectful and informed approach to our democratic commitments.\u201d",
      "South Africa is a major beneficiary of U.S. funding under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which contributes around $400 million a year to the country's HIV/AIDS program. That funding was already under threat after Trump's freeze on foreign aid across the world.",
      "Ramaphosa\u2019s office said that there is \u201cno other significant funding that is provided by the United States in South Africa,\u201d although South Africa is Washington's largest trading partner in Africa by some way, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.",
      "A civil society group that represents the interests of South Africa\u2019s Afrikaans-speaking white minority, and which has fought against the new law, said that Trump\u2019s proposed measures would likely hurt the South African people. It said that it was asking Trump to ensure that any \u201cpunitive measures\u201d be targeted at senior government leaders.",
      "Trump has previously been critical of South Africa's government, writing in a social media post during his first term in 2018 that land was being seized from white farms and there was \"large scale killing of farmers.\" Trump said in the same message \u2014 which was roundly criticized in South Africa as making false claims \u2014 that he was ordering then U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to investigate.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 22:42:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Most countries in fast-growing Southeast Asia are looking to develop nuclear energy in their quest for cleaner and more reliable energy",
    "story": [
      "Most countries in fast-growing Southeast Asia are looking to develop nuclear energy in their quest for cleaner and more reliable energy",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Southeast Asia's only nuclear power plant, completed four decades ago in Bataan, about 40 miles from the Philippine capital Manila, was built in the 1970s but left idle due to safety concerns and corruption. It has never produced a single watt of energy.",
      "Now the Philippines and other countries in fast-growing Southeast Asia are looking to develop nuclear energy in their quest for cleaner and more reliable energy. Nuclear energy is viewed by its proponents as a climate solution since reactors don\u2019t emit the plant-warming greenhouses gases released by burning coal, gas or oil. Advances in technology have helped reduce the risks from radiation, making nuclear plants safer, cheaper to build and smaller.",
      "\u201cWe see multiple signs of a new era in nuclear power across the world,\u201d said Faith Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, adding that it expects 2025 to be a historical high for nuclear-generated electricity because of new plants, new national plans and interest in smaller nuclear reactors.",
      "Nuclear energy has been used for decades in wealthier nations like the U.S., France and Japan. It produces about 10% of all electricity generated worldwide, with 413 gigawatts of capacity operating in 32 countries, according to the IEA. That is more than African's entire generating capacity. The IEA says construction of new nuclear power plants needs to \u201caccelerate significantly\u201d in this decade to meet global targets for ending emissions of greenhouse gases.",
      "Southeast Asia will account for a fourth of global energy demand growth between now and 2035, and fossil fuels account for most of the region's energy capacity. Many countries in the region are showing interest in building nuclear power plants \u2014 which typically produce one gigawatt of power per plant \u2014 to help clear their smoggy skies and boost capacity.",
      "Indonesia plans 20 nuclear power plants. A Korean company is assessing restarting the mothballed Philippine plant. Vietnam has revived nuclear plans, and Malaysia\u2019s future plans include nuclear energy. Singapore signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the U.S. last year, and Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar have shown interest in nuclear power.",
      "But nuclear power plants are expensive, take years to build and require a long time to become profitable. Vietnam suspended a nuclear project in 2016 after costs soared to $18 billion, but on Jan. 14, it signed a deal with Russia on atomic energy cooperation.",
      "International financing for nuclear energy is becoming more available, said Henry Preston, a United Kingdom-based communications manager for the World Nuclear Association, noting that 14 major financial institutions endorsed a goal for tripling global nuclear energy capacity by 2050 at the latest Climate Week NYC.",
      "Financing sources are still limited, though. The World Bank does not fund any nuclear energy development projects.",
      "\u201cWe hear the call from some stakeholders to explore nuclear power to decarbonize energy and improve energy supply reliability,\" a World Bank spokesperson said in a recent written response to questions from The Associated Press. \"We continue to have conversations with our board, management, and external stakeholders to understand the facts. Any reconsideration of our position is ultimately a decision for our member countries.\"",
      "Developing robust nuclear energy policies and regulations, now lacking in many countries, could catalyze more funding by reassuring investors, Preston said.",
      "Technological advances are making nuclear power more affordable, experts say.",
      "Small modular reactors, which advocates say can generate up to roughly one-third the amount of power of a traditional reactor, can be built faster and at lower costs than large power reactors, scaling to fit the needs of a particular location. Advocates say they are safer due to simpler designs, lower core power, and more coolant, giving operators more time to respond in case of accidents.",
      "Critics question how inexpensive the technology might be since smaller reactors have not been widely commercially deployed, said Putra Adhiguna of the Jakarta-based think tank Energy Shift Institute.",
      "The small modular reactors already operating are run by state-owned entities that aren\u2019t transparent about performance or costs. The cost of the first such reactor that was to be commercially deployed in the U.S. inflated by about half before it was cancelled, he said. The Idaho-based project had a target of delivering 40 years of electricity at $55 per megawatt-hour, but project costs climbed to $89 per MWh, according to a report by The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "Nuclear disasters dimmed earlier enthusiasm for nuclear power in Southeast Asia. Ukraine\u2019s 1986 Chernobyl disaster was a factor behind the decision to shelve the project in the Philippines. Meltdowns in 2011 at the Dai-ichi nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan, following a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami also raised worries, leading Thailand to halt its nuclear power plans. In 2018, Malaysia\u2019s then prime minister Mahathir Mohamad cited such disasters when deciding against using nuclear energy.",
      "Some other challenges remain. Markets for nuclear technologies remain concentrated in a few countries \u2014 Russia controls roughly 40% of the world's supply of enriched uranium \u2014 and this is a \u201c\u201crisk factor for the future,\u201d said an IEA report. It added that safely disposing of spent fuel and other radioactive waste is essential to gain public acceptance of nuclear power.",
      "For countries like Vietnam, a lack of trained engineers and scientists is also a big obstacle. It estimates that it will need around 2,400 trained personnel to revive its nuclear program.",
      "\u201cThis is not just about the program but about building a nuclear power ecosystem and technology for the future,\u201d the state-run VN Express cited Minister of Industry and Trade Nguyen Hong Dien as saying.",

    "story": [
      "Fay Vincent, who became baseball commissioner in 1989 and then was forced out three years later by owners intent on a labor confrontation with players, has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Fay Vincent, who became an unexpected baseball commissioner in 1989 following the death of A. Bartlett Giamatti and then was forced out three years later by owners intent on a labor confrontation with players, has died. He was 86.",
      "Vincent had undergone radiation and chemotherapy for bladder cancer and developed complications that included bleeding, said his wife, Christina. He asked that treatment be stopped and died Saturday at a hospital in Vero Beach, Florida.",
      "\u201cMr. Vincent served the game during a time of many challenges, and he remained proud of his association with our national pastime throughout his life,\u201d current commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.",
      "A lawyer who became a movie studio executive at the behest of a college friend, Vincent had been retired for three decades and lived in New Canaan, Connecticut, and Vero Beach.",
      "During his three-year tenure as commissioner, Vincent had a string of what he called \u201cthree-cigar days,\u201d angering owners by becoming the first management official to admit the collusion among teams against free agents following the 1985, \u201886 and \u201987 seasons. He suspended the Yankees\u2019 George Steinbrenner, divided expansion fees among both leagues, attempted to force National League realignment and negotiated a settlement that ended a 1990 spring training lockout.",
      "\u201cI had the conviction that being commissioner was a public trust. I tried to do what I thought was best for the game and the public who cared so much about it,\u201d Vincent said in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI had mixed results. Sometimes I\u2019m pleased with what I did. The tragedy of baseball is the single biggest thing I left undone was to build a decent relationship between the owners and the players. I thought somebody would take over after me and get that done. If I died tomorrow, that would be the big regret, is that the players and the owners still have to make some commitment to each other to be partners and to build the game.\u201d",
      "Born May 29, 1938, Vincent was a securities lawyer when he was hired in 1978 as president and chief executive officer of Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. by Herbert Allen Jr., who had known him their time as undergraduates at Williams College.",
      "Vincent remained a corporate executive for a decade, then had been with a law firm for only a few months when he was asked to become deputy commissioner by Giamatti, a friend since they met during a party at Princeton in the 1970s.",
      "Giamatti, the former Yale president, was NL president from June 1986 until succeeding Peter Ueberroth as commissioner in April 1989. Giamatti tasked Vincent with supervising the gambling investigation of career hits leader Pete Rose, and Vincent hired lawyer John M. Dowd to lead a probe that led to Rose agreeing to a lifetime ban that August.",
      "Giamatti died of a heart attack that Sept. 1, and Vincent was elected commissioner by owners 12 days later and given a 4 1/2-year term.",
      "Vincent\u2019s first World Series in charge was interrupted by the Loma Prieta earthquake, which struck a half-hour before Game 3 was to start at San Francisco\u2019s Candlestick Park. Vincent was praised for a 10-day delay before the series resumed.",
      "\u201cIt is becoming very clear to us in Major League Baseball that our concerns, our issue, is a rather modest one,\u201d he said then.",
      "His first full season as commissioner began after a 32-day spring training lockout. The deal he reached angered owners seeking greater management gains, a group led by Bud Selig of the Milwaukee Brewers and Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox.",
      "In July 1990, Vincent signed an agreement with George Steinbrenner under which the New York Yankees principal owner resigned as managing general partner because of his dealings with a $40,000 payment to a gambler, Howard Spira, to find embarrassing information about outfielder Dave Winfield. Vincent later reinstated Steinbrenner as of 1993.",
      "The following June, Vincent ruled the American League was to receive $42 million of the $190 million in expansion fees due for the National League adding Colorado and Miami in 1993. He also ordered both leagues to supply players equally for the expansion draft and that any future expansion money be divided equally among all clubs.",
      "In July 1992 he ordered NL realignment for the following year, moving the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals to the West Division in 1993, and the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds to the East. The Cubs obtained an injunction in federal court, and the plan was dropped after Vincent\u2019s departure.",
      "By mid-August, Selig and Reinsdorf gained enough support to cause AL president Bobby Brown and NL head Bill White to call a special meeting aimed at ousting Vincent. Owners approved a resolution of no confidence in an 18-9 vote on Sept. 3. After a weekend of thought at his home on Cape Cod, Vincent quit four days later, on Labor Day.",
      "\u201cThe commissioner has to look out for the fans, and the owners don\u2019t want to hear me speak that idea,\" Vincent said.",
      "Selig was installed as chairman of the executive council, a new position that made him in effect acting commissioner. He led owners through a 7 1/2-month strike in 1994-95, was voted commissioner in 1998 and remained on the job until retiring in 2015.",
      "A longtime Anglophile, Vincent wanted to decompress and rented the Mill House in the Berkshire village of Sutton Courtenay for the first six months of 1993. Living in the home of former British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, Vincent frequently entertained visitors during his sabbatical.",
      "Francis Thomas Vincent Jr. was born May 29, 1938, at Waterbury, Connecticut. His father, Francis, was a football and baseball star at Yale in the 1930s and became a college football official. His mother, the former Alice Lynch, was a housewife.",
      "Vincent was a tackle and center at Williams until he broke his back during his freshman year, falling four floors from an icy ledge outside his dormitory after his roommates locked him out as a prank. His left leg was partially paralyzed and he walked with a cane. Vincent, a Roman Catholic, gave up thoughts of Jesuit training because of the injury. Still, he managed to finish school on time and graduate Phi Beta Kappa.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been lucky in a lot of ways \u2014 mostly I survived that terrible accident and being paralyzed for so long,\u201d Vincent said in 2023. \u201cI can\u2019t have any regrets.\u201d",
      "He went to Yale Law School, started as an associate at Whitman & Ransom in New York in 1963 and stayed there for five years.",
      "In 1968, he moved to Caplin & Drysdale Chartered in Washington and practiced securities law there for almost 10 years, becoming a partner. In March 1978 he quit the firm to become associate director of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Division of Corporate Finance. His stay there was rather brief.",
      "Allen, who was two years behind Vincent at Williams, decided that summer to fire Alan J. Hirschfield, Columbia Pictures Industries\u2019 CEO. For more than a year, the company had been in turmoil after David Begelman, president of the movie studio, was discovered to have forged checks.",
      "Vincent replaced Hirschfield on July 13 and ran the company so well that Allen & Co. sold it to Coca-Cola Co. in 1982 for $692 million. Vincent was promoted from president to chairman and was named executive vice president of Coca-Cola\u2019s new Entertainment Business Sector.",
      "He went to Hollywood only about six times a year and let his production heads \u2014Frank Price, Guy McIlwaine and David Puttnam \u2014 make the artistic decisions. While Vincent ran the company, Columbia released \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d \u201cThe Big Chill,\u201d \u201cGandhi\u201d and \u201cTootsie.\u201d",
      "Still, he remained devoted to baseball.",
      "\u201cHe talked about baseball every day,\u201d Allen said. \u201cA couple of times I went with him to Mets\u2019 opening day.\u201d",
      "On Sept. 1, 1987, Coca-Cola bought Tri-Star Pictures and Tri-Star\u2019s Victor A. Kaufman replaced Vincent, who was reassigned to oversee equity investments in Coca-Cola Bottling\u2019s properties. Vincent quit in 1988 and went to Caplin & Drysdale\u2019s New York office as a partner. Before he settled in, Giamatti asked him to join baseball.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d always been a baseball fan,\u201d Vincent said then. \u201cI\u2019ve followed baseball as long as I can remember.\u201d",
      "In one of his lasting acts as commissioner, he chaired an eight-member committee for statistical accuracy, which removed the asterisk that had been next to Roger Maris\u2019 entry as the season home run leader and deleted 50 no-hitters. The group defined a no-hitter as games of nine innings or more that ended with no hits.",
      "He recorded interviews with Hall of Fame members and Negro Leagues players for an oral history project that led to three books: \u201cThe Only Game in Town\u201d (2006), \u201cWe Would Have Played for Nothing\u201d (2009) and \u201cIt\u2019s What\u2019s Inside the Lines That Counts\u201d (2010). In 2024, he made a $2 million gift to Yale to endow the Yale baseball coach\u2019s position in the name of his father.",
      "Vincent married the former Valerie McMahon in 1965 and they had a daughter Anne and twin sons William, and Edward. They divorced in 1994 and he married Christina Watkins in 1998.",

      "Rogers is accused of meeting co-conspirators in China for multiple visits, under the guise of him being an academic instructor teaching them as students. The indictment alleges that in 2023, Rogers received $450,000 as a part-time professor at a Chinese university. ___"

      "The Teamsters union represents 18,000 Costco workers in six states: California, Washington, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and New York. Overall, Costco has 219,000 U.S. employees and 617 U.S. stores. The company said its labor agreement with the Teamsters applies to less than 10% of those stores.",

    "story": [
      "With home prices high, American families are grappling with the prospect that homeownership might remain out of reach for them for a long time",
      "The Petersen family\u2019s two-bedroom apartment in northern California is starting to feel small.",
      "Four-year-old Jerrik's toy monster trucks are everywhere in the 1,100-square-foot unit in Campbell, just outside of San Jose. And it's only a matter of time before 9-month-old Carolynn starts amassing more toys, adding to the disarray, says her mother, Jenn Petersen.",
      "The 42-year-old chiropractor had hoped she and her husband, Steve, a 39-year-old dental hygienist, would have bought a house by now. But when they can afford a bigger place, it will have to be another rental. Petersen has done the math: With mortgage rates and home prices stubbornly high, there's no way the couple, who make about $270,000 a year and pay about $2,500 in monthly rent, can afford a home anywhere in their area.",
      "According to October data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, a San Jose family with a median income of $156,700 would need to spend 80% of their income on housing \u2014 including an $8,600 monthly mortgage payment \u2014 to own a median-priced $1.54 million home. That's far higher than the general rule of thumb that people should pay no more than 30% of their income on a mortgage or rent.",
      "Moving out of state is out of the question for the Petersens \u2014 they have strong family ties to the area and their income would plummet if they move to a lower cost-of-living area. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to give up my job and close connections with my family for a house,\u201d Petersen said.",
      "The issue is widespread and near historic highs nationally: As of last fall, the median homeowner in the U.S. was paying 42% of their income on homeownership costs, according to the Atlanta Fed. Four years ago, that percentage was 28% and had not previously reached 38% since late 2007, just before the housing market crash.",
      "\u201cThe American dream, as our parents knew it, doesn\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cThe whole idea that you get a house after you graduate college, get a steady job and get married? I\u2019ve done most of those milestones. But the homeownership part? That just doesn\u2019t fit financially.\u201d",
      "The same is true for an increasing number of American families.",
      "In 2024, the median first-time homebuyer was 38 years old, a jump from age 35 the previous year, according to a recent report by the National Association of Realtors. That's significantly above historic norms, when median first-time buyers hovered between 30 and 32 years old from 1993 to 2018.",
      "The biggest driver of this trend, experts said, is simple: There are far too few houses on the market to match pent-up demand, driving prices past the point of affordability for many people who are relatively early in their careers. Coupled with high mortgage rates, many have concluded that renting is their only option.",
      "\u201cWage growth hasn\u2019t kept up with the increase in home prices and interest rates,\u201d said Domonic Purviance, who studies housing at the Atlanta Fed. \u201cEven though people are making more money, home prices are increasing at a faster rate.\u201d",
      "That gap has left many out of the housing market, which for generations has been a way for Americans to build equity and wealth that they can pass down or leverage to buy a larger home. It's also led to widespread worries about housing in the U.S. About 7 in 10 voters under age 45 said they were \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the cost of housing in their community, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters in the 2024 election.",
      "Brian McCabe, a sociology professor at Georgetown University, said he frequently tells his students that \u201cthere are few things that all Americans agree on, but one of them is that they\u2019d rather own a home than rent.\u201d",
      "McCabe said homeownership, especially as a wealth-building tool, is the right move for many, especially if the owner intends to be in one place for a long time. But he also said many are realizing that not owning a home has its advantages, too \u2014 it gives people more flexibility to move and allows them to live in exciting neighborhoods they would not be able to afford to buy property in.",
      "McCabe said millennials are getting married later, having children later, have a stronger desire to stay in cities and, especially due to remote work, value the flexibility of being able to move with ease \u2014 all of which he said could prompt an end to the notion that homeownership is the \u201capex of the American dream.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe big question is whether we see the sheen of homeownership start to fade,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cIt's such an interesting cultural marker: Why is owning a home the pinnacle for so many people?\u201d",
      "It's a question Petersen wrestles with because she knows any three-bedroom home she found in her area would leave her family \u201chouse poor.\u201d",
      "\"I used to subscribe to the idea that owning a house is just a natural milestone you have to reach,\" she said. \u201cAt some point, though, what are you sacrificing by just owning a house and gaining equity? I want to be able to travel with my kids. I want to be able to sign them up for extracurriculars. How are we supposed to do that if we're paying a mortgage that's most of our take-home pay?\u201d",
      "Petersen said she'll \u201calways hold out a little bit of hope\" that homeownership will be in her family's future. But if they find a townhouse to rent that has space for her kids and fits within their $3,600 monthly rental budget?",
      "\u201cI'd take that,\u201d she said.",
      "Lifelong Boston resident Julieta Lopez, 63, spent decades hoping to buy a home but watched as prices became increasingly out of reach.",
      "\u201cThe prices in Boston just got higher and higher and higher and higher,\u201d said Lopez, who works for the city traffic department issuing tickets for parking violations.",
      "Two years ago, furious to learn that her subsidized apartment's monthly rent was being hiked to $2,900, Lopez, who earns about $60,000 annually, took out her phone and began searching for government programs that help first-time homebuyers. She was determined to finally own her own place.",
      "Within months, she had succeeded. Lopez qualified to receive $50,000 from the local Massachusetts Affordable Homeownership Alliance nonprofit and another $50,000 from the city of Boston's Office of Housing \u2014 funds that helped her with a down payment on the $430,000 two-bedroom condominium she shares with her 30-year-old son. She now pays about $2,160 a month on her mortgage.",
      "Lopez knows she is lucky the city has placed such a focus on aiding first-time buyers like herself \u2014 Boston has poured more than $24 million into its homeownership assistance programs since Mayor Michelle Wu took office in 2021, helping nearly 700 residents get their first homes.",
      "But Lopez also feels proud to have her own place after years of working so hard \u2014 jobs that included everything from telecommunications to health care to electronics.",
      "\u201cI was determined to have my piece of the pie,\" she said. \u201cI felt I deserved that. I\u2019ve always worked. Always. Nonstop.\"",

      "Trump sued CBS for $10 billion over the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, claiming it was deceptively edited to make Harris look good. Published reports said CBS' parent company, Paramount, has been talking to Trump's lawyers about a settlement.",
      "The network said Friday that it was compelled by Brendan Carr, Trump's appointee as FCC chairman, to turn over the transcripts and camera feeds of the interview for a parallel investigation by the commission. \u201c60 Minutes\u201d has resisted releasing transcripts for this and all of its interviews, to avoid second-guessing of its editing process.",
      "The case, particularly a potential settlement, is being closely watched by advocates for press freedom and by journalists within CBS, whose lawyers called Trump's lawsuit \u201ccompletely without merit\u201d and promised to vigorously fight it after it was filed.",
      "The Harris interview initially drew attention because CBS News showed Harris giving completely different responses to a question posed by correspondent Bill Whitaker in clips that were aired on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Oct. 6 and the next night on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d The network said each clip came from a lengthy response by Harris to Whitaker's question, but they were edited to fit time constraints on both broadcasts.",
      "In his lawsuit, filed in Texas on Nov. 1, Trump charged it was deceptive editing designed to benefit Harris and constituted \u201cpartisan and unlawful acts of voter interference.\u201d",
      "Trump, who turned down a request to be interviewed by \u201c60 Minutes\u201d during the campaign, has continued his fight despite winning the election less than a week after the lawsuit was filed.",

      "ABC News in December settled a defamation lawsuit by Trump over statements made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, agreeing to pay $15 million toward Trump's presidential library rather than engage in a public fight.

      "Canada and Mexico say they\u2019ve prepared the option of retaliatory tariffs to be used if necessary now that the White House says the U.S. will put in place 25% tariffs on imports from them this weekend",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump will put in place 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China effective on Saturday, the White House said, but it provided no word on whether there would be any exemptions to the measures that could result in swift price increases to U.S. consumers.",
      "Trump had been threatening the tariffs to ensure greater cooperation from the countries on stopping illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl, but he has also pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing and raise revenues for the federal government.",
      "\u201cStarting tomorrow, those tariffs will be in place,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. \u201cThese are promises made and promises kept by the president.\u201d",
      "The tariffs carry both political and economic risks for Trump, who is just two weeks into his second term. Many voters backed the Republican on the promise that he could tamp down inflation, but the possibility of tariffs could trigger higher prices and potentially disrupt the energy, auto, lumber and agricultural sectors.",
      "Trump had said he was weighing issuing an exemption for Canadian and Mexican oil imports, but Leavitt said she had no information to share on the president's decision on any potential carveouts.",
      "The United States imported almost 4.6 million barrels of oil daily from Canada in October and 563,000 barrels from Mexico, according to the Energy Information Administration. U.S. daily production during that month averaged nearly 13.5 million barrels a day.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re ready with a response, a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act.\u201d",
      "Trudeau said tariffs would have \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d for the U.S, putting American jobs at risk and causing prices to rise. Trudeau reiterated that less than 1% of the fentanyl and illegal crossings into the U.S. come from Canada.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that Mexico has maintained a dialogue with Trump\u2019s team since before he returned to the White House, but she emphasized that Mexico has a \u201cPlan A, Plan B, Plan C for what the United States government decides.\"",

      "\u201cFor Mexico,\u2019\u2019 the study said, \u201ca 25% tariff would be catastrophic.

      "In the first serious fallout from President Donald Trump\u2019s early actions against offshore wind power, oil and gas giant Shell is walking away from a major project off the coast of New Jersey",
      "In the first serious fallout from President Donald Trump's early actions against offshore wind power, oil and gas giant Shell is walking away from a major project off the coast of New Jersey.",
      "Shell told The Associated Press it is writing off the project, citing increased competition, delays and a changing market.",
      "\u201cNaturally we also take regulatory context into consideration,\u201d spokesperson Natalie Gunnell said in an email.",
      "Shell co-owns the large Atlantic Shores project, which has most of its permits and would generate enough power for 1 million homes if both of two phases were completed. That\u2019s enough for one-third of New Jersey households.",
      "It's unclear whether Shell's decision kills the project \u2014 partner EDF-RE Offshore Development says it remains committed to Atlantic Shores.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order singling out offshore wind for contempt with a temporary halt on all lease sales in federal waters and a pause on approvals, permits and loans. Perhaps most of interest to Shell, the order directs administration officials to review existing offshore wind energy leases and identify any legal reasons to terminate them.",
      "Large offshore wind farms have been making electricity for three decades in Europe, and more recently in Asia. They are considered by experts to be an essential part of addressing climate change because they can take the place of fossil fuel plants, if paired with battery storage. New Jersey has set a goal of generating 100% of its energy from clean sources by 2035.",
      "The Biden administration approved plans to build the Atlantic Shores project in two phases in October, but construction has not begun. Oliver Metcalfe, head of wind research at BloombergNEF, said the partners are facing significant uncertainty about their lease, and other developers are watching what happens with Atlantic Shores closely. \u201cWe\u2019re in uncertain territory here,\u201d he added.",
      "Offshore wind foes, who are particularly vocal and well-organized in New Jersey, celebrated Shell\u2019s withdrawal. Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew, of New Jersey, helped the Trump team draft the executive order. He said Shell\u2019s decision is a \u201cbig win\u201d for New Jersey\u2019s coastline and economy but \u201cthis fight is not over.\u201d",
      "Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast NJ, said that without Shell's financial backing, it appears the project is \u201cdead in the water.\u201d",
      "Shell is writing off a nearly $1 billion investment. It announced its decision on Thursday, as it reported a 16% decline in full-year earnings of $23.7 billion from $28.3 billion. Most of its business is oil and gas.",
      "Danish wind developer Orsted was close to beginning work on two offshore wind farms in New Jersey but scrapped the project in Oct. 2023 after deciding it would not be economical.",
      "A lot of clean energy is cheap now, but offshore wind is still among the most expensive. That can make these projects less attractive to investors, absent strong policy support, said Coco Zhang, vice president for environmental, social and governance research at ING.",
      "\u201cThe potential uncertainty that the executive order has brought to the market, it cannot be ignored,\u201d she said.",
      "The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals to deploy offshore wind energy, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale offshore wind energy projects.",

      "It includes ... well, basically everybody.",
      "\u201cThis is the world we\u2019re living in,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a business. You have to understand this. Nobody\u2019s safe. Nobody\u2019s safe.",
      "After this weekend, he might be right.",
      "It's hard to envision a bigger stunner than the first deal that went down over the weekend \u2014 Luka Doncic is now with the Los Angeles Lakers and Anthony Davis is now with the Dallas Mavericks, the first time that two reigning All-NBA players were traded for one another in-season. That move overshadowed another one that, under normal circumstances, would have been seismic: De'Aaron Fox leaving Sacramento for San Antonio to join All-Star Victor Wembanyama, with Zach LaVine leaving Chicago for the Kings.",
      "Fox was an All-NBA selection two years ago. LaVine is a two-time All-Star. And when adding in D'Angelo Russell getting moved by the Lakers to Brooklyn in late December, that's five current or former All-Stars that have been traded already this season.",
      "\u201cNormally when you trade a star you get a bunch of junk back,\" Hall of Famer and NBA analyst Charles Barkley said on NBA TV, reacting to the Doncic-Davis trade. \"This is the first time I can remember when you\u2019ve got two All-NBA players traded for each other.\u201d",
      "To Antetokounmpo\u2019s point, if Doncic \u2014 the clear face of the Dallas franchise until now, the player who replaced Dirk Nowitzki in that role with the Mavericks, someone who took his team to the NBA Finals last season \u2014 can get moved, then yes, it can be argued that any player can get moved.",
      "The Spurs probably won\u2019t be trading Wembanyama anytime soon, especially now that they\u2019ve landed Fox to play alongside the French center. Golden State would only trade a franchise icon like Stephen Curry if he asked to be moved, which doesn\u2019t seem likely. The Lakers\u2019 LeBron James and Phoenix\u2019s Bradley Beal have no-trade clauses, meaning they control their own destinies to a certain extent.",
      "But for everyone else, getting a middle-of-the-night call from a general manager \u2014 like the ones Dallas' Nico Harrison tried to place to Doncic in the wee hours of Sunday, all of them going unanswered \u2014 is at least possible.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, and I\u2019ve said this in the past, you get evaluated every single day,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cYou don\u2019t take nothing for granted. Being an All-Star, you don\u2019t take it for granted. Being able to go out there and put on the jersey and represent your team, you don\u2019t take that for granted. Being out there and representing your family, you don\u2019t take that for granted. Every second that you play an NBA game, I love it. I try to play with joy.\u201d",
      "Speaking of joy, or lack thereof, another past All-Star and All-NBA selection in Jimmy Butler is still out there and desperately seeking a way out of Miami. He has as many game appearances in the last month as he does team suspensions \u2014 three games, three suspensions.",
      "For Butler to get moved, with Phoenix believed to be his preferred destination, it\u2019s very possible that another All-Star-caliber player \u2014 or at least someone with a big salary \u2014 would have to be changing addresses as well simply to make the contract math work.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s surprising, for sure,\u201d Philadelphia coach Nick Nurse said of superstar-level players like Doncic and Davis getting traded. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s been a lot of stars moving in recent years that we\u2019ve all been surprised by and all that kind of stuff.\u201d",
      "More big things could still happen. Some teams that are out of the playoff hunt, like injury-plagued New Orleans, could make deals to collect assets and think about the future. Others might add a piece or two in an effort to win now.",
      "Nobody knows what other surprises might be looming, especially with a slew of teams that are in the playoff \u2014 or play-in \u2014 chase thinking about which players could be acquired to help their postseason odds.",
      "\u201cThe play-in part of it lets the competition last longer,\" said Detroit coach J.B. Bickerstaff, whose Pistons are squarely in the Eastern Conference play-in mix. \"And more teams are competing for those spots longer into the season. The past, what, four or five years, we\u2019ve had a different champion. So now, everybody feels like they\u2019ve got a shot at it. They're making moves so that they can go and get it. I think that\u2019s great for the league.\u201d",

      "Spain's women\u2019s World Cup winner Jenni Hermoso has testified against the former Spanish soccer federation president",
      "MADRID -- When the former president of Spain's Football Federation kissed a player from the national team who had just won the 2023 Women's World Cup, it sparked widespread outrage in Spain about sexism in sports and beyond.",
      "On Monday, women's World Cup winner Jenni Hermoso testified at the trial of Luis Rubiales that she did not consent to the kiss and that she felt coerced to publicly exonerate him after the incident.",
      "\u201cI felt disrespected,\u201d Hermoso said. \u201cI think it was a moment that stained one of the happiest days of my life.\u201d",
      "The 47-year-old Rubiales, who sat nearby at Madrid's High Court, is accused of sexual assault and of trying to coerce Hermoso, alongside others, to publicly support him.",
      "Rubiales has denied the charges, claiming the kiss was consensual and happened in a \u201cmoment of jubilation.\u201d Facing immense pressure, he resigned in 2023 and was banned by FIFA for three years. Rubiales had said he was the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by \u201cfalse feminists.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors, Hermoso and Spain\u2019s players\u2019 association want a prison sentence of two-and-a-half years for Rubiales, a payment of 50,000 euros ($51,800) for damages and for him to be banned from working as a sports official.",
      "When asked if at any point Rubiales had asked Hermoso if he could kiss her, the Spain forward said no.",
      "\u201cI didn't hear or understand anything,\u201d Hermoso said. \u201cThe next thing he did was to grab me by the ears and kiss me on the mouth.\u201d",
      "Rubiales could face a fine or a prison sentence of one to four years if found guilty, according to court officials.",
      "Hermoso had celebrated with her teammates after the kiss at the World Cup awards ceremony in Australia. When asked about those champagne-fueled celebrations on Monday, Hermoso said she chose to celebrate her team's victory like any footballer would.",
      "\u201cFor me, it was important to be able to celebrate this moment,\u201d she said.",
      "The trial is expected to last at least 10 days. Among the nearly 20 witnesses expected to testify are Spain\u2019s men\u2019s national team coach Luis de la Fuente and some of Hermoso\u2019s teammates on the women's team, including former world player of the year Alexia Putellas.",
      "Rubiales is required to attend only the first and the last day, according to the court.",
      "Also on trial are Spain's former women\u2019s national team coach Jorge Vilda, former sports director of Spain\u2019s men\u2019s team Albert Luque, and the federation\u2019s former head of marketing, Rub\u00e9n Rivera. They are accused of allegedly pressuring Hermoso to defend Rubiales publicly in a statement after the incident, which she refused to do.",
      "Hermoso said that after the incident and ensuing controversy, her life had been put on standby. She said she was able to escape the spotlight that she was thrust into after the incident in Mexico, where she plays for a club team.",
      "The incident overshadowed Spain's first women's World Cup victory, triggering protests and widespread condemnation.",
      "\u201cI have not been able to really live freely,\u201d she told the court.",

    "story": [
      "Lindsey Vonn has faced a lot of second guessing about her comeback to ski racing at age 40 this season",
      "SAALBACH-HINTERGLEMM, Austria -- When Tom Brady played in the NFL well beyond the age of 40, he wasn't considered crazy for facing 300-pound defensive linemen intent on sacking him.",
      "When Lewis Hamilton recently got behind the wheel of a Ferrari Formula 1 car for the first time at 40, he wasn't told he's too old for the elite auto racing series.",
      "So why did Lindsey Vonn face so much second guessing in Europe about her comeback to ski racing at age 40 this season?",
      "Maybe it's the speeds in downhill that exceed 80 mph (130 kph). Or maybe it was because of Vonn's long history of crashes and injuries. Or maybe it's because no woman of her caliber had ever done it before \u2014 even though plenty of men have competed successfully in ski racing beyond 40.",
      "Whatever it was, Vonn has a simple explanation for why she returned. It has a lot to do with the multiple injuries that ended her career prematurely back in 2019 and the surgery to replace part of her right knee with titanium that has her feeling better than she has since she was in her 20s.",
      "\u201cThe why is that I love skiing,\u201d Vonn told The Associated Press in a recent interview ahead of the world championships starting this week. \u201cThe last few years of my career, I was in a lot of pain and I was dealing with a lot of injuries. And I haven\u2019t felt this good in a long, long time.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really solid. My position is solid. I think I\u2019m technically actually skiing better now than I was when I retired,\" Vonn added. \"But the \u2018why\u2019 is just I love it. I love going fast and I\u2019m still capable of doing it. I know that I\u2019m still competitive. I think I\u2019ve proven already that I\u2019m competitive. So why not?\u201d",
      "Before Vonn returned in December after nearly six years of retirement, two-time Olympic champion Michaela Dorfmeister suggested that the American \u201cshould see a psychologist,\u201d adding on Austrian TV, \u201cDoes she want to kill herself?\u201d",
      "Austrian downhill great Franz Klammer said \u201cshe\u2019s gone completely mad\u201d and four-time overall World Cup champion Pirmin Zurbriggen said that Vonn \u201chasn\u2019t recognized the meaning and purpose of her other life in recent years.\u201d",
      "But Vonn showed that she can still be competitive when she finished sixth and fourth in a downhill and a super-G in St. Anton, Austria, last month. She's still rediscovering her speed and has had a few minor falls during her comeback, but she also now has had more time to regain her timing entering worlds at another Austrian resort \u2014 in Saalbach-Hinterglemm.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m 40,\" Vonn said. \"I think if you would have asked this question a year and a half ago or a year ago, I would have said, \u2018Yeah, I feel really old.\u2019 But with my knee I feel so much better. And it\u2019s possible. Anything is possible.\u201d",
      "Besides Brady and Hamilton, Vonn is also inspired by the way Serena Williams excelled even at the end of her career near age 40.",
      "\u201cTom, Lewis, Serena. They\u2019ve all done it,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cThe resources that athletes have now allow for a better recovery. So even though you\u2019re older, you\u2019re still recovering faster than I was when I was in my 20s.",
      "Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin are both back just in time to lend some serious star power to the worlds \u2014 the biggest event in skiing outside of the Olympics.",
      "Shiffrin returned to the circuit on Thursday when she placed 10th in a World Cup slalom in Courchevel, France. It was her first race back in two months after crashing and suffering a deep puncture wound on her side.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m catching up to the fastest in the world,\" Shiffrin said, \u201cso I have a lot of work to do.\u201d",
      "The two Americans are the winningest female racers in World Cup history with 99 victories for Shiffrin and 82 for Vonn.",
      "There\u2019s even a chance that Vonn and Shiffrin could team up in the new team combined event that entails one squad member competing in downhill and the other in slalom \u2014 with their two times added together to determine the final results.",
      "In terms of pedigree, there couldn't be a better team: Vonn is the all-time leader in World Cup downhill victories with 43 and Shiffrin holds the mark in slalom with 62 \u2014 both records among men and women.",
      "First, though, Vonn will be in the spotlight during her individual events of super-G and downhill on Thursday and Saturday, respectively.",
      "Shiffrin is planning to compete in only two individual events: the giant slalom and slalom on Feb. 13 and 15.",
      "The women\u2019s team combined event is scheduled for Feb. 11.",
      "\u201cAll of my teammates have been showing incredible speed this season, and I would be lucky and so excited to pair with anyone one of them for team combined if I\u2019m in the position to be able to race,\u201d Shiffrin said.",
      "The championships open with a team parallel event on Tuesday that neither Vonn nor Shiffrin will compete in.",

      "\u201cI feel like I already have those butterflies in your stomach when you walk in here,\u201d Clark said during a pregame press conference. \u201cNot so much for a basketball game now, but obviously just to be around everybody and to enjoy this environment. I don\u2019t have to go and compete for 40 minutes, even though I wish maybe I could. I think it will definitely be a little bit more emotional that I don\u2019t have to compete.\u201d",

We had players that were selfless. We had players that didn\u2019t care how many points you were going to score. They\u2019re going to do whatever they could for your teammates.

I\u2019m confident in my teammates. I try to instill that in them.

      "MADRID -- Robert Lewandowski scored a second-half winner as Barcelona beat Alaves 1-0 on Sunday to move within four points of rival Real Madrid at the top of the Spanish league.",
      "Madrid lost 1-0 at Espanyol on Saturday after a run of 10 victories in its last 11 matches in all competitions.",
      "Third-placed Barcelona is three points behind second-placed Atletico Madrid, which ended a two-match winless streak in the league with a 2-0 victory against Mallorca on Saturday.",
      "\u201cWe knew we had to win this match,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cWe needed the victory. We had lost too many points in the league already.\u201d",
      "It was the fourth goal in as many matches for Lewandowski across all competitions, and his seventh in the last eight games.",
      "The Poland striker scored from close range after a volley by Lamine Yamal from inside the area deflected off a defender.",
      "It was an unusually low-scoring game for Barcelona, which had claimed 14 goals in its last three matches \u2014 including a 7-1 rout of Valencia in the league.",
      "\u201cIt's not every time that we will be able to score three, four or five goals in a game,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cWe had to be patient and in the end we did what we had to do, which was to score one more goal than our opponent.\u201d",
      "Alaves, which ended with no attempts on target, stayed inside the relegation zone with the loss. It has won only one of its last 11 matches in all competitions.",
      "Barcelona midfielder Gavi and Alaves forward Tom\u00e1s Conechny had to be substituted in the first half after a collision of heads while going for the ball about 10 minutes into the match at Montjuic stadium.",
      "Gavi left the field on his own but Conechny was carried off on a stretcher and taken to a local hospital for further tests. There was no immediate update about his condition.",

      "Japan has launched a navigation satellite on its flagship H3 rocket as the country seeks to have a precise positioning system of its own",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's space agency said on Sunday it successfully launched a navigation satellite on its new flagship H3 rocket as the country seeks to have a more precise location positioning system of its own.",
      "The H3 rocket carrying the Michibiki 6 satellite lifted off from the Tanegashima Space Center on a southwestern Japanese island.",
      "Everything went smoothly and the satellite successfully separated from the rocket as planned about 29 minutes after the liftoff, said Makoto Arita, H3 project manager for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA.",
      "Officials said it is expected to reach its targeted geospatial orbit in about two weeks.",
      "Japan currently has the quasi-zenith satellite system, or QZSS, with four satellites for a regional navigation system that first went into operation in 2018. The Michibiki 6 will be the fifth of its network.",
      "Michibiki\u2019s signals are used to supplement American GPS and will further improve positioning data for smartphones, car and maritime navigation and drones.",
      "Japan plans to launch two more navigation satellites to have a seven-satellite system by March 2026 in order to have a more precise global positioning capability without relying on foreign services, including the U.S., according to the Japan Science and Technology Agency. By the late 2030s, Japan plans to have an 11-satellite network.",
      "Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, noting the successful launch in a statement later Sunday, promised that his government will make further effort to \u201cmaximize\u201d the use of the navigation satellite system so that more people can smoothly access positioning data.",
      "Sunday's launch, delayed by a day due to the weather, was the fourth consecutive successful flight for the H3 system after a shocking failed debut attempt last year when the rocket had to be destroyed with its payload.",
      "Japan sees a stable, commercially competitive space transport capability as key to its space program and national security and has been developing two new flagship rockets as successors to the mainstay H2A series \u2014 the larger H3 with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and a much smaller Epsilon system with the aerospace unit of the heavy machinery maker IHI. It hopes to cater to diverse customer needs and improve its position in the growing satellite launch market."

    "summary": "America&rsquo;s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
    "story": [
      "America\u2019s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
      "WEST ORANGE, N.J. -- Along the long road from American icon to endangered species and back again, the bald eagle \u2014 the national bird of the United States, often seen against a clear blue sky \u2014 is having a moment.",
      "The eagles find themselves in an environmental updraft of sorts since the early 2000's, when the federal government took the thriving birds off its endangered species list with more states following suit. Culturally, too, the animals are soaring.",
      "In December, Joe Biden signed legislation making the raptor the country's national bird (thought that was already the case? More in a bit). This month, New Jersey became the latest state to delist the bald eagle as endangered, citing a remarkable comeback for the creatures associated with strength and independence \u2014 and that occupied just a single nest in the state decades ago. And to the chagrin or elation of football fans, the Philadelphia Eagles will be vying for a championship in the Super Bowl this weekend.",
      "How did the storied birds find their way back? As with so many tales, it's complex.",
      "The story \u2014 there was a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the 1980s and roughly 300 now, for instance \u2014 centers on the banning of DDT, a chemical insecticide with environmental side effects that included thin-shelled eagle eggs. That touched off a cratering in the number of eagles across the country, and officials prohibited the pesticide in 1972.",
      "To rebuild the birds' numbers in their historic range across the country, conservationists imported birds from places where their populations were stable, including from Canada. Early on, they also removed eggs from nesting birds' nests, replacing them with artificial ones for the eagles to \u201cincubate\u201d while the real eggs were safely hatched outside the nest before being returned, as eaglets for their parents to raise according to Kathy Clark, the head of New Jersey's Endangered and Nongame Species Program.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that almost went extinct on our continent. And so I think now it\u2019s really important to make sure people know that story and learn from it,\u201d said Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation in Alaska.",
      "Clark, whose work with the birds spans decades and includes the period when their numbers were so small they lived only in a remote part of the state, said the eagles have taught officials a number of lessons. One is that they're \u201cfairly adaptable\" and now live across densely populated (with people) New Jersey \u2014 from suburban Bergen County near New York to the wetlands along the shore in the south.",
      "She recalled the story of one fledgling eagle in a suburban town \u2014 New York Giants territory, as it were, sorry, Eagles fans \u2014 that found itself on a backyard woodpile and walking around the street. Volunteer observers worried over the bird's well-being, given the realities of suburban living. But a year later, observers spotted the eagle, identified by a band. It had apparently made it.",
      "\u201cThose birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're Jersey birds. You got to have attitude, right?\u201d",
      "The birds do face dangers as they expand into suburbia, though. Jilian Fazio, director of the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo in suburban northern New Jersey, said the zoo rescues a number of birds hit by cars. One bird, a male named Freedom, perched atop a branch in his enclosure at the zoo recently and called out loudly. He was found dangling by a rope, left with an injury that renders him unreleasable, Fazio said.",
      "There are threats, as well. Habitat preservation and clean, open water, since the eagles feed heavily on fish, is a worry, but there's also the current outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu. Clark says officials are going to maintain surveillance amid the outbreak.",
      "Beyond the birds coming off endangered lists, they made headlines recently for finally getting their due as the county's national bird, an oversight left undone in law because the bald eagle was already on the national seal and many thought it already had that status, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who sponsored legislation that Biden signed last month.",
      "She and colleagues worked with Native American and veterans groups to get buy-in for the legislation, she said, and it passed the typically divisive House and Senate last year with no dissent. The birds are revered in a number of Native American cultures as symbols of strength, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, according to Paul Apodaca, a retired academic who specializes in folklore and mythology.",
      "The eagles' perch as symbols of the country contributes to their conservation, with experts considering them an \u201cumbrella species,\u201d whose need for large open spaces and waterways helps preserve lesser known wildlife.",
      "\u201cAmericans are always going to have that sort of personal relationship with bald eagles,\" Clark said.",
      "Experiencing seeing a bird in the wild or even as you're driving along a business-lined highway can leave an impression. Dan Day, a birder who's spotted bald eagles some 50 times in recent years both on nature walks and just driving around suburban New Jersey, remembered never having seen the birds as a kid growing up in Cleveland. Now a New Jersey resident and Philadelphia Eagles fan, he regularly goes out in his green \u201cBirds\u201d cap and binoculars.",
      "\u201cJust the mere thrill of seeing one \u2014 a lot of people just have never, ever looked at one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really elevates your day to see a bald eagle.\u201d",
      "Enjoy watching them, experts say, but give them space, too. Because rescuing animals threatened with extinction is expensive, uncertain work. Said Clark, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection official: \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever will lose that perspective of, of being on the brink there, not knowing if if you\u2019re going to be able to save the species.\"",

      "With his 70th birthday looming on this year\u2019s horizon, Microsoft founder Bill Gates looked inward to open a window into the man behind Windows and other seminal software that turned the personal computer into a household staple",
      "With his 70th birthday looming on this year's horizon, Microsoft founder Bill Gates looked inward to open a window into the man behind Windows and other seminal software that turned the personal computer into a household staple.",
      "Gates focuses on the first quarter-century of his life in \u201cSource Code: My Beginnings,\u201d the opening installment in a retrospective trilogy about an insouciant, impertinent and often misunderstood kid who grew up to become a polarizing technology titan before morphing into an influential philanthropist.",
      "In \u201cSource Code,\u201d Gates explores how his childhood quirks, upbringing, friendships and experiences coalesced into shaping his own internal operating system. Along the way, he dissects his brain's unusual wiring, delves into the emotional trauma of his best friend dying while they were both in high school, and revisits the birth of Traf-O-Data, a trailblazing startup that he launched in Albuquerque, New Mexico with another childhood friend, Paul Allen.",
      "Traf-O-Data, conceived to create software for the groundbreaking Altair computer made Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, became Microsoft in 1975 \u2014 a year it booked $16,005 in revenue while Gates and Allen were making $9 per hour.",
      "By 1977, Microsoft had become successful enough to embolden Gates to drop out of Harvard University. In 1979, he had decided to move Microsoft to the Seattle area where he grew up. Although Gates stepped down as Microsoft's CEO 25 years ago, the Windows operating system and other software created under his reign remain the main pillar in a company that now generates $212 billion in annual revenue, boasts a $3.1 trillion market value, and accounts for most of Gates' $100 billion personal fortune.",
      "\u201cSource Code\u201d ends with Gates's drive back to Seattle in 1979, meaning it doesn't touch upon his 1994 marriage to Melinda French, nor their 2021 divorce.",
      "\u201cI am being reflective, which is not my normal mode, but it\u2019s kind of time,\u201d Gates said during an interview about the book with The Associated Press. \u201cAs we went back and got teacher\u2019s comments or people I worked with at Harvard, it was fascinating. I had confused myself into thinking I got straight A\u2019s in ninth grade.\u201d",
      "That might not sound like much of a revelation, but it was a surprise to the cerebral Gates, who paints himself in the book as a \u201cbratty smartass\u201d prone to dismissively sneering, \u201cThat's the stupidest thing I ever heard,\u201d about remarks that seemed nonsensical to him.",
      "Gate's self-portrait is that of a nerd nicknamed \u201cTrey\u201d by his card-playing grandmother because he was the third male on this father's side of the family to be named Bill. He was a pipsqueak who had difficulty making friends and preferred living in his own head before he discovered computers, which became like slot machines that rewarded him for writing elegant lines of code.",
      "When he did talk, the young Gates rocked back and forth like a metronome setting a rhythm for his brain \u2014 a habit that surfaced during parts of his 45-minute interview with the AP.",
      "\u201cIt was a little weird because it was hard to direct my attention,\u201d Gates recalled during the interview. \u201cI had one year in school where they said, \u2018Oh we should put you ahead a couple grades.\u2019 And then another time, they said, \u2018No, we should hold you back.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018Well make up your mind.\u2019 They were a little confounded.\u201d",
      "Although he didn't realize it as a boy, Gates has no doubt he was and still is neurodivergent who channeled that anomaly into learning to program computers at the right time in the right place with the patient support of his late parents (the book is dedicated to them, along with his sister, Kristi and Libby).",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that there was this idea that there are kids that have this kind of unique ability to concentrate but less social skills. I certainly would be included in that,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI encourage people who have strengths and deficits to kind of map their ambition onto something that plays to their strengths. Being able to think just about programming and how you do it better ended up being invaluable for me.\u201d",
      "Gates also had the advantage of growing up in a family that could afford to pay for him to attend a private high school in Seattle. Still, that privilege didn't insulate him from the trauma he experienced when his best friend, Kent Evans, died in a mountain climbing accident in May 1972 \u2014 a year before they were going to graduate.",
      "Evans' death occurred while he and Gates were preparing to spend much of the summer working on a program for their school, but what hurt far more was the loss of someone who understood him and helped give him a sense of purpose for the first time in his life.",
      "\u201cI had no notion of a friend just being gone. It was the only negative thing in my childhood,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt shapes you, that someone can just disappear \u2014 somebody you loved and would have done things with. He would have been part of whatever I ended up going on to do. I give Kent credit, along with Paul (Allen), for setting the direction that I ended up going down.\u201d",
      "Evans' death provided the impetus for Gates to reconnect with Allen, who was already attending college, to help him with his programming projects. Allen, three years older than Gates and a passionate fan of legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, did more than just help with the coding. He also offered Gates some LSD in an attempt to lure his partner down a more psychedelic path.",
      "Gates rebuffed Allen at first but decided to drop acid with a group of high school friends shortly before his 1973 graduation, according to the book.",
      "It wasn't a pleasant experience, a reaction that Gates thought might have been related to the dental surgery he underwent the day after his LSD trip. He tried LSD again with Allen in October 1974 while they were watching an episode of the old \"Kung Fu\" series on TV, and decided he would be better off without psychedelic drugs even though Apple co-founder Steve Jobs contended Microsoft would have created better products had Gates taken more acid.",
      "\"I thought maybe I\u2019d seem cool if I took it, but that didn\u2019t happen,\" Gates said during the interview. \u201cI would say Steve was definitely more hip than I was. He took a lot more acid than I did. He had a sense of style. I had some charisma in terms of motivating engineers and saying this great thing (with personal computers) would happen, but Steve had natural speaking and charisma capabilities, even beyond mine. So I always envied him for the things he did.\"",
      "Gates' mind is now being blown by the recent advances in artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology being planted into Microsoft's software as part of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.",
      "\u201cWhen I finally see ChatGPT-4, where the OpenAI guys show me a very early version, I am just blown away completely,\u201d Gates said. He views AI as an \u201camazing and scary\u201d technology that should be rigorously monitored.",
      "\u201cYou should be nervous. We have to acknowledge that AI is almost uniquely dangerous because it\u2019s unbounded in terms of how good it will get and it\u2019s happening within a generation,\u201d Gates said. \u201cHopefully, the politicians and the technologists will share with each other, and we can shape this thing. We better get on top of that now.\u201d",
      "If nothing else, Gates is hoping \u201cSource Code\u201d will help people see a more human side of him, even if he might never been seen as the cultural tastemaker that Jobs was.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was completely uncool,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut once I got going on Microsoft, I was willing to be pretty monomaniacal. Even people I competed with found it very intimidating how focused I was. I really didn\u2019t goof off in my 20s because my whole thing was having Microsoft move at full speed.\u201d",
      "Perhaps Gates will delve deeper into the monomania that made him so rich, famous and sometimes reviled in the next book about his life \u2014 an installment that he says won't be done until sometime in 2027, at the earliest."

      "President Donald Trump is meeting Friday with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whose company designs and supplies the advanced computer chips that play an integral role in developing artificial intelligence.",
      "The meeting at the White House was confirmed by a person familiar who insisted on anonymity to discuss the conversation between Huang and Trump. The person said the meeting was set up weeks ago and would enable them to get acquainted and talk about AI policy. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, Calif., declined to comment on the meeting.",
      "Nvidia had loudly protested a last-minute move by the Biden administration in January to expand AI chip restrictions beyond adversaries like China to more than 100 other countries, including Singapore. But it remains to be seen if Trump will follow through with or drop those proposed rules.",
      "Trump signed an order on his first day in office last week that said his administration would \u201cidentify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls,\u201d signaling that he might continue and harden Biden\u2019s approach.",
      "The Republican president is banking on AI to foster economic growth and draw hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, but he also saw the performance of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI technology as a sign that the technology can be developed more cheaply.",
      "Speaking Monday to House Republicans in Miami, Trump called the DeepSeek news \u201cpositive\u201d if it\u2019s accurate because \u201cyou won\u2019t be spending as much and you\u2019ll get the same result.\u201d",
      "Trump said it was a \u201cwake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek has said its recent models were built with Nvidia\u2019s lower-performing H800 chips, which are not banned in China. DeepSeek began attracting more attention in the AI industry last month when it released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and was more cost-effective in its use of expensive Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data. The chatbot became more widely accessible when it appeared on Apple and Google app stores early this year.",
      "The meeting between Trump and Huang comes as leaders of a special House committee focused on countering China have urged Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, to consider the potential national security benefits of placing export controls on Nvidia semiconductor chips used by DeepSeek. They said the examination should be part of a review that Trump ordered on his first day in office that called on the secretaries of State and Commerce to review the U.S. export control system.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said DeepSeek made extensive use of a Nvidia chip designed specifically to fall outside U.S. export controls. The lawmakers said that the committee supports American AI innovation, and that support \u201cincludes imposing reasonable safeguards\u201d to protect those innovations from China.",
      "\u201cThis demonstrates what the Select Committee has long argued: frequently updating export controls is imperative to ensure (China) will not exploit regulatory gaps and loopholes to advance their AI ambitions,\u201d the two lawmakers wrote in letter dated Wednesday.",
      "The pair asked that Waltz look for ways to strengthen controls on shipments through third countries \u201cthat pose a high risk of diversion.\u201d Singapore, the letter said, represented 22% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue in its most recently quarterly statement, \u201cdespite the company itself revealing most of these shipments ultimately went to users outside of Singapore.\u201d",
      "Countries such as Singapore, they added, should be subject to strict licensing requirements if they aren't willing to \u201ccrack down\u201d on China using their country as an intermediary for shipments.",

      "The unsolved death of a teenager in 1977 haunted students and staff at Honolulu's McKinley High School for nearly half a century",
      "HONOLULU -- Former Hawaii lawmaker Suzanne Chun Oakland remembers arriving at school one morning in 1977 to an eerie buzz.",
      "The 15-year-old had met up with girlfriends as usual before class at Honolulu's McKinley High School when she learned a student named Dawn Momohara had been found dead on the second floor of a school building.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how we got word of it, but everything spread really quickly,\u201d Chun Oakland said.",
      "Chun Oakland didn't know Momohara, who was 16, but the unsolved death has haunted her and other McKinley students and staff for nearly half a century. That was until last week, when police used advances in DNA technology to arrest a 66-year-old resident of a Utah nursing home.",
      "The suspect, former McKinley student Gideon Castro, was scheduled to make an initial court appearance Friday before a judge in Salt Lake County District Court. He remained in custody Thursday with the bond for his release set at $250,000, according to Salt Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office records.",
      "Castro\u2019s attorney, Marlene Mohn, did not respond to email and phone messages seeking comment.",
      "Momohara had been sexually assaulted and strangled, police said.",
      "\u201cI was just really sad,\" Chun Oakland recalled earlier this week. \"I think for our student body, of course there\u2019s that concern that what if he\u2019s still out there and he does it to somebody else.\u201d",
      "On March 21, 1977, shortly after 7:30 a.m., Honolulu police found Momohara lying on her back, partially clothed, an orange cloth wrapped tightly around her neck.",
      "Details from more than four decades ago are fuzzy for 1967 McKinley graduate Grant Okamura, who was the school\u2019s 28-year-old band teacher in 1977, but the morning Momohara was found has remained a core memory.",
      "Momohara's sister \u2014 one of his flute players \u2014 arrived at school that day not knowing her sister had been found dead, he recalled. The sister was called to the office and later walked into the band room, devastated.",
      "\u201cThe other students were trying to console her,\" Okamura said. \"At that point, I couldn't have band. How do you have a class? She just sat there crying.\u201d",
      "She didn't return to school for weeks afterward.",
      "He doesn't remember the sister's name. The Associated Press was unable to make contact with any possible relatives. Okamura said he met Momohara a few times when he let her into the air-conditioned band room to wait for her sister.",
      "The morning before Momohara was killed, she got a call from an unknown male and told her mother she was going to a nearby shopping center with friends. That was the last time her mother saw her, homicide Lt. Deena Thoemmes said.",
      "Police released sketches of a person of interest and a possible vehicle described by witnesses as a 1974 or 1975 Pontiac Lemans. A witness reported seeing the car when he and his girlfriend drove through campus the night before Momohara died. The witness saw a man and the car on the grass near the school's English building, Thoemmes said.",
      "The witness circled back around but the car and the man were gone.",
      "Police were unable to identify a suspect and the case grew cold, though grief lingered over the campus.",
      "In 2019, cold case detectives asked a forensic biology unit to examine several items of evidence from the scene, including Momohara's underwear. They were able to develop a DNA profile in 2020. Then, in 2023, police received information about potential suspects, two brothers who were interviewed in 1977.",
      "Several days after Momohara was killed, detectives interviewed Castro, who graduated from McKinley High in 1976. He said he met Momohara at a school dance that year and last saw her at a carnival on campus in February 1977. Police interviewed his brother, who also met Momohara at the dance.",
      "In November 2023, Honolulu police went to Chicago, where the brother was living. They \u201csurreptitiously\u201d obtained DNA from one of the brother's adult children, Thoemmes said.",
      "Lab findings excluded the brother as a suspect, but a DNA sample from Castro's adult son, and later from Castro himself, proved he was responsible, Thoemmes said.",
      "He was arrested last week at the nursing home where he lived in Millcreek, just south of Salt Lake City, on suspicion of second-degree murder.",
      "Neither Okamura nor Chun Oakland remembered Castro.",
      "Chun Oakland graduated in 1979 and grew up to become a Democratic member of the Hawaii Senate. She said Momohara's killing bothered her over the years, especially when she would meet victims through her work as a lawmaker or as a board member of the nonprofit Sex Abuse Treatment Center, a statewide program provding services for sexual assault survivors.",
      "Chun Oakland said she is grateful an arrest was possible even after all these years.",
      "\u201cI think the community in general, and our elected officials, they know the importance of trying to preserve the evidence that can someday be able to see justice for that individual or individuals,\" she said.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 14:32:25 -0500",
    "summary": "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world&rsquo;s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
    "story": [
      "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world\u2019s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rat infestation in many world cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington, and a new study blames climate change, urbanization and other human actions.",
      "A first-of-its-kind examination of trends and reasons in hard-to-count rat populations uses rat sighting reports in 16 cities around the world. In 11 of those cities, rat complaints have increased, according to a study in Friday's journal Science Advances.",
      "Based on individual trends within cities, Washington was by far the leader in rat increases, followed by San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam. Washington's rising rat reporting trend was three times greater than Boston's and 50% more than New York's, the study said. Washington city officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Only three cities saw significant decreasing trends \u2014 New Orleans, Louisville and Tokyo \u2014 with the home of Mardi Gras showing the biggest drop in rat reporting. Experts said the Louisiana city can teach others how to combat the rat problem.",
      "Researchers did a statistical analysis of the rising rat reporting in those cities and concluded that slightly more than 40% of the trend seen is due to warming temperatures from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. And that comes down to sex and food, said study lead author Jonathan Richardson, a biologist at the University of Richmond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these increasing trends in rats in cities that are warming the fastest, probably because this is a small mammal that has physiological challenges in the cold weather months,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf we're warming the climate and winter starts a week or two later and spring arrives a week or two earlier, that's one, two, maybe even three or four weeks across the entire year where those rats can be above ground foraging, acquiring more food and maybe squeezing out one or two more reproductive cycles. \u201d",
      "An extra month may not sound like much, but female rats can have a litter every month. Each litter is eight to 16 baby rats, Richardson said: \u201cThat is a recipe for accelerated population growth.\u201d",
      "Researchers pointed to two other big statistical links \u2014 that fit with known biological issues \u2014 behind more rat reports: the increase in urbanization and more densely populated cities.",
      "Rats like the built-up environment and being near people and their waste, the study and outside scientists said. They essentially eat at the same table as humans, multiple experts said.",
      "\u201cThe rat is the third most successful mammal behind humans and house mice. So it evolved and engineered to live alongside us,\u201d New York City rat czar Kathleen Corradi said during a break at a New Orleans conference on improving pest management. \u201cThey followed humans, Homo sapiens, across the continents and are in every single continent except Antarctica. So it's considered a wicked problem.\u201d",
      "Even though rats are intelligent and highly adaptive, Richardson and other experts said they are a serious problem for people.",
      "\u201cWhen rodent populations are high, people get sick, motor vehicles become disabled, mental health declines, fires are started and foods fouled,\u201d said Houston rat expert Michael Parsons, who wasn't part of the study. People are rightly bothered by rats because of \u201can innate fear caused by an organism that can make us sick.\u201d",
      "Researchers have not had good figures on rats. Because of the way they live and hide, they are not as easily counted as other critters, so this is one of the first attempts to quantify them. The study is not really a count of rats, but of complaints by people.",
      "Because the statistics go back years and only cities that haven't changed their reporting methods were looked at, Richardson said the trends they spotted have scientific merit. Even though Washington has the highest increasing trend that doesn't mean it has more rats or even rat sightings, it is just that the numbers within the city are increasing fastest, he said.",
      "Several outside experts said the study is legitimate, sensible and was sorely needed.",
      "\u201cThis paper is by far the largest data-driven effort to understand changes in urban rat populations ever attempted,\u201d said Drexel University ecology professor Jason Munshi-South, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Looking at the few cities where rat reports are down may help in the fight against rats, Richardson and Corradi said. The answer is not more poison or traps, but prevention, the study said.",
      "\u201cIn New Orleans they make a big effort to get out into neighborhoods and do educational workshops and campaigns to talk to residents about what makes a property less likely to have rats,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "New York City's recently stepped up rat-fighting, which includes replacing garbage in bags on the street with rat-resistant containers, hasn't quite shown up in Richardson's data yet, but rat czar Corradi said early results are encouraging. The city has signed people up for what it calls an elite squad of rat fighters, named \" NYC rat pack.\u201d",
      "It's an uphill battle.",
      "\u201cAs our cities warm, urbanize and (increase in) density, we create more resources for rats which could result in further increases in numbers,\u201d Simon Fraser University health and rat scientist Kaylee Byers said in an email.",
      "We can fight them better, but in the end people \u201cneed to coexist with wildlife in urban environments, even with rats,\u201d University of Michigan conservation scientist Neil Carter said.",
      "\u201cZero rats is impossible,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut I think an expectation that we need to live with the number of rats that we're seeing in many of these cities is also an unhealthy perspective on this problem.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 11:20:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution dating to around 5,200 years ago in ancient Greece",

      "Researchers have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution dating to around 5,200 years ago in ancient Greece",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ancient Greece produced the earliest records of democracy, western philosophy \u2014 and, it turns out, lead pollution.",
      "Researchers studying sediment cores recovered from mainland Greece and the Aegean Sea have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution in the environment dating to around 5,200 years ago.",
      "That's 1,200 years older than the previous earliest recorded lead pollution, which was found in a peatbog in Serbia.",
      "In antiquity, lead was released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of smelting ore for copper and silver. The toxic metal later condensed as dust and settled onto the soil.",
      "\u201cSilver was used for jewelry, for special objects \u2014 but it wasn't found in a pure state,\u201d but mined in ore combined with lead, said Heidelberg University archaeologist Joseph Maran, co-author of a new study published Thursday in Communications Earth and Environment.",
      "The site with the earliest signs of lead contamination is located in northeastern Greece, near the island of Thasos. Prior archaeological evidence suggests Thasos was one of the region\u2019s most significant sites for silver mining and metalwork, said Maran.",
      "\u201cLead released from smelting is the world\u2019s first form of toxic or industrial pollution,\u201d said Yale historian Joseph Manning, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The researchers found that levels of lead contamination remained fairly low and localized in ancient Greece, considered the cradle of European civilization, throughout the Bronze Age, the Classical period and the Hellenistic period. The Classical period is famous for Athenian democracy, Socrates and Plato, and the Hellenistic period saw Greek cultural influence peak across the Mediterranean region.",
      "But around 2,150 years ago, the researchers detected \u201ca very strong and abrupt increase\" in lead emissions caused by human activities across Greece, said co-author Andreas Koutsodendris at Heidelberg University.",
      "Around that time, in 146 B.C., the Roman army conquered the Greek peninsula, transforming the region\u2019s society and economy. As Roman trade, colonies and shipping expanded across the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, demand for silver coins grew rapidly, requiring smelting that released lead, said Koutsodendris.",
      "Later the Roman Empire used lead for tableware and for construction, including pipes.",
      "Previous research \u2013 including an analysis of ice cores from Greenland \u2013 had detected high levels of lead across much of the Northern Hemisphere during Roman times.",
      "But the new study adds a more \"specific and local picture to how lead levels changed,\u201d said Nathan Chellman, an environmental scientist at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was not involved in the research.",

    "summary": "The 40-year-old founder of China's DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund that now manages a reported $8 billion in assets",

      "The 40-year-old founder of China's DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund that now manages a reported $8 billion in assets",
      "BANGKOK -- The 40-year-old founder of China\u2019s DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund and then refined its quantitative models to branch into artificial intelligence.",
      "Liang Wenfeng, who founded DeepSeek in 2023, was born in southern China's Guangdong and studied in eastern China's Zhejiang province, home to e-commerce giant Alibaba and other tech firms, according to Chinese media reports.",
      "The hedge fund he set up in 2015, High-Flyer Quantitative Investment Management, developed models for computerized stock trading and began using machine-learning techniques to refine those strategies.",
      "Like many Chinese quantitative traders, High-Flyer was hit by losses when regulators cracked down on such trading in the past year. However, it reportedly manages $8 billion in assets, ample resources for funding DeepSeek\u2019s AI research.",
      "It also has abundant computing power for AI, since High-Flyer had by 2022 amassed a cluster of 10,000 of California-based Nvidia\u2019s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips that are used to build and run AI systems, according to a post that summer on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. soon after restricted sales of those chips to China.",
      "\u201cThing is, we are sure now that we want to do this, can do this, and are capable of doing this, so we\u2019re among the best-suited candidates to tackle it at this moment,\" Liang told Waves, a tech media outlet, in 2023.",
      "\u201cCurrently, neither tech giants nor startups have an unassailable lead. With OpenAI paving the way, everyone is working with published papers and open-source code,\u201d it quoted him as saying.",
      "Liang said he spends his days reading papers, writing code, and participating in group discussions, like other researchers.",
      "DeepSeek is exploring what intelligence means, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople may think there\u2019s some hidden business logic behind this, but it\u2019s mainly driven by curiosity,\u201d Liang said.",
      "When DeepSeek was asked, \u201cWho is Liang Wenfeng?\u201d its first answer was to name a different Chinese entrepreneur with the same name, at least as spelled in English letters.",
      "When asked: \u201cWhere is Liang Wenfeng from and where did he go to university?\u201d it said that as of October 2023, the most recent knowledge cutoff for DeepSeek's R1 AI model, \u201cthere is no publicly available information about Liang Wenfeng\u2019s background, including his place of origin or educational history.\"",
      "\"If you are referring to the founder of DeepSeek, details about his personal life or academic background have not been disclosed publicly. For more information about DeepSeek, you can visit its official website,\u201d it said.",
      "Liang's focused approach fits in with his determination to push AI learning forward. After decades of relying on innovation from the West, he says China should be making its own contributions.",
      "\u201cWhat we see is that Chinese AI can\u2019t be in the position of following forever. We often say that there is a gap of one or two years between Chinese AI and the United States, but the real gap is the difference between originality and imitation,\u201d he said in another Waves interview in November. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t change, China will always be only a follower \u2014 so some exploration is inescapable.\u201d",

      "Access to the Sundance Film Festival doesn\u2019t require a trip to Park City, Utah anymore; Just an internet connection",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Access to the Sundance Film Festival doesn\u2019t require a trip to Park City, Utah, anymore \u2014 just an internet connection. Over half of the films that premiered this past week will be available to steam on the festival\u2019s online platform starting Thursday.",
      "What started as a COVID-era necessity has become one of the festival\u2019s most beloved components, even for those who do brave the cold and the lines to see films in person.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really great to be able to offer that opportunity to our audiences, but also to our artists. Sundance is a festival of discovery and each of the films coming to the festival is seeking that moment with audiences,\u201d said festival director Eugene Hernandez. \u201cHow cool is it that even for that short window of time, just a few days, folks from anywhere in the country can log on in their living room with family and friends, get together and watch a few of the films?\u201d",
      "The Sundance Film Festival website has information on the technical requirements, but there are ways to watch on your computer and television. After you click the \u201cWatch Now\u201d button, you have five hours to complete the feature film.",
      "Anyone in the U.S. can access the online portal. Rights restrictions make the films and shows unavailable to stream internationally.",
      "All of the feature films playing in the main competitions are included on the platform and a few extras, many of which do not yet have theatrical distribution plans. That includes the Dylan O\u2019Brien breakout \u201cTwinless,\u201d the Marlee Matlin, Sally Ride and Selena Quintanilla documentaries, and Ukrainian documentaries \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka\u201d and \u201cMr. Nobody Against Putin.\u201d",
      "Other highlights include \u201cLove, Brooklyn\u201d; \u201cRicky\u201d; the Barry Jenkins produced \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d made by triple threat Eva Victor; the politically relevant \u201cHeightened Scrutiny\u201d which looks at how the media is responsible for shaping narratives around transgender issues; and \u201cThe Perfect Neighbor,\u201d which uses police bodycam footage to reconstruct a deadly neighborhood incident in Florida.",
      "Some films already have distributors and won\u2019t be streaming on the platform. A24 will release both the Ayo Edebiri film \u201cOpus\u201d and the Rose Byrne psychological thriller \u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You\u201d in theaters this year. Same with Focus Features' Carey Mulligan charmer \u201cThe Ballad of Wallis Island,\u201d which will be in theaters in March. And in general, movies that played in the premieres section will not be available online, whether or not they have distribution plans yet. That includes Bill Condon\u2019s \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d remake.",
      "Between Jan. 30 through Feb. 2.",
      "It\u2019s $35 for a single film and up to $800 for unlimited. Proceeds benefit the Sundance Institute\u2019s artist programs and funds.",

      "Chinese artificial intelligence startup company DeepSeek stunned markets and AI experts with its claim that it built its immensely popular chatbot at a fraction of the cost of those made by American tech titans.",
      "That immediately called into question the billions of dollars U.S. tech companies are spending on a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers they say are needed to unlock the next wave of artificial intelligence.",
      "Could this new AI mean the world needs significantly less electricity for the technology than everyone thinks? The answer has profound implications for the overheating climate . AI uses vast amounts of energy, much of which comes from burning fossil fuels, which causes climate change. Tech companies have said their electricity use is going up, when it was supposed to be ramping down, ruining their carefully-laid plans to address climate change.",
      "\u201cThere has been a very gung ho, go ahead at all costs mentality in this space, pushing toward investment in fossil fuels,\u201d said Eric Gimon, senior fellow at Energy Innovation. \u201cThis is an opportunity to tap the brakes.\u201d",
      "Making AI more efficient could be less taxing on the environment, experts say, even if its huge electricity needs are not going away.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s claims of building its impressive chatbot on a budget drew curiosity that helped make its AI assistant the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s iPhone this week, ahead of U.S.-made chatbots ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden we wake up Monday morning and we see a new player number one on the App Store, and all of a sudden it could be a potential gamechanger overnight,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \u201c It caused a bit of a panic. These were the hottest stocks in the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s app competes well with other leading AI models. It can compose software code, solve math problems and address other questions that take multiple steps of planning. It's attracted attention for its ability to explain its reasoning in the process of answering questions.",
      "Leading analysts have been poring through the startup's public research papers about its new model, R1, and its precursors. Among the details that stood out was DeepSeek\u2019s assertion that the cost to train the flagship v3 model behind its AI assistant was only $5.6 million, a stunningly low number compared to the multiple billions of dollars spent to build ChatGPT and other well-known systems. DeepSeek hasn\u2019t responded to requests for comment.",
      "The $5.6 million number only included actually training the chatbot, not the costs of earlier-stage research and experiments, the paper said. DeepSeek was also working under some constraints: U.S. export controls on the most powerful AI chips. It said it relied on a relatively low-performing AI chip from California chipmaker Nvidia that the U.S. hasn\u2019t banned for sale in China.",
      "Data centers consumed about 4.4% of all U.S. electricity in 2023 and that's expected to increase to 6.7% to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.",
      "It's been axiomatic that U.S. tech giants must spend much more on building out data centers and other infrastructure to train and run their AI systems. Meta Platforms, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, says it plans to spend up to $65 billion this year, including on a massive data center complex coming to Louisiana.",
      "Microsoft said it plans to spend $80 billion this year. And Trump last week joined the CEOs of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to announce a joint venture that hopes to invest up to $500 billion on data centers and the electricity generation needed for AI development, starting with a project already under construction in Texas.",
      "When there's an innovative technology that's useful to the general population and it's affordable, people will use it, said Vic Shao, founder of DC Grid, which delivers off-grid, direct current power to data centers and electric vehicle charging stations.",
      "That means data centers will still be built, though they may be able to operate more efficiently, said Travis Miller, an energy and utilities strategist at Morningstar Securities Research.",
      "\u201cWe think that the growth in electricity demand will end up at the lower end of most of the ranges out there,\u201d he said.",
      "If DeepSeek's claims hold true, some routine AI queries might not need a data center and could be shifted to phones, said Rahul Sandil, vice president and general manager for global marketing and communications at MediaTek, a semiconductor company. That would ease the computing need and give more time to scale up renewable energy sources for data centers.",
      "Bloom Energy is one of the AI-related stocks that took a hit Monday. KR Sridhar, founder and CEO, said it's imperative that the U.S. leads in AI because it can power data centers with clean energy, unlike other countries that still primarily rely on coal.",
      "\u201cWe can continue to make it better and we will continue to make it better,\u201d he said.",
      "Rick Villars, an analyst for market research group IDC, said the DeepSeek news could influence how AI researchers advance their models, but they\u2019ll still need plenty of data centers and electricity.",
      "\u201cWe think this actually could boost and accelerate the time frame for when AI becomes much more embedded into our lives, in the work sense, the living sense and in health care,\u201d Villars said. \u201cSo we still think the capacity is required.\u201d",

      "NATO is deploying eyes in the sky and on the Baltic Sea to protect cables and pipelines that stitch together the nine countries with shores on Baltic waters",
      "ABOARD A FRENCH NAVY FLIGHT OVER THE BALTIC SEA -- With its powerful camera, the French Navy surveillance plane scouring the Baltic Sea zoomed in on a cargo ship plowing the waters below \u2014 closer, closer and closer still until the camera operator could make out details on the vessel's front deck and smoke pouring from its chimney.",
      "The long-range Atlantique 2 aircraft on a new mission for NATO then shifted its high-tech gaze onto another target, and another after that until, after more than five hours on patrol, the plane's array of sensors had scoped out the bulk of the Baltic \u2014 from Germany in the west to Estonia in the northeast, bordering Russia.",
      "The flight's mere presence in the skies above the strategic sea last week, combined with military ships patrolling on the waters, also sent an unmistakable message: The NATO alliance is ratcheting up its guard against suspected attempts to sabotage underwater energy and data cables and pipelines that crisscross the Baltic, prompted by a growing catalogue of incidents that have damaged them.",
      "\u201cWe will do everything in our power to make sure that we fight back, that we are able to see what is happening and then take the next steps to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. And our adversaries should know this,\" NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said this month in announcing a new alliance mission, dubbed \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d to protect the underwater infrastructure vital to the economic well-being of Baltic-region nations.",
      "Power and communications cables and gas pipelines stitch together the nine countries with shores on the Baltic, a relatively shallow and nearly landlocked sea. A few examples are the 152-kilometer (94-mile) Balticconnector pipeline that carries gas between Finland and Estonia, the high-voltage Baltic Cable connecting the power grids of Sweden and Germany, and the 1,173-kilometer (729-mile) C-Lion1 telecommunications cable between Finland and Germany.",
      "Undersea pipes and cables help power economies, keep houses warm and connect billions of people. More than 1.3 million kilometers (807,800 miles) of fiber optic cables \u2014 more than enough to stretch to the moon and back \u2014 span the world's oceans and seas, according to TeleGeography, which tracks and maps the vital communication networks. The cables are typically the width of a garden hose. But 97% of the world\u2019s communications, including trillions of dollars of financial transactions, pass through them each day.",
      "\u201cIn the last two months alone, we have seen damage to a cable connecting Lithuania and Sweden, another connecting Germany and Finland, and most recently, a number of cables linking Estonia and Finland. Investigations of all of these cases are still ongoing. But there is reason for grave concern,\" Rutte said on Jan. 14.",
      "At least 11 Baltic cables have been damaged since October 2023 \u2014 the most recent being a fiber optic cable connecting Latvia and the Swedish island of Gotland, reported to have ruptured on Sunday. Although cable operators note that subsea cable damage is commonplace, the frequency and concentration of incidents in the Baltic heightened suspicions that damage might have been deliberate.",
      "There also are fears that Russia could target cables as part of a wider campaign of so-called \u201chybrid warfare\u201d to destabilize European nations helping Ukraine defend itself against the full-scale invasion that Moscow has been pursuing since 2022.",
      "Without specifically blaming Russia, Rutte said: \u201cHybrid means sabotage. Hybrid means cyber-attacks. Hybrid means sometimes even assassination attacks, attempts, and in this case, it means hitting on our critical undersea infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Finnish police suspect that the Eagle S, an oil tanker that damaged the Estlink 2 power cable and two other communications cables linking Finland and Estonia on Dec. 25th, is part of Moscow\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d used to avoid war-related sanctions on Russian oil exports.",
      "Finnish authorities seized the tanker shortly after it left a Russian port and apparently cut the cables by dragging its anchor. Finnish investigators allege the ship left an almost 100-kilometer (62-mile) long anchor trail on the seabed.",
      "Several Western intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of their work, told The Associated Press that recent damage was most likely accidental, seemingly caused by anchors being dragged by ships that were poorly maintained and poorly crewed.",
      "One senior intelligence official told AP that ships' logs and mechanical failures with ships' anchors were among \u201cmultiple indications\u201d pointing away from Russian sabotage. The official said Russian cables were also severed. Another Western official, also speaking anonymously to discuss intelligence matters, said Russia sent an intelligence-gathering vessel to the site of one cable rupture to investigate the damage.",
      "The Washington Post first reported on the emerging consensus among U.S. and European security services that maritime accidents likely caused recent damage.",
      "The European Subsea Cables Association, representing cable owners and operators, noted in November after faults were reported on two Baltic links that, on average, a subsea cable is damaged somewhere in the world every three days. In northern European waters, the main causes of damage are commercial fishing or ship anchors, it said.",
      "In the fiber-optic cable rupture on Sunday connecting Latvia and Sweden, Swedish authorities detained a Maltese-flagged ship bound for South America with a cargo of fertilizer.",
      "Navibulgar, a Bulgarian company that owns the Vezhen, said any damage was unintentional and that the ship's crew discovered while navigating in extremely bad weather that its left anchor appeared to have dragged on the seabed.",
      "The alliance is deploying warships, maritime patrol aircraft and naval drones for the mission to provide \u201cenhanced surveillance and deterrence.\u201d",
      "Aboard the French Navy surveillance flight, the 14-member crew cross-checked ships they spotted from the air against lists of vessels they had been ordered to watch for.",
      "\u201cIf we witness some suspicious activities from ships as sea \u2013 for example, ships at very low speed or at anchorage in a position that they shouldn\u2019t be at this time \u2013 so this is something we can see,\u201d said the flight commander, Lt. Alban, whose surname was withheld by the French military for security reasons.",

      "HONG KONG -- Chinese tech startup DeepSeek \u2019s new artificial intelligence chatbot has sparked discussions about the competition between China and the U.S. in AI development, with many users flocking to test the rival of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s AI assistant became the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s iPhone store on Tuesday afternoon and its launch made Wall Street tech superstars' stocks tumble. Observers are eager to see whether the Chinese company has matched America\u2019s leading AI companies at a fraction of the cost.",
      "The chatbot's ultimate impact on the AI industry is still unclear, but it appears to censor answers on sensitive Chinese topics, a practice commonly seen on China's internet. In 2023, China issued regulations requiring companies to conduct a security review and obtain approvals before their products can be publicly launched.",
      "Here are some answers The Associated Press received from DeepSeek's new chatbot and ChatGPT:",
      "For many Chinese, the Winnie the Pooh character is a playful taunt of President Xi Jinping. Chinese censors in the past briefly banned social media searches for the bear in mainland China.",
      "ChatGPT got that idea right. It said Winnie the Pooh had become a symbol of political satire and resistance, often used to mock or criticize Xi. It explained that internet users started comparing Xi to the bear over similarities in their physical appearances.",
      "DeepSeek's chatbot said the bear is a beloved cartoon character that is adored by countless children and families in China, symbolizing joy and friendship.",
      "Then, abruptly, it said the Chinese government is \u201cdedicated to providing a wholesome cyberspace for its citizens.\" It added that all online content is managed following Chinese laws and socialist core values, with the aim of protecting national security and social stability.",
      "It might be easy for many people to answer, but both AI chatbots mistakenly said Joe Biden, whose term ended last week, because their data was last updated in October 2023. But they both tried to be responsible by reminding users to verify with updated sources.",
      "The 1989 crackdown saw government troops open fire on student-led pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths. The event remains a taboo subject in mainland China.",
      "DeepSeek's chatbot answered, \u201cSorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else.\u201d",
      "But ChatGPT gave a detailed answer on what it called \u201cone of the most significant and tragic events\u201d in modern Chinese history. The chatbot talked about the background of the massive protests, the estimated casualties and the legacy.",
      "DeepSeek's chatbot's answer echoed China's official statements, saying the relationship between the world's two largest economies is one of the most important bilateral relationships globally. It said China is committed to developing ties with the U.S. based on mutual respect and win-win cooperation.",
      "\u201cWe hope that the United States will work with China to meet each other halfway, properly manage differences, promote mutually beneficial cooperation, and push forward the healthy and stable development of China-U.S. relations,\u201d it said.",
      "ChatGPT's answer was more nuanced.

      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro says he wants to fast-track the construction of power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that produce electricity and use hydrogen",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Gov. Josh Shapiro said Thursday that he wants to fast-track the construction of big power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that provide electricity to the grid and use hydrogen.",
      "Shapiro's announcement comes a few days before he delivers his third budget proposal to lawmakers amid an energy crunch that threatens to raise electricity bills across Pennsylvania, the nation's second-biggest natural gas-producing state.",
      "Shapiro, a Democrat, said he wants to start the \u201cnext chapter in Pennsylvania\u2019s long story of energy leadership\u201d and keep pace with other states that are attracting big projects, such as data centers and electric vehicle factories.",
      "\"Pennsylvania, it\u2019s time for us to be more competitive. It\u2019s time for us to act. We need to take some big and decisive steps right now, build new sources of power so Pennsylvania doesn't miss out,\u201d Shapiro said at a news conference at Pittsburgh International Airport.",
      "Shapiro said Pennsylvania is one of just 12 states that doesn't have an entity to fast-track siting decisions for energy projects. He wants to change that by creating the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board to streamline permitting and support for new energy projects.",
      "\"We need shovels in the ground now, not in the years to come,\" Shapiro said.",
      "The tax credits Shapiro is proposing are aimed at large projects producing electricity, using hydrogen and making hydrogen-based aviation fuel.",
      "A new power plant could qualify for up to $100 million per year for three years based on the amount of power the facility can produce, under Shapiro's plan.",
      "The Shapiro administration said it would leave it to lawmakers to hammer out what sort of power plants would qualify for a tax credit, although they said it wouldn't include the proposed restart of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to feed data centers run by tech giant Microsoft.",
      "At the federal level, former President Joe Biden's administration enacted rules last year as a centerpiece of his efforts to fight climate change by requiring coal and newer, higher-usage gas plants to slash their carbon dioxide emissions by 90% to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases from a major source.",
      "For the other tax credits, a user of hydrogen fuel could qualify for up to $49 million a year and an aviation fuel producer could qualify for up to $15 million a year, under Shapiro's plan. The hydrogen-related tax credits are an attempt to create demand for the two federally subsidized hydrogen-making projects in which Pennsylvania or some of its businesses and institutions play a role, another part of Biden\u2019s agenda to slow climate change.",
      "The plans would require approval from lawmakers. Republican lawmakers have been critical of Shapiro\u2019s energy policy, saying it is a major hurdle for Pennsylvania to attract companies that want to build big new natural gas-fired power plants and stabilize the power grid.",
      "Shapiro's plans elicited applause from renewable energy advocates, while business groups echoed Republican criticism, but said they were encouraged by Shapiro's focus on energy.",
      "Shapiro's plan unveiled last year to make power plant owners in the nation\u2019s third-biggest energy-producing state pay for their greenhouse gas emissions and require utilities to buy more electricity from renewable sources gained no traction in the Legislature.",
      "One project Shapiro said he wants to help is a proposal by natural gas producer CNX Resources to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh\u2019s airport to make hydrogen-based fuels.",
      "CNX has said it would only go through with it if the federal government allows coal mine methane to qualify for tax credits that were central to Biden's plan to fight climate change.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "That\u2019s spurred proposals to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, develop small modular nuclear reactors and build utility-scale renewable installations or new natural gas plants.",
      "However, the growth in energy demand comes at a time when the power supply is already strained by efforts to shift away from planet-warming fossil fuels and the closure of aging nuclear power plants.",
      "In recent months, governors including Shapiro and state ratepayer advocates have pressured the operator of the mid-Atlantic electricity grid to reduce the amount of money it offers to power plant owners, warning that it will unjustifiably raise electricity bills across the region.",

The paper is backed by 30 countries including the U.S. and China, marking rare cooperation between the two countries as they battle over AI supremacy, highlighted by Chinese startup DeepSeek stunning the world this week with its budget chatbot in spite of U.S. export controls on advanced chips to the country.",
      "The report by a group of independent experts is a \u201csynthesis\u201d of existing research intended to help guide officials working on drawing up guardrails for the rapidly advancing technology, Yoshua Bengio, a prominent AI scientist who led the study, told the Associated Press in an interview.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are high,\u201d the report says, noting that while a few years ago the best AI systems could barely spit out a coherent paragraph, now they can write computer programs, generate realistic images and hold extended conversations.",
      "While some AI harms are already widely known, such as deepfakes, scams and biased results, the report said that \u201cas general-purpose AI becomes more capable, evidence of additional risks is gradually emerging\u201d and risk management techniques are only in their early stages.",
      "It comes amid warnings this week about artificial intelligence from the Vatican and the group behind the Doomsday Clock.",
      "The report focuses on general purpose AI, typified by chatbots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT used to carry out many different kinds of tasks. The risks fall into three categories: malicious use, malfunctions and widespread \u201csystemic\u201d risks.",
      "Bengio, who with two other AI pioneers won computer science\u2019s top prize in 2019, said the 100 experts who came together on the report don\u2019t all agree on what to expect from AI in the future. Among the biggest disagreements within the AI research community is the timing of when the fast-developing technology will surpass human capabilities across a variety of tasks and what that will mean.",

      "Researchers delved into the details surrounding possible dangers.

But it\u2019s \u201cunclear how well they capture the practical challenges\u201d of weaponizing and delivering the agents, it said.",
      "General purpose AI is also likely to transform a range of jobs and \u201cdisplace workers,\u201d the report says, noting that some researchers believe it could create more jobs than it takes away, while others think it will drive down wages or employment rates, though there\u2019s plenty of uncertainty over how it will play out.",
      "AI systems could also run out of control, either because they actively undermine human oversight or humans pay less attention, the report said.",
      "However, a raft of factors make it hard to manage the risks, including AI developers knowing little about how their models work, the authors said.",
      "The paper was commissioned at an inaugural global summit on AI safety hosted by Britain in November 2023, where nations agreed to work together to contain potentially \u201ccatastrophic risks.\u201d At a follow-up meeting hosted by South Korea last year, AI companies pledged to develop AI safety while world leaders backed setting up a network of public AI safety institutes.",
      "The report, also backed by the United Nations and the European Union, is meant to weather changes in governments, such as the recent presidential transition in the U.S., leaving it up to each country to choose how it responds to AI risks. President Donald Trump rescinded former President Joe Biden\u2019s AI safety policies on his first day in office, and has since directed his new administration to craft its own approach. But Trump hasn\u2019t made any move to disband the AI Safety Institute that Biden formed last year, part of a growing international network of such centers.",

      "Bengio said the report's aim was not to \"propose a particular way to evaluate systems or anything.\" The authors stayed away from prioritizing particular risks or making specific policy recommendations. Instead they laid out what the scientific literature on AI says \u201cin a way that\u2019s digestible by policymakers.\"",

      "X is teaming up with Visa to soon offer a system for real-time payments on the social media platform",
      "NEW YORK -- X is teaming up with Visa to soon offer a system for real-time payments on the social media platform \u2014 signaling some progress in a yearslong vision from billionaire owner Elon Musk to create an \u201ceverything app.\u201d",
      "Visa is the first partner for the platform's \u201cX Money Account\" service, which is set to launch later this year, X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a Tuesday post announcing the news. The offering, Yaccarino noted, will support an in-platform digital wallet and peer-to-peer payments connected to users' debit cards, with an option to transfer funds to a bank account.",
      "According to Visa, which also posted about the partnership on X Tuesday, these services will be powered by Visa Direct \u2014 the payment giant's instant money transferring service \u2014 and will be available to X Money Account users in the U.S.",
      "Whether X Money will become available to consumers in other countries, and perhaps through additional payment partners in the near future is still known. And an exact date for the U.S. launch has also not been announced yet.",
      "In her post Tuesday, Yaccarino called the partnership with Visa a \u201cmilestone for the Everything App\u201d and the \u201cfirst of many big announcements about X Money this year.\"",
      "The prospect of San Francisco-based X, formerly known as Twitter, becoming an \u201ceverything app\" has been floated around for some time. Before officially closing the deal to purchase the platform for $44 billion back in 2022, Musk expressed interest in creating his own version of something similar to China\u2019s WeChat \u2014 a \u201csuper app\u201d that does video chats, messaging, streaming and payments.",
      "And his fascination with such a platform began long before the Twitter deal was on the table. Musk has been toying with the idea of an \u201ceverything app\u201d since the late 1990s when he launched a startup called X.com that was later merged into what became X.com. He continued to push for PayPal to diversify but was rebuffed by company CEO Peter Thiel and other executives. PayPal was sold in 2002 to eBay for $1.5 billion \u2014 providing Musk with a windfall that he funneled into the creation of SpaceX and an investment in Tesla in its early days.",
      "The landscape is far more competitive today \u2014 with a handful of companies making similar efforts to expand their in-platform offerings. Other social media giants, such as Facebook parent Meta, have added shopping, games and even dating features.",
      "Consumers now have different platforms at their disposal for communications, payment services, entertainment and more. How X's coming \u201ceverything\u201d features will fare has yet to be seen. Since Musk's 2022 takeover, the platform has already alienated many users and advertisers over reports of rising hate speech and misinformation.",
      "X\u2019s ambitions could also thrust the company into the crosshairs of other powerful tech giants trying to fend off a perceived competitive threat. U.S. regulators have alleged that Apple, for example, has been illegally using its market power to stifle so-called super apps from making their way onto its iPhone since 2017.",
      "As part of an antitrust lawsuit filed last year, the U.S. Justice Department said it had uncovered evidence showing that Apple believed a super app would lessen consumers\u2019 usage of the iPhone\u2019s own software and services, including payment processing. The Cupertino, California, company has vehemently denied the allegations and is trying to persuade a federal judge in New Jersey to dismiss the entire case.",

      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s cold on land, it\u2019s also cold in the ocean. And that led to a number of turtles being beached or very debilitated and just floating in the water,\" said Dr. Heather Barron, the chief science officer and veterinarian at the center.",

      "While it snowed as far south as northern Florida, which is extremely rare, the frigid temperatures reached South Florida. That meant cold-stunned turtles were also found along Palm Beach County's coastline.",
      "\u201cIt is quite unusual for this to happen in Florida. Sea turtles do migrate, and typically they're migrating down to Florida for this time of year because of warmer water,\" Barron said.",
      "By Wednesday morning, Espresso, Pickle Juice and Ginger Beer were basking in the sunshine in the center's \u201cParty Tank.\u201d",
      "The turtles arrived in Juno Beach on Friday from the Marine Science Center in Volusia County, Florida. They all suffered from cold stunning, which causes sea turtles to lose mobility and become lethargic. Most of the 17 turtles are expected to be released back into the ocean in a few weeks.",

      "Since late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people \u2014 mostly female sex workers \u2014 whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island\u2019s south shore.",
      "Heuermann was arrested in 2023 and charged in the deaths of three of the victims between 2009 and 2010: Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Megan Waterman.",
      "While in custody, he was subsequently charged in the deaths of Valerie Mack in 2000, Jessica Taylor in 2003, Maureen Brainard-Barnes in 2007 and Sandra Costilla in 1993.",
      "Huermann has maintained his innocence and pleaded not guilty to all counts.",
      "Michael Brown, Heuermann's attorney, said following a Wednesday court hearing that his client risks being improperly convicted because of the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of the evidence put forward by prosecutors.",
      "He also argued there\u2019s a \u201csubstantial disparity\u201d in the evidence in the some of the deaths, which he maintained involves different time frames, killing methods and locations for disposing the bodies.",
      "\u201cThe danger of having count after count, victim after victim in the same trial is that 'If there's smoke, there\u2019s fire' mentality,\" Brown said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be tried together. One issue has nothing to do with the other.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors on Wednesday filed a written response to the DNA challenge and said they will respond to the motion for separate trials later. Heuermann\u2019s next court date is Feb. 18.",
      "DNA results from hair strands found at some of the crime scenes are among the key pieces of evidence prosecutors have put forward in the case.",

      "Workers at a Whole Foods Market in Pennsylvania voted to unionize on Monday, becoming the first group of employees to pull off a labor win at the Amazon-owned grocery store chain.",
      "Employees at the Philadelphia store cast 130 votes \u2014 or about 57% of the ballots cast \u2014 in favor of joining a local chapter of The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union for the purposes of collective bargaining. According to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election, 100 workers rejected the motion.",
      "\u201cThis fight is far from over, but today\u2019s victory is an important step forward,\" said Wendell Young IV, the president of UFCW Local 1776. \"We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers\u2019 needs and priorities.\u201d",
      "The results mark the first successful entry of organized labor into Amazon\u2019s grocery business, which includes Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and the Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion, has tried to fend off organizing efforts in its stores as well as by delivery drivers and warehouse workers.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Amazon warehouse workers in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to be represented in labor negotiations by a fledgling union that has since affiliated with the Teamsters. But Amazon has refused to come to the bargaining table.",
      "Employees at the Whole Foods store, located in the center of Philadelphia, started organizing early last year, Young said. They teamed up with UFCW Local 1776 in the late summer, and in November petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an official election.",
      "The local union said the store workers hoped a successful vote would help them secure higher wages, more affordable health care coverage, child care support, greater work-life balance and better working conditions.",
      "In a statement after the votes were counted Monday night, Whole Foods said it \u201cis proud to offer competitive compensation, great benefits, and career advancement opportunities to all Team Members.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are disappointed by the outcome of this election, but we are committed to maintaining a positive working environment in our Philly Center City store,\u201d the company added.",
      "The company said it provides store employees with a competitive average hourly wage and other benefits, such as 401(k) plans and \u201con-demand\u201d mental health support. It did not disclose its average hourly rate, but some online job postings show store employees can earn $16 per hour or higher.",
      "After the union filed the election petition, workers at the Philadelphia store were given free snacks, and the company repainted their break rooms, according to Young.",
      "Earlier this month, UFCW Local 1776 filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against the company, accusing it of firing one worker in retaliation for union activities and alleging that supervisors told employees they would get paid more if they rejected the union bid. Whole Foods disputed the worker was fired in retaliation.",
      "The union has also accused Whole Foods of withholding region-wide wage increases from employees at the Philadelphia store because of the union activities.",
      "The company acknowledges it did not offer wage increases to workers at the store, even though it did so at a number of other stores as part of a quarterly review. Whole Foods maintains it would have been illegal to make wage adjustments in the lead-up to the union election, an argument Young disputed.",
      "The company said it was delaying the pay bumps until after the election to avoid the appearance of trying to influence the vote with raises.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon has resisted union organizing efforts by its workers. Amazon delivery drivers went on strike in a handful of U.S. cities before Christmas to exert pressure on the the company to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",
      "Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina are scheduled to vote next month on whether they want to be represented by an upstart union called Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment.",
      "The retail giant has challenged the structure of the National Labor Relations Board in court. Amazon accused the federal agency of tampering in the 2022 union election at the Staten Island warehouse, in part by bringing a lawsuit against the company to reinstate a fired organizer close to when voting began.",

      "Sheinbaum said Mexico has agreed to \"reinforce\" the Mexico-U.S. border with 10,000 National Guard troops \"immediately.\" She also said the U.S. had agreed to work to prevent high-powered weapons from being trafficked into Mexico.",

      "Sheinbaum, who took over as Mexican president in October 2024, said Trump asked her how long she would like the tariffs on Mexico to be paused, and she responded \"forever,\" before Trump suggested they pause them for a month.",
      "\"He insisted on the commercial deficit that the U.S. has with Mexico. I told him it was not a deficit, that we are commercial partners, and it's the best way to compete with China and other countries,\" Sheinbaum said.",

      "'This measure of 25% tariffs has effects for both countries but it has very serious effects for the U.S. economy,\" she said, \"because it will raise the costs of all the products that are exported from Mexico to the U.S., it will have a 25% higher cost.\"",
      "Trudeau responded to the planned tariffs on Saturday evening, announcing his country will implement 25% tariffs on 155 billion Canadian dollars, or about $107 billion, of U.S. goods. The prime minister said he has not talked to Trump since his inauguration.",
      "Sheinbaum, who was elected in June, offered little detail on how her government's \"Plan B\" would respond to the tariffs.",
      "She instructed her economic secretary to \"implement Plan B that we have been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,\" she said in a statement written in Spanish and translated by ABC News.",
      "She also sought to remind the White House that the current free trade agreements between the U.S. and Mexico have been in place for about three decades.",
      "\"The last free trade agreement was signed by President L\u00f3pez Obrador and President Trump himself,\" she said.",
      "Trump on Sunday told reporters he was unconcerned about the potential impact of imposing tariffs on close trading partners, saying the American people would understand.",
      "\"We may have short term, some, a little pain, and people understand that, but, long term, the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world,\" he told reporters on Sunday, as he departed Air Force One at Maryland's Joint Base Andrews.",
      "He added, \"We have deficits with almost every country, not every country, but almost. And we're going to change it. It's been unfair. That's why we owe $36 trillion; we have deficits with everybody.\"",

      "The demand for access to the payment system reportedly caused such a rift inside the Treasury Department that the career official who previously oversaw it, David Lebryk, was placed on administrative leave last week after he resisted granting Musk and his government efficiency team access to the database.",
      "On Friday, Lebryk told colleagues at the department he would be retiring, sources told ABC News.",
      "If Musk or his team were to attempt to block these payments, it would likely face legal challenges given the money is approved by Congress.",
      "Sources said that if Musk or his representatives were to request that changes be made to the system, such requests would be subject to an internal review process by Treasury Department officials.",
      "In a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said that any \"politically-motivated meddling\" in the payment systems \"risks severe damage to our country and the economy.\"",
      "\"To put it bluntly, these payment systems simply cannot fail, and any politically-motivated meddling in them risks severe damage to our country and the economy. I am deeply concerned that following the federal grant and loan freeze earlier this week, these officials associated with Musk may have intended to access these payment systems to illegally withhold payments to any number of programs,\" Wyden wrote in a Friday evening letter.",
      "\"I can think of no good reason why political operators who have demonstrated a blatant disregard for the law would need access to these sensitive, missioncritical systems,\" Wyden wrote.",
      "Spokespeople for DOGE, the White House and Treasury didn't respond to a request for comment.",

      "Darren Beattie is the acting under secretary in a top State Department role.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration is filling one of the State Department\u2019s top positions with a controversial conservative journalist who has promoted conspiracy theories related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and was fired as a speechwriter by the first Trump administration when it was revealed that he had spoken at a conference tied to White nationalists, sources familiar with the move told ABC News.",
      "The sources said that the man, Darren Beattie, will now be the acting Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, a so-called \u201cTop 10\u201d position that, as the State Department\u2019s website describes it, \u201cleads America\u2019s public diplomacy outreach, which includes messaging to counter terrorism and violent extremism.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Under Secretary oversees the bureaus of Educational and Cultural Affairs and Global Public Affairs, and participates in foreign policy development,\u201d the website adds.",
      "Beattie is slated to start in the position on Monday, sources said. He was already serving in another senior role within the State Department, but the new move to such a high-level position has raised concerns among many of its employees, sources said.",
      "More than two years ago, Beattie launched a right-wing media outlet called Revolver News, which has raised funds in part by selling pro-Trump apparel and merchandise.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s OK to deny 2020,\u201d reads two shirts still being sold on the outlet\u2019s website. Another shirt promotes the refuted claim that Jan. 6, 2021, was an \"FBI setup to frame Trump supporters as insurrectionists,\" as the shirt says.",
      "And Beattie has become a frequent guest on other right-wing media, often promoting conspiracy theories related to Jan. 6.",
      "On Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s podcast last month, Beattie repeated his claims that the FBI knows who\u2019s behind the pipe bombs left at DNC and RNC offices on Jan. 6 but \u201cwhat they found out was profoundly embarrassing to the government and to the narrative that the Biden regime wanted to promote, and so instead of following that investigation further, they basically just killed it,\u201d Beattie said.",
      "Beattie also claimed that surveillance video released by the FBI to seek help in identifying the perpetrator was \u201cclearly tampered with.\u201d",
      "In mid-August 2018, he made national headlines, with the Washington Post reporting then that he \u201cwas terminated last week after revelations that he had spoken at a conference attended by well-known white nationalists\u201d two years earlier.",
      "According to the Washington Post, Beattie \u2013 who is Jewish \u2013 insisted that he was not racist and said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIn 2016 I attended the [H.L. Mencken Club] conference in question and delivered a stand-alone, academic talk titled \u2018The Intelligentsia and the Right.\u2019 I said nothing objectionable and stand by my remarks completely,\" the statement said. \"It was the honor of my life to serve in the Trump Administration. I love President Trump, who is a fearless American hero, and continue to support him one hundred percent.\u201d",
      "At the end of the Trump administration, in November 2020, the Trump White House appointed Beattie to a three-year term with the Commission for the Preservation of America\u2019s Heritage Abroad, which helps preserve sites related to the Holocaust.",
      "The Anti-Defamation League strongly objected to the appointment, issuing a statement at the time saying, \u201cIt is absolutely outrageous that someone who has consorted with racists would even be considered for a position on a commission devoted to preserving Holocaust memorials in Europe.\u201d",
      "The New York Times then asked Beattie for comment, and he told the paper: \u201cThe ADL pretends to be an organization that protects Jews, but it really exists to protect Democrats. As a Jewish Trump supporter, I consider it an honor to be attacked by the far-left ADL and its disgraced leader, Jonathan Greenblatt.\u201d",
      "Asked about Beattie\u2019s new position at the State Department, a White House spokesperson referred ABC News to the State Department. First reached on Friday, the State Department has so far not commented.",
      "On Sunday, Beattie did not immediately respond to a request for comment by ABC News."

      "WASHINGTON -- From an ice cream parlor in California to a medical supply business in North Carolina to a T-shirt vendor outside Detroit, U.S. businesses are bracing to take a hit from the taxes President Donald Trump imposed Saturday on imports from Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 America\u2019s three biggest trading partners.",
      "The levies \u2014 25% on Canadian and Mexican and 10% on Chinese goods \u2013 will take effect Tuesday. Canadian energy, including oil, natural gas and electricity, will be taxed at a lower 10% rate.",
      "Mexico\u2019s president immediately ordered retaliatory tariffs and Canada\u2019s prime minister said the country would put matching 25% tariffs on up to $155 billion in U.S. imports. China did not immediately respond to Trump\u2019s action.",
      "The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates that Trump's tariffs would cost the average American household $1,000 to $1,200 in annual purchasing power.",
      "Gregory Daco, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm EY, calculates that the tariffs would increase inflation, which was running at a 2.9% annual rate in December, by 0.4 percentage points this year. Daco also projects that the U.S. economy, which grew 2.8% last year, would fall by 1.5% this year and 2.1% in 2026 \u201cas higher import costs dampen consumer spending and business investment.\u2019\u2019",
      "The Penny Ice Creamery in Santa Cruz, California, has had to hike prices of its ice cream \u2014 including popular flavors \u201cstrawberry pink peppercorn\u2019\u2019 and \u201cchocolate caramel sea salt\u2019\u2019 \u2014 repeatedly in recent years as an inflationary surge increased the cost of its supplies.",
      "\u201cI feel bad about always having to raise prices,\u2019\u2019 said co-owner Zach Davis. \u201cWe were looking forward to inflation coming down, the economy stabilizing in 2025 ... Now with the tariffs, we may be back at it again.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump tariffs, Davis said, threaten to drive up the cost of the mostly made-in-China refrigerators, freezers and blenders he\u2019ll need if Penny Ice Creamery goes ahead with plans to add to its six shops. He still has painful memories of the extra equipment costs the company had to absorb when Trump slapped massive tariffs on China during his first term.",
      "The new tariffs will also raise the price of a customer favorite \u2014 sprinkles \u2014 which Penny Ice Creamery imports from a company in Whitby, Ontario. Tacking a 25% import tax on even something as small as that can damage a small business like his.",
      "\u201cThe margins are so slim,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBeing able to offer that add-on can maybe generate an additional 10 cents in profit per scoop. If a tariff wipes that out, that can really be the difference between being profitable and being break-even and even being underwater by the end of the year.\u2019\u2019",
      "In Asheville, North Carolina, Casey Hite, CEO of Aeroflow Health, expects to take a hit because his company gets more than half its supplies \u2014 including breast pumps \u2014 from Chinese manufacturers, providing them to American patients through insurance plans. Aeroflow Health gets paid by insurers at pre-negotiated rates, put in place before Trump decided on his tariffs.",
      "Hite said the tax on Chinese imports would hit the company\u2019s finances, forcing it either to purchase cheaper and lower-quality products or pass higher costs along via higher health insurance premiums. Those might take two years to materialize, Hite said, but eventually they would hit consumers\u2019 budgets.",
      "\u201cIt will impact the patients,\u201d Hite said. \u201cIn time, patients pay more for the products.\u201d",
      "Even the made-in-USA absorbent incontinence pads Aeroflow Health buys aren\u2019t safe from Trump\u2019s import taxes. They may include pulp from tariff target Canada and plastics and packaging from China, according to the Aeroflow Health, which warns of \u201cturbulences\u201d from the tariffs.",
      "\u201cIs this going to affect our business? You bet it is,\u2019\u2019 said Linda Schlesinger-Wagner, who owns skinnytees, a women\u2019s apparel company in Birmingham, Michigan, north of Detroit, that imports clothing from China. She said the 10% tax would increase her costs, though she plans to absorb the extra expense instead of passing it along to customers.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like what\u2019s going on,\u2019\u2019 she said, referring to the broader impact of the tariffs. \u201cAnd I think people are going to be truly shocked at the pricing they\u2019re going to see on the cars, on the lumber, on the clothes, on the food. This is going to be a mess.\u2019\u2019",
      "William Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that many companies that stocked up on imported goods ahead of time to avoid the tariffs. They will be able to draw on their piled-up inventories for weeks or a couple of months, delaying their customers\u2019 pain.",
      "George Carrillo, CEO of the Hispanic Construction Council, an industry advocacy group, said construction companies have been hoarding materials in anticipation of Trump\u2019s actions, but he worries about the possibility of inflation spiking in three to six months.",
      "\u201cOnce that inventory starts to get low, we\u2019re going to start feeling the effects,\u201d Carillo said in a phone interview Saturday, ahead of the announcement. \u201cDevelopers and general contractors need to keep up with the pace and they\u2019re going to start buying more products and it\u2019s going to be at a higher price point.\u201d",
      "All that will be exacerbated by an emerging immigration crackdown that is already spooking the construction industry\u2019s labor pool, he said.",
      "\u201cYou put tariffs and you put workforce instability, it\u2019s going to create major delays in projects. It\u2019s going to create an increase in prices because of the lack of availability,\u201d Carrillo said.",
      "Then there are the industries that don't have the luxury of stockpiling, including supermarkets whose farm products will spoil. So the tariff impact will show up on grocery shelves within days.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t stockpile avocados,\u2019\u2019 Reinsch said. \u201cYou don\u2019t stockpile cut flowers. You don\u2019t stockpile bananas.\u2019\u2019",
      "In the tomato trading hub of Nogales, Arizona, produce vendor Rod Sbragia, who followed his father into the business nearly four decades ago, worries that the import levies will force some distribution companies out of business and \u201cwould be detrimental to the American consumer, to the choices they have at the supermarket.\u201d",
      "Sbragia voted for Trump in the past three elections and calls himself a \u201cstaunch Republican.\u201d The president, he said, must not have been properly advised on the matter.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re worried about cost to consumers, inflationary pressures and the overall health of our population,\u2019\u2019 he asked, \u201cwhy are we going to make it more difficult to get access to fresh fruits and vegetables?\u201d",
      "American farmers are also likely to get caught in Trump\u2019s trade tussle with Canada, China and Mexico. The president\u2019s supporters in rural America make a tempting target for retaliatory tariffs. That is what happened in Trump\u2019s first term when other countries, notably China, slapped back against the president\u2019s tariffs with levies of their own on things like soybeans and pork. In response, Trump spent billions in taxpayer money to compensate them for lost sales and lower prices.",
      "Many farmers are now counting on the president to come through and protect them from reprisals.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration provided a safety net,\u201d said former tobacco grower Lee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, a collection of 700 farms that lawfully brings in foreign temporary laborers to work the fields through a federal visa program. Many of the association's farmers \u201ctrust him that he\u2019s going to take care of anybody who\u2019s hurt by the tariffs, and that\u2019s really all that we can ask for.\u201d",

      "The tariffs are expected to be implemented on Tuesday but Hillman said her government is continuing to discuss the situation with the Trump administration.",
      "\"We're hopeful that they don't come into effect on Tuesday,\" she said. \"We're ready to continue to talk to the Trump administration about that, and in particular about all the work that we're doing with them and on our own, with respect to the border.\"",
      "Hillman said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Trump discussed Canada's plan to meet some of his demands, although not recently, and discussions between the two governments are continuing.",
      "\"Not in recent days, but they have discussed it, and we've discussed it with senior members of the White House as well, and we've laid out our plan, and my understanding is that the plan and some of the actual outcomes, results of what we have done, have been presented to the president,\" she said.",
      "Trudeau responded to the tariffs on Saturday evening, announcing his country will implement 25% tariffs on $155 billion Canadian dollars (about $107 billion U.S. dollars) of U.S. goods. The prime minister said he has not talked to Trump since his inauguration.",
      "Hillman said the proposed tariff's are \"disrupting an incredibly successful trading relationship.\"",
      "\"The Canadian people are going to expect that our government stands firm and stands up for itself,\" she said. \"I don't think we're not at all interested in escalating, but I think that there will be a very strong demand on our government to make sure that we stand up for the deal that we have struck with the with the United States.\"",
      "\"They just don\u2019t understand where this is coming from, and probably there's a little bit of hurt,\" she added.",
      "The U.S. and Canada have always had a \"sense of common purpose,\" Hillman said, and Trump's actions constitute a significant heel turn.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 09:22:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Marco Rubio is set to embark on his first diplomatic mission abroad since being confirmed to his post, visiting five countries in Central and South America.",
    "story": [
      "The trip is Rubio's first as America's top diplomat.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to embark on his first diplomatic mission abroad since being confirmed to his post, visiting five countries in Central and South America over the first week of February.",
      "During the trip, Rubio is expected to reinforce the Trump administration's immigration priorities with leaders in the region, according to a senior official, who said the secretary is also planning to address Beijing's influence during several of the stops.",
      "The State Department is also billing Rubio's trip as historic -- saying his six-day journey to Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic marks the first time a U.S. secretary of state has opted to make his or her first official visit to Latin America in over 100 years.",
      "\"This is where we live\"",
      "In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Rubio said the trip is part of a realignment of American diplomatic priorities.",
      "\"For many reasons, U.S. foreign policy has long focused on other regions while overlooking our own. As a result, we've let problems fester, missed opportunities and neglected partners,\" he said. \"That ends now.\"",
      "State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said the region's proximity to the United States was an important factor in selecting it for Rubio's first trip.",
      "\"The fact of the matter is, this is where we live. This is who we are,\" she said. \"This is about not just wanting to have new partnerships -- but that's always good -- but the nature of what it means to have an extended relationship with the people closest to you.\"",
      "Those relationships are vital for fulfilling the Trump administration's border security and deportation plans, Rubio noted.",
      "\"Diplomacy's role in this effort is central. We need to work with countries of origin to halt and deter further migrant flows, and to accept the return of their citizens present in the U.S. illegally,\" he said.",
      "Cooperation and coercion",
      "However, the countries on his itinerary have largely been very cooperative with the administration so far, as other countries in the region Rubio will skip over remain hesitant to comply.",
      "Guatemala, for instance, has accepted hundreds of migrants brought to the country on military planes since Trump took office, and the country's leadership has signaled it is open to accepting deportees of other nationalities.",
      "Meanwhile, Mexico, which is traditionally the U.S.' most important partner in handling illegal immigration, has been much more tentative.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum originally said the country wouldn't accept migrants from other countries, but she quietly reversed course in late January when she revealed Mexico had accepted over 4,000 deportees and that while \"the large majority\" was Mexican, others were not.",
      "Mexico has also so far refused requests from the U.S. to allow military flights carrying deportees to land in the country, according to officials from both countries.",
      "Honduras has posed another challenge to the administration's agenda. According to data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the end of 2024, Hondurans made up the largest share of the population in the deportation pipeline. But ahead of Trump's inauguration, the president of Honduras threatened to expel members of the U.S. military stationed in the country in response to mass deportations of Honduran nationals.",
      "However, Honduran authorities have signaled the country's position may be softening. The country's foreign minister wrote on X that the government is in the process of launching a program to support returning migrants called \"Brother, Come Home.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also had some early success in overtly pressuring countries to acquiesce. His threatened trade war against Colombia prompted its government to allow military deportation flights to land on its territory.",
      "\"It sends a message that this administration, President Trump, Secretary Rubio -- they mean what they say,\" said Mauricio Claver-Carone, special envoy for Latin America.",
      "Claver-Carone also suggested the Trump administration would use gentler diplomatic tactics as well, saying that during Rubio's trip, he will attempt to lay the groundwork for a program to repatriate migrants travelling through Central America with the government of Costa Rica.",
      "He also addressed Richard Grenell's visit to Venezuela to meet with strongman Nicolas Maduro on Friday.",
      "\"President Trump expects Nicolas Maduro to take back all of the Venezuelan criminals and gang members that have been exported to United States and to do so unequivocally and without condition,\" he said, adding that Grenell, the envoy for special missions, will also urge Maduro to release American hostages held in the country.",
      "A \"direct threat\" from China",
      "Beyond immigration, Claver-Carone said Beijing's growing influence in Central America will also be top of mind for Rubio through much of the trip, but it is expected to take center stage during the secretary's first stop in Panama.",
      "Trump has lodged a litany of complaints related to Panama's operation of the canal that cuts through the country -- claiming that American vessels are overcharged, lamenting that the U.S. ceded control of the vital waterway in the first place and promising \"we're taking it back\" during his inaugural address.",
      "Rubio has taken a more measured approach in discussing the Panama Canal while also underscoring that what he says are Trump's legitimate concerns about the waterway -- especially when it comes to companies controlled by Beijing located on each end of it.",
      "\"If the government in China in a conflict tells them to shut down the Panama Canal, they will have to,\" Rubio said in an interview on Thursday. \"That is a direct threat.\"",
      "Rubio continued to say it is a dynamic that cannot be allowed to continue.",
      "\"It is not in the national interest of the United States to have a canal we paid for and we built used as a leverage and a weapon against us. That can't happen,\" he said.",
      "But ahead of Rubio's visit, Panama President Jose Raul Mulino said handing back control of the canal isn't a thought he can entertain.",
      "\"It's impossible,\" Mulino said during a press conference on Thursday. \"I cannot negotiate, and much less open, a process of negotiation over the canal. That's sealed. The canal belongs to Panama.\"",

      "Kennedy had planned to earn referral fees in a lawsuit over the HPV vaccine.",
      "After a bruising round of confirmation hearings this week that left Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation in doubt, the nominee for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services declared in a written statement to senators on Friday that, if confirmed, he will divest his financial stake in an ongoing civil lawsuit against a vaccine manufacturer.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s commitment to walk away from the potential windfall is a major reversal for the nominee, who in his ethics plan submitted to federal officials earlier this month told lawmakers he was entitled to those proceeds so long as the U.S. government wasn\u2019t involved.",
      "Democrats had seized on Kennedy\u2019s financial stake in the lawsuit, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., warning that he could use his perch in government to make it easier for lawyers \u2013 including himself \u2013 to sue vaccine manufacturers and drug makers in court.",
      "The lawsuit alleges marketing fraud against pharmaceutical company Merck for its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, which Merck denies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains that the vaccine has been proven safe, with more than 160 studies finding no concerns.",
      "\u201cKennedy can kill off access to vaccines and make millions of dollars while he does it,\u201d Warren said at Kennedy\u2019s confirmation hearing on Wednesday.",

      "The next day, Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy said he was \u201cstruggling\u201d with Kennedy\u2019s nomination, noting at one point that Kennedy was \u201cfinancially vested in finding fault with vaccines.\u201d",
      "Kennedy told senators in his testimony Thursday that he was giving away his rights to the fees in the lawsuit against Merck. However, it was unclear whether he misspoke because his ethics agreement still maintained that he was entitled to the fees.",
      "In written answers provided to the Senate Finance Committee on Friday, Kennedy clarified that an amendment was forthcoming.",
      "\u201cAn amendment to my Ethics Agreement is in process, and it provides that I will divest my interest in this litigation,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy has earned millions of dollars in referral fees from law firms in the past for lawsuits unrelated to vaccines, including one involving a pesticide. He had not earned money yet from the Merck case, which only recently was taken up in civil courts.",
      "In his testimony, Kennedy said he wanted to retain the right to sue drug companies even if confirmed.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to not sue drug companies, and I am not going to agree to that,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Eight senior FBI executive were also to be terminated, per an email.",
      "The Justice Department, under leadership appointed by the Trump administration, has asked for information about potentially thousands of FBI employees across the country who were involved in work related to investigations stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and a Hamas-related case filed last year in New York.",
      "According an email sent to the FBI workforce late Friday, and obtained by ABC News, the requested information is to be provided by Tuesday afternoon to the office of the acting Deputy Attorney General, Emil Bove, whose office will then conduct a review to determine if any \"personnel actions\" are warranted.",
      "\"We understand that this request encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have supported these investigative efforts,\" the email from acting FBI director Brian Driscoll said. \"I am one of those employees, as is [the] acting Deputy Director.\"",
      "It's unclear why Bove is interested in the Hamas-related case.",
      "\"As we've said since the moment we agreed to take on these roles, we are going to follow the law, follow FBI policy, and do what's in the best interest of the workforce and the American people \u2014 always,\" Driscoll's email said.",
      "The email noted that eight senior FBI executive were also to be terminated, as directed by Bove.",
      "Earlier Friday, several sources told ABC New that the Trump administration is compiling a list of agents and other FBI officials from around the country who they believe should be fired or forced to resign in the coming days, several sources told ABC News.",
      "Firings were expected to begin as early as Friday, but a list was expected to be finalized on Monday, sources said.",
      "The list of those who could be fired includes the heads of dozens of field offices across the country and could include scores of agents in the FBI's Washington, D.C., Field Office alone, sources said.",
      "An FBI spokesperson said in a statement to ABC: \"The FBI is declining to comment on any questions regarding FBI personnel matters. We have also instructed the public affairs officers in our field offices to decline to comment as well.\"",
      "Trump's nominee for FBI director, Kash Patel, was pressed Thursday during his confirmation hearing as to whether FBI agents who worked on Smith's investigations would be protected from \"retribution,\" should he be confirmed.",
      "\"Every FBI employee will be held to the absolute same standard, and no one will be terminated for cases,\" Patel said. \"All FBI employees will be protected against political retribution.\"",
      "The FBI Agents Association said the actions \"contradict the commitments\" Patel made to the association ahead of his Senate confirmation hearing, saying Patel said FBI agents \"would be afforded appropriate process and review and not face retribution based solely on the cases to which they were assigned.\"",
      "\"If true, these outrageous actions by acting officials are fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI Agents,\" the FBI Agents Association added in a statement. \"Dismissing potentially hundreds of Agents would severely weaken the Bureau's ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the Bureau and its new leadership for failure.\"",
      "Separately, about 40 prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia who had previously worked on Jan. 6 cases were also dismissed Friday by acting U.S. Attorney Ed Martin, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to ABC News.",
      "The prosecutors who were dismissed had been hired to permanent career posts after serving in the office on a temporary detail, but they remained on probationary status -- which cleared the way for their firings under DOJ policy, the sources said.",
      "In the Oval Office later Friday, Trump was asked by reporters about Justice Department employees who may be fired or forced out in the coming days and he appeared to indicate it could be a \"good thing.\"",
      "\"If they fired some people over there, that's a good thing because they were very bad,\" Trump said. \"They used the Justice Department to correct their political opponents, which in itself is illegal.\"",
      "Asked if he specifically requested any action, Trump denied, \"No, but we have some very bad people over there. It was weaponized at a level that nobody's ever seen before.\"",
      "In a Friday statement, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the potential firing of agents en masse \"deeply alarming.\"",
      "\"At a time when we are facing a multitude of threats to the homeland -- from terrorism and espionage to drug trafficking and Salt Typhoon -- it is deeply alarming that the Trump administration appears to be purging dozens of the most experienced agents who are our nation's first line of defense,\" he said.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, called the dismissal of FBI and DOJ officials a \"major blow to the FBI and Justice Department\u2019s integrity and effectiveness\" in a statement Friday night.",
      "\"President Trump would rather have the FBI and DOJ full of blind admirers and loyalists than experienced law enforcement officers,\" Durbin said.",

      "The White House's Office of Personnel Management had told government workers in an email Tuesday that if they quit by Feb. 6, they would still get paid through Sept. 30.",
      "Employment lawyers questioned whether such an offer was lawful because Congress, not the White House, is responsible for authorizing workers' paychecks. Many agencies are expected to run out of money this spring, with the federal government only funded through March, raising questions about how the Trump administration can promise those who take the buyouts would still get paid if the executive branch doesn't control spending.",
      "Many federal workers also wondered whether the memo, titled \"A Fork in the Road,\" was a phishing scam, prompting OPM to release a new memo assuring workers they are \"most welcome [to] stay at home and relax or to travel to your dream destination. Whatever you would like.\"",
      "On Friday morning, senior officials at the various agencies sent memos to staffers assuring them the offers were indeed real.",
      "\"On behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), I am informing you that the offer is valid, lawful, and will be honored by USDA,\" said one such memo signed by Kailee Tkacz Buller, chief of staff at the Department of Agriculture.",
      "\"If you accept the deferred resignation offer, you will receive pay and benefits through September 30, 2025, and will not be subject to a reduction-in-force or other premature separation,\" she wrote.",
      "However, Max Alonzo, the national secretary-treasurer for the National Federation of Federal Employees, a labor union that represents 110,000 federal workers, said his union is advising federal workers not to respond to the email.",
      "In part, he said, the union is worried about the lack of clarity and specifics in the offer email. He pointed to the lack of a contract and the fact that Congress has not allocated funds for large-scale federal buyouts, and he worried people might offer to resign but not actually be paid in the end or may have their benefits stripped.",
      "\"Absolutely do not resign. There is nothing that says that the day that you resign, that they can't just let you go,\" he said. \"They don't have to pay you -- there's nothing that says they have to pay you till Sept. 30. This is nothing that has been done before. This is not in our regulations. There's no regs about it. We're not even sure if it's actually legal. So, yeah, absolutely do not resign.\"",
      "The buyout offers come as President Donald Trump has pushed for federal employees to return to working in person, signing an executive order on his first day in office calling for an end to teleworking.",
      "However, the email went to many workers across the country who never had telework agreements, including firefighters with the U.S. Forest Service and nurses at hospitals with the Department of Veterans Affairs, and many remain skeptical about the intention of the offer and ramifications for those who reply.",
      "Asked about the buyout offers in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump was blunt, saying, \"We'd love to have them leave.\"",
      "\"We're trying to reduce government,\" Trump added, noting that he didn't know how many people had taken the offer but that it would become clear on Feb. 6, when the offer expires.",
      "\"Nobody knows how that's going to turn out,\" Trump said. \"Everybody's replaceable, and we'll get very good people to replace them if it turns out to be more than we thought it could be.\"",

      "Top White House policy adviser Stephen Miller and staff secretary Will Scharf were among those who had been left out of the review process, sources said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Just a day before President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China go into effect, the world is bracing for the possible impacts. There is uncertainty about whether a deal could be reached or whether the tariffs are a harbinger of a broader trade war as Trump has promised more import taxes to come.",
      "Trump posted on social media that he spoke Monday morning with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and would \u201cbe speaking to him again at 3:00 P.M.\u201d The U.S. president has said he also would talk Monday with his counterpart in Mexico. Both Canada and Mexico are about to levy their own tariffs in response to U.S. actions.",
      "Trump used his Monday social media post to repeat his complaints that Canada has been uncooperative, despite decades of friendship and partnerships that range from World War II to the response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States.",
      "\u201cCanada doesn\u2019t even allow U.S. Banks to open or do business there,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cWhat\u2019s that all about? Many such things, but it\u2019s also a DRUG WAR, and hundreds of thousands of people have died in the U.S. from drugs pouring through the Borders of Mexico and Canada.\u201d",
      "Financial markets, businesses and consumers are braced for the impact of the new tariffs that also include an import tax against China. Stock market indices were set for a modest selloff, suggesting some hope that the import taxes that could push up inflation and disrupt global trade and growth would be short-lived.",
      "But the outlook reflected a deep uncertainty about a Republican president who has talked with adoration about tariffs, even saying the U.S. government made a mistake in 1913 by switching to income taxes as its primary revenue source. Trump said Sunday the tariffs would lift if Canada and Mexico did more to crack down on illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling, though there are no clear benchmarks. Trump also said the U.S. can no longer run a trade imbalance with its two largest trade partners.",
      "Mexico is facing a 25% tariff, while Canada would be charged 25% on its imports to the United States and 10% on its energy products. China is facing a 10% additional tariff due to its role in the making and selling of fentanyl, the Trump White House said.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Monday that it was misleading to characterize the showdown as a trade war despite the planned retaliations and risk of escalation.",
      "\u201cRead the executive order where President Trump was absolutely, 100% clear that this is not a trade war,\u201d Hassett said. \u201cThis is a drug war.\"",
      "But even if the orders are focused on illegal drugs, Trump's own remarks have often been more about his perceived sense that foreign countries are ripping off the United States by running trade surpluses. On Sunday, Trump said that tariffs would be coming soon on countries in the European Union. He has discussed tariffs as both a diplomatic tool on national security issues, a way to raise revenues and a vehicle for renegotiating existing trade pacts.",
      "Multiple economists outside the administration have warned that the tariffs would push up prices and hamper growth, with Trump himself saying there would be some short term pain after having campaigned last year on the promise that he could tame inflation.",
      "Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the consultancy RSM, said the United States was unlikely to fall into a recession this year, but the tariffs would hurt growth and push up the cost of government borrowing, which would potentially keep the interest rates charged on mortgages and auto loans elevated.",
      "\u201cIf there is no resolution, the impact on the U.S. economy will be significant,\u201d he said. \u201cGrowth will slow notably from the 2.9% average over the past three years as inflation and interest rates rise. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, currently around 4.5%, could climb to a range between 4.75% and 5%.\u201d"

      "\u2014 Saints executives were so involved in the church\u2019s damage control that a team spokesman briefed his boss on a 2018 call with the city\u2019s top prosecutor hours before the church released a list of clergymen accused of abuse. The call, the spokesman said, \u201callowed us to take certain people off\u201d the list.",
      "\u2014 Team officials were among the first people outside the church to view that list, a carefully curated, yet undercounted roster of suspected pedophiles. The disclosure of those names invited civil claims against the church and drew attention from federal and state law enforcement.",
      "\u2014 The team\u2019s president, Dennis Lauscha, drafted more than a dozen questions that Archbishop Gregory Aymond should be prepared to answer as he faced reporters.",
      "\u2014 The Saints\u2019 senior vice president of communications, Greg Bensel, provided fly-on-the-wall updates to Lauscha about local media interviews, suggesting church and team leaders were all on the same team. \u201cHe is doing well,\u201d Bensel wrote as the archbishop told reporters the church was committed to addressing the crisis. \u201cThat is our message,\u201d Bensel added, \u201cthat we will not stop here today.\u201d",
      "The emails obtained by AP sharply undercut assurances the Saints gave fans about the public relations guidance five years ago when they asserted they had provided only \u201cminimal\u201d assistance to the church. The team went to court to keep its internal emails secret.",
      "\u201cThis is disgusting,\u201d said state Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans. \u201cAs a New Orleans resident, taxpayer and Catholic, it doesn\u2019t make any sense to me why the Saints would go to these lengths to protect grown men who raped children. All of them should have been just as horrified at the allegations.\u201d",
      "The Saints told AP last week that the partnership is a thing of the past. The emails cover a yearlong period ending in July 2019, when they were subpoenaed by attorneys for victims of a priest later charged with raping an 8-year-old boy.",
      "In a lengthy statement, the team criticized the media for using \u201cleaked emails for the purpose of misconstruing a well-intended effort.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo member of the Saints organization condones or wants to cover up the abuse that occurred in the Archdiocese of New Orleans,\" the team said. \"That abuse occurred is a terrible fact.\u201d",
      "The team's response did little to quell the anger of survivors of clergy sexual abuse. \u201cWe felt betrayed by the organization,\u201d said Kevin Bourgeois, a former Saints season ticket holder who was abused by a priest in the 1980s. \u201cIt forces me to question what other secrets are being withheld. I\u2019m angry, hurt and re-traumatized again.\u201d",
      "After the AP first reported on the alliance in early 2020, Saints owner Gayle Benson denied that anyone \u201cassociated with our organizations made recommendations or had input\u201d on the list of pedophile priests.",
      "The Saints reiterated that denial in its statement Saturday, saying no Saints employees \u201chad any responsibility for adding or removing any names from that list.\u201d The team said that no employees offered \"any input, suggestions or opinions as to who should be included or omitted from\u201d the list.",
      "Leon Cannizzaro, the district attorney at the time, last week denied any role in shaping the credibly accused clergy list, echoing statements he made in 2020. He told AP he \u201cabsolutely had no involvement in removing any names from any list.\" Cannizzaro said he did not know why the Saints' spokesman would have reported he had been on a call related to the list.",
      "The emails, sent from Saints accounts, don\u2019t specify which clergymen were removed from the list or why. They raise fresh questions, however, about the Saints\u2019 role in a scandal that has taken on much larger legal and financial stakes since the team waded into it, potentially in violation of the NFL\u2019s policy against conduct \u201cdetrimental to the league.\u201d",
      "The outsized role of Saints executives could draw new attention from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who is scheduled to address reporters Monday as New Orleans prepares to host its 11th Super Bowl. Messages requesting comment were sent to the NFL.",
      "Taken together, the emails portray a coalescing of several New Orleans institutions. U.S. District Court Judge Jay Zainey, who was copied by the Saints on the public relations efforts, cheered Bensel on from his personal email account, thanking the team\u2019s spokesman \u201cfor the wonderful advice.\u201d A newspaper editor similarly thanked Bensel for getting involved.",
      "\u201cYou have hit all the points,\u201d Zainey, a fellow Catholic, wrote in another email to Bensel, praising a lengthy note the Saints spokesman sent to local newspaper editors. \u201cBy his example and leadership, Archbishop Aymond, our shepherd, will continue to lead our Church in the right direction \u2014 helping us to learn and to rebuild from the mistakes of the past.\u201d",
      "Zainey later struck down a Louisiana law, vigorously opposed by the church, that would have allowed victims to bring civil claims irrespective of how long ago the alleged sex abuse took place. He declined to comment.",
      "The list marked a watershed in heavily Catholic New Orleans \u2014 a long-awaited mea culpa to parishioners intended to usher in healing and local accountability. It came at a time when church leaders were seeking to retain public trust \u2014 and financial support \u2014 as they reckoned with generations of abuse and mounting litigation that eventually drove the Archdiocese of New Orleans into bankruptcy.",
      "That litigation, filed in 2020, involves more than 600 people who say they were abused by clergy. The case has produced a trove of still-secret church records said to document years of abuse claims and a pattern of church leaders transferring clergy without reporting their crimes to law enforcement.",
      "While it has since expanded, the list of accused priests was missing a number of clergy when it was originally released, an earlier AP investigation found.",
      "The AP identified 20 clergymen who had been accused in lawsuits or charged by law enforcement with child sexual abuse who were inexplicably omitted from the New Orleans list \u2014 including two who were charged and convicted of crimes.",
      "Still, the list has served as a roadmap for both the FBI and Louisiana State Police, which launched sweeping investigations into New Orleans church leaders\u2019 shielding of predatory priests.",
      "Last spring, state police carried out a wide-ranging search warrant at the Archdiocese of New Orleans, seizing records that include communications with the Vatican.",
      "Since the Saints began assisting the archdiocese, at least seven current and former members of the local clergy have been charged with crimes ranging from rape to possession of child pornography.",
      "The extent of the abuse remained largely unknown in 2018, a year the Saints won nine consecutive games on the way to an NFC Championship appearance. As the church prepped for a media onslaught, Bensel carried out an aggressive public relations campaign in which he called in favors, prepared talking points and leaned on long-time media contacts to support the church through a \u201csoon-to-be-messy\u201d time.",
      "Far from freelancing, Bensel had the Saints\u2019 backing and blessing through what he called a \u201cGalileo moment,\u201d suggesting Aymond would be a trailblazer in releasing a credibly accused clergy list at a critical time for the church. In emails to editorial boards, he warned against \u201ccasting a critical eye\u201d on the archbishop \u201cis neither beneficial nor right.\u201d",
      "He urged the city's newspapers to \u201cwork with\u201d the church, reminding them the Saints and New Orleans Pelicans \u2014 the city's NBA team, also owned by Benson \u2014 had been successful thanks, in part, to their support.",
      "\u201cWe did this because we had buy-in from YOU,\" Bensel wrote to the editors of The Times-Picayune and New Orleans Advocate, \u201csupporting our mission to be the best, to make New Orleans and everything within her bounds the best.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are sitting on that opportunity now with the Archdiocese of New Orleans,\" he added. \"We need to tell the story of how this Archbishop is leading us out of this mess.\u201d",
      "Benson and Aymond, the archbishop, have been confidants for years. It was the archbishop who introduced Benson to her late husband, Tom Benson, who died in 2018, leaving his widow in control of New Orleans\u2019 NFL and NBA franchises.",
      "The Bensons\u2019 foundation has given tens of millions of dollars to the archdiocese and other Catholic causes. Along the way, Aymond has flown on the owner\u2019s private jet and become almost a part of the team, frequently celebrating pregame Masses.",
      "When the clergy abuse allegations came to a head, Bensel, the Saints' spokesman, worked his contacts in the local media to help shape the story. He had friendly email exchanges with a Times-Picayune columnist who praised the archbishop for releasing the clergy list. He also asked the newspaper\u2019s leadership to keep their communications \u201cconfidential, not for publication nor to share with others.\u201d",
      "His emails revealed that The Advocate \u2013 after Aymond privately complained to the publisher \u2014 removed a notice from one online article that had called for clergy abuse victims to reach out.",
      "Kevin Hall, president and publisher of Georges Media, which owns the newspaper, said the publication welcomes engagement from community leaders but that outreach \"does not dilute our journalistic standards or keep us from pursuing the truth.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo one gets preferential treatment in our coverage of the news,\" he said in a statement. \u201cOver the past six years, we have consistently published in-depth stories highlighting the ongoing serious issues surrounding the archdiocese sex abuse crisis, as well as investigative reports on this matter by WWL-TV and by The Associated Press.\u201d",
      "It was The Advocate\u2019s reporting that prompted Bensel to help the church, the emails show. He first offered to \u201cchat crisis communications\u201d with church leaders after the newspaper exposed a scandal involving a disgraced deacon, George Brignac, who remained a lay minister even after the archdiocese settled claims he raped an 8-year-old altar boy.",
      "\u201cWe have been through enough at Saints to be a help or sounding board,\u201d Bensel wrote, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to overstep!\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Justice Department has ordered a halt to programs that provide information and guidance to people in immigration proceedings",
      "Just days after President Donald Trump's second inauguration, Ruby Robinson went to Detroit's immigration court to post a notice that a help desk his organization ran for people facing deportation was no longer available.",
      "The desk staffed by the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center shut down after a Trump executive order prompted the Justice Department to instruct nonprofit organizations \u201cto stop work immediately\u201d on four federally funded programs that provided information to people in immigration proceedings.",
      "\u201cThere were individuals in the waiting room who we otherwise would have been able to assist, but we're not able to do so at this time,\u201d said Robinson, managing attorney for the center, which he said has helped about 10,000 people since it began operating the help desk in December 2021.",
      "Without the programs that educate people in immigration courts and detention centers about their rights and the complicated legal process, many will end up navigating the system on their own. Advocates worry that due process and the backlogged immigration courts will suffer as Trump tries to make good on his campaign promise to crack down on illegal immigration.",
      "A coalition of nonprofit groups that provide the services filed a lawsuit Friday challenging the stop-work order and seeking to immediately restore access to the programs.",
      "Despite the loss of federal funding, staff from the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights went to a Virginia detention center to provide services the day after the Jan. 22 stop-work order. They had spoken to about two dozen people when detention center staff escorted them out, telling them they could no longer provide those services, Amica executive director Michael Lukens said, describing the stoppage as \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe often hear that people don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. Why are they detained? What\u2019s going to happen next? And we are being stopped from even giving that basic level of orientation,\u201d Lukens said.",
      "Lawyers running a help desk inside Chicago\u2019s busy immigration court provided services to more than 2,000 people in 2024. The National Immigrant Justice Center started the effort in 2013 with private funding and expanded it three years later with federal funds.",
      "Since the stop-work order, the organization has provided scaled-down services, but they are unsure how long they will be able to continue that with the gap left by federal funding cuts, spokesperson Tara Tidwell Cullen said.",
      "Several organizations said they\u2019ve been told that posters informing people of their services and information about legal help hotlines have been removed from detention centers.",
      "Congress allocates $29 million a year for the four programs \u2014 the Legal Orientation Program, the Immigration Court Helpdesk, the Family Group Legal Orientation and the Counsel for Children Initiative \u2014 funding that's spread among various groups across the country providing the services, Lukens said, adding that the programs have broad bipartisan support. The amount is the same regardless of the number of people they're helping, and the organizations often do additional fundraising to cover their costs, he said.",
      "Trump previously targeted these programs during his first term, but this time things are different.",
      "In 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the funding would be pulled from the programs, but the threat of legal action by a coalition of organizations that provide the services, as well as bipartisan support from members of Congress, caused the Justice Department to reverse course.",
      "This time, the action was more abrupt, with the stop-work order issued just hours before it took effect and program staff being barred from detention centers.",
      "Immigration law is incredibly complicated and, unlike in criminal courts, people do not have a right to have an attorney appointed if they cannot afford one, and many end up going through the system without legal representation.",
      "Immigration courts throughout the country are clogged by a backlog of about 3.7 million cases, which can leave people in limbo for years. When people know what to expect and have their affairs in order, hearings move more quickly because judges don't have to explain the basics to each person who appears before them, advocates assert. It can also reduce lines at filing windows in immigration courts because people know what forms they have to fill out and can get help completing them correctly.",
      "People can make informed choices to either move forward with a case knowing their chances and the risks involved or, if they don't want to go through a court battle or don't see any available relief that fits their situation, they may decide not to fight and to just go home, said Edna Yang, co-executive director of American Gateways, which operates in three detention centers and the immigration court in San Antonio, Texas.",
      "\u201cStopping programs that actually help people get the information they need isn\u2019t going to fix the system,\u201d Yang said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to make it worse.\u201d",
      "The organizations also make sure due process rights are respected, alert people to imminent filing deadlines, ensure that translators are available and help avoid deportation orders that could unlawfully return asylum seekers to a harmful situation, advocates said.",
      "Milagro, a 69-year-old woman from Venezuela, arrived in the U.S. in May 2024 when she got an appointment through a U.S. government app after spending four years in Mexico. The Associated Press agreed not to use her last name because she fears that speaking out could affect her pending case.",
      "She filed an asylum application, citing a fear for her life in Venezuela as part of the political opposition. She didn\u2019t have a job when she arrived and used the help desk operated by Estrella del Paso at the immigration court in El Paso, Texas, for help with her asylum application. The last time she went, she discovered it was closed because of the stop-work order.",
      "\u201cYou feel a kind of frustration because the window that you had open to ask, to get advice, is closed,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cIt is a feeling of helplessness and loneliness.\u201d",
      "Without their help, she said, \u201cI would have had to pay money that I do not have.\u201d",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Jury selection begins Monday in the trial of the alleged ringleader of a scheme to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic that federal prosecutors say stole $250 million from a program meant to feed children, the latest chapter in a broader case that has also included an attempt to bribe a juror and political repercussions against Gov. Tim Walz.",
      "But the attorney for Aimee Bock, the founder of Feeding our Future \u2014 the group that prosecutors say was at the heart of the plot \u2014 insists that she\u2019s innocent.",
      "Bock and a co-defendant will be the second group to stand trial in what prosecutors call one of the country\u2019s largest COVID-19-related fraud cases anywhere. The first trial resulted in the conviction of five people last year and received widespread attention after some defendants and people linked with them allegedly tried \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash. The juror went straight to police instead.",
      "Bock is one of 70 defendants charged in the overall case. They're being tried in batches. Thirty of them have already pleaded guilty to various charges, including some who had been scheduled to go on trial with Bock this week. One defendant from the first trial was sentenced this month to 17 1/2 years, the longest prison term handed down in the case so far.",
      "Here's a look at a trial that's expected to last around six weeks:",
      "Federal prosecutors allege that the conspiracy revolved around two groups \u2014 Feeding Our Future and Partners in Nutrition \u2014 that were both small nonprofits that were approved as sponsors of the Federal Child Nutrition Program before the pandemic. But the two groups dramatically increased the number of meal sites that they claimed to be sponsoring during the pandemic. Feeding Our Future went from receiving and disbursing $3.4 million in federal funds in 2019 to nearly $200 million in 2021. Sites sponsored by Feeding Our Future falsely claimed to be serving thousands of children daily, prosecutors allege.",
      "\u201cIn all, Feeding Our Future fraudulently obtained and disbursed more than $240 million in Federal Child Nutrition Program funds during the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a preview of their case this month. The total included administrative fees to which Feeding Our Future was not entitled, they said.",
      "\u201cBock and other Feeding Our Future employees also solicited and received bribes and kickbacks from individuals and companies sponsored by Feeding Our Future,\u201d prosecutors continued. \u201cFeeding Our Future operated a pay-to-play scheme, where individuals seeking to operate fraudulent sites under the sponsorship of Feeding Our Future had to kick back a portion of their fraudulent proceeds to Feeding Our Future employees.\u201d",
      "Bock's attorney, Kenneth Udoibok, said they'll argue at trial that she's not guilty of the federal fraud, conspiracy and bribery charges against her.",
      "\u201cShe's innocent and she's going to express that belief, that truth, until the day she dies,\u201d Udoibok said in an interview last week. \u201cThis woman was hoodwinked, played by people she trusted. She trusted that these people that have pled guilty, she trusted them to have delivered food to needy children, needy people, deserving folks. And they played her.\u201d",
      "Udoibok said the large number of guilty pleas, and the fact that they're now down to just Bock and a co-defendant for this trial, doesn't change the defense strategy. He said the jury will be able to see the difference between her and the rest of the defendants despite the complexities of the overall case.",
      "\u201cShe accepted no bribes or kickbacks from anybody. She did not know that the invoices were fraudulent. She was focused on providing as much access to needy people as possible, that is, feeding adults and children during COVID and during the George Floyd protests,\u201d Udoibok said.",
      "An attorney for Bock's co-defendant, Salim Ahmed Said, did not return a call seeking comment on the case.",
      "Five people were charged with bribery because of the attempt in the first trial, including three who were on trial at the time. Two of the five have already pleaded guilty, while one more is scheduled to change his plea to guilty in the bribery case in March. U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger described the elaborate scheme as \u201csomething out of a mob movie.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel, who is overseeing Bock's trial, has ordered extra steps to shield the jurors' identities and prevent any further bribe attempts.",
      "The federal money flowed through the state Department of Education, and the loss of 250 million taxpayer dollars became a major political problem for Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. His administration largely blamed federal authorities, saying the FBI asked them not to cut off the flow of funds to protect its investigation. Walz's critics insist he should have done more. While Walz comfortably won reelection in 2022, the issue resurfaced after presidential candidate Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate.",
      "This year, Republicans in the closely divided Minnesota Legislature have made fighting fraud in government programs one of their top issues, and not just because of Feeding our Future. Walz himself has proposed his own anti-fraud package. But the 2025 legislative session is off to a contentious start and it's not clear yet if the sides can reach the bipartisan consensus that will be needed to pass anything.",

    "summary": "America&rsquo;s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
    "story": [
      "America\u2019s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
      "WEST ORANGE, N.J. -- Along the long road from American icon to endangered species and back again, the bald eagle \u2014 the national bird of the United States, often seen against a clear blue sky \u2014 is having a moment.",
      "The eagles find themselves in an environmental updraft of sorts since the early 2000's, when the federal government took the thriving birds off its endangered species list with more states following suit. Culturally, too, the animals are soaring.",
      "In December, Joe Biden signed legislation making the raptor the country's national bird (thought that was already the case? More in a bit). This month, New Jersey became the latest state to delist the bald eagle as endangered, citing a remarkable comeback for the creatures associated with strength and independence \u2014 and that occupied just a single nest in the state decades ago. And to the chagrin or elation of football fans, the Philadelphia Eagles will be vying for a championship in the Super Bowl this weekend.",
      "How did the storied birds find their way back? As with so many tales, it's complex.",
      "The story \u2014 there was a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the 1980s and roughly 300 now, for instance \u2014 centers on the banning of DDT, a chemical insecticide with environmental side effects that included thin-shelled eagle eggs. That touched off a cratering in the number of eagles across the country, and officials prohibited the pesticide in 1972.",
      "To rebuild the birds' numbers in their historic range across the country, conservationists imported birds from places where their populations were stable, including from Canada. Early on, they also removed eggs from nesting birds' nests, replacing them with artificial ones for the eagles to \u201cincubate\u201d while the real eggs were safely hatched outside the nest before being returned, as eaglets for their parents to raise according to Kathy Clark, the head of New Jersey's Endangered and Nongame Species Program.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that almost went extinct on our continent. And so I think now it\u2019s really important to make sure people know that story and learn from it,\u201d said Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation in Alaska.",
      "Clark, whose work with the birds spans decades and includes the period when their numbers were so small they lived only in a remote part of the state, said the eagles have taught officials a number of lessons. One is that they're \u201cfairly adaptable\" and now live across densely populated (with people) New Jersey \u2014 from suburban Bergen County near New York to the wetlands along the shore in the south.",
      "She recalled the story of one fledgling eagle in a suburban town \u2014 New York Giants territory, as it were, sorry, Eagles fans \u2014 that found itself on a backyard woodpile and walking around the street. Volunteer observers worried over the bird's well-being, given the realities of suburban living. But a year later, observers spotted the eagle, identified by a band. It had apparently made it.",
      "\u201cThose birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're Jersey birds. You got to have attitude, right?\u201d",
      "The birds do face dangers as they expand into suburbia, though. Jilian Fazio, director of the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo in suburban northern New Jersey, said the zoo rescues a number of birds hit by cars. One bird, a male named Freedom, perched atop a branch in his enclosure at the zoo recently and called out loudly. He was found dangling by a rope, left with an injury that renders him unreleasable, Fazio said.",
      "There are threats, as well. Habitat preservation and clean, open water, since the eagles feed heavily on fish, is a worry, but there's also the current outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu. Clark says officials are going to maintain surveillance amid the outbreak.",
      "Beyond the birds coming off endangered lists, they made headlines recently for finally getting their due as the county's national bird, an oversight left undone in law because the bald eagle was already on the national seal and many thought it already had that status, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who sponsored legislation that Biden signed last month.",
      "She and colleagues worked with Native American and veterans groups to get buy-in for the legislation, she said, and it passed the typically divisive House and Senate last year with no dissent. The birds are revered in a number of Native American cultures as symbols of strength, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, according to Paul Apodaca, a retired academic who specializes in folklore and mythology.",
      "The eagles' perch as symbols of the country contributes to their conservation, with experts considering them an \u201cumbrella species,\u201d whose need for large open spaces and waterways helps preserve lesser known wildlife.",
      "\u201cAmericans are always going to have that sort of personal relationship with bald eagles,\" Clark said.",
      "Experiencing seeing a bird in the wild or even as you're driving along a business-lined highway can leave an impression. Dan Day, a birder who's spotted bald eagles some 50 times in recent years both on nature walks and just driving around suburban New Jersey, remembered never having seen the birds as a kid growing up in Cleveland. Now a New Jersey resident and Philadelphia Eagles fan, he regularly goes out in his green \u201cBirds\u201d cap and binoculars.",
      "\u201cJust the mere thrill of seeing one \u2014 a lot of people just have never, ever looked at one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really elevates your day to see a bald eagle.\u201d",
      "Enjoy watching them, experts say, but give them space, too. Because rescuing animals threatened with extinction is expensive, uncertain work. Said Clark, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection official: \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever will lose that perspective of, of being on the brink there, not knowing if if you\u2019re going to be able to save the species.\""

      "North Korea has lashed out at U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio for calling it a \u201crogue\u201d state and warned that such remarks will never contribute to U.S. interests",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In its first direct criticism of the Trump administration, North Korea lashed out at U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio for calling it a \u201crogue\u201d state and warned Monday that such \u201ccoarse and nonsensical remarks\u201d will never contribute to U.S. interests.",
      "The statement is the latest in a series of North Korean signals that it will maintain its tough stance on the U.S. for now, though Trump has said he\u2019s intent on reaching out to its leader Kim Jong Un to revive diplomacy.",
      "\u201cThe hostile words and deeds of the person who is in charge of the U.S. foreign policy served as an occasion of confirming once again the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK which remains unchanged,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said, using the acronym of the country's official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.",
      "\u201cRubio\u2019s coarse and nonsensical remarks only show directly the incorrect view of the new U.S. administration on the DPRK and will never help promote the U.S. interests as he wishes,\u201d it said.",
      "The statement took issue with what the ministry called Rubio\u2019s branding of North Korea as a \u201crogue\u201d state in a media interview. It likely referred to Rubio\u2019s appearance on \u201cThe Megyn Kelly Show\u201d on Jan. 30, in which he called North Korea and Iran \u201crogue states\u201d as he addressed foreign policy challenges.",
      "It was not the first time for U.S. officials to describe North Korea as a rogue state. But the North\u2019s latest statement suggests the country won\u2019t likely quickly embrace Trump\u2019s overture.",
      "During a Fox News interview broadcast on Jan. 23, Trump called Kim \u201ca smart guy\u201d and \u201cnot a religious zealot.\u201d Asked whether he will reach out to Kim again, Trump replied, \u201cI will, yeah.\u201d",
      "Trump's comments raised prospects for a possible revival of diplomacy between the United States and North Korea, as Trump met Kim three times during his first term to discuss how to end Kim's nuclear program. Their earlier high-stakes diplomacy in 2018-19 broke down due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on North Korea, but Trump has still repeatedly boasted of his personal ties with Kim.",
      "North Korea hasn\u2019t directly responded to Trump\u2019s interview comments. But it has maintained its confrontational rhetoric against the U.S. and continued its weapons testing activities. Last week, Kim visited a facility to produce nuclear materials and called for boosting North Korea\u2019s nuclear capability in the face of what he called challenges posed by \u201chostile forces,\u201d an apparent reference to the U.S. and South Korea.",
      "Many experts say Kim likely thinks he now has greater leverage than before because of his expanded nuclear arsenal and deepening military ties with Russia.",
      "The previous diplomacy with Trump likely gave Kim a propaganda coup for winning the much-needed recognition of his government on the world stage. But the eventual collapse of diplomacy was still a huge embarrassment.",
      "Kim has since then focused on perfecting nuclear-capable missiles targeting the U.S. and South Korea.",
      "Last November, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington\u2019s \u201cunchangeable\u201d hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats. During a key political meeting in December, Kim vowed to implement the \u201ctoughest\u201d anti-U.S. policy.",

      "President Donald Trump says Americans could feel \u201csome pain\u201d from the emerging trade war triggered by his tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China",
      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Sunday that Americans could feel \u201csome pain\u201d from the emerging trade war triggered by his tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China, and claimed that Canada would \u201ccease to exist\u201d without its trade surplus with the United States.",
      "The trade penalties that Trump signed Saturday at his Florida resort caused a mix of panic, anger and uncertainty, and threatened to rupture a decades-old partnership on trade in North America while further straining relations with China. But by following through on a campaign pledge, Trump may have simultaneously broken his promise to voters in last year's election that his administration could quickly reduce inflation.",
      "\u201cWILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cBUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\u201d",
      "His administration has not said how high that price could be or what improvements would need to be seen in stopping illegal immigration and the smuggling of fentanyl to merit the removal of the tariffs that Trump imposed under the legal justification of an economic emergency. The tariffs are set to launch Tuesday.",
      "In his Truth Social post, Trump took particular aim at Canada, which responded with retaliatory measures. Trump is placing a 25% tariff on Canadian goods, with a 10% tax on oil, natural gas and electricity. Canada is imposing 25% tariffs on more than $155 billion on U.S. products, including alcohol and fruit.",
      "Trump railed against Canada's trade surplus with the United States: \u201cWe don\u2019t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use.\u201d",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s claim that the U.S does not need Canada, one-quarter of the oil that the America consumes per day is from its ally to the north.",
      "Trump contended that without that surplus, \"Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada \u2014 AND NO TARIFFS!\u201d",
      "Canada\u2019s ambassador to Washington has said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year, but noted that one-third of what Canada sells into the U.S. is energy exports and that there is a deficit when oil prices are high. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is encouraging Canadians to buy more Canadian goods, and says Trump's moves will only cause pain across North America. More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt is going to have real consequences for people, for workers on both sides of our border,\" Trudeau said Saturday night. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be here. We didn\u2019t ask for this but we will not back down in standing up both for Canadians and for the incredible successful relationship between Canada and the United States.\u201d",
      "Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, also announced new tariffs and suggested the U.S. should do more within its own borders to address drug addiction.",
      "The Chinese government said it would take steps to defend its economic interests and intends to file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization.",
      "For Trump, the open question is whether inflation could be a political pressure point that would cause him to back down. As a candidate, Trump repeatedly hammered Democrats over the inflation under President Joe Biden that resulted from supply chain issues during the coronavirus pandemic, the Biden administration\u2019s own spending to spur the recovery and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Trump said his previous four years as president had low inflation, so the public should expect the same if he came back to the White House. But he also said specifically that higher inflation would stagger the U.S. as a nation, a position from which he now appears to be retreating with the tariffs.",
      "\u201cInflation is a disaster,\u201d he said at a Philadelphia campaign rally. \u201cIt\u2019s a country-buster. It\u2019s a total country-buster.\u201d",
      "Outside analyses make clear that Trump's tariffs would hurt the voters that he intended to help, meaning that he might ultimately need to find a resolution.",
      "An analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale shows, if the tariffs were to continue, an average U.S. household would lose roughly $1,245 in income this year, in what would be the overall equivalent of a more than $1.4 trillion tax increase over the next 10 years.",
      "Goldman Sachs, in a Sunday analyst note, stressed that the tariffs go into effect on Tuesday, which means they're likely to proceed \u201cthough a last-minute compromise cannot be completely ruled out.\u201d",
      "The investment bank concluded that because of the possible economic damage and possible conditions for removal that \u201cwe think it is more likely that the tariffs will be temporary but the outlook is unclear.\u201d",

      "ARLINGTON, Va. -- Families of victims of the deadliest U.S. air disaster in nearly 25 years visited the crash site Sunday just outside Washington, D.C.",
      "Dozens of people walked along the banks of the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport, close to where an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided Wednesday, killing all 67 aboard.",
      "They arrived in buses with a police escort, memorializing loved ones as federal investigators work to piece together the events that led to the crash and recovery crews were set to pull more wreckage from the chilly water.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Sunday said he wanted to leave federal aviation investigators space to conduct their inquiry.",
      "But he posed a range of questions about the crash while appearing on morning TV news programs.",
      "\u201cWhat was happening inside the towers? Were they understaffed? \u2026 The position of the Black Hawk, the elevation of the Black Hawk, were the pilots of the Black Hawk wearing night vision goggles?\u201d Duffy asked on CNN.",
      "The American Airlines flight, with 64 people on board was preparing to land from Wichita, Kansas. The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a training mission and had three soldiers on board. Both aircraft plunged to the Potomac River after colliding.",
      "The plane\u2019s passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip.",
      "Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O\u2019Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Cpt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were killed in the helicopter.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said Saturday that preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the airliner and the Army helicopter.",
      "Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet\u2019s flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.",
      "Data from the jet\u2019s flight recorder showed its altitude as 325 feet (99 meters), plus or minus 25 feet (7.6 meters), when the crash happened Wednesday night, NTSB officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the Black Hawk at 200 feet (61 meters), the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in the area.",
      "The discrepancy has yet to be explained.",
      "Investigators said they hoped to reconcile the difference with data from the helicopter\u2019s black box, which is taking more time to retrieve because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the Potomac. They also said they plan to refine the tower data, which can be less reliable.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what our job is, to figure that out,\u201d NTSB member Todd Inman said.",
      "\u201cThis is a complex investigation,\u201d investigator in charge Brice Banning said. \u201cThere are a lot of pieces here. Our team is working hard to gather this data.\u201d",
      "Banning said the jet\u2019s cockpit voice recorder captured sound moments before the crash.",
      "\u201cThe crew had a verbal reaction,\u201d Banning said, and the flight data recorder showed \u201cthe airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of impact were audible about one second later, followed by the end of the recording.\u201d",
      "Full NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.",
      "Inman said he spent hours meeting with victims\u2019 families since the crash. The families are struggling, Inman said.",
      "\u201cSome wanted to give us hugs. Some are just mad and angry,\u201d Inman said. \u201cThey are just all hurt. And they still want answers, and we want to give them answers.\u201d",
      "The remains of 42 people had been pulled from the river as of Saturday afternoon, including 38 that have been positively identified, officials said. They expect to recover all of the remains, though the plane\u2019s fuselage will probably have to be pulled from the water to get the rest.",
      "More than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a given time, officials said. Two Navy salvage barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage.",
      "On Fox News Sunday, Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration was looking into staffing in the Reagan Airport control tower.",
      "Investigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller, a supervisor and supervisor in training.",
      "According to an FAA report obtained by The Associated Press, one controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically combines them at 9:30 p.m., once traffic slows down. On Wednesday, the tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called \u201cnot normal.\u201d",
      "\u201cStaffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem for years and years,\u201d Duffy said, promising that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration would address shortages with \u201cbright, smart, brilliant people in towers controlling airspace.\u201d",
      "With the nation already grieving, an air ambulance crashed in Philadelphia on Friday, killing all six people on board, including a child returning home to Mexico from treatment, and at least one person on the ground.",
      "Also Friday, the FAA heavily restricted helicopter traffic around Reagan National, hours after Trump claimed on social media that the Army helicopter had been flying higher than allowed.",
      "\u201cIt was far above the 200-foot limit. That\u2019s not really too complicated to understand, is it???\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. The crash killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground.",
      "Experts regularly highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots.",

      "Punxsutawney Phil's team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck's weather verdict as the sun rises on Sunday, telling the world whether he is predicting wintry conditions for the next six weeks or the relief of an early spring.",
      "The annual ritual goes back more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in European folklore, but it took Bill Murray's 1993 movie to transform it into what it is today, with tens of thousands of revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States and beyond.",
      "Last year's crowd may have been a record and organizers are bracing for a similar turnout on Sunday.",
      "If the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club members declare Phil did not see his shadow, that is said to usher in an early spring. If he does see it, it's six more weeks of winter, although what that means can be subjective.",
      "Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less than half the time.",
      "Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler's Knob: the faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to confirm their skepticism.",
      "Phil communicates his forecast through \u201cGroundhog-ese\u201d with the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club's leader. It's not as if he speaks in English words.",

      "Attendance is free but it costs $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction is made, some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh. The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.",
      "A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split time between Gobbler's Knob and Phil's longtime home at the town library. The club also is putting up large video screens and more powerful speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the proceedings.",
      "\"It\u2019s a holiday where you don\u2019t really owe anyone anything,\u201d said A.J. Dereume, who among the club's 15-member inner circle serves as Phil's handler. \u201cYou\u2019re grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that\u2019s just fun to believe in.\u201d",
      "Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring, Shadow and Sunny, although his family won't join him on stage for the big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily visits from Dereume and see a veterinarian at least once a year.",

      "\u201cThere's only one Phil, and it's not something that can be handed down,\u201d Dunkel said. \u201cJust like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, there's only one.\u201d",
      "Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, are being held in many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces."

      "Independent journalists live outside the mainstream and their numbers are growing",
      "First word of the Trump administration's since-rescinded order to freeze spending on federal loans and grants came not from a major news organization, but from a woman working alone in her Brooklyn apartment.",
      "Marisa Kabas' scoop this past week was a key moment for a growing cadre of journalists who work independently to gather and analyze news and market themselves as brands. Many are refugees from legacy outlets while others are scrappy newcomers like Kabas, who found traditional career paths unappealing or out of reach.",
      "\u201cThis week has been career-changing,\u201d Kabas said in an interview. \u201cIn a sense, my job has changed overnight.\u201d",
      "She was sitting at her kitchen table last Monday, sifting through emails on her laptop, when a source forwarded her a copy of a memo announcing the freeze sent by the Office of Management and Budget's acting director. Kabas has her own website, the Handbasket, but to give the story wider visibility, she posted a screen shot of the memo on the social media site Bluesky.",
      "Then she waited.",
      "Her stomach was in knots. She calmed herself with a walk on a frigid night. Despite her belief in independent journalism \u2014 and her own work \u2014 she recognized that to many, news only becomes \u201creal\u201d when it appears in a major outlet. Three hours later, The Washington Post published its story, with a hat-tip to Kabas.",
      "The directive caused such an uproar that the administration walked back its order two days later.",
      "Kabas, 37, kicked around in various journalism and publicist jobs and freelanced for outlets like MSNBC.com, the Huffington Post and New Republic. She started her website in 2022 primarily for personal writing and decided to go \u201call in\u201d with journalism the next year.",
      "The advantage to going it alone is that \u201cI get to write about things that I care about,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't have to work on assignments that are given to me that I don't care about.\u201d The down side is she's all alone, dependent upon her own hustle.",
      "Kabas wrote on ex-congressman George Santos, the raid on a weekly newspaper in Kansas and Elon Musk, although much of her writing was essays instead of reported work.",
      "Like many in the independent journalism world, she doesn't hide her opinions. She wrote that the OMB memo was \"a truly unhinged document that sounds like it was written by the world's most petty 4Chan poster.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe's got attitude, she's got personality,\u201d said Greg Munno, a journalism professor at Syracuse University. \u201cI think attitude and personality help these independent journalists connect with readers and potentially sources.\u201d",
      "A wide variety of independent journalists have made their mark, often working on publishing platforms like Substack and Beehiiv.",
      "Seamus Hughes' Court Watch pulls together interesting legal documents from around the country. Heather Cox Richardson's Letters From an American explores the intersection of history and today's politics. Peter Geoghegan's Democracy for Sale investigates money in politics.",
      "Casey Newton, a former editor at The Verge, looks at the tech world on Platformer, and this past week urged people worried about the A.I. company DeepSeek to take \u201ca few long, deep breaths.\u201d Molly Knight's The Long Game writes smartly about sports and even admits to her clunkers, like recently revisiting her prediction that the Texas Rangers would repeat as American League champions.",
      "Oliver Darcy left CNN to break news and offer commentary about the media on his own site, Status. Two former Washington Post journalists have set up their own shops: opinion writer Jennifer Rubin's site, The Contrarian, boasts the tagline \u201cNot owned by anybody,\u201d and tech writer Taylor Lorenz's User Mag broke its own news last week on conservative influencer Candace Owens' new venture.",
      "Days ago, CNN anchor Jim Acosta announced he was setting up shop at Substack after quitting the network rather than accept a transfer to a middle-of-the-night time slot.",
      "\u201cIndependent journalism is now the way forward,\u201d Dan Rather, the former CBS News anchor and perhaps quintessential old-school journalist, posted on Facebook Thursday. \u201cSadly, we can no longer rely on legacy media to hold the powerful accountable.\u201d",
      "Expand the definition of independent journalist more broadly, and you can include the exploding world of podcasts, many of which played a key role in the presidential election, and TikTok or YouTube influencers who comment on the news.",
      "The more that traditional news outlets shrink or die, \u201csomething is going to fill that gap,\u201d said Jeremy Littau, a Lehigh University journalism professor. \u201cThere is going to be a need for it.\u201d",
      "It's exciting for those who seek variety and new voices, particularly with legacy media lagging in public esteem. The danger comes in figuring out who to trust in a world where a single person often performs the role of reporter, editor, sales person and business manager.",
      "That's particularly important with breaking news, Littau said. Who is out there cutting corners, or repackaging things they see online without the standards that a traditional news organization imposes?",
      "Munno is skeptical about how much support there is in the marketplace.",
      "\u201cI don't think the consumer's appetite for news is high enough to support a really deep pool of independent journalists that would be able to create an audience and make a living,\u201d he said.",
      "Kabas cobbled together what she considered a typical journalist's living \u2014 translation: modest \u2014 before this past week. Her earnings through the Handbasket come through subscribers who pay $8 a month or $80 annually. This week alone, she jumped from 800 paid subscribers to about 1,500.",
      "Her scoop is making her rethink the purpose of her work, that now the pressing need is to report deeply on how the country is changing as the result of its new government. She's even thinking of hiring another reporter to help.",
      "\u201cI've gone from very much taking my time, sitting with my thoughts and writing from a personal perspective to being a breaking news reporter,\u201d Kabas said. \u201cThey are very different skills.\u201d",

      "The City of New Orleans says it has spent more than 18 months preparing to host its 11th Super Bowl on Feb. 9",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- After a New Year's Day attack struck at the heart of the French Quarter, officials in New Orleans say they are confident in the security plans they have in place for the Super Bowl.",
      "Upwards of 125,000 visitors are expected to converge on the Big Easy beginning Feb. 5 for parties, concerts and revelry featuring artists including Post Malone and Diplo and capped off by the Feb. 9 clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at the Caesars Superdome stadium to crown this season's NFL champion.",
      "Following the truck-ramming attack early on Jan. 1 that killed 14 people and injured dozens more along Bourbon Street, one of the city's most famous thoroughfares, alleged security lapses triggered multiple lawsuits and investigations. But the city, the NFL and law enforcement officials insist that after more than a year of preparations they are ready to play host.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going above and beyond what we\u2019ve seen in the past when we\u2019ve hosted previously,\u201d Mayor LaToya Cantrell said at a news conference. \u201cWe know we\u2019re safer than we\u2019ve ever been before.\u201d",
      "Thousands of state, federal and local law enforcement officers will be on the ground during the Super Bowl, NFL Chief Security Officer Cathy Lanier said. But she and city officials remained tight-lipped about details.",
      "Drones will be prohibited around the Superdome and downtown New Orleans throughout the week of the game and there will be flight restrictions up to 18,000 feet (5,486 meters), according to the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "Armed federal air marshals will be stationed around the city's transportation hubs scanning for suspicious people or activities and guarding against drones, said Noel Curtin, supervisory air marshal in charge with the Transportation Security Administration.",
      "Super Bowl events will sprawl across neighborhoods far beyond the stadium, said the Homeland Security Department's Eric DeLaune, who is leading federal coordination of Super Bowl security.",
      "Federal agencies from the FBI to the Secret Service are bringing in rooftop snipers and BearCat armored SWAT vehicles around the stadium and across the city's historic French Quarter and downtown, DeLaune said.",
      "No one will be allowed inside the cordoned-off area surrounding the Superdome without credentials, and the city already has begun shutting down and limiting traffic on roads near the stadium, where the perimeter will include blast barriers requiring trucks to pass through giant X-ray machines typically used at border crossings, DeLaune said.",
      "Dozens of technicians and more than 100 bomb-sniffing dogs are engaging in a days-long effort to scour the 400,000 square feet (37,161 square meters) of the Superdome and each of its more than 70,000 seats prior to game day, DeLaune said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to go from top to bottom on that building to make sure it\u2019s clear and it\u2019s safe. They open every door, check under every seat,\u201d DeLaune said.",
      "Much of the security infrastructure will carry over to the Mardi Gras season, which has been upgraded to Homeland Security's highest risk rating to receive more manpower and resources.",
      "With the sheer amount of law enforcement on every street corner and security measures in place, \u201cNew Orleans will be the safest place to be anywhere in the country,\u201d said Phillip Constantin, an adviser with the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.",
      "Multiple lawsuits have claimed city authorities were aware of Bourbon Street's vulnerabilities to the kind of truck-ramming attack that the Islamic State group-inspired Shamsud-Din Jabbar carried out. He drove his F-150 around a police car parked as a makeshift barricade and plowed into pedestrians before he crashed and was killed by police.",
      "The bollard system of steel columns installed to block vehicle traffic, which was being replaced at the entrance to Bourbon Street at the time of the attack, remains on track for completion before the Super Bowl, officials said.",
      "Authorities say they have brought in more types of physical barriers to protect entry points resulting from concerns that the new bollard system was not strong enough to block vehicle attacks.",
      "The NFL and federal and city agencies have \u201cput a fresh set of eyes\u201d on their plans post-Jan. 1, DeLaune said, noting the New Orleans Police Department hired former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton and his team from high-profile security firm Teneo.",
      "\u201cNo specific or credible threats\u201d have surfaced targeting the Super Bowl, NFL security chief Lanier said Wednesday.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry announced the creation of an \u201cenhanced security zone\u201d along Bourbon Street to bookend Super Bowl weekend and said he would deploy 350 national guardsmen.",
      "After authorities found Jabbar had planted ice chests containing undetonated improvised explosive devices around the French Quarter, Landry declared a ban on coolers and ice chests in these areas and ordered mandatory searches of bags for anyone entering Bourbon Street zone during the Super Bowl weekend.",
      "But in accordance with state law, firearms including permitless concealed carry guns will be allowed on Bourbon Street, Louisiana State Police Sgt. Katharine Stegall said, noting they remained banned from bars.",
      "Landry also ordered the removal of multiple homeless encampments near the stadium and funneled dozens of unhoused people into a temporary warehouse shelter.",
      "The Superdome\u2019s owner, ASM Global, has contracted New York-based artificial intelligence firm Dataminr to monitor potential and emerging threats in real time.",
      "The company will draw from over 1 million sources of public data across 150 languages, from social media to dark web forums to traffic cameras, Dataminr Chief Security Officer Robert Crowley said.",
      "Dataminr uses generative AI to produce memos alerting Superdome officials of trending patterns, such as an influx of posts showing swelling crowds or other public disturbances as they unfold.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s stitching together all these little pieces of the puzzle to get a holistic, comprehensive view of what has just happened,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cThe faster you know what is occurring, the quicker you can take better action.\u201d",

      "Women represent half of the U.S. population",
      "JACKSON, Miss. -- Women represent half of the U.S. population but it's still rare for them to have leading roles in setting taxes or budgets in some states.",
      "Take Mississippi, for example. Only one woman currently serves on the 14-member Joint Legislative Budget Committee. The elite group makes the first recommendations on how much money the state should spend on schools, prisons, Medicaid and other programs, giving these lawmakers substantial influence over their colleagues and over the lives of people who use government services.",
      "Second-term Sen. Nicole Akins Boyd was appointed to the committee by Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, a fellow Republican who said he did not consider whether to choose a balance of men and women.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t look at it so much like, \u2018We need a woman here,\u2019 or something like that,\" Hosemann said. \"I look at the abilities and there are plenty of people that have great abilities, male and female. Nicole Boyd, I believe, is outstanding.\u201d",
      "Just over 2,400 women are serving in state legislatures across the U.S., or about 33% of the total, according to the Center for American Women and Politics, at Rutgers University. Almost 1,600 are Democrats, just over 800 are Republicans and the others are nonpartisan or independent.",
      "Last year, when 31% of state lawmakers nationwide were women, they held about 30% of the seats on committees overseeing taxes, revenues and other financial matters, according to a review by The Associated Press.",
      "But participation varies widely by state, and by session. In Utah, women held only 5% of those seats in 2024. This year, they hold 28%. In Nevada, 62% of finance-related seats were held by women when the Legislature last met in 2023.",
      "Jean Sinzdak, associate director of The Center for American Women and Politics, notes that people who serve in legislatures for a long time tend to receive the most desired committee assignments.",
      "\u201cAnything budget- and appropriations-related is always one at the top,\u201d Sinzdak said. \u201cAnd so part of the challenge of getting more women is that women haven\u2019t been serving as long and in the numbers needed.\u201d",
      "Mississippi has the third-lowest percentage of women in its legislature, at 15%, according to the center. The only states behind it are South Carolina, with 13%, and West Virginia, with 11%.",
      "All together, women hold just over 11% of seats on Mississippi\u2019s five money committees: Joint Legislative Budget, House and Senate Appropriations, House Ways and Means and Senate Finance.",
      "Mississippi has never had a woman as governor or House speaker. Only two women have been elected lieutenant governor, decades ago. All of those roles are crucial to setting taxes and budgets.",
      "\u201cLook, I want to see more women there because I think we add to the conversation,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cWe work together differently, and I think those are all good things for the Legislature.\u201d",
      "For example, women in the Mississippi Legislature banded together in 2023 to secure money for evidence testing in rape cases when a backlog at the state crime lab was delaying trials.",
      "\u201cOur male colleagues supported us just as strongly,\u201d Boyd said.",
      "In West Virginia, Republican Delegate Kathie Hess Crouse said she believes women generally get the committee assignments they ask for. The low number of women on tax and budget committees is not only due to the fact that few serve in the legislature, but also because female lawmakers sometimes prioritize other committees, she said.",
      "That\u2019s the case for Hess Crouse, who chaired the House Committee on Workforce Development and served on other committees focusing on energy, manufacturing and government organization last year. She said legislative leadership has conversations with all the GOP lawmakers before the session starts and asks what their interests are. She always has received her top picks; it just so happens finance is not one of them.",
      "\u201cDo I like money? Yes,\u201d Crouse said. \u201cI do my home budget. I don\u2019t necessarily like it, but I do it. I file my own taxes normally. I work on those things, but it\u2019s not my main interest area. So do I want to serve on finance? No, I have interests elsewhere.\u201d",
      "The balance is different in Nevada, which in 2019 became the first state where a majority of legislators were women.",
      "That is reflected on key committees. Women have most of the seats on the Assembly\u2019s Revenue and Ways and Means committees. And they hold seven of eight seats on the Senate\u2019s finance committee, including the entire Democratic delegation on the committee.",
      "The chair, Sen. Marilyn Dondero Loop, said there could be areas, such as breast cancer funding, where female lawmakers might be more likely to put taxpayer money because of their personal connections to the issue. But she said she doesn\u2019t approach her work thinking about gender.",
      "\u201cWhenever I vote and my other colleagues vote,\u201d Dondero Loop said, \u201cwe do it solely as being a Nevadan and making things better.\u201d",
      "Elizabeth Steiner served as co-chair of the Oregon Legislature\u2019s Ways and Means Committee, which handles money matters and has members from the House and Senate, before being elected state treasurer last year. She said it's important for women's personal and professional life experiences to be brought into state decision-making.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t include 50% of the population, the perspective of 50% of the population in your decision-making, then you\u2019re really disadvantaging everybody: men and women, and certainly children,\u201d said Steiner, a Democrat.",
      "Other states also have women in prominent roles. In Alaska, a Republican woman was one of three co-chairs of the House Finance Committee last year. Connecticut has two Democratic women leading the Appropriations Committee and another co-chairing the Finance Committee. Vermont had two Democratic women in charge of the Appropriations committees for 2023-24.",
      "South Carolina has never had a woman chair a money committee. Three served on the 25-person House Ways and Means Committee in 2024.

      "In the heart of thriving Oklahoma City lies a more than 100-year-old relic to the city's western heritage: one of the largest cattle stockyards in the world",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- On the edge of a thriving downtown dotted with luxury hotels and trendy restaurants is a more than 100-year-old relic of Oklahoma City's western heritage: One of the world's largest cattle stockyards.",
      "But maybe not for much longer.",
      "The Oklahoma National Stockyards \u2014 the last big-city stockyard in the U.S. \u2014 is for sale. The $27 million price tag includes 100 acres (40 hectares) of prime property along the Oklahoma River in a growing city of roughly 700,000 residents, where a state-of-the-art NBA arena is set to break ground and a developer is pushing plans for the country's tallest skyscraper.",
      "Although the stockyard's owners are hopeful a buyer will keep the cattle coming, they acknowledge the land is attractive for redevelopment.",
      "The sale is a sign of the times for livestock auctions and America's cattle market, a volatile industry squeezed in recent years by drought, higher production costs and the lowest number of cattle in the U.S. since the 1950s.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on imported goods has created uncertainty in the industry, although the potential impact is not yet clear. The U.S. is the world's largest producer of beef but is still a net beef importer, with Canada and Mexico among the top countries accounting for U.S. beef imports.",
      "The number of cattle moving through the maze of wooden pens in Oklahoma City is down roughly 20% over the past two years, said Jerry Reynolds, the stockyard's president.",
      "The same family has owned the grounds since 1910, but Reynolds said younger generations of the owners are simply not interested in overseeing a major stockyard and the daily grind that entails: a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week operation with tens of thousands of animals auctioned every week and a seemingly endless maintenance to-do list.",
      "\u201cThe handwriting has kind of been on the wall for a long time, as the cities grow and surround these facilities,\u201d said Derrell Peel, a professor at Oklahoma State University who studies cattle markets. \u201cNot only is that a prime piece of real estate, but the increasing challenges, the environmental challenges, of operating a stockyard in a major city, is pretty tricky.\u201d",
      "The stockyard went on the market in October and the current owners do not have a timetable for completing the sale.",
      "As many as 10,000 head of cattle still rumble each week through the stockyard, an urban survivor in an industry that is largely now scattered across rural America. One of the largest stocker/feeder cattle markets in the world, the Oklahoma City grounds are the last of the so-called \u201cterminal markets\u201d that dotted the Midwest, where cattle were shipped, sold, slaughtered and then processed at nearby packing houses.",
      "In the mid-20th century, such stockyards thrived in bigger cities including Chicago, Kansas City, Omaha, Nebraska, and Fort Worth, Texas. But with the advent of refrigeration and the increasing value of those properties in urban centers, they slowly transitioned to more rural areas closer to feedlots and meatpacking plants, according to Peel, a professor of agricultural economics.",
      "If Oklahoma City's stockyard is shuttered, an auction market in Joplin, Missouri, would likely claim the title of the largest in the country, Peel said. That stockyard, a little more than 200 miles (320 kilometers) from Oklahoma City, as well as another large facility just west of the metro in El Reno, Oklahoma, would pick up much of the business, he said.",
      "\u201cAs a member of the family that began the yards and has been involved throughout our entire 115-year history, obviously I have some feelings about the outcome there,\" said Chris Bakwin, chairman of the stockyard's board and one of the major shareholders in the company founded by his great-grandfather. \u201cBut I have to do what\u2019s best for shareholders.\u201d",
      "The stockyard's pens are set up on the original bricks laid during its construction more than a century ago. From a metal catwalk that runs over the stockyard, visitors can hear the thundering sound of hoofs and the yells of cowboys on horseback leading them into pens or running a few at a time into a small, tightly packed arena where buyers signal their interest to a fast-talking auctioneer.",
      "On a recent January morning, rancher Garrison Duke, his wife Pamela, and their children, Pecos, 3, and 1-year-old Sterling, hauled a trailer full of cattle from their ranch in Lexington, on the outskirts of Oklahoma City.",
      "Duke was a boy when he first started going to the stockyard with his father and, on a good trip, they would leave town with a full stomach after a steak dinner and perhaps a new pair of boots.",

      "As crews work to clean up from the Los Angeles wildfires, city officials and residents are opposing the designation of a federally owned park to process hazardous waste",
      "DUARTE, Calif. -- Not far from where Ceci Carroll lives, a rock-mining company has polluted the air with dust across the San Gabriel Valley, she said.",
      "Now, as crews clean charred remains from the Los Angeles wildfires, she worries about a new potential source of contamination: a site to process hazardous debris from the Eaton Fire.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the community and also the school districts here, where we have children,\u201d said Carroll, a Duarte resident of 23 years and former local school board member.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with the site with the chemicals and hazardous materials,\" she said. \"Parents are absolutely concerned.\"",
      "Carroll is among residents from Duarte, Azusa and nearby cities opposing the Environmental Protection Agency's use of Lario Park in Irwindale as a temporary site to separate, package and transport potentially hazardous materials from the Eaton Fire.",
      "In ordinary times, people picnic, bike or ride horses on equestrian trails in the federally owned land. They now worry about dangerous waste that could pollute the air or seep into groundwater.",
      "The blazes that began on Jan. 7 charred thousands of buildings, cars and electronics across the Los Angeles area. The EPA has begun the enormous task of removing potentially hundreds of tons of hazardous materials from the Eaton and Palisades fires. That includes paints, pesticides, solvents, compressed gas cylinders, ammunition and lithium-ion batteries from electric cars that could turn toxic when burned.",
      "\u201cThe removal of these materials should not come at the cost of creating a toxic environment for communities already disproportionately impacted by pollution,\" Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said in a statement.",
      "The mostly Latino communities adjacent to the site are exposed to higher levels of ozone and particulate matter pollution than other areas, according to data from the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.",
      "Experts acknowledge residents' concerns, but say hazardous waste is not necessarily harmful as long as safety measures are in place and the waste is not stored on site for years.",
      "At a town hall Wednesday, California Sen. Susan Rubio and local mayors opposing the site grilled state and federal officials: How was the site chosen? Why weren't we consulted or notified? Why truck toxic waste 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the burn zone and risk contaminating our communities? What testing will be done after it's closed?",
      "Hundreds of residents crammed into the performing arts center and spilled into the hall. They shouted \u201cShut it down!\u201d and chanted \u201cLeave it in Altadena!\u201d",
      "EPA coordinator Tara Fitzgerald told the audience that sites closer to the Eaton burn zone were being used for emergency fire operations, including the Rose Bowl and the Santa Anita Park in Pasadena. They chose the Lario Park site because it suited their needs and was available.",
      "She emphasized the EPA has done this work for years across the state.",
      "\u201cWe did the exact same thing\" for the Woolsey, Santa Rosa and Napa fires, Fitzgerald said, and \"we did not have any impacts to the community during the entire process.\"",
      "But the Eaton and Palisades fires are unprecedented. Together, they torched the largest urban area on record in California, according to an Associated Press analysis, and more than double the urban acreage consumed by the 2018 Woolsey Fire.",
      "The EPA said it would regularly monitor air, sample soil, use water trucks to control dust and transport waste out of the area daily.",
      "The agency lines areas with plastic where materials are processed and uses wattles, earthen berms and other items to control spills. The waste will be transported on surface streets, not freeways, so trucks can travel at a slower and safer speed, the EPA\u2019s Celeste McCoy told the county Board of Supervisors. She said the site would likely be used less than six months, and more areas are being considered.",
      "With these protective measures, the risks of groundwater contamination, which takes a long time, are low, said Sanjay Mohanty, a UCLA associate professor who has studied wildfire effects on water and soil.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s several feet of soil that the pollutant has to pass through, and that also requires lots of water to leech from the system,\u201d Mohanty said. \"And even if there is leeching, they would not migrate far into the soil in a short time. \"",
      "The bigger risks are soil and air pollution from possible dust emissions, he added, but those too can be mitigated.",
      "Duarte resident Laura Jasso did not leave the meeting reassured and remained upset about the lack of transparency from state and federal officials.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to have confidence when they\u2019ve really done this behind our backs,\" she said.",
      "While crews continue their work, residents should be vigilant to what is happening at the site and ask how materials are being handled, about emergency response plans and truck routes and schedules, said Rachael Jones, professor and director of the UCLA Center for Occupational and Environmental Health.",
      "\u201cThe community has the right to know that information from the EPA and the Army Corps,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Jasso said her community is committed to holding the EPA accountable for ensuring safety.",
      "\u201cUltimately, we don\u2019t want it here, and we\u2019re going to continue to fight to not have it here,\u201d she said of the site. \u201cBut the fact is, it\u2019s here right now. And so we have to just acknowledge the safety of our students, the concerns of our families.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- From an ice cream parlor in California to a medical supply business in North Carolina to a T-shirt vendor outside Detroit, U.S. businesses are bracing to take a hit from the taxes President Donald Trump imposed Saturday on imports from Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 America\u2019s three biggest trading partners.",
      "The levies \u2014 25% on Canadian and Mexican and 10% on Chinese goods \u2013 will take effect Tuesday. Canadian energy, including oil, natural gas and electricity, will be taxed at a lower 10% rate.",
      "Mexico\u2019s president immediately ordered retaliatory tariffs and Canada\u2019s prime minister said the country would put matching 25% tariffs on up to $155 billion in U.S. imports. China did not immediately respond to Trump\u2019s action.",
      "The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates that Trump's tariffs would cost the average American household $1,000 to $1,200 in annual purchasing power.",
      "Gregory Daco, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm EY, calculates that the tariffs would increase inflation, which was running at a 2.9% annual rate in December, by 0.4 percentage points this year. Daco also projects that the U.S. economy, which grew 2.8% last year, would fall by 1.5% this year and 2.1% in 2026 \u201cas higher import costs dampen consumer spending and business investment.\u2019\u2019",
      "The Penny Ice Creamery in Santa Cruz, California, has had to hike prices of its ice cream \u2014 including popular flavors \u201cstrawberry pink peppercorn\u2019\u2019 and \u201cchocolate caramel sea salt\u2019\u2019 \u2014 repeatedly in recent years as an inflationary surge increased the cost of its supplies.",
      "\u201cI feel bad about always having to raise prices,\u2019\u2019 said co-owner Zach Davis. \u201cWe were looking forward to inflation coming down, the economy stabilizing in 2025 ... Now with the tariffs, we may be back at it again.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump tariffs, Davis said, threaten to drive up the cost of the mostly made-in-China refrigerators, freezers and blenders he\u2019ll need if Penny Ice Creamery goes ahead with plans to add to its six shops. He still has painful memories of the extra equipment costs the company had to absorb when Trump slapped massive tariffs on China during his first term.",
      "The new tariffs will also raise the price of a customer favorite \u2014 sprinkles \u2014 which Penny Ice Creamery imports from a company in Whitby, Ontario. Tacking a 25% import tax on even something as small as that can damage a small business like his.",
      "\u201cThe margins are so slim,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBeing able to offer that add-on can maybe generate an additional 10 cents in profit per scoop. If a tariff wipes that out, that can really be the difference between being profitable and being break-even and even being underwater by the end of the year.\u2019\u2019",
      "In Asheville, North Carolina, Casey Hite, CEO of Aeroflow Health, expects to take a hit because his company gets more than half its supplies \u2014 including breast pumps \u2014 from Chinese manufacturers, providing them to American patients through insurance plans. Aeroflow Health gets paid by insurers at pre-negotiated rates, put in place before Trump decided on his tariffs.",
      "Hite said the tax on Chinese imports would hit the company\u2019s finances, forcing it either to purchase cheaper and lower-quality products or pass higher costs along via higher health insurance premiums. Those might take two years to materialize, Hite said, but eventually they would hit consumers\u2019 budgets.",
      "\u201cIt will impact the patients,\u201d Hite said. \u201cIn time, patients pay more for the products.\u201d",
      "Even the made-in-USA absorbent incontinence pads Aeroflow Health buys aren\u2019t safe from Trump\u2019s import taxes. They may include pulp from tariff target Canada and plastics and packaging from China, according to the Aeroflow Health, which warns of \u201cturbulences\u201d from the tariffs.",
      "\u201cIs this going to affect our business? You bet it is,\u2019\u2019 said Linda Schlesinger-Wagner, who owns skinnytees, a women\u2019s apparel company in Birmingham, Michigan, north of Detroit, that imports clothing from China. She said the 10% tax would increase her costs, though she plans to absorb the extra expense instead of passing it along to customers.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like what\u2019s going on,\u2019\u2019 she said, referring to the broader impact of the tariffs. \u201cAnd I think people are going to be truly shocked at the pricing they\u2019re going to see on the cars, on the lumber, on the clothes, on the food. This is going to be a mess.\u2019\u2019",
      "William Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that many companies that stocked up on imported goods ahead of time to avoid the tariffs. They will be able to draw on their piled-up inventories for weeks or a couple of months, delaying their customers\u2019 pain.",
      "George Carrillo, CEO of the Hispanic Construction Council, an industry advocacy group, said construction companies have been hoarding materials in anticipation of Trump\u2019s actions, but he worries about the possibility of inflation spiking in three to six months.",
      "\u201cOnce that inventory starts to get low, we\u2019re going to start feeling the effects,\u201d Carillo said in a phone interview Saturday, ahead of the announcement. \u201cDevelopers and general contractors need to keep up with the pace and they\u2019re going to start buying more products and it\u2019s going to be at a higher price point.\u201d",
      "All that will be exacerbated by an emerging immigration crackdown that is already spooking the construction industry\u2019s labor pool, he said.",
      "\u201cYou put tariffs and you put workforce instability, it\u2019s going to create major delays in projects. It\u2019s going to create an increase in prices because of the lack of availability,\u201d Carrillo said.",
      "Then there are the industries that don't have the luxury of stockpiling, including supermarkets whose farm products will spoil. So the tariff impact will show up on grocery shelves within days.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t stockpile avocados,\u2019\u2019 Reinsch said. \u201cYou don\u2019t stockpile cut flowers. You don\u2019t stockpile bananas.\u2019\u2019",
      "In the tomato trading hub of Nogales, Arizona, produce vendor Rod Sbragia, who followed his father into the business nearly four decades ago, worries that the import levies will force some distribution companies out of business and \u201cwould be detrimental to the American consumer, to the choices they have at the supermarket.\u201d",
      "Sbragia voted for Trump in the past three elections and calls himself a \u201cstaunch Republican.\u201d The president, he said, must not have been properly advised on the matter.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re worried about cost to consumers, inflationary pressures and the overall health of our population,\u2019\u2019 he asked, \u201cwhy are we going to make it more difficult to get access to fresh fruits and vegetables?\u201d",
      "American farmers are also likely to get caught in Trump\u2019s trade tussle with Canada, China and Mexico. The president\u2019s supporters in rural America make a tempting target for retaliatory tariffs. That is what happened in Trump\u2019s first term when other countries, notably China, slapped back against the president\u2019s tariffs with levies of their own on things like soybeans and pork. In response, Trump spent billions in taxpayer money to compensate them for lost sales and lower prices.",
      "Many farmers are now counting on the president to come through and protect them from reprisals.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration provided a safety net,\u201d said former tobacco grower Lee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, a collection of 700 farms that lawfully brings in foreign temporary laborers to work the fields through a federal visa program. Many of the association's farmers \u201ctrust him that he\u2019s going to take care of anybody who\u2019s hurt by the tariffs, and that\u2019s really all that we can ask for.\u201d",

      "Patty Day, formerly employed by the Public Works Department, claimed in a lawsuit filed last May that she was the victim of excessive force and a wrongful arrest.

      "Trump says he wants to protect American industry, but many economists warn the taxes, which are still due to come into force on Canadian imports on Tuesday, could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US.",
      "That's because tariffs are paid by the domestic company importing the goods, who may choose to pass the cost on to customers directly, or to reduce imports, which would mean fewer products available.",
      "So what could get more expensive if Trump's tariff threats go ahead?",
      "Cars",
      "Cars are likely to go up in price - by about $3,000 according to TD Economics.",
      "That's because parts cross the US, Canadian and Mexican borders multiple times before a vehicle is assembled.",
      "As a result of higher taxes paid on the importing of parts to build the cars, it is likely the costs will be passed on to customers.",

      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but that are produced using inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",
      "Fuel prices",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November last year came from Canada.",
      "While 25% has been slapped on Canadian goods imported to the US, its energy faces a lower 10% tariff.",
      "Now the US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but the type its refineries are designed to process means it depends on so-called \"heavier\" - i.e. thicker - crude oil from mostly Canada and some from Mexico.",

      "The company is still considering whether to appeal against a decision by the water industry regulator Ofwat to increase bills by 35% above inflation over the next five years \u2013 short of the 53% increase it applied for.",

      "In the latest bid to survive, lenders have offered Thames a further loan of up to \u00a33bn in two instalments.",

      "Although Thames will not collapse immediately if the deal is not approved by the judge, insiders have acknowledged that the company will move a step closer to temporary nationalisation \u2013 a so-called Special Administration Regime \u2013 if it fails.",
      "The government has already sounded out a number of consultancies to take that on if the situation arises.",
      "The company has been keen to stress that whatever happens, its services to 16 million customers would continue uninterrupted, but big questions about the future of Thames and other key infrastructure providers have been thrown up.",
      "Some argue that Thames should be allowed to go bust and have the government take over the company due to it being the architect of its own misfortune. Previous owners loaded the company with debt, took out big dividends and paid executives handsomely. Caving in to its demands for customers to pay more now for a failing service would be a gross injustice.",
      "Others say that poor regulation has allowed this mess. Bills were kept too low for too long which hampered investment in the aging infrastructure that is now being overwhelmed by a wetter climate. Ofwat is fighting yesterday's battle and making things worse by imposing fines of tens of millions of pounds for failures, thus further depriving the company of the funds to fix the very things it is being fined for.",
      "What Thames and ministers both agree on is that neither want this sprawling company on the government's books. Consultancy Teneo has predicted a temporary nationalisation would cost up to \u00a32bn a year.",
      "However, a wider, perhaps more important argument made by some is that the failure of Thames as a private company would send an unhelpful message to the international investors that Chancellor Rachel Reeves hopes will invest hundreds of billions in UK airports, wind farms, rail links and everything else on her long shopping list of growth-boosting projects.",
      "Sources close to the company and its creditors argue that we cannot agonise over and regulate for past mistakes. We are where we are - between a rock and a hard place. Carve out a special deal for Thames - or risk its collapse.",
      "Thames has just over two weeks to appeal to the CMA to bump up the bills it's allowed to charge. It's not without risk - the CMA could revise them down.",
      "Last week, the chair of the CMA was forced out by ministers unimpressed by the regulator's focus on growth. Thames says it needs higher bills to invest \u00a320bn over the next five years. It will be an interesting test case for the new chair."

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has hinted the European Union (EU) could be next to face tariffs, after he slapped 25% levies on goods from Mexico and Canada along with an additional 10% tax on imports from China.",
      "While arriving in Maryland from Florida, Trump told the BBC that tariffs on EU goods imported into the US could happen \"pretty soon\".",
      "\"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products,\" he told journalists.",
      "The US President added he enjoyed good relations with British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, and that trade issues with the UK could be worked out.",
      "When asked by the BBC if there was a timeline for announcing tariffs on the EU, Trump said: \"I wouldn't say there's a timeline, but it's going to be pretty soon.\"",
      "For its part, the 27-member bloc has condemned Trump's decision to move ahead with tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China, and warned that it will \"respond firmly\" if it also becomes a target.",
      "China said it could take \"corresponding counter measures\".",
      "Mexico and Canada have also vowed to take retaliatory measures, although Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said after meeting Trump on Monday that he had agreed to delay tariffs against her country for a month.",
      "On trade with Britain, Trump said: \"The UK is out of line. But I'm sure that one, I think that one, can be worked out.\"",
      "He also discussed his relationship with the British Prime Minister who he said has been \"very nice\".",
      "\"We've had a couple of meetings. We've had numerous phone calls. We're getting along very well,\" he added.",
      "How world responds to Trump's tariffs is what matters next",
      "Trump's tariffs hit China hard before - this time, it's ready",
      "Trump says he will hit EU with tariffs - while UK is 'out of line' but 'can be worked out'",
      "Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries. The charges are seen as a tool to protect domestic industries from foreign competition.",
      "Increasing the price of imported goods is aimed at encouraging consumers to buy cheaper domestic products instead to help boost their own economy's growth.",
      "Most tariffs are set as a percentage of the value of the goods and in general the importer pays it.",
      "But given countries often respond to tariffs by matching measures of their own, businesses and consumers in both countries can be impacted.",
      "Trump is threatening to impose tariffs on goods imported from the EU to the US to address his country's long-standing trade deficit with the bloc, which occurs when a country imports more than it exports.",
      "Some 20 EU member states exported more to the US than they imported in 2023, according to Eurostat. The country with the largest surplus was Germany, driven by car and machinery exports, followed by Italy and Ireland.",
      "Trump has repeatedly complained about the EU's car exports to the US, with fewer vehicles being shipped the other way.",
      "Last week, British business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, told the BBC that the UK should be exempt from any tariffs, noting that the US does not have a goods trade deficit with the UK.",
      "Following Trump's comments, the main European stock markets all fell back.",
      "Shares in some of the biggest European carmakers also slumped following concerns over potential import duties to the US.",
      "Volkswagen, BMW, Porsche, Volvo Cars, Stellantis, and truckmaker Daimler Truck all fell between around 5% and 6%. French car parts supplier Valeo slumped 8%.",
      "\"We believe around 8 billion euros ($8.18 billion) of VW's revenues are impacted by tariffs and around 16 billion euros of Stellantis revenues,\" analysts at investment bank Stifel wrote in a note.",
      "US shares also fell when trading started, although the main indexes pulled back some of the losses following the news that tariffs on Mexico were being delayed.",
      "The prospect of higher taxes being introduced on imports to the US is concerning many world leaders, because it will make it more difficult for companies to sell goods in the world's largest economy.",
      "But tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic policy. He sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue."

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 23:13:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump claims more taxes on trade wouldn't be a cost to the US - but almost all economists dispute this.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has imposed new tariffs on goods entering the US from Canada, Mexico and China.",
      "The US president signed an executive order putting a 25% tariff - or tax on imports - on all goods coming from Canada and Mexico, to get both countries to crack down on illegal immigration and drug trafficking.",
      "Goods coming from China will also be hit with a 10% tariff \"above any additional tariffs\" until it cuts fentanyl smuggling. He has already pledged to target the country with a 60% rate, and has mulled a 200% tax on some car imports.",
      "Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue.",
      "During his election campaign, he told voters that the taxes were \"not going to be a cost to you, it\u2019s a cost to another country\".",
      "That was almost universally regarded by economists as misleading.",
      "Trudeau urges buyers to 'choose Canadian' as Trump tariff dispute intensifies",
      "China, Canada and Mexico vow swift response to Trump tariffs",
      "How world responds to Trump's tariffs is what matters next",
      "How do tariffs work?",
      "In practical terms, a tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter the country, proportional to the value of the import.",
      "So a car imported to the US with a value of $50,000 (\u00a338,000) subject to a 25% tariff, would face a $12,500 charge.",
      "The charge is physically paid by the domestic company that imports the goods, not the foreign company that exports them.",
      "So, in that sense, it is a straightforward tax paid by domestic US firms to the US government.",
      "Over the course of 2023, the US imported around $3.1tn of goods, equivalent to around 11% of US GDP.",
      "And tariffs imposed on those imports brought in $80bn in that year, around 2% of total US tax revenues.",
      "The question of where the final \u201ceconomic\u201d burden of tariffs falls, as opposed to the upfront bill, is more complicated.",
      "If the US importing firm passes on the cost of the tariff to the person buying the product in the US in the form of higher retail prices, it would be the US consumer that bears the economic burden.",
      "If the US importing firm absorbs the cost of the tariff itself and doesn\u2019t pass it on, then that firm is said to bear the economic burden in the form of lower profits than it would otherwise have enjoyed.",
      "'Is it for a day or four years?' Tariff uncertainty spooks small businesses",
      "Trump's tariffs hit China hard before - this time, it's ready",
      "Alternatively, it is possible that foreign exporters might have to lower their wholesale prices by the value of the tariff in order to retain their US customers.",
      "In that scenario, the exporting firm would bear the economic burden of the tariff in the form of lower profits.",
      "All three scenarios are theoretically possible.",
      "But economic studies of the impact of the new tariffs that Trump imposed in his first term of office between 2017 and 2020 suggest most of the economic burden was ultimately borne by US consumers.",
      "A survey by the University of Chicago in September 2024 asked a group of respected economists whether they agreed with the statement that \"imposing tariffs results in a substantial portion of the tariffs being borne by consumers of the country that enacts the tariffs, through price increases\". Only 2% disagreed.",
      "Raising prices",
      "Let\u2019s use a concrete example.",
      "Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports of washing machines in 2018.",
      "Researchers estimate the value of washing machines jumped by around 12% as a direct consequence, equivalent to $86 per unit, and that US consumers paid around $1.5bn extra a year in total for these products.",
      "There is no reason to believe the results of even higher import tariffs from a future Trump administration would be any different in terms of where the economic burden would fall.",
      "The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated Trump\u2019s new proposed tariffs would lower the incomes of Americans, with the impact ranging from around 4% for the poorest fifth to around 2% for the wealthiest fifth.",
      "A typical household in the middle of the US income distribution, the think tank estimates, would lose around $1,700 each year.",
      "The left-of-centre think tank Centre for American Progress, using a different methodology, has an estimate of a $2,500 to $3,900 loss for a middle-income family.",
      "Various researchers have also warned that another major round of tariffs from the US would risk another spike in domestic inflation.",
      "Impact on jobs",
      "Yet Trump has used another economic justification for his tariffs: that they protect and create US domestic jobs.",
      "\u201cUnder my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations, instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,\" he said on the campaign trail.",
      "The political context for Trump\u2019s tariffs was longstanding concern about the loss of US manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labour costs, particularly after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico in 1994 and the entry of China into the World Trade Organisation in 2001.",
      "In January 1994, when Nafta came into effect, the US had just under 17 million manufacturing jobs. By 2016, this had declined to around 12 million.",
      "Yet economists say it is misleading to attribute this decline to trade, arguing that growing levels of automation are also an important factor.",
      "And researchers who studied the impact of Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs found no substantial positive effects on overall employment in US industrial sectors that were protected.",
      "Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel in 2018 to protect US producers.",
      "By 2020, total employment in the US steel sector was 80,000, still lower than the 84,000 it had been in 2018.",
      "It is theoretically possible that employment might have dropped even further without the Trump steel tariffs but detailed economic studies of their impact on US steel still showed no positive employment impact.",
      "And economists have also found evidence suggesting that, because the domestic price of steel rose after the tariffs were imposed, employment in some other US manufacturing sectors, which relied on steel as an input - including the agricultural machinery manufacturer Deere & Co - was lower than it otherwise would have been.",
      "Impact on trade deficit",
      "Trump has criticised America's trade deficit, which is the difference between the value of all the things the country imports and the value of its exports in a given year.",
      "\u201cTrade deficits hurt the economy very badly,\u201d he has said.",
      "In 2016, just before Trump took office, the total goods and services deficit was $480bn, around 2.5% of US GDP. By 2020, it had grown to $653bn, around 3% of GDP, despite his tariffs.",
      "Part of the explanation, according to economists, is that Trump\u2019s tariffs increased the international relative value of the US dollar (by automatically reducing demand for foreign currencies in international trade) and that this made the products of US exporters less competitive globally.",
      "Another factor behind this failure to close the trade deficit is the fact that tariffs, in a globalised economy with multinational companies, can sometimes be bypassed.",
      "For example, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on Chinese imported solar panels in 2018.",
      "The US Commerce Department presented evidence in 2023 that Chinese solar panel manufacturers had shifted their assembly operations to countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam and then sent the finished products to the US from those countries, effectively evading the tariffs.",
      "There are some economists who support Trump\u2019s tariff plans as a way to boost US industry, such as Jeff Ferry of the Coalition for A Prosperous America, a domestic lobby group, but they are a small minority of the profession.",
      "Oren Cass, the director of the conservative think tank American Compass, has argued tariffs can incentivise firms to keep more of their manufacturing operations in America, which he argues has national defence and supply chain security benefits.",
      "And the Biden/Harris administration, while sharply criticising Trump\u2019s proposed extension of tariffs, kept in place many of the ones he implemented after 2018.",
      "It also imposed new tariffs on imports of things like electric vehicles from China, justifying them on the grounds of national security, US industrial policy and unfair domestic subsidies from Beijing.",

      "\"I know they annoy some people, some don't like them,\" he says.",

      "The agency says it has a bank of more than 60 million registrations. It also has a team that analyses market trends to identify lucrative registrations it can release to make the most money.",
      "But this doesn't include combinations of numbers and letters that the DVLA thinks \"may cause offence, embarrassment or are in poor taste\", which are withheld.",
      "Meanwhile, plates that are already in circulation can be bought through third-party dealers, who sell at private auctions and on their websites.",
      "Plates are also traded on Facebook groups and eBay.",
      "The market for these previously used plates is the area that potentially saw the biggest increase.",
      "Since 2014 the number of these transactions has tripled to about 800,000, according to the DVLA's figures.",
      "The data includes plates being sold, and those either put on or taken off vehicles. It can also include applications to change the owner's details, like their address.",
      "'\u00a325 to hundreds of thousands'",
      "Mark Reynolds, sales manager at Plate Hunter, one of several private dealers, says he sold the number plate KS1 just before Christmas for \u00a3285,000 to an anonymous buyer with the same initials.",

      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",

      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",

I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",

      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

      "If the plans were not a surprise, they still presented a potentially stunning blow to many businesses, especially for those in North America.

    "story": [
      "AstraZeneca has scrapped plans to invest \u00a3450m in expanding a vaccine manufacturing plant in Merseyside, blaming a reduction in government support.",
      "The pharmaceutical giant announced its decision just two days after Chancellor Rachel Reeves set out Labour's plan to go \"further and faster\" to boost economic growth.",
      "AstraZeneca said that after \"protracted\" talks, a number of factors influenced the move, including \"the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government's proposal\".",
      "The Treasury said a change to the \"make-up of the investment\" that had originally been proposed led to the government grant being reduced.",
      "\"All government grant funding has to demonstrate value for the taxpayer and unfortunately, despite extensive work from government officials, it has not been possible to achieve a solution,\" said a Treasury spokesperson.",
      "AstraZeneca said despite ditching its investment plans, its site in Speke would \"continue to produce and supply our flu vaccine, for patients in the UK and around the world\".",
      "It added that none of the current jobs at the plant would be affected.",
      "On Wednesday, Reeves named AstraZeneca as one of the \"great companies\" as she set out her plans to kickstart economic growth, saying she was \"determined to make Britain the best place in the world to invest\".",
      "But shadow business secretary Andrew Griffiths said: \"There's no vaccine for incompetence.",
      "\"In the same week they talked about growth, Labour seem to have fumbled a deal with AstraZeneca, one of the UK's largest companies and central to the critical life sciences sector.\"",
      "Labour has made boosting the UK economy its main objective in a bid to raise living standards but growth has remained sluggish.",
      "The government has been trying to encourage more firms to invest in the UK and create new jobs.",
      "Plans to expand AstraZeneca's site at Speke had been set out by the previous Conservative Chancellor Jeremy Hunt in last March's Budget.",
      "But reports subsequently emerged that talks over the plans between the new Labour government and the company had run into delays.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 00:51:57 GMT",
    "summary": "Trading Standards says adverts for heated tobacco products are banned, but some supermarkets disagree.",
    "story": [
      "Sainsbury's and Morrisons are displaying adverts for tobacco products in their stores which Trading Standards says are against the law.",
      "Video screens and posters promote devices that deliver nicotine by heating tobacco rather than burning it.",
      "The two supermarkets say they believe the laws banning tobacco advertising do not apply to the devices.",
      "Heated tobacco is less harmful than cigarettes, but experts say it is probably more harmful than vapes, and less effective at helping smokers quit.",
      "Tobacco adverts were banned in 2002. But if you walk into a Sainsbury's or a Morrisons you may well see adverts for iQos, a device that uses an electric current to heat tobacco.",
      "Some are on flashing video screens in places where they can easily be seen by children. The BBC has also seen adverts in Morrisons for a similar device called Ploom.",
      "Heated tobacco is different from vapes, which contain nicotine but no tobacco, and they are much less popular. But tobacco companies are keen to promote it as a new revenue stream to replace dwindling cigarette sales.",
      "The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), which represents local authority trading standards teams, says the ads are \"prohibited\" by the 2002 law.",
      "CTSI says the issue has never been tested in court, so it cannot say conclusively that running them is illegal.",
      "\"The only people who can definitively test it are the courts. Now the courts are chocka. Trading Standards is very stretched, and I think that's probably the reason why you're seeing more and more of these ads,\" Kate Pike, lead officer for tobacco and vaping at CTSI, told the BBC.",
      "\"It's taking the mick, is my view.\"",
      "There is limited evidence regarding the health effects of heated tobacco, according to Prof Lion Shahab, co-director of the tobacco and alcohol research group at University College, London.",
      "\"As it involves no combustion, heated tobacco is likely less harmful than cigarettes,\" he said.",
      "\"Current findings suggest that heated tobacco may be more harmful than e-cigarettes, and less effective at helping smokers give up cigarettes long-term.\"",
      "How are the vaping rules changing?",
      "How many people still smoke in the UK?",
      "In June 2018, then-health minister Steve Brine wrote to the company that makes iQos, Philip Morris International (PMI), to say advertising for it was \"prohibited\" and to ask them to \"desist from such promotion in the future\".",
      "Two months later, he wrote to thank them for \"agreeing to comply with our request to stop advertising and promoting the iQos device\".",
      "PMI says it only agreed to suspend advertising, not stop.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"We maintain our view that communications regarding the iQos device at appropriate points of sale is lawful.\"",
      "Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which makes Ploom, said the 2002 law defines a tobacco product as something that is \"smoked, sniffed, sucked or chewed\", and because heated tobacco products do not produce smoke, they aren't covered by that definition.",
      "Morrisons cited the same argument. \"On that basis, we are comfortable that it is legal for heated tobacco products to be advertised in store,\" it said.",
      "Sainsbury's said the ads were \"in line with current tobacco legislation\".",
      "Both supermarkets say they do not sell the devices to children.",
      "PMI and JTI say their heated tobacco devices are only intended for existing nicotine and tobacco users.",
      "Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said supermarkets advertising these products was \"disgraceful behaviour\".",
      "\"[It] puts pressure on overstretched enforcement services and risks introducing children and young people to new tobacco products.\"",
      "The government would not say whether it still thinks advertising heated tobacco is prohibited.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"This government's landmark Tobacco and Vapes Bill will enhance existing legislation, including on advertising, and put us on track for a smoke-free UK.\"",
      "The forthcoming bill is expected to ban all advertising of nicotine and tobacco products including nicotine pouches and vapes.",
      "The UK's biggest supermarket Tesco said it does not run tobacco ads, while a spokesperson for Asda said it doesn't advertise tobacco products \"in order to comply with current legislation as we understand it\"."

    "title": "Five key impacts of Brexit five years on",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:41:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:00:14 GMT",
    "summary": "In choppy global seas, going for growth will require tricky navigation",
    "story": [
      "It has been a wild January for Rachel Reeves and frankly for economics in the UK and the world.",
      "When Labour swept to victory last summer, Reeves pledged she would be an \"iron\" chancellor, reining in public spending and improving the lives of working people through growing the economy. Without solid public finances, she argued, the government couldn't achieve any of its other aims.",
      "This month has tested that plan.",
      "It started off with a global bond market tantrum - UK borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years and the pound fell sharply.",
      "Some argued that Reeves's Budget decisions had made the UK more vulnerable to such shocks. The prime minister was forced to confirm Reeves had his backing after political opponents called for her resignation.",
      "The market turbulence sparked concerns that a verdict of sorts was being made on the chancellor.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament. That meant, the rise in global and UK debt interest costs would require some spending cuts.",
      "The message was sent out that the government, with its massive majority, could do and would do what it takes to keep to the self-imposed rules, which it said were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The markets have now recovered all their negative moves. Short term and long term government borrowing costs are all lower than at the beginning of the year.",
      "While the \"gilt crisis\" hyperbole was overdone, there have been consequences.",
      "From doom to promises of a boom",
      "The chancellor sped up an already planned \"drumbeat\" of pro-growth measures, culminating in this week's speech. Reeves's counsel of doom and warnings about black holes and pain has been replaced by a promise of an investment boom.",
      "She has vowed a new runway at Heathrow, visas for those with AI and life science skills and said she would ease the non-dom ban to allow a more generous phase out of tax benefits.",
      "Alongside this are plans to make it easier to build, delays to new rules on banks and the ousting of the boss of the competition regulator, which shows she's serious on growth. As Meatloaf might have scripted for her: \"I would do anything for growth\".",
      "But Reeves's plans are not yet a fully fledged growth plan. Her announcements signal that she is willing to take a series of political hits to foster long term growth.",
      "The chancellor will deploy the near total executive power from her party's commons majority to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Some outside advisers who support the chancellor say that stability is not enough, and nor is planning, and nor is deregulation.",
      "Reeves has not pledged any allocation of public money to these grand projects.",
      "Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye sounded a little coy after plans for a third runway were confirmed, saying they would not spend more money on it unless they really believed it was going to happen.",
      "\"This will take years, it will take what I call Churchillian resolve and lots of ingenuity but we can trust a government that will be with us for many years to deliver this,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Reeves's UK growth mission",
      "Reeves is focusing on a very specific type of growth - increasing the supply of goods and services. She believes a lack of this supply side growth has held back the UK, and she is on a mission to remove barriers, and open new markets.",
      "For example, Reeves is very concerned about small businesses who have told her they have given up on exporting to the EU, because post Brexit it is now easier to export to the US.",
      "At a meeting last week, one business told the chancellor that exports to Europe meant for Christmas, had only just arrived.",
      "The problem is that while the chancellor awaits a long term growth spurt, she has prioritised stabilising public finances through significant tax rises.",
      "In April, employers will be hit with an increase in national insurance payments and a higher minimum wage. These costs could be passed on in price rises meaning inflation - already higher than target at 2.5%, could remain sticky.",
      "Reeves would have preferred employers to squeeze pay settlements rather than raise prices or cut staff.",
      "Retail and hospitality businesses using low wage labour will be most impacted by the bumper rise in minimum wages. Downing Street insiders acknowledge that many domestic business bosses are \"grumpy\" as they put it.",
      "The concern is whether the impact will show up in higher unemployment. At last October's Budget, the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted extra government spending would help boost the economy and bring unemployment down to 4% this year. Some outside forecasters now think it will top 5%.",
      "It is a critical few months for the animal spirits in the economy to reignite.",
      "How far will she go?",
      "But how far is Rachel Reeves willing to push this pro-growth agenda?",
      "Will she follow the US away from the decarbonisation path to benefit from cheaper hydrocarbon prices promised by President Trump? Will she accede to construction industry requests to import foreign workers to meet the target to build 1.5 million homes?",
      "Will she push the Brexit reset to remove all the barriers to UK-EU trade in food and farm products, and many goods too? Will she offer Britain to the global tech and pharma industries as a deregulatory haven from the EU and US respectively?",
      "Taken at face value, she will do most of this, with big political consequences. Take the Brexit reset. Cabinet ministers at The World Economic Forum were delighted with the tone of the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic in his interview with me, saying he was open to Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "The arrangement allows for tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.",
      "But if the UK demanded effective single market treatment in certain sectors, it would need to follow the EU rule book in those areas. There would be counter asks, such as extending EU fishing arrangements in UK waters, and some sort of youth cultural exchange scheme.",
      "The need for delicate diplomacy",
      "Push is coming to shove on these issues, and the question is whether the chancellor's pro growth agenda is the overwhelming factor in making decisions. I suspect it is.",
      "However, that approach will require delicate diplomacy in the middle of a potential goods tariff war. If Trump follows through on his threat of a universal tariff then the G7 could decide to coordinate retaliatory tariffs. Does the UK join in?",
      "What if the US decides it wants its allies to help contain China's tech ascendancy? What if Trump wants to deter the UK from rebuilding free-flowing trade with the EU?",
      "The sudden emergence of China's AI expertise via DeepSeek underlines how important it is to be nimble. There was only one mention of China in the government's big AI paper earlier this month - in Science Secretary Peter Kyle's foreword.",
      "The pharma industry is lobbying the government to quietly open the door for relocation of key top talent into the UK, concerned about the Trump / Robert F Kennedy Jr approach to medicines regulation. Our leading universities are saying that for the first time since Brexit, it's easier to recruit some of the very best international scientists who are not keen to bring up their families in Trump's America.",
      "Trump's decision to abandon Biden's green subsidies also levels the playing field for net zero investment here.",
      "After a tumultuous start to the year, with the US administration threatening different tariffs almost every day, and tech giant shares falling over concerns they've been overvalued in the light of China's AI app DeepSeek, the UK remains a safe haven for investors.",
      "The self declared iron chancellor remains very attached to stability. But zero growth is a form of stability too. In choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some very tricky navigation - and it will make some big domestic political waves too.",

    "story": [
      "Sales of Apple iPhones dropped at the end of last year, as the tech firm's roll out of new artificial intelligence (AI) features was met with a lukewarm response.",
      "Chief executive Tim Cook said the new features helped to drive stronger sales in the countries where they were available, such as the US.",
      "But iPhone sales slipped about 1% overall compared with last year, to $69.1bn (\u00a355bn).",
      "The company is also contending with other challenges, including a sales drop in China and the possibility its US sales will be hit by tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump.",
      "He has called for tariffs of up to 60% on products made in China, where Apple does much of its manufacturing.",
      "But the timing and full scope of those plans, which would put a new tax on imports into the US, remains highly uncertain.",

    "story": [
      "Switzerland's highest court has convicted the commodities trading giant Trafigura and one of its senior executives of bribery over payments made by the firm to gain access to Angola's lucrative oil market.",
      "In a landmark case, the court handed the company's British former chief operating officer Mike Wainwright, who has also competed as a racing driver, a 32-month jail sentence and fined the company $148m (\u00a3119m).",
      "This is the first time an entire company has been charged by Switzerland's highest court, and bribery convictions of senior staff are rare.",
      "Trafigura's lawyers said the company and Wainwright intended to appeal against the verdict, so the former executive was not jailed immediately.",
      "The case against Trafigura has had all the elements of a financial thriller: millions of dollars, shady middlemen and a chain of shell companies located in offshore havens like the Virgin Islands.",
      "Trafigura's strategy, the court heard, was to set up a complex payment web, through which an official with Angola's state oil company was paid almost $5m (\u00a34.02m; \u20ac4.81) between 2009 and 2011.",
      "Documents presented to the court by Swiss prosecutors showed payments authorised on Trafigura's own headed notepaper.",
      "The strategy appeared to work: over the next few years, the court heard, Angola signed contracts with Trafigura worth almost $144m (\u00a3115.93; \u20ac138.56).",
      "Trafigura, whose lawyers appeared bullish before the verdict, denied bribery. The company said its own compliance and anti-corruption measures had been independently assessed and found to be excellent.",
      "But the sheer weight of the evidence - which included dozens of documents, emails and memos - revealed a different picture: strict anti-corruption measures on paper but an intricate structure set up to evade those measures in reality. At the heart of it sat a middleman named \"Mr Non-Compliant\" in an anonymous Geneva office.",
      "The case will send a chill through commodity brokers worldwide but especially in Geneva, where Trafigura and many other commodity trading houses are headquartered.",
      "In an eerie coincidence, the night before the verdict was delivered, a fire broke out at the five star Hotel des Bergues - where, court documents showed, an Angolan official stayed at the expense of Trafigura in 2008.",
      "Swiss federal prosecutors hope the case will be a symbol that the old ways of doing business are finally over.",
      "They brought the charges to Switzerland's highest court, reserved for the worst crimes, such as terrorist offences.",
      "Trafigura now faces a large fine and Wainwright, who was in court for the verdict and denied the charges, was told he must serve at least one year of his 32 month sentence in jail.",
      "However, he was not immediately detained, pending the appeal he intends to lodge."

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 11:32:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce expansion plans but some question the short-term benefits.",
    "story": [
      "The expansion of Heathrow Airport has been backed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is hoping investment in a third runway, along with a series of other transport projects, will drive economic growth in the UK.",
      "Reeves has said expansion of the UK's biggest airport is \"badly needed\" and could lead to 100,000 jobs.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Friends of the Earth has said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "So is a third runway at Heathrow the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",
      "The construction project itself - the biggest privately-funded infrastructure scheme in Europe - would create thousands of jobs.",
      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

    "summary": "The chancellor says expanding Heathrow would boost growth, but there is a lot of vocal opposition.",
    "story": [
      "The government has backed the expansion of Heathrow Airport after years of heated debate, saying it could create 100,000 jobs.",
      "The move, alongside potential confirmation of the expansion of other London airports including Gatwick and Luton, is likely to be met by fierce opposition.",
      "Critics say increasing air travel would make it much harder for the UK to meet its climate change commitments.",
      "However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"a third runway is badly needed\", adding the government \"cannot duck the decision any longer\".",
      "How would Heathrow Airport be expanded?",
      "Heathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving more than 80 million travellers a year with its four passenger terminals and two runways.",
      "A third runway would mean demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting rivers, and rerouting the M25 motorway between junctions 14 and 15 through a tunnel under the new runway.",
      "The number of flights, currently capped at 480,000 a year, could go up to 720,000 - or nearly 2,000 a day on average.",
      "Heathrow told the BBC that it would eventually be able to serve up to 140 million passengers a year once the third runway is in operation.",
      "The airport's owners, who include Saudi Arabia and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds and private equity firm Ardian, said the costs of expansion would be met by charging airlines for use of the larger airport.",
      "But after years of wrangling over the original plans, the initial cost estimate of \u00a314bn will need to be revised.",
      "When could a third runway open?",
      "Even with government backing, the formal planning process could take up to two years.",
      "Any planning decision could then be subject to a judicial review, as well as needing to answer questions from opponents over environmental concerns.",
      "Local authorities and nearby residents will also have questions.",
      "After all that, construction is expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "Reeves has told the BBC she wants to see \"spades in the ground\" in the current Parliament and planes to start using the runway by 2035.",
      "Does Labour support a third runway?",
      "A third runway was first proposed by Gordon Brown's Labour government in 2009 but was only finally given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court in 2020.",
      "Several members of the current government - including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - voted against a Heathrow expansion when in opposition.",
      "But Sir Keir recently told the BBC that the government has climate commitments, \"but growth is really important too\".",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Any aviation expansion will only be able to go ahead if it is consistent with our carbon budgets.\"",
      "However, London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office said he has \"a long-standing opposition to airport expansion around London\" because of the impact on air quality and noise.",
      "Heathrow's boss, Thomas Woldbye, said in December he was waiting for a \"clear steer\" from the government before he could take plans forward.",
      "Could an extra runway help the economy?",
      "Some arguments for investing in the UK's transport infrastructure include a boost in growth, more jobs, and help for UK exports.",
      "Other European cities boast hub airports with more runways, including Amsterdam which serves fewer passengers than Heathrow but has five runways. Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt have four.",
      "Currently, over \u00a3200bn of British trade passes through Heathrow annually. Heathrow has not devised figures on how much trade is expected to increase after a third runway, which it will do when it arrives at planning stage.",
      "The Airport Commission, an independent panel that examines the need for additional UK airport capacity, looked into the likely impact of Heathrow expansion and reported in 2015 that there would be benefits to the tune of \u00a361bn over 60 years.",
      "It said that included reduced fares, fewer delays, greater resilience, and the creation of up to 77,000 jobs.",
      "Forging ahead with Heathrow expansion would also send a clear message to foreign investors that the government means what it says about making growth its priority.",
      "However, some critics, including think tank the New Economics Foundation say the impact on growth is exaggerated, arguing more capacity in the south of England might simply displace activity from other regions.",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "What would the environmental impact be?",
      "Aviation is one source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and the industry is under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",
      "Reeves pointed to progress on creating sustainable fuels, and electric planes. A third runway at Heathrow would also mean \"that instead of circling London, flights can land\" she added, meaning less fuel is used.",
      "But it is far from clear that those technologies will be enough to make up for the growing demand for air travel. Heathrow will have to prove that its plan meets the governments net-zero by 2050 targets in any planning application.",
      "Last year the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions, the Climate Change Committee, warned that the UK should not go ahead with airport expansion without a framework in place to manage capacity across the country.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Friends of the Earth has described the plan for a third runway as \"hugely irresponsible\".",

      "What about Gatwick, Luton and London's other airports?",
      "Plans to expand London's other airports are already further along than Heathrow's and have in the past been viewed as an alternative to a third Heathrow runway.",
      "Work is set to start this year to expand capacity at Stansted's terminal.",
      "The government is due to make a decision on Gatwick airport by 27 February.",

      "Meanwhile, a decision on Luton airport's expansion, which includes plans for a new terminal, is due by 3 April.",

      "It's important that someone is able to maintain curl when he steps away.",
      "\u201cI just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,\u201d Mr Stenberg says.",
      "It\u2019s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system \u2013 and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.",
      "The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today\u2019s technology landscape.",
      "In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master\u2019s thesis. \u201cMy concern was graduating,\u201d he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.",
      "Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark.",
      "\u201cWe're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,\u201d he says.",
      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work after all.",

      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",

      "The government will step in more quickly to help struggling schools based on the findings of new Ofsted report cards, the education secretary has said.",
      "Bridget Phillipson said in a speech on Monday that the old single-word Ofsted judgements, which were scrapped last year, were \"too blunt\" and \"too vague\" to serve a purpose.",
      "She said new regional teams, with a budget of up to \u00a3100,000 per school, would help turn around the 600 \"stuck\" schools in England which had received back-to-back negative judgements from Ofsted.",
      "However, the report cards have drawn strong criticism from school leaders, who said the proposals risk \"replicating the worst aspects of the current system\".",
      "Prof Julia Waters, whose sister Ruth Perry took her own life after an Ofsted inspection, said it appeared to be \"a rehash of the discredited and dangerous system it is meant to replace\".",
      "The changes follow a major public debate around Ofsted after a coroner ruled that an inspection contributed to the death of primary school head teacher Mrs Perry in 2023.",
      "Phillipson pushed back on the criticism of the report cards after her speech, saying parents wanted more information about schools.",
      "She also said she was \"delighted to see the debate raging\" over the proposed reforms, saying \"that is how we shape the best education system\".",
      "She said report cards would provide \"rich, granular insight\" which would help to deliver \"tailored\" support for struggling schools.",
      "Those schools which do not improve will be transferred to a successful academy trust, even if they are already run by a different academy or a council.",
      "Under Ofsted's proposals, the old one or two-word judgements, ranging across four grades from \"Outstanding\" to \"Inadequate\", will be replaced from the 2025 autumn term by a report card describing what inspectors have found on key aspects of each school, including:",

      "A separate part of the report card will say whether the school's duties around safeguarding have been met.",
      "The new format will be used for inspections across all settings, from early years to further education colleges, but will be tailored to the type of provider, Ofsted said.",
      "Ofsted boss Sir Martyn Oliver said the proposals were designed to \"raise standards and improve the lives of children, particularly the most disadvantaged\".",
      "He said the \"suite of grades\" would give parents \"much more detail\" and help identify a school's strengths and areas for improvement.",

      "Taylor Swift was blanked despite scoring six nominations. Voters clearly decided that The Tortured Poets Department wasn't worthy of comparison with her four previous album of the year winners (Fearless, 1989, Folklore and Midnights).",
      "Billie Eilish's wipeout was even more unexpected. She had been the bookmakers' favourite for album of the year, for her third release Hit Me Hard And Soft - but she lost all seven of the categories she was nominated for.",
      "Still, there was a lot of competition this year, especially in the pop categories. And Swift has spoken in the past about how losing album of the year for Red inspired her pop opus, and biggest-seller to date, 1989.",

Which means she would break the record of four wins, set all the way back in 2024 by Taylor Swift. I'm just gonna say Taylor, if you break Taylor's record, the Swifties are gonna come for you. And you don't wanna mess with them.\"\"The Beatles are nominated tonight for Record of the Year. Yes, the legendary band from Liverpool used AI to put out a new song after 53 years. So good luck to the Beatles. I think if they win, this could open up a few doors for them.\"\"And who knows, through the power of AI, one day, we could even get another Rihanna album.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 05:24:11 GMT",
    "summary": "In a show  filled with musical royalty, the star of the Grammys this year was the city of LA.",
    "story": [
      "In a show celebrating the biggest names in music, the star of the night was the city of Los Angeles.",
      "The historic fires that tore through Los Angeles became the theme of this year's Grammys. Reminders of the tragedy seeped into the musical performances and donation drives for relief efforts throughout the show.",
      "There were questions over whether the ceremony, the \"Oscars for Music,\" would go on as planned on Sunday after its host city saw its most devastating fire disaster ever recorded - blazes that were only fully doused on Friday after burning for 24 days.",
      "The week of glitzy parties and events that typically mark Grammys week were cancelled. Even the hallmark rowdy after-parties were axed.",
      "In the end, it became a moment of perseverance for the city - the epicentre of entertainment - and a chance to shed light on the intense need for those who have lost homes and loved ones.",
      "Twenty-nine people have died and more than 16,000 homes and businesses have been destroyed - with whole neighbourhoods now ash. Many artists and industry professionals are among those who lost homes, studios and equipment.",
      "Preformances honour LA",
      "The awards opened with a special performance by the Los Angeles band Dawes, two brothers whose homes were destroyed in the recent wildfires.",
      "The duo were joined on stage by former Grammy winners including Sheryl Crow, John Legend, Brad Paisley and Brittany Howard to perform Randy Newman's classic song I Love LA.",
      "After the performance, Dawes - brothers Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith - reflected on this moment for the city and how they'd become LA's unofficial ambassadors in the fire aftermath.",
      "\"For a lot of musicians, you sort of feel helpless to not know how to help,\" they said. \"We really wanted to get involved, and so this really was a very proud moment for us.\"",
      "They noted they'd never been to the Grammys and now they helped open the show.",
      "\"It's wild to think about our childhood dreams meeting up with an opportunity to help our communities and at such a tragic moment.\"",
      "Throughout the evening, multiple performances provided a nod to the area.",
      "Grammys ceremony opens with tribute to Los AngelesGrammy Awards 2025: Beyonc\u00e9 wins best country album",
      "Grammys ceremony opens with tribute to Los Angeles",
      "Grammy Awards 2025: Beyonc\u00e9 wins best country album",
      "Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga sang a powerful rendition of the Mamas & the Papas classic California Dreamin'. During a segment honouring the late Quincy Jones, Stevie Wonder sang We Are the World with a choir of students from two schools lost in the fires.",
      "The Red Hot Chili Peppers, a band synonymous with LA, also took the stage to mark the evening. The Grammys audience sang along with Chad Smith and Anthony Kiedis in an impromptu performance of their hit \"Under the Bridge\" - about Los Angeles.",
      "LA firefighters also took the stage during the show. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone spoke before the group and told the audience: \"I am confident that we will recover and rebuild together, because we are LA strong.\"",
      "Then firefighters presented the biggest award of the night - album of the year - with Beyonc\u00e9 winning the elusive honour after four losses in the category over the years.",
      "Fundraising efforts",
      "Nearly every commercial break during the show included a nod to the fires that happened here. Footage of burned down neighbourhoods or an inside look at a skate shop or small business that was destroyed in the blazes.",
      "Host Trevor Noah made mention of the fundraising effort throughout the show - acknowledging big donations that were made. He noted at one point during the broadcast that at least $7 million (\u00a35.7m) had been donated thus far.",
      "Much of the red carpet was plastered with fundraising signs and backdrops with QR codes to a Grammys website where people can donate.",
      "As celebrities strolled along the red carpet, groups of firefighters and first responders also took their walk before the media.",
      "They were greeted by loud applause and thank yous from everyone they passed. Many smiled and took selfies in their uniforms, some even nabbing pictures with celebrities.",
      "One firefighter's jaw dropped when he saw the Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi and they took a picture together.",
      "Los Angeles County Fire Captain Joshua Swaney walked alongside fellow firefighters on the red carpet. He told the BBC that while it was a phenomenal experience being honoured at the event, it was a helpful reminder for the rest of the world that LA is still reeling.",
      "\"This is definitely not what we're used to. That's for sure. It's been a humbling experience to be a part of this,\" he said. \"We are here making sure that people know that there's so much more to Los Angeles than just what's currently happening right now.\"",
      "To cancel the show or not?",
      "The Recording Academy, which runs the show, had said the show was needed more than ever.",
      "Showrunners sought to strike the right tone honouring the victims of the fire and displaying a defiant Los Angeles that will persevere. But there was concern the optics of rich celebrities dolled up with smiles on a red carpet could come off as tone deaf.",
      "Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. highlighted the economic impact, noting that thousands rely on Grammy-related work, particularly in the service industry. He framed the event as a symbol of resilience, arguing that cancelling would not benefit the city or music industry.",
      "\"Cancelling, pushing, moving does not accomplish what us standing together\" does, Mr Mason argued in a webcast before the show. The show will be \"unifying and coming together, honouring music, but also using the power of music to heal, rebuild and provide services to people who need it\".",
      "\"I think this might be one of the most important Grammy weeks we've ever had.\"",
      "Mr Mason told the New York Times that they consulted a range of public officials about whether they should hold the event - including the city's mayor and California Governor Gavin Newsom - and whether it would hinder fire response efforts.",
      "\"They strongly suggested that we continue forward with hosting the event,\" he told the outlet. \"Everyone said there's nothing good that comes from postponing.\"",
      "But there were still worries that the night will be a bad look for the music industry.",
      "\"I actually don't think that the Grammys should be happening,\" Elyn Kazarian, a creative director in the music industry, told the BBC.",
      "\"It's just very weird to me that there are going to be celebrities on a red carpet wearing expensive clothes while people in other parts of the city are suffering and whose livelihoods have been destroyed.\"",

      "This is not the first time a major disruption has impacted the music industry's biggest night.",
      "In 2021, the show was postponed due to Covid-19 and was significantly altered to accommodate safety protocols. It featured a socially distanced format, with no live audience and pre-recorded performances in an intimate outdoor setting rather than the usual large-scale arena production.",
      "Artists had to adjust to a new way of promoting their music, relying on digital platforms rather than in-person Grammy week events, which were either cancelled or moved online.",
      "\"I wouldn't necessarily compare the COVID pandemic to what's happening here,\" senior music writer for Variety, Steven J Horowitz, told the BBC. \"COVID lasted for so long and the effects were devastating for years. People had to cancel major releases, and everything shifted to a digital space.\"",
      "He said the fires are different.",
      "\"The industry has reacted in real time. It's not as widespread as a worldwide pandemic, so people are a little more flexible on how to properly react and help those affected,\" he said.",

      "Beyonc\u00e9 passes Jay-Z in all-time Grammy nominations",
      "How the industry has been impacted",
      "Artist Manager Dani Chavez told the BBC that the fires have affected many people working in LA's music industry.",
      "\"I know multiple musicians who lost their gear\", Chavez said. \"I know stylists who work in music who lost their houses, who had costumes and whatnot. I know musicians who are born and raised in LA who lost their house.\"",
      "There is also a ripple effect in the industry on those not personally impacted by the fires.",
      "The week of events typically held before the show, which were cancelled this year to help with fundraising efforts instead, helps new musicians and allows them to break out in a crowded market - getting time with top executives and those at major record labels.",
      "\"Visibility is very important for artists,\" Mr Horowitz told the BBC.",
      "\"Say you're a Best New Artist nominee who is relatively unknown to the public - being on these platforms and at these parties is a really big look if you're trying to get your music out in front of the industry. It really does help.\"",
      "One of the most sought-after parties is Spotify's event honouring the nominees for Best New Artist of the year. It is half party, half concert, with previous nominees showcasing their new music, and celebrities from all parts of the entertainment industry there to celebrate.",
      "Following the fires, Spotify chose to cancel this year's event.",
      "\"We've decided that the most impactful approach is cancelling all our Grammy Week events, including our annual Best New Artist party, and redirecting funds to support efforts to reach local fans and charitable organizations,\" Spotify's Global Head of Music Partnerships and Audience Joe Hadley wrote in an announcement.",
      "The music industry and the Grammys are deeply rooted in Los Angeles, and though the city is going through a devastating period, it has reinforced a sense of community, especially in the music industry.",
      "\"Even if people lost everything, they still have hope. And I think that feeds into what we're going to see in the music industry in the future,\" Mr Horowitz said. \"People aren't going to flee Los Angeles because of this one thing. It's not going to stop L.A. from being one of the main hubs for music in the world.\"",

      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",

      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",

      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 18:01:38 GMT",
    "summary": "Is skinny back for good? We speak to designers, casting agents and models at Paris Fashion Week.",
    "story": [
      "The high fashion industry has always been synonymous with thinness, but for a brief moment in the 2010s, the body positivity movement was at the forefront.",
      "It promised a revolution of accepting bodies of all shapes and sizes, welcomed curves and advocated for inclusion, particularly on the runway.",
      "But 10 years on, industry insiders tell us things have shifted. Was body positivity a flash-in-the-pan trend? And with help with weight loss medication such as Ozempic, is skinny back for good?",
      "We speak to designers, casting agents and models at Paris Fashion Week to investigate what is happening.",
      "The 2010s: The era of body positivity",
      "The body positivity movement finds its origins in the hazy days of the 1960s and was helped by icons like Marilyn Monroe who broadened Hollywood's rigid beauty standard.",
      "It was brought to the forefront again in the 2010s, when Instagram was launched and influencers began to highlight fashion and beauty outside of the glossy magazines and runways.",
      "Helping this was the celebrity Kardashian family, whose curves triggered BBLs  (Brazilian butt lift surgery) around the world.",
      "Enrika, a 28-year-old plus-sized model, said: \"When the body positivity movement emerged, it felt incredibly empowering and liberating.\"",
      "\"It felt like an act of rebellion - what had always been criticised was now being appreciated. It was as if we had finally had enough of being judged.\"",
      "Plus-size models were being booked for big brands, including Rihanna's highly coveted lingerie label, 'Savage x Fenty' which launched in 2018.",
      "The brand, valued at $1bn, became known for its runway extravaganzas, reminiscent of a modern alternative to the iconic Victoria's Secret shows, but this time with every body type on display.",
      "Felicity Hayward, a 36-year-old plus-sized model, reflects on being scouted in 2011.",
      "\"When I got that call from my first modelling agency Storm - who discovered Kate Moss - I thought I was being punk'd,\" she said.",
      "\"Before the 2010s, attitudes around bigger bodies weren't positive and I never thought being a plus-size model was a possibility.",
      "\"Seeing that narrative change over the last decade and a half has been life changing both emotionally, physically and financially.\"",
      "The 2020s: The era of Ozempic",
      "But then around 2020, progress started to slow. And come the autumn and winter of 2024, of the 8,800 looks across 230 shows, just 0.8 per cent were on plus-size models, Vogue reports.",
      "At the same time, a new weight loss drug used to treat diabetes came onto the market and skyrocketed in popularity.  Semaglutide, also known as Ozempic and Wegovy, curbs the appetite of users, and was approved by the NHS for weight loss in 2023.",
      "Celebrities including Elon Musk started crediting the drug for their newly slim frame and it was only a matter of time before that trickled down to consumers.",
      "As Ozempic and its counterparts become more commercially available for aesthetic purposes, industry insiders claim it has affected the body positivity movement.",
      "Model, Moya, said: \"We've seen how quickly the narrative shifted, with celebrities and influencers using surgeries or medication like Ozempic to chase what's considered 'in Vogue'.\"",
      "Another model, Jenny, said: \"When I realised skinny was back, it was positive because I was going to get more jobs.",
      "\"But I've realised it means now I have to keep up. Now I have to be the skinniest.\"",
      "Even the editorial director of British Vogue said that the fashion industry \"should be concerned\" by a recent trend back to using more skinny models",
      "Chioma Nnadi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme:  \"I do think maybe perhaps Ozempic has something to do with it.\"",
      "\"We're in this moment where we're seeing the pendulum sort of swing back to skinny being 'in' and often these things are treated like a trend and we don't want them to be.\"",
      "Then Berlin brand, Namilia, went viral for an \"I love Ozempic\" T-shirt on their 2024 Fashion Week runway.",
      "\"The 'I love Ozempic' tee really hit a nerve,\" laughed Nan Li, the brand's creative director who claims the T-shirt was satire.",
      "\"With the rise of Ozempic, so many people are using it. Over the last few years, celebrities just lost weight and didn't talk about it.\"",
      "Paris 'celebrates elitism'",
      "Fast-forward to January, when Men's AW25 Fashion Week lands in Paris and audiences get a litmus test in real-time of exactly where brands stand.",
      "Aside from a selection of designers, including Rick Owens, LGN and Charles Jeffrey LOVERBOY, I can count on two hands how many plus-sized models I saw at a week of shows.",
      "Nan Li said: \"Paris celebrates elitism, and elitism means skinny and white.\"",
      "\"There's a handful of plus-sized models [at the shows] but they're not really plus - they're normal-sized. They are cast in every show to make the brand appear body positive.\"",
      "Amidst the hustle and bustle of fashion week, Shaun Beyen, casting director for iconic French brand Fursac, told the BBC: \"The only motivation for a brand is to sell clothes - that's it. I don't think we need to lie about this.",
      "\"Brands adopted body positivity in the 2010s because in part they saw it as a commercial opportunity, and when they saw it was no longer performing as they would hope in 2020, they hopped off.\"",
      "Beyen added: \"Full transparency - I don't really want to see clothes on someone like me. I want to see it on somebody I aspire to look like.\"",
      "Gauthier Borsarello, Fursac's creative director, laughed in agreement and said: \"I hate my body. I don't want to see clothes on people like me.\"",
      "On the other hand, designers like Charles Jeffrey believe brands have a moral imperative to cast inclusively. \"Body positivity was never a trend for me,\" he said. \"It was an opportunity to start being responsible.\"",
      "Body positivity is knitted into the very fabric of Charles' brand, which takes inspiration from the queer nightlife scene. This is readily apparent throughout his Paris Fashion Week show.",
      "The designer explained: \"The people in my shows are people I was clubbing with. It was never about models, it was my friends and their different body shapes. It was about the community I surrounded myself with.\"",
      "Body positivity 'taken a backseat now'",
      "It seem the reality is that designers like Charles are the exception to the rule. As much as activists resist it, industry insiders confirm that body positivity is behind us.",
      "Daniel Mitchell-Jones, co-founder of modelling agency Chapter Management, said: \"Yes, things have shifted. In 2020 and 2021, we saw so much more diversity and inclusion on the runways - but body-wise, that's taken a backseat now.\"",
      "Daniel said when he sends his curve models to castings, they're always pushed, but is often told the brand isn't interested this season.",
      "Plus-size model Enrika told the BBC that not only are plus-sized models being booked less, their agents are actively struggling to secure work for them.",
      "She explained: \"It's not unusual to see campaigns featuring four sample-size models and only one plus-size model. This can make you feel like you're just a token.\"",
      "Enrika said these brands sometimes often use tactics in campaigns to virtue-signal being inclusive - such as highlighting stretch marks on plus-sized models, whilst airbrushing them on others.",
      "She said: \"It sends the message that 'We don't actually think you look as good as the slim models in our skirt. But we accept you because we are such kind-hearted good people, so please give us your hard-earned money', it's nasty work and I don't support it.\"",
      "If you want change, change your buying habits. At least, that's what Shaun Beyen, believes: \"Everything is consumer-driven\".",
      "\"It's this kind of vicious circle. Every fashion house gives their version of what they know the customer wants, it's their interpretation and it's up to the consumer.\"",
      "Gauthier Borsarello said: \"There's a famous French saying: 'If people stop producing, people will stop buying.' But the inverse is true. If people stop buying, we stop producing.",
      "\"No-one is forcing you to do anything. It's an education of the customer: In a polite way - educate yourself.\"",
      "And the one benefit of bodies as trends is that the pendulum will eventually swing back. Beyen said: \"Nothing is ever gone, especially not in fashion.\"",

    "story": [
      "For Christmas I received an interesting gift from a friend - my very own \"best-selling\" book.",
      "\"Tech-Splaining for Dummies\" (great title) bears my name and my photo on its cover, and it has glowing reviews.",
      "Yet it was entirely written by AI, with a few simple prompts about me supplied by my friend Janet.",
      "It's an interesting read, and very funny in parts. But it also meanders quite a lot, and is somewhere between a self-help book and a stream of anecdotes.",
      "It mimics my chatty style of writing, but it's also a bit repetitive, and very verbose. It may have gone beyond Janet's prompts in collating data about me.",
      "Several sentences begin \"as a leading technology journalist\u2026\" \u2013 cringe \u2013 which could have been scraped from an online bio.",
      "There's also a mysterious, repeated hallucination in the form of my cat (I have no pets). And there's a metaphor on almost every page \u2013 some more random than others.",
      "There are dozens of companies online offering AI-book writing services. My book was from BookByAnyone.",
      "When I contacted the chief executive Adir Mashiach, based in Israel, he told me he had sold around 150,000 personalised books, mainly in the US, since pivoting from compiling AI-generated travel guides in June 2024.",
      "A paperback copy of your own 240-page long best-seller costs \u00a326. The firm uses its own AI tools to generate them, based on an open source large language model.",
      "I'm not asking you to buy my book. Actually you can't \u2013 only Janet, who created it, can order any further copies.",
      "There is currently no barrier to anyone creating one in anybody's name, including celebrities \u2013 although Mr Mashiach says there are guardrails around abusive content. Each book contains a printed disclaimer stating that it is fictional, created by AI, and designed \"solely to bring humour and joy\".",
      "Legally, the copyright belongs to the firm, but Mr Mashiach stresses that the product is intended as a \"personalised gag gift\", and the books do not get sold further.",
      "He hopes to broaden his range, generating different genres such as sci-fi, and perhaps offering an autobiography service. It's designed to be a light-hearted form of consumer AI \u2013 selling AI-generated goods to human customers.",
      "It's also a bit terrifying if, like me, you write for a living. Not least because it probably took less than a minute to generate, and it does, certainly in some parts, sound just like me.",
      "Musicians, authors, artists and actors worldwide have expressed alarm about their work being used to train generative AI tools that then churn out similar content based upon it.",
      "\"We should be clear, when we are talking about data here, we actually mean human creators' life works,\" says Ed Newton Rex, founder of Fairly Trained, which campaigns for AI firms to respect creators' rights.",
      "\"This is books, this is articles, this is photos. It's works of art. It's records\u2026 The whole point of AI training is to learn how to do something and then do more like that.\"",
      "In 2023 a song featuring AI-generated voices of Canadian singers Drake and The Weeknd went viral on social media before being pulled from streaming platforms because it was not their work and they had not consented to it. It didn't stop the track's creator trying to nominate it for a Grammy award. And even though the artists were fake, it was still wildly popular.",
      "\"I do not think the use of generative AI for creative purposes should be banned, but I do think that generative AI for these purposes that is trained on people's work without permission should be banned,\" Mr Newton Rex adds. \"AI can be very powerful but let's build it ethically and fairly.\"",

If anything, Tech-Splaining for Dummies highlights the current weakness in generative AI tools for bigger projects. It is full of inaccuracies and hallucinations, and it can be quite difficult to read in parts because it's so long-winded.",

      "The Rolling Stones were a rhythm and blues band. When singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards wrote a gentle ballad, When Tears Go By, they dismissed it as a \"piece of tripe\".",
      "So Oldham gave it to Marianne Faithfull.",
      "The song had not been written for her but, she said, \"fitted me so perfectly it might as well had been\".",
      "The melancholy classic, sung in her detached, wintry voice, reached the UK Top 10.",
      "The Stones were so disappointed they had missed a hit, they recorded their own version a year later.",
      "Faithfull followed up with a series of singles, including Summer Nights, This Little Bird and - her highest chart success - Come and Stay with Me.",
      "She caught Bob Dylan's eye when he came to town.",
      "Inspired by her doe-eyed looks, the American singer-songwriter wrote her a poem - but tore it up when she turned him down.",
      "In 1965, she married John Dunbar and gave birth to their son. Soon afterwards, she left the family home and moved in with Mick Jagger.",
      "He was not Faithfull's first Rolling Stone. \"I slept with three of them,\" she later admitted, \"and then I decided the lead singer was the best bet.\"",
      "Her influence on the band was significant.",
      "Let's Spend the Night Together, You Can't Always Get What You Want and Wild Horses were all songs said to have been written about her.",
      "And Sympathy for the Devil was inspired by The Master and Margarita, a Russian novel Faithfull introduced to Jagger.",
      "As one of the faces of the 1960s, Faithfull carved out a side-career as an actor.",
      "She appeared at London's Royal Court in an adaptation of Chekhov's Three Sisters, alongside Glenda Jackson.",
      "She became the first person ever to utter the F-word in a mainstream film, I'll Never Forget What'sisname, in 1967.",
      "A year later, she starred opposite Alain Delon, as a doomed, leather-clad beauty in The Girl on a Motorcycle.",
      "Her character's psychedelic and erotic fantasies saw the film win the first ever X-rating in the United States.",
      "Of course, there were a lot of drugs.",
      "During a police raid on Keith Richards' house in Sussex, Faithfull was discovered naked, draped in a fur rug - which she took indecent pleasure in occasionally letting slip.",
      "Allegations involving a Mars bar, she insisted, were entirely made up. But the drugs bust took a toll on her reputation. \"It destroyed me,\" she later said.",
      "\"To be a male drug addict and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorising, she explained.",
      "\"A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother.\"",
      "Faithfull co-wrote Sister Morphine with Jagger and Richards and released the song in 1969.",
      "The lyrics - the authorship of which were later the subject of a legal dispute with the band - are a terrifying insight into the effect of heroin and cocaine addiction: \"The scream of the ambulance is sounding in my ears. Tell me, Sister Morphine, how long have I been lying here?\"",
      "The relationship with Jagger - whom she accused of having a misogynistic streak - fell apart at the turn of the decade.",
      "At the same time, Faithfull lost custody of her son and her life began to spiral out of control.",
      "A suicide attempt left her in a coma, and she ended up an alcoholic, anorexic heroin addict living in a bomb-damaged building in London's Soho.",
      "She looked back on these years in a BBC interview in 2002, describing her addiction as a kind of brutal therapy.",
      "\"I was in agony and I healed myself as best I could,\" she said. \"One of the ways was with drugs, because they are painkillers.",
      "\"It was all too much for me,\" she explained. \"I really didn't like my gilded cage.\"",
      "Occasional attempts to emerge from her squat in Chelsea failed.",
      "Her voice - affected by drug abuse and laryngitis - had become permanently rough and lower in pitch.",
      "But, a decade after her split with Jagger, Faithfull made Broken English - her most critically acclaimed album.",
      "Gone was the innocence of the 1960s - and in its place, a post-punk performer of depth and world-weary experience.",
      "The album's final track, Why'd Ya Do It?, is the rasping rant of a woman reacting to a man's infidelity - set to a riff inspired by Jimi Hendrix.",
      "It was a moment of metamorphosis: the Rolling Stone party-girl had become a gravel-voiced, truth-telling sophisticate.",
      "The album's critical success was not matched commercially. It did well in France and Germany but reached just number 57 in the UK charts.",
      "But it did earn Faithfull a Grammy nomination in 1981, for best female rock vocal performance.",
      "She moved to America, where Island Records put her into rehab.",
      "Still suffering from alcohol and drug addiction, she had a string of mishaps - including breaking her jaw on the stairs. On one occasion, her heart actually stopped.",
      "But she held it together, and released more than a dozen albums over the next three decades.",
      "She also wrote an autobiography, Faithfull - looking back on the 1960s and 70s with a notable absence of self-pity.",
      "Constantly worried about money, she auctioned off much of her 1960s memorabilia in 2024 - saying that she preferred gardening to looking back.",
      "Now in her late 70s, she had inherited her mother's ancient title and - technically a baroness - was living in Paris.",
      "In the last decade of her life, Faithfull had to cancel concert tours after being diagnosed first with breast cancer and then hepatitis C.",
      "She was also troubled by the complications of a broken back and hip, and thought she would never sing again after weeks in hospital with the coronavirus.",
      "But she never quite lost the creative spark.",
      "In recent years, she published a record that put the words of Keats and Wordsworth to music.",
      "And Negative Capability, her 21st album, was described by the Guardian as a \"masterly mediation on ageing and death\".",
      "It was notable for They Come at Night, her furious response to the Bataclan terror in Paris.",
      "\"They come at night,\" she sang, \"and the world goes blind with fear. Terror in Paris, the future is here.\"",
      "It also dealt with Faithfull's own increasing frailty and loneliness, as well as the loss of close friends, including fellow Rolling Stones muse Anita Pallenberg.",
      "\"I know I'm not young and I'm damaged,\" she wrote defiantly. \"But I'm still pretty kind of funny.\"",
      "Marianne Faithfull will in part be remembered for being Mick Jagger's girlfriend and surviving the horrors of drink and drug addiction.",
      "But her resurrection proved - if proof were needed - a rock star's muse can become a fully fledged, respected artist in her own right.",

      "In December the health secretary announced an indefinite ban on puberty-suppressing drugs for gender dysphoria.",

      "The lawyers said private clinics are providing these to under 18s, despite the fact that they pose at least an equal risk as puberty blockers.",
      "The letter, seen by the BBC, points to potential health risks to children's developing brains, bones and reproductive system.",
      "Keira Bell has previously taken legal action against the NHS - after her treatment when she was a teenager more than a decade ago at what was then the only NHS gender clinic.",
      "She was given puberty blockers at 16 and then the male hormone testosterone at 17 before having surgery to remove her breasts.",
      "Ms Bell, 28, told BBC News: \"I was very vulnerable and was dealing with a lot of issues.",

      "Paul Conrathe, the lawyer who is representing Ms Bell and the two other individuals, said: \"Given what we know about the unscrupulous and harmful practices of unregulated overseas gender clinics it is remarkable that the secretary of state has not banned the prescription of cross-sex hormones.",
      "\"He banned puberty blockers, but failed to ban even more harmful cross-sex hormones that expose children to irreversible lifelong changes.",

      "Cervical screenings, offered by the NHS to all women and people with a cervix aged 25-64, test for the presence of certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes 99% of cervical cancers.",
      "During the test, a nurse uses a speculum - a tool to open the vagina - and a brush to take a sample of cells from the cervix.",

      "How did you feel beforehand?",
      "Erica Donnelly, 26, who lives in Sunderland, waited about a year to book her screening appointment after receiving an invite.",
      "\"I was in a massive panic about it because I have PTSD relating to sexual trauma, so I was really extra nervous about that,\" she says.",
      "When she finally had the test done last month, she brought her partner with her for support and to help her in case she had a flashback or a panic attack. Having them there also made the experience feel more \"comfortable and casual\", she says.",
      "Bianca Ionici, 27, who lives in London, says she put off her cervical screening \"for at least two years\" because of concerns about pain.",
      "But after getting another invite which contained a lot of information about the process, Bianca booked her screening in January.",
      "Other people say they booked their screenings as soon as they could.",
      "Eleanor Gratton, who had her test at the end of last year aged 25, says her friends were scared the process would be \"uncomfortable and painful\". But as more and more people in her group had their screenings, she says they didn't find this to be the case.",
      "What did the test feel like?",
      "Jessica Tse was \"really anxious\" before her cervical screening in December.",
      "\"I didn't know if it was going to hurt\", she says.",
      "But the nurse was \"talking to me, distracting me throughout\" and explained the procedure \"really clearly\", she adds.",
      "\"Pain-wise, it was uncomfortable and it was something I hadn't felt before,\" Bianca recalls.",
      "But \"it was over before I knew\", she says.",
      "Others say they didn't experience any discomfort - like Megan Burns, a social media content creator living in Brighton.",
      "\"It was nothing,\" says Megan, who had her first screening in September aged 25. \"I couldn't feel anything.\" She says the fact she'd already had two children made her less anxious about the experience.",
      "\"These nurses have seen everything,\" Megan adds.",
      "Some people feel under pressure to shave their pubic hair or wear their best underwear, she says. But speaking as a former healthcare worker, Megan says \"you're there to do a job, you don't care about these things\".",
      "While most people only feel light pain at their appointments, some people do experience more discomfort at their appointments.",
      "\"Some people find cervical screening uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful,\" the Eve Appeal says. It notes that some conditions like endometriosis, vaginismus and being menopausal can make the screening painful.",
      "The NHS says that patients are in control of screening and \"can ask the nurse to stop at any time\".",
      "Did you know about the adjustments available?",

      "Some of the people the BBC spoke to said they weren't aware they could have asked for accommodations.",
      "Bianca says she asked the nurse to use a smaller speculum after reading about it online.",
      "But she thinks information about adjustments should be flagged more clearly when you book the appointment, because some need to be thought about in advance - like bringing a friend or booking a double slot.",
      "What is it like to have the test as a transgender man?",
      "Jack Latham, a 28-year-old personal trainer living in Kent, says he received his first screening invite aged 25, just after he came out as trans. He says his GP was \"incredibly supportive\" and there was even a poster in his surgery's waiting room encouraging trans men to have a cervical screening.",
      "Trans and non-binary people who have a cervix should still have regular cervical screenings.",
      "Jack says he'd put off the appointment out of fear, until he went for a blood test in summer 2024 and the nurse offered him a cervical screening on the spot.",
      "\"It was so much quicker and much less of a bigger deal,\" Jack says. \"It's nowhere near as bad as you think it will be.\"",
      "Some trans men previously told the BBC they had not been invited to get cervical screenings because they were listed as male on medical records, though they still had a cervix.",
      "How could the process be improved?",
      "The NHS wants to encourage more people to go for their cervical screenings. NHS England has promised to eliminate cervical cancer by 2040.",
      "Women aged 25-49 are encouraged to have a screening every three years, while women aged 50-64 should have one every five years.",
      "NHS England data from March 2024 showed 44.5% of women aged 25-29 had not been screened in the last 3.5 years. For those aged 30-34, this figure was 35.3%.",
      "The proportion of younger women who have been adequately screened has been falling a little in recent years.",
      "Dr Sue Mann, NHS national clinical director for women's health, told the BBC in a statement that medics know that some women find screenings \"very worrying and uncomfortable\".",
      "She emphasised that adjustments are always available and that women should book their screenings, even if they were invited months or years ago.",
      "A display at the Vagina Museum in east London last year encouraged visitors to write improvements they'd like to see to the NHS's cervical screening service on slips of paper.",
      "Artist Ella Clancy, who produced the display, says common requests included more information about the adjustments available - especially asking for smaller speculums - nurses talking people through exactly what they were doing as they performed the screening and staff being more trauma-aware.",
      "Eleanor says there should be more education around what HPV is. School pupils are typically vaccinated against HPV between year eight and year 10 but Eleanor says it wasn't clear at the time what the jab was for.",
      "Jessica thinks doctors should explain the results using plainer language, and says she had to call her GP for further explanation after receiving her results letter.",
      "Would you rather do the test yourself?",
      "Some people prefer to carry out medical tests in the comfort of their own homes where possible. Do-it-yourself cervical tests are available in some countries, and researchers at King's College London trialled them in London in 2021 with \"fantastic\" results. They involve doing a vaginal swab which is then sent to a lab.",
      "The NHS said last year it was assessing whether to roll the scheme out more widely.",
      "Eleanor says she felt \"reassured\" knowing that a healthcare professional performed her first screening, but would try doing an at-home version of the test after that if the option were available.",
      "Jack, on the other hand, has his doubts. He says he'd prefer an at-home kit for \"the convenience and flexibility\" but that he'd \"have some hesitation about whether I'd done it correctly\".",

      "A gene-editing therapy for sickle cell disease, with a price tag of \u00a31.65m, is to be offered to patients on the NHS in England.",
      "About 50 people a year with the inherited blood disorder are likely to receive it, experts say.",
      "Prof Bola Owolabi, of NHS England, called it a \"monumental step forward\", and said the one-off treatment Casgevy, also known as Exa-cel, \"holds a very real prospect of  a cure\".",
      "A confidential agreement has been made with manufacturer Vertex on how much the NHS will pay.",
      "Campaigners have described the treatment as \"groundbreaking\" and its availability on the NHS as a \"milestone\".",
      "Sickle cell disease can be life-threatening and cause recurring intense pain, when blood vessels become blocked by misshapen red cells.",
      "About 15,000 people in England live with the condition, which mainly affects people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage.",
      "It is caused by genetic change that means people make haemoglobin - a key protein in red blood cells - that doesn't work properly.",
      "This results in red blood cells becoming sickle in shape and stiff and sticky - rather than flexible smooth discs.",
      "These sickle cells do not live as long as healthy red blood cells and can clump as they travel around blood vessels - reducing oxygen to vital parts of the body.",
      "This puts people at risk of organ damage, stroke, heart failure and a greatly  reduced quality of life.",
      "In trials all patients who received the therapy - which tweaks a specific gene and allows the body to make more healthy red blood cells - avoided stays in hospital for a year after treatment and most for three-and-a-half years. Further data is still being studied.",
      "NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the therapy \"could be absolutely transformative \u2013 it could enable patients to live free from the fear of sickle cell crises hanging over them\".",
      "Asiawu Imam, 26, lives in London, where she works as a nurse looking after people who have sickle cell disorder. She also lives with the condition.",

      "\"It feels like a stabbing pain, like someone is stabbing you form the inside outwards. It can last anything from half an hour to four days. It is excruciating,\" she said.",
      "The therapy being made available on the NHS gives her hope, and a sense to the community that people with the condition are being taken seriously.",
      "\"This is going to be a life-changing moment for many of my patients.\"",
      "How the gene therapy works",
      "It is a multi-step process.",
      "First, blood stem cells from a patient's bone marrow (where all blood cells originate) are removed from the body.",
      "In the laboratory, a gene-editing tool called Crispr is used.",
      "This allows a specific gene to be pinpointed and very precise editing to take place.",
      "However, instead of directly editing a faulty gene, Casgevy instead takes advantage of a process that happens when babies are in the womb, where they make red blood cells with foetal haemoglobin (a key protein that carries oxygen). This switches to the adult form once they are born.",
      "Crucially foetal haemoglobin is not affected by sickle cell disease, so Crispr acts by dampening down the \"switch\" that makes the body produce the adult form.",
      "Patients have to undergo \"conditioning\" chemotherapy to make sure their bodies are ready to accept the edited stem cells.",
      "Modified stem cells are then transfused back into the body, where they multiply and increase the production of stable, well-functioning red cells.",
      "The full treatment must be considered carefully - it can involve lengthy stays in hospital and may have side effects, including headaches and bleeding problems.",
      "UK approves gene-edit drug for sickle cell disease",
      "First gene-editing therapy may cure blood disorder",
      "The only other current option for a cure is a stem cell transplant - but this can only happen if a closely matched donor is available. There is also a risk of the transplant being rejected.",
      "The gene therapy will be available in specialist centres in London, Manchester and Birmingham to people aged 12 and over who get recurrent sickle cell crises and who cannot find a donor for a stem cell transplant.",
      "John James, chief executive of the Sickle Cell Society, said: \"We are absolutely thrilled to see this groundbreaking gene therapy treatment available on the NHS\", adding \"the significance of this milestone for the sickle cell community could not be understated\".",
      "He said the news would \"give hope to many\" and was \"incredible\".",
      "However, he added: \"We remain acutely aware that not everyone with sickle cell will be eligible for the potentially life-changing benefits of Casgevy.",
      "\"There is still much work ahead to ensure that everyone living with sickle cell has access to the care, treatments, and support they deserve.\"",
      "The therapy has already been approved for another inherited blood disorder, transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.",

      "Heated tobacco is different from vapes, which contain nicotine but no tobacco, and they are much less popular. But tobacco companies are keen to promote it as a new revenue stream to replace dwindling cigarette sales.",
      "The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), which represents local authority trading standards teams, says the ads are \"prohibited\" by the 2002 law.",
      "CTSI says the issue has never been tested in court, so it cannot say conclusively that running them is illegal.",
      "\"The only people who can definitively test it are the courts. Now the courts are chocka. Trading Standards is very stretched, and I think that's probably the reason why you're seeing more and more of these ads,\" Kate Pike, lead officer for tobacco and vaping at CTSI, told the BBC.",

      "Overall levels of the virus have not yet reached the peak of recent years.",

      "Recent work by researchers from the UK's Royal Veterinary College and institutions in China found possible evidence that they may be linked to changes in how the virus evolves.",
      "They carried out genetic analysis of avian flu samples collected from wild birds and farmed poultry between 1996 and 2023.",
      "While they found that infections occurred more often in unvaccinated birds, they also found that in countries with high vaccination rates, there was a higher rate of change in the virus itself.",

      "The government will step in more quickly to help struggling schools based on the findings of new Ofsted report cards, the education secretary has said.",
      "Bridget Phillipson said in a speech on Monday that the old single-word Ofsted judgements, which were scrapped last year, were \"too blunt\" and \"too vague\" to serve a purpose.",
      "She said new regional teams, with a budget of up to \u00a3100,000 per school, would help turn around the 600 \"stuck\" schools in England which had received back-to-back negative judgements from Ofsted.",
      "However, the report cards have drawn strong criticism from school leaders, who said the proposals risk \"replicating the worst aspects of the current system\".",
      "Prof Julia Waters, whose sister Ruth Perry took her own life after an Ofsted inspection, said it appeared to be \"a rehash of the discredited and dangerous system it is meant to replace\".",

      "Phillipson pushed back on the criticism of the report cards after her speech, saying parents wanted more information about schools.",
      "She also said she was \"delighted to see the debate raging\" over the proposed reforms, saying \"that is how we shape the best education system\".",
      "She said report cards would provide \"rich, granular insight\" which would help to deliver \"tailored\" support for struggling schools.",
      "Those schools which do not improve will be transferred to a successful academy trust, even if they are already run by a different academy or a council.",
      "Under Ofsted's proposals, the old one or two-word judgements, ranging across four grades from \"Outstanding\" to \"Inadequate\", will be replaced from the 2025 autumn term by a report card describing what inspectors have found on key aspects of each school, including:",

      "Quality of education",
      "Behaviour and attendance",
      "Personal development",

      "A separate part of the report card will say whether the school's duties around safeguarding have been met.",
      "The new format will be used for inspections across all settings, from early years to further education colleges, but will be tailored to the type of provider, Ofsted said.",
      "Ofsted boss Sir Martyn Oliver said the proposals were designed to \"raise standards and improve the lives of children, particularly the most disadvantaged\".",
      "He said the \"suite of grades\" would give parents \"much more detail\" and help identify a school's strengths and areas for improvement.",

      "Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the plans would generate a \"new league table based on the sum of Ofsted judgements across at least 40 points of comparison\".",
      "It would be \"bewildering for teachers and leaders, never mind the parents whose choices these reports are supposedly intended to guide\", he added.",

      "Those comments came in the wake of the inquest into Ruth Perry's death, in which the coroner said the inspection at her school had \"lacked fairness, respect and sensitivity\" and was at times \"rude and intimidating\".",
      "Ofsted removed its practice of issuing overall grades for a school at the start of the current academic year, bringing in a temporary system of grading individual aspects of a school's performance, ahead of the introduction of report cards later this year.",

      "Possessing AI paedophile manuals - which teach people how to use AI for sexual abuse - will also be made illegal, and offenders will get up to three years in prison.",
      "\"What we're seeing is that AI is now putting the online child abuse on steroids,\" Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.",
      "Cooper said AI was \"industrialising the scale\" of sexual abuse against children and said government measures \"may have to go further.\"",
      "Other laws set to be introduced include making it an offence to run websites where paedophiles can share child sexual abuse content or provide advice on how to groom children. That would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "And the Border Force will be given powers to instruct individuals who they suspect of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection when they attempt to enter the UK, as CSAM is often filmed abroad. Depending on the severity of the images, this will be punishable by up to three years in prison.",
      "Artificially generated CSAM involves images that are either partly or completely computer generated. Software can \"nudify\" real images and replace the face of one child with another, creating a realistic image.",
      "In some cases, the real-life voices of children are also used, meaning innocent survivors of abuse are being re-victimised.",
      "Fake images are also being used to blackmail children and force victims into further abuse.",

      "Cooper said: \"You have perpetrators who are using AI to help them better groom or blackmail teenagers and children, distorting images and using those to draw young people into further abuse, just the most horrific things taking place and also becoming more sadistic.\"",
      "She continued: \"This is an area where the technology doesn't stand still and our response cannot stand still to keep children safe.\"",

      "Prof Clare McGlynn, an expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse, said the changes were \"welcome\" but that there were \"significant gaps\".",
      "The government should ban \"nudify\" apps and tackle the \"normalisation of sexual activity with young-looking girls on the mainstream porn sites\", she said, describing these videos as \"simulated child sexual abuse videos\".",
      "These videos \"involve adult actors but they look very young and are shown in children's bedrooms, with toys, pigtails, braces and other markers of childhood,\" she said. \"This material can be found with the most obvious search terms and legitimises and normalises child sexual abuse. Unlike in many other countries, this material remains lawful in the UK.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) warns that more sexual abuse AI images of children are being produced, with them becoming more prevalent on the open web.",
      "The charity's latest data shows reports of AI-generated CSAM have risen 380% with 245 confirmed reports in 2024 compared with 51 in 2023. Each report can contain thousands of images.",
      "In research last year it found that over a one-month period, 3,512 AI child sexual abuse and exploitation images were discovered on one dark website. Compared with a month in the previous year, the number of the most severe category images (Category A) had risen by 10%.",
      "Experts say AI CSAM can often look incredibly realistic, making it difficult to tell the real from the fake.",
      "The interim chief executive of the IWF, Derek Ray-Hill, said: \"The availability of this AI content further fuels sexual violence against children.",
      "\"It emboldens and encourages abusers, and it makes real children less safe. There is certainly more to be done to prevent AI technology from being exploited, but we welcome [the] announcement, and believe these measures are a vital starting point.\"",
      "Lynn Perry, chief executive of children's charity Barnardo's, welcomed government action to tackle AI-produced CSAM \"which normalises the abuse of children, putting more of them at risk, both on and offline\".",
      "\"It is vital that legislation keeps up with technological advances to prevent these horrific crimes,\" she added.",
      "\"Tech companies must make sure their platforms are safe for children. They need to take action to introduce stronger safeguards, and Ofcom must ensure that the Online Safety Act is implemented effectively and robustly.\"",

Just over half of our power currently comes from wind, solar, nuclear and biomass - organic matter.  The government wants to raise that to 95% by 2030 - just five years' time.",

      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to take on the \"naysayers\" and \"Nimbys\" [Not in My Back Yard], who he says stand in the way of national growth by making repeated legal challenges to planning decisions.",
      "That message was underscored last week. Chancellor Rachel Reeves vowed to go \"further and faster\" in her effort to deliver the government's growth agenda as she announced a series of potentially controversial new infrastructure projects, including backing plans for a third runway at Heathrow.",

      "It will also mean more pylons, cables and substations. But what about the local communities who told us they felt they were not being heard and feared their concerns would be overridden?",
      "\"The answer is to listen to local people but to make decisions. That's what our country needs,\" Mr Milliband says.",
      "He says the government has committed to provide direct benefits to affected communities via community funds, he adds. People who live near transmission lines could also have discounts on their energy bills.",

      "Violent and extremist videos are still online despite government calls for their removal, the home secretary has told the BBC.",
      "Yvette Cooper condemned tech giants for failing to take down disturbing videos, including footage watched by the Southport killer, calling their response \"disgraceful\" and a clear breach of their \"moral responsibilities\".",
      "Last week it emerged that Axel Rudakubana, who murdered three young girls and seriously injured eight other children and two adults at a dance class in July, had watched graphic footage of a knife attack in Australia and downloaded an academic study of an Al-Qaeda training manual.",
      "Cooper told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that, despite her letter to X, Meta, TikTok, Google, and YouTube, much of the harmful content is still available.",
      "She said: \"I think, frankly, that is disgraceful, because they have a moral responsibility.\"",

      "In the home secretary's letter, which was co-written with Technology Secretary Peter Kyle, Cooper said that, while possession of the al-Qaeda study was illegal under existing anti-terror laws, Rudakubana had been \"able to easily obtain access\" to it.",
      "Kuenssberg asked Cooper why, given her position as home secretary, she appeared to be powerless to stop it. The home secretary said the Online Safety Act, which comes into force this spring, will require social media platforms to remove illegal content. She warned that the government is ready to take further steps if these companies don't comply.",
      "Visibly angry, Cooper said: \"They really should be doing more, but this will mean if they don't, then there will be new penalties brought in. Much stronger action can be taken against them and then further stronger measures on the protection of children later in the year.\"",
      "Rudakubana had been referred to the Prevent counter-terror programme three times between 2019 and 2021 and was known to authorities including the police and social services.",
      "Kuenssberg asked who was responsible for stopping individuals like Rudakubana, given that he had been flagged to multiple agencies.",

      "\"Different organisations all have partial responsibilities, but that network collectively failed to identify the scale of risk that this young man poses.\"",
      "Asked what she proposed as a remedy to the problem, Cooper said \"the system needs to be strengthened.\"",
      "She pointed out that when someone demonstrates clear ideological extremism, such as Islamist extremism, the Prevent programme is well-equipped to intervene. But when individuals, like Rudakubana, show a dangerous obsession with extreme violence \u2013 without a clear ideology \u2013 the current system struggles to address the threat.",
      "\"The impact of what they do may be terrorising in the same way,\" she said, explaining that such individuals can cause widespread fear, even if their motives are not linked to terrorism.",
      "Kuenssberg once again pressed the home secretary on a solution and Cooper acknowledged that, in some cases, mental health services might need to take the lead, while in others, the police or social services should be more involved.",
      "She claimed that the current approach is a legacy of previous failures and suggested that the inception of youth prevention partnerships, which would bring together different agencies, could be a step towards a more coordinated response.",
      "But she said the inquiry into the Southport attack must focus on identifying how the system failed and how future tragedies can be prevented.",
      "\"We are not keeping up with the challenge that we're seeing,\" she said.",

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced at the end of January that the government would look at changing laws to allow perpetrators of \"extreme individualised violence,\" like Rudakubana, to be charged with terrorism offences.",

      "Valentyna - not her real name - applied for her 12-year-old son to join her in the UK last August but her application had remained pending because Ukrainians were no longer allowed to act as sponsors.",
      "She first came to the UK before the invasion for seasonal work on a farm and extended her visa when the war broke out.",
      "Her son was staying with relatives in Odessa while she found somewhere permanent to live before applying for him to join her.",
      "Valentyna has not seen her son for six months and became emotional when asked how it felt to be separated from him.",
      "She told the BBC the change in the rules gave her hope they would finally be reunited.",
      "Dora-Olivia Vicol, chief executive of Work Rights Centre, a charity supporting migrants, said: \"It will come as a huge relief to those parents who have been separated from their children, and will finally be able to bring them to the UK to reunite in safety.\"",
      "She added: \"However, this action does not help those who have been forced apart from other family members, including siblings, parents or partners.",
      "\"We know there are many Ukrainians in the UK who left behind elderly, sick or disabled relatives with the belief they would be able to bring them later. They face a cruel choice: leave the safety of the UK to care for them in Ukraine, or remain in safety leaving their loved ones vulnerable at risk.\"",
      "The charity says it has heard from hundreds of Ukrainians separated from family members and trying to bring them to the UK.",
      "Settled, another charity which supports Ukrainians applying for visas, said some families had resorted to bringing their children to join them through illegal routes, rather than leave them in danger.",
      "Yuliia Ismail, an immigration advisor for the charity, said: \"We ask that the Home Office now acts quickly to decide outstanding applications from children stuck in Ukrainian conflict zones some of which have been in limbo for almost a year.\"",
      "A Home Office spokesperson said: \"Under the previous government, a change was made to the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which meant that parents could not sponsor their children to join them in the UK even if they had appropriate accommodation.",
      "\"We have taken urgent action to resolve this issue, which will now enable parents with Ukraine Scheme visas to sponsor their children to join them in the UK. These will apply to both applications that have already been made, as well as future applications.\""

    "story": [
      "The Home Office's response to the \"serious and growing problem\" of violence against women and girls (VAWG) has been ineffective, the UK's spending watchdog has said.",
      "In a report published on Friday, the National Audit Office (NAO) said the department had \"not led an effective whole-system response\" to the rising incidence of rape and sexual assault recorded by police.",
      "Its efforts as the lead on the government's response to VAWG have so far \"not improved outcomes\" for victims, the report found.",
      "A Home Office spokesperson said the report had looked at the previous government's \"failure to deliver systemic change\", and that Labour was \"delivering a step-change in the government's response\".",
      "The report noted that three separate strategies aimed at reducing VAWG have been published since 2010, when the Conservative party began its 14 years in power.",
      "But the NAO said its own analysis of Office for National Statistics data showed the percentage of women aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales to have suffered a sexual assault was estimated to be 4.3% in 2023-24, up from 3.4% in 2009-10.",
      "It said incidents of rape and sexual assault recorded by police had increased almost fourfold during the same period, from 34,000 to 123,000 - but cautioned that this could be partially explained by improved recording of these crimes.",
      "The NAO also found \"little evidence\" that the Home Office had improved on earlier strategies, while the department and the wider government had \"a poor understanding of what works to prevent and tackle VAWG\".",
      "The report added that as part of the 2021 strategy, at least \u00a34.2m had been spent on research into preventing VAWG, but the projects it funded were \"yet to provide insights to inform any future interventions\".",
      "The report noted that \"low charge rate and long wait times\" contributed to a considerable number of rape victims dropping out before cases reached a conviction.",
      "Meanwhile, only a minority of domestic abuse cases recorded by police led to charges, the NAO said.",
      "In 2021, under the previous Conservative government, the department created a dedicated team to lead VAWG strategy.",
      "The NAO said the Home Office \"found it challenging to get buy-in from other government departments\" and had a \"limited understanding\" of the extent of resources devoted to addressing VAWG across government.",
      "Its dedicated team did not meet until a year after the launch, the NAO found, and had only met four times in total.",
      "The Home Office \"does not know what effect the government's work is having on VAWG\", the report said.",
      "The NAO said: \"Government's efforts to tackle violence against women and girls have not yet improved outcomes for the victims of these crimes.",
      "\"The lack of an effective, cross-government approach and a limited understanding of what works to help reduce these crimes, means the Home Office cannot be confident that government is doing the best it can to keep women and girls safe.\"",

      "Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: \"The lack of attention to prevention is deplorable, especially as we know VAWG is significantly under-reported.\"",
      "But she added that the strategy's \"worth\" could not \"be determined solely on a value-for-money basis\".",
      "\"The harms of VAWG are so significant and far-reaching that the societal importance of addressing it must be recognised,\" Ms Simon said.",

      "\"We know all too well VAWG is horrifically common,\" she added.",

      "The Chancellor has said she would now support the expansion of Leeds Bradford Airport (LBA), saying \"the way we fly has changed\".",
      "As Leeds West MP, Reeves had opposed proposals for a new terminal at the Yorkshire site over environmental and noise concerns.",
      "On Wednesday, Reeves announced the government's backing of a third runway at London Heathrow and the re-opening of the Doncaster Sheffield airport, citing the progress of \"sustainable aviation\" since the pandemic.",
      "In 2022, LBA's \u00a3150m scheme to develop a new terminal was abandoned over planning delays, in favour of an earlier proposal to regenerate the current terminal.",
      "Speaking in Yorkshire following the government decision to back a third runway at Heathrow, the chancellor said \"sustainable aviation and economic growth go hand-in-hand\".",
      "She defended her previous position of opposing the Leeds Bradford expansion, insisting \"a lot has changed since 2020 when those plans last came forward - no one was flying because it was during the pandemic, but also the way we fly has changed\".",

      "From Saturday, the alcohol tax will rise by 3.6%, in line with the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation.",
      "There will also be further increases in duty for some drinks, depending on their strength.",
      "A new system of duties based on strength was introduced in August 2023, although some wines were given a temporary reprieve. This relief is now ending.",
      "The Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) says the changes mean duty on a 14.5% ABV bottle of red wine will have risen by 98p over the past 18 months.",
      "The WTSA argues that the tax rises are self-defeating for the government, as revenues from alcohol tax are lower than the previous year.",
      "\"The government continues to claim that the tax hikes are part of their big plan to plug the black hole in the public finances, but a series of record-breaking tax levies are doing the exact opposite,\" said WSTA chief executive Miles Beale.",
      "\"There are no winners under the UK's punishing alcohol tax regime \u2013 higher duty rates mean people buy less which results in reduced income to the Exchequer, businesses are being squeezed and consumers have to pay more.\"",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said: \"The alcohol duty reforms have modernised and simplified the duty system, prioritising public health and incentivising consumption of lower strength products.\"",
      "As well as cutting the tax on draught alcohol, the government is also increasing small producer relief for products which are below 8.5% ABV. The relief tapers away as production is increased.",

    "story": [
      "Endangering lives at sea is to be a new criminal offence carrying a jail term of up to five years as part of plans to tackle people smuggling, the Home Office says.",
      "Border officials will also get powers to seize migrants' phones in the search for intelligence about who helped them cross the Channel.",
      "Those convicted of acts in preparation of smuggling, such as buying boat parts, face up to 14 years in jail, in an attempt to tackle gangs at a far earlier stage in their preparations.",
      "The package retains some powers introduced by the Conservatives, including longer forms of detention for some migrants and restricting when someone who says they have been trafficked into slavery can stay in the UK.",
      "How many people cross the Channel in small boats?",
      "Suspected people smugglers face phone and travel ban",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC's political editor Chris Mason the government was planning to bring in the new laws this year.",
      "She said counter-terror style powers would mean \"we can step in much earlier to take action on those who are facilitating the boats\".",
      "However, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said it was \"a weak bill from a weak government\", which re-announces steps taken by his party when it was in power.",
      "He described the changes as \"minor tinkering\" and said a real deterrent was needed, after Labour scrapped a scheme which would have seen some migrants sent to Rwanda.",
      "The new offence of endangering lives at sea could lead to the prosecution of anyone arriving in the UK on a small and unsafe boat who has been involved in intimidating or coercing others passengers to take part in the journey, or who has refused to be rescued outside of British waters.",
      "Boat launches from French beaches are often terrifying and dangerous, investigators say, with some of the passengers doing the work of gangs by forcing reluctant travellers to climb on board.",
      "Officials say they have come across migrants who had managed to get into a small boat then held out babies to stop others climbing in.",
      "A senior law enforcement official said investigators often found themselves dealing with \"traumatised victims in a floating crime scene\".",
      "The five-year term for endangering lives is in addition to existing laws, such as grievous bodily harm or attempted murder, that may result from people smuggling.",
      "The planned new tools, inspired by successes in counter-terrorism cases, also include court orders to ban suspects from travelling, or promoting smuggling on social media.",
      "Asylum and refugee campaigners say the government's focus on policing powers is at the expense of devising more safe routes for people genuinely in need.",
      "Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the government was right to tackle smuggling gangs.",
      "\"But we are very concerned that by creating new offences, many refugees themselves could also be prosecuted,\" he added.",
      "Other measures in the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill aim to make it easier for law enforcement agencies to pursue gangs as they prepare to smuggle people into the UK, rather than have to wait to charge them with crimes after a movement has occurred.",
      "Ministers hope these powers will mean the police will be able to arrest and charge more gang members, or seek their extradition from abroad, before boats have left France.",
      "The proposed powers are based on legal principles that have been used for 20 years to apprehend suspected terrorists at much early stages of their planning.",
      "One of these \"preparatory\" powers will be a crime of being involved in the handling or selling boat parts, where there is a suspicion the trade is for people smuggling.",
      "People who promote crossings, take bookings and arrange for potential passengers to meet boats in northern France could also face prosecution.",
      "Serious Crime Prevention Orders, a power to restrict the liberties of offenders, will be reformed so that the National Crime Agency can temporarily impose conditions on the lives of suspected smugglers, while they build a case.",
      "Those conditions could include bans on travel, internet and mobile phone use and how they can move money.",
      "Ministers say the new legislation is part of a broader strategy including giving the recently-created Border Security Commander powers to co-ordinate operations and lead talks with foreign law enforcement agencies.",
      "A recent deal with Germany has seen the country agree to introduce a new crime of illegal immigration to the UK, so investigators can target gangs operating in the country.  Bulgarian authorities have begun using health and safety laws to seize shipments of inflatables from Turkey.",
      "But law enforcement chiefs say they have wanted new powers at home too.",
      "Police believe people smuggling involves hundreds rather than thousands of perpetrators, and was \"not like the drugs trade\".",
      "\"With concerted effort and legislation you can make a difference\" they told reporters, in a background briefing on the basis that those speaking would not be named.",
      "In one recent example, Amanj Hasan Zada was jailed for 17 years for organising small boat crossings from Preston.",
      "The National Crime Agency only won the case last November with evidence linking his activities to specific crossings.",
      "Under the proposed new powers, investigators would simply have to show suspects such as Zada had made preparations, such as funding boats or promoting crossings.",

    "summary": "The government is not just looking at reforming the benefits system - it is preparing to put it at the heart of its economic agenda.",
    "story": [
      "When Sir Keir Starmer was preparing to run for the Labour leadership in 2020, his campaign director told the future prime minister what mattered to the party.",
      "Morgan McSweeney emphasised that whatever their faction, Labour members shared certain core principles - and top of the list was a commitment to combatting poverty and defending the welfare state.",
      "That is why any Labour politician treads carefully when looking at welfare reform.",
      "This government, though, is not just looking at reforming welfare  - it is preparing to put it at the heart of its economic agenda.",
      "In Rachel Reeves's big speech on growth this week, she vowed that to achieve \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system, the government would look at areas that have been \"ducked for too long, like the rising cost of health and disability benefits\".",
      "What did that mean?",
      "The question is being frantically addressed between the Treasury and the Department of Work of Pensions (DWP) right now.",
      "Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, will present a \"green paper\" - or policy proposals - on welfare reform in just over a month, designed to demonstrate how serious the government is about finding ways to get more people into work - and save money from the welfare budget.",
      "That dual motive explains why this is being treated as such an urgent issue at the top of government.",
      "Ministers are concerned by a situation in which the amount of people who are in receipt of certain benefits has surged. Meanwhile, the Treasury needs to ensure that it is not on course to break its own self-imposed fiscal rules.",
      "\"It's high up the agenda for us because of the cost implications but also the broader economic problem of having so many people economically inactive,\" a Treasury source said.",
      "And in 10 Downing Street, aides say that tackling this issue would be the clearest sign yet that Sir Keir is truly serious about reforming public services.",
      "Last year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around \u00a3100bn before the next general election.",
      "Some of this is the legacy of Covid. But the chancellor has made clear her view that another reason for this surge is the \"perverse incentives\" wired into the system.",
      "Again and again, ministers and officials complain of a system where those on universal credit are required to display evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.",
      "Ministers believe that this encourages some people to \"game the system\". Some Labour advisers fear this issue is being exacerbated, especially among young people, by videos on TikTok and other platforms which explain to claimants the best ways to fill out questionnaires in order to get sickness benefits.",
      "One option officials are examining is whether there should be \u2013 as in the past - a third path whereby some people on sickness benefits are required to seek work - but without the risk that they lose their sickness benefits.",
      "\"Lots of people tell us they're scared to go to work in case it doesn't work out and they then can't go back to the safety net,\" a senior government source said.",
      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "Labour says it will cut benefits bill in its own way",
      "DWP must focus on work not welfare, says minister",
      "Some in government say this may need more frequent assessments of claimants' health, but those involved in discussions acknowledge that being required to explain their condition to the DWP can often be \"traumatic\", \"humiliating\" and \"terrifying\" for vulnerable claimants.",
      "Better training and coaching can help, but the amount of money involved may not sit well with a Treasury that's in savings mode.",
      "That's complicated enough - and that's before you even get to the finances and the politics.",
      "On the finances, this round of welfare reform is designed to generate savings that can be \"scored\", in other words accounted for, by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the next Budget in the autumn.",
      "But those involved in past Budgets caution that it is \"basically impossible\" to persuade the OBR that the savings will actually happen.",
      "And then there's the politics.",
      "As McSweeney, now Sir Keir's chief of staff, found - the Labour Party is deeply committed to the welfare state and deeply anxious about anything which looks like the safety net is fraying.",
      "That's not just true of party members but MPs too. Among the vast 2024 intake of Labour MPs, one of their most common reasons for getting involved in the Labour Party was opposition to Conservative austerity and welfare cuts.",
      "That means that even some of those most loyal to Starmer and Reeves are privately expressing significant anxiety about the direction of travel.",
      "Some of these tensions are beginning to spill into public view.",
      "At PMQs this week Debbie Abrahams, the Labour chair of the work and pensions select committee, said that \"speculation\" about billions of pounds of savings to be found from the social security budget had left \"many vulnerable claimants [feeling] worried\".",
      "She warned the prime minister that \"language matters\".",
      "Senior Labour figures involved in the discussions are adamant that it is Reeves and Starmer who are in line with public opinion, not concerned Labour MPs.",
      "One complained: \"If you ask Labour MPs whether they'd rather be on the side of the public or on the side of a lot of the Labour movement and vocal disability campaigners - well, for some of them that's a marginal call.\"",
      "Others caution about public opinion on this issue though: \"The public think they support welfare cuts until they hear a story about someone they feel sympathy for losing money. Then they don't.\"",
      "Some older hands warn of how quickly the government could be left out of step with its base, pointing to the party's decision to abstain on a Conservative welfare bill in July 2015.",
      "Such was the scale of Labour members' fury that Conservative welfare cuts were not being opposed, it is seen by many as the main reason that Jeremy Corbyn's longshot leadership campaign took off.",
      "Jon Ashworth, a former shadow cabinet minister who is still close to top party figures, urged the government to put \"helping people move into good, well-paid jobs\" at the heart of their arguments for reform.",
      "He said: \"The welfare system as currently designed traps people out of work and actively denies people who want to work real, genuine help.\"",
      "These political considerations are not new territory for Reeves. She was shadow work and pensions secretary for two years before the 2015 general election.",
      "Her vow that Labour would be \"tougher than the Tories on benefits\" made her deeply controversial with the party's grassroots for years afterwards. Speaking to the New Statesman in 2021, Reeves acknowledged she may have made her point \"badly\", but insisted that \"spending more on benefits wasn't always a sign of success. And actually the benefits bill goes up when society fails.\"",
      "These dilemmas may not be new for Reeves, but they have left some of her colleagues feeling uneasy at best.",
      "\"Of course I'm worried about the politics of this,\" one minister said.",
      "\"Anyone with a brain would worry about this.\"",

    "title": "Five key impacts of Brexit five years on",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:41:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.",

      "When Labour swept to victory last summer, Reeves pledged she would be an \"iron\" chancellor, reining in public spending and improving the lives of working people through growing the economy. Without solid public finances, she argued, the government couldn't achieve any of its other aims.",
      "This month has tested that plan.",
      "It started off with a global bond market tantrum - UK borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years and the pound fell sharply.",
      "Some argued that Reeves's Budget decisions had made the UK more vulnerable to such shocks. The prime minister was forced to confirm Reeves had his backing after political opponents called for her resignation.",
      "The market turbulence sparked concerns that a verdict of sorts was being made on the chancellor.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament. That meant, the rise in global and UK debt interest costs would require some spending cuts.",
      "The message was sent out that the government, with its massive majority, could do and would do what it takes to keep to the self-imposed rules, which it said were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The markets have now recovered all their negative moves. Short term and long term government borrowing costs are all lower than at the beginning of the year.",
      "While the \"gilt crisis\" hyperbole was overdone, there have been consequences.",
      "From doom to promises of a boom",
      "The chancellor sped up an already planned \"drumbeat\" of pro-growth measures, culminating in this week's speech. Reeves's counsel of doom and warnings about black holes and pain has been replaced by a promise of an investment boom.",
      "She has vowed a new runway at Heathrow, visas for those with AI and life science skills and said she would ease the non-dom ban to allow a more generous phase out of tax benefits.",
      "Alongside this are plans to make it easier to build, delays to new rules on banks and the ousting of the boss of the competition regulator, which shows she's serious on growth. As Meatloaf might have scripted for her: \"I would do anything for growth\".",
      "But Reeves's plans are not yet a fully fledged growth plan. Her announcements signal that she is willing to take a series of political hits to foster long term growth.",
      "The chancellor will deploy the near total executive power from her party's commons majority to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Some outside advisers who support the chancellor say that stability is not enough, and nor is planning, and nor is deregulation.",
      "Reeves has not pledged any allocation of public money to these grand projects.",
      "Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye sounded a little coy after plans for a third runway were confirmed, saying they would not spend more money on it unless they really believed it was going to happen.",
      "\"This will take years, it will take what I call Churchillian resolve and lots of ingenuity but we can trust a government that will be with us for many years to deliver this,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Reeves's UK growth mission",
      "Reeves is focusing on a very specific type of growth - increasing the supply of goods and services. She believes a lack of this supply side growth has held back the UK, and she is on a mission to remove barriers, and open new markets.",
      "For example, Reeves is very concerned about small businesses who have told her they have given up on exporting to the EU, because post Brexit it is now easier to export to the US.",
      "At a meeting last week, one business told the chancellor that exports to Europe meant for Christmas, had only just arrived.",
      "The problem is that while the chancellor awaits a long term growth spurt, she has prioritised stabilising public finances through significant tax rises.",
      "In April, employers will be hit with an increase in national insurance payments and a higher minimum wage. These costs could be passed on in price rises meaning inflation - already higher than target at 2.5%, could remain sticky.",
      "Reeves would have preferred employers to squeeze pay settlements rather than raise prices or cut staff.",
      "Retail and hospitality businesses using low wage labour will be most impacted by the bumper rise in minimum wages. Downing Street insiders acknowledge that many domestic business bosses are \"grumpy\" as they put it.",
      "The concern is whether the impact will show up in higher unemployment. At last October's Budget, the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted extra government spending would help boost the economy and bring unemployment down to 4% this year. Some outside forecasters now think it will top 5%.",
      "It is a critical few months for the animal spirits in the economy to reignite.",
      "How far will she go?",
      "But how far is Rachel Reeves willing to push this pro-growth agenda?",
      "Will she follow the US away from the decarbonisation path to benefit from cheaper hydrocarbon prices promised by President Trump? Will she accede to construction industry requests to import foreign workers to meet the target to build 1.5 million homes?",
      "Will she push the Brexit reset to remove all the barriers to UK-EU trade in food and farm products, and many goods too? Will she offer Britain to the global tech and pharma industries as a deregulatory haven from the EU and US respectively?",
      "Taken at face value, she will do most of this, with big political consequences. Take the Brexit reset. Cabinet ministers at The World Economic Forum were delighted with the tone of the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic in his interview with me, saying he was open to Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "The arrangement allows for tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.",
      "But if the UK demanded effective single market treatment in certain sectors, it would need to follow the EU rule book in those areas. There would be counter asks, such as extending EU fishing arrangements in UK waters, and some sort of youth cultural exchange scheme.",
      "The need for delicate diplomacy",
      "Push is coming to shove on these issues, and the question is whether the chancellor's pro growth agenda is the overwhelming factor in making decisions. I suspect it is.",
      "However, that approach will require delicate diplomacy in the middle of a potential goods tariff war. If Trump follows through on his threat of a universal tariff then the G7 could decide to coordinate retaliatory tariffs. Does the UK join in?",
      "What if the US decides it wants its allies to help contain China's tech ascendancy? What if Trump wants to deter the UK from rebuilding free-flowing trade with the EU?",
      "The sudden emergence of China's AI expertise via DeepSeek underlines how important it is to be nimble. There was only one mention of China in the government's big AI paper earlier this month - in Science Secretary Peter Kyle's foreword.",
      "The pharma industry is lobbying the government to quietly open the door for relocation of key top talent into the UK, concerned about the Trump / Robert F Kennedy Jr approach to medicines regulation. Our leading universities are saying that for the first time since Brexit, it's easier to recruit some of the very best international scientists who are not keen to bring up their families in Trump's America.",
      "Trump's decision to abandon Biden's green subsidies also levels the playing field for net zero investment here.",
      "After a tumultuous start to the year, with the US administration threatening different tariffs almost every day, and tech giant shares falling over concerns they've been overvalued in the light of China's AI app DeepSeek, the UK remains a safe haven for investors.",
      "The self declared iron chancellor remains very attached to stability. But zero growth is a form of stability too. In choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some very tricky navigation - and it will make some big domestic political waves too.",

    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said on Wednesday that \"economic growth is the number one mission of this government\" as she unveiled a series of proposals to boost the UK's economy.",
      "But how quickly could the government get growth from the plans she announced?",
      "Critics have argued some of the projects - such as expanding Heathrow  - would not help in the near term.",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers and claims.",
      "How slow is the UK's growth?",
      "The most recent official data shows there was virtually no growth in GDP - the overall size of the UK economy - between the July 2024 election and November 2024.",
      "And the latest medium term official growth forecast from the Office for Budget Responsiblity, the government's official forecaster, is for 1.6% GDP growth in 2029, which would be well below the pre-2008 financial crisis average growth of 2.8% a year.",
      "However, the International Monetary Fund has forecast that the UK's growth rate for 2025 and 2026 will be higher than in France and Germany.",
      "Lower rates of GDP growth would translate into slower growth in our wages and incomes and general living standards.",
      "Heathrow expansion",
      "The chancellor said that allowing Heathrow to build a third runway would \"create 100,000 jobs\", boost investment and exports and \"unlock futher growth\".",
      "She cited a new report by the consultancy Frontier Economics which found it could increase the UK's potential GDP by 2050 by 0.43%, around \u00a317bn.",
      "That is broadly in line with the findings of an independent commission by Sir Howard Davies in 2015, which concluded a third runway at Heathrow would support UK trade and enhance productivity and push up GDP by 0.65-0.75% by 2050 relative to otherwise.",
      "However, most analysts believe it would likely take many years before shovels went into the ground to start building a new runway, even with new reforms to speed up the planning process.",
      "And the government will have a difficult balancing act to both expand Heathrow and meet its climate goals.",
      "BBC Verify asked the Treasury for its source for the 100,000 jobs figure and it pointed to a 2017 report by the Department for Transport estimating that a new runway at Heathrow could add between 57,000 and 114,000 additional local jobs. Though that report added that \"these jobs are not additional at the national level, as some jobs may have been displaced from other airports or other sectors.\"",
      "Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor",
      "The chancellor in her speech claimed an Oxford and Cambridge Growth Corridor \"could add up to \u00a378bn to the UK economy by 2035\".",
      "This corridor is a resurrection of the previous government's plans to join Oxford and Cambridge with new transport links and allow those two university and research hubs to expand.",
      "In support of the chancellor's figure, the Treasury has cited research by an industry group called the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster.",
      "This research shows that this \u00a378bn is a \"cumulative figure\" over 10 years, not the boost in a given year.",
      "The analysis suggests the project could add \u00a325bn in Gross Value Added (GVA) a year to the UK economy by 2035.",
      "That would constitute roughly a permanent 1% boost to UK GDP by that date.",
      "Estimates of the impacts of an infrastructure project on growth are inherently uncertain and very sensitive to the assumptions of researchers about what would have happened to growth if it had never been built.",
      "Yet most economists do believe infrastructure projects, especially those that allow already productive places to expand, will ultimately help the UK economy grow more rapidly than otherwise.",
      "Ben Caswell, a senior economist at The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), said: \"Big infrastructure projects typically deliver growth over the long term, approximately 10 to 20 years.\"",
      "\"There may be a small demand side boost in the short term when shovels are in the ground, but nothing so significant that you would see it in headline GDP growth figures.",
      "\"However, after the project is complete, the supply capacity of the economy is permanently enhanced, and, all other things equal, that delivers higher sustained GDP growth than would have otherwise been.\"",
      "Pensions reform",
      "Another reform the chancellor says will be pro-growth is enabling UK companies to access the funds from their \"defined benefit pension\" pots, held on behalf of their workforces to fund their retirement.",
      "Defined benefit pension schemes guarantee an annual pension payment to retired workers, based on their salary while they were in work.",
      "Many of these defined benefit pension pots have moved into surplus in recent years due to the rise in interest rates since the pandemic, meaning their financial assets (their investments) are greater than their financial liabilities (what they have to pay out to pensioners).",
      "The Treasury has said that approximately 75% of schemes are now in surplus and that the total surplus adds up to \u00a3160bn.",
      "The chancellor wants to legislate to allow the firms to use these funds to invest, while keeping safeguards to protect and guarantee workers' pension pay-outs.",

      "The official Pension Regulator estimates that on one measurement the size in September 2024 was \u00a3207bn, but \u00a3137bn on a different measurement.",
      "The Treasury's estimate is roughly midway between the two.",
      "If such sums were deployed that could, in theory, make a positive difference to overall UK business investment, which is regarded by economists as both a short term and a long term driver of GDP growth.",
      "Total business investment in 2023, according to official data, was \u00a3258bn.",

His instant restatement of his opposition to the scheme  - because of its \"severe impact\" on noise, air pollution and climate change  - may well embolden Labour critics in the House of Commons, including within the government.",
      "One senior government source insisted this morning that Reeves's decision to publicly invite Heathrow to submit an application should be seen as just that - an invitation that will kick off a long process with plenty more opportunities for internal opponents to make their case.",
      "Some inside Labour argue that there is a generational divide within the party on many controversial growth issues, including this one.",

      "Opponents of the runway insist the generational split will prove to be the other way round, citing the concerns of young voters about the environment.",

      "Even one Labour MP for a seat in the south of England urged the government to talk not only about the benefits of the developments to Oxford and Cambridge, but also to stress the benefits for the communities in between the two cities  - noting acidly that Reeves, Sir Keir Starmer and all the previous five Conservative prime ministers went to Oxford University.",
      "While the response of Labour MPs will play a big role in determining how Reeves's speech is assessed in Westminster, the actual delivery of her plans will rely in large part on private finance and local government.",
      "The entire speech was designed to boost business confidence in Britain's prospects. The decisions firms make over the coming weeks, months and years will help to show whether that was a success.",
      "When it comes to local government, some of the signs are not auspicious.",
      "The BBC revealed last month that local councils, many of them Labour-led, had told the government its housebuilding plans were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "Ministers are eager to strike devolution deals across the country but in some areas on the growth corridor this is proving complicated.",
      "More housebuilding will also require new Labour MPs, many of whom claimed long-term Conservative seats in last year's election landslide, to face down local campaigners arguing against development and argue for prioritising growth instead.",
      "It was striking this afternoon how many centre-right think tanks, disappointed by the pace of building projects under the Conservatives, praised Reeves's approach this afternoon.",
      "Even among those most supportive of Reeves's agenda, some argue that plans for long-term growth need to be accompanied by short-term ways to boost Britons' living standards.",
      "The prime minister's \"plan for change\" shift at the end of last year was in part an attempt to move the main focus of the government away from targeting GDP and towards \"milestones\" tangible to people's everyday lives.",

      "\"We want it to be 600,000,\" he told reporters.",
      "Later, he added: \"I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species\u2026 I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft.\"",
      "Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (\u00a31.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space.",
      "Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule and performing the first commercial spacewalk.",
      "During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock.",
      "The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic \u2013 it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology.",
      "And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still \u2013 being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa.",
      "The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do \u2013 especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX owner Elon Musk to a government role to cut $2 trillion (\u00a31.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.",
      "The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now.",
      "Brink of a second space age?",
      "In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs.",
      "Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values.",
      "And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space.",
      "They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.",
      "On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. \"This second space age has only just begun,\" he wrote.",
      "\"There will inevitably be a thriving space economy \u2013 one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space\u2026 At Nasa, we will\u2026 usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.\"",
      "Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, but Trump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan.",
      "But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets.",
      "That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank.",
      "\"You have a government looking to slash,\" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. \"If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget\u2026",
      "\"This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table.\"",
      "Future of Nasa's moon rocket",
      "One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn) for each and every launch.",
      "By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (\u00a380m) per launch \u2013 and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (\u00a38m) as he develops his system.",
      "Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (\u00a354.5m).",
      "Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further.",
      "Starship and New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But \"that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs\", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University.",
      "\"SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,\" he continues. \"They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs.",
      "\"A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way.",
      "\"There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future.\"",
      "Questions around spiralling costs",
      "The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: \"Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs.",
      "\"Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (\u00a320bn) for key activities\".",
      "Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration \u2013 some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (\u00a3800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 \u2013 but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of \"the telescope that ate astronomy\".",
      "(Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.)",
      "It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s.",
      "Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US.",
      "But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. \"Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue.\"",
      "New light on the 'old way of doing things'",
      "The current model is to give so-called \"cost-plus\" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit.",
      "The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns.",
      "Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things.",
      "\"We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things.\"",
      "Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget.",
      "Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo.",
      "The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job.",
      "SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years \u2013 only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station.",
      "The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule.",
      "\"Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,\" says Prof Logsdon. \"So, shaking up the system is very positive.\"",
      "On the brink of a big shakeup?",
      "Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS \"outrageously expensive\" and said that the major aerospace contractors are \"incentivised to be economically inefficient\".",
      "But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (\u00a320bn) annual budget.",
      "\"Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,\" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress.",
      "Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.",
      "The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt.",

      "There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (\u00a316bn) in contracts from government since 2008.",

      "A combination of prevailing winds and the rotation of the earth drive litter up the loch to create what is known as the Arrochar litter sink.",
      "About 62,000 items wash up on the beach each year, much of it from the waterways in and around Glasgow, Scotland\u2019s largest city.",
      "It is estimated that 11% of the rubbish which enters the River Clyde - which flows through the city - and its tributaries is eventually washed up at Arrochar.",
      "The local residents can't clean it up fast enough.",
      "Lots of the waste is tangled in the seaweed which was once an asset to the community.",
      "It used to be collected by the bucketload to fertilise farm land, but that's no longer possible because of the pollution.",
      "Campaigners say the only solution is to stop the waste entering the water in the first place - and that the introduction of a deposit return scheme for bottles and cans would play a major role in doing just that.",
      "A Scottish scheme was originally meant to be operational by 2023 but was delayed after objections from businesses to the inclusion of glass.",
      "It then emerged that the UK government was considering blocking Scotland's plans because it wanted a single scheme for all four nations.",
      "UK ministers eventually decided they would grant an exemption - but only if glass was taken out of the Scottish plans to align it with the scheme it was planning to introduce in England.",
      "That position led to angry recriminations and eventually an announcement from Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater of a further delay until at least October 2025.",

      "\"It is a big task at hand but this is where we hope the deposit return scheme would help see a reduction in that problem.\"",
      "The scheme in Ireland went live a year ago and more than 900 million items have so far been returned to shops.",
      "Consumers have to pay a deposit of 15 cents for every standard-sized plastic bottle or can which is purchased. The deposit is refunded when the item is returned.",
      "Glass is not included in the scheme.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 00:45:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Some scientists fear the risk of a collapse to warm Atlantic currents has not been taken seriously.",
    "story": [
      "Of all the possible climate futures, there's a scenario where the United Kingdom and north-west Europe buck the trend of global warming and instead face plunging temperatures and freezing winters.",
      "It's not the most likely outcome, but a number of scientists fear that the chance of it happening is growing, and that the consequences would be so great that it deserves proper consideration.",
      "They are concerned that the ocean currents that bring warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic could weaken - or even collapse - in response to climate change.",
      "Huge uncertainties remain about when - or even whether - a collapse could happen. So, how likely is it, and what would it mean?",
      "The system of Atlantic currents, called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), is a key reason why the UK is warmer than Moscow, despite being a similar distance from the Equator.",
      "Forming a vital part of our climate system, this conveyor belt distributes energy around the planet, bringing warm, salty water from the tropical Atlantic to cooler regions south of Greenland and Iceland, and also the Nordic Seas.",
      "The warmth from the ocean is transferred to the air above it, helping keep temperatures milder than they otherwise would be.",
      "As this salty water cools, it becomes denser, and sinks, before flowing back towards the southern hemisphere as a deep ocean current. This water eventually gets pulled back up to the surface, and the circulation continues.",
      "But Amoc appears to be getting weaker.",
      "We don't know for sure, because direct and continuous measurements of Amoc strength have only been taken since 2004. That's not long enough to be able to identify a definite change.",
      "But indirect evidence suggests it could have already slowed by around 15% over the last couple of centuries, although not all scientists agree.",
      "One indication is the sediments on the ocean floor. Larger grains indicate a stronger current. By measuring the size of the grains and calculating their age, scientists can estimate how much Amoc has slowed over time.",
      "Another piece of evidence is the so-called 'cold blob' or 'warming hole' in the north Atlantic. This describes a region which appears to have cooled in recent decades, unlike the vast majority of the world.",
      "A slowdown in Amoc - meaning less warmer water would be transported to this region - is seen as a possible culprit.",
      "This is \"a very clear signature and footprint of a classic Amoc slowdown\" says Matthew England, professor of oceanography at the University of New South Wales.",
      "The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects Amoc to weaken this century. But the major concern is that Amoc could suddenly \"switch off\", as appears to have happened repeatedly in the Earth's past.",
      "Today, global warming appears to be making the water in the north Atlantic less salty, due to extra freshwater from a melting Greenland ice sheet and more rainfall.",
      "As fresher water doesn't sink as easily, this is expected to slow the circulation and so bring less saltwater northwards from the tropics.",
      "Beyond a \"tipping point\", this loop could lead Amoc to runaway collapse.",
      "\"We really want to avoid a tipping point because then there's nothing we can do about it,\" warns David Thornalley, professor of ocean and climate science at University College London.",
      "Where might the tipping point be?",
      "No one really knows how close it may be.",
      "In 2021, the IPCC said it had \"medium confidence\" that Amoc would not collapse abruptly this century, although it expected it to weaken.",
      "But some more recent studies have pointed to a growing possibility of Amoc passing a tipping point in the coming decades, beyond which full collapse would be inevitable.",
      "Each study comes with various caveats and uncertainties, and different climate models can give different results for a system as complex as Amoc.",
      "\"We don't believe the idea of an Amoc collapse this century has substantially changed because of these new results,\" cautions Dr Laura Jackson, oceanographer at the Met Office.",
      "But many scientists are growing increasingly concerned. Prof Thornalley argues that, whatever the imperfections of individual studies, taken together they \"lead to a conclusion that we maybe need to be worried\".",
      "Following the new evidence, more than 40 leading ocean and climate scientists signed an open letter last October calling for wider recognition of the \"greatly underestimated\" risks.",
      "That is not to say the signatories believe Amoc will pass a tipping point this century. But they warn it is now enough of a possibility to warrant proper consideration.",
      "\"I'd say you're looking at a risk of reaching a tipping point in the coming decades that could be at the 10 or 20% level even if we hold the line at 2C warming [above temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate],\" warns Tim Lenton, professor of Earth system science at the University of Exeter.",
      "Given the magnitude of the consequences from Amoc collapse, these probabilities \"are not trivial,\" he adds.",
      "What would happen if Amoc collapsed?",
      "Even the most likely scenario - where Amoc continues to weaken this century - could have serious effects.",
      "\"If the Amoc gradually weakens over the next century, you're going to get global warming but less warming over Europe,\" says Dr Jackson.",
      "That would still mean the UK getting hotter summers with climate change, but a weaker Amoc could also fuel more winter storms as regional temperature patterns change.",
      "A full-scale collapse, meanwhile, would be \"like a war situation [\u2026] something almost unimaginable,\" says Prof Lenton.",
      "While it could take a century or more for impacts to play out, temperatures in northern Europe could fall by a couple of degrees a decade.",
      "In the UK, it could \"become horribly, horribly cold \u2026 like living in northern Norway,\" Prof Thornalley warns.",
      "\"Our infrastructure is not set up for that.\"",
      "There could be global consequences too, such as shifts to the tropical rain belts.",
      "\"That's a big story,\" warns Prof Lenton.",
      "\"If you lost the monsoon or seriously disrupted it, you'd have humanitarian catastrophes, in simple terms, in west Africa [and] probably in India.\"",
      "How we prepare for this alternative future poses challenges for governments.",
      "Prof Lenton draws parallels with preparations for the Covid-19 pandemic - another major event which scientists had warned about, but had no way of knowing when it might occur.",
      "But a recent report warned the UK has a \"glaring national security blind spot for climate threats\" such as those posed by Amoc collapse. The government admitted last year that it \"has not assessed the effect of any [Amoc] slowing or collapse\" on economic planning.",
      "Scientists are clear that the fundamental way to reduce these risks is to cut the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change.",
      "\"We're playing a bit of a Russian roulette game,\" warns Prof England.",
      "\"The more we stack up the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, the more we warm the system, the more chance we have of an Amoc slowdown and collapse.",

    "story": [
      "If you have ever struggled with the sudden shift in routine imposed by the seasonal \"springing forward\" and \"falling backward\" of the clocks, spare a thought for the sled dogs of Ontario, Canada.",
      "Researchers say the time shift is measurably unsettling for those working dogs, whose days are dictated by strict schedules.",
      "When scientists from the University of Toronto put movement sensors on a group of Canadian sled dogs, they saw that the animals were active and moving around almost exactly an hour early - the morning after the clocks went back.",
      "In contrast, pet dogs of the same breeds as the working dogs showed no measurable effect - apparently resting peacefully during their extra hour in bed.",
      "\"I wasn't expecting any differences between the two groups [of dogs],\" said Lavania Nagendran, one of the lead researchers.",
      "\"So it was interesting to see that the dogs were so aligned to their routine.\"",
      "The study, published in the journal PLoS One, is part of a wider project investigating the differences in behaviour between wolves and domestic dogs.",
      "\"Not all animals can just switch up their schedule based on human influences, [like changing the clocks]\" said Ming Fei Li, the co-lead researcher.",
      "She explained that she and her colleagues hoped to learn whether wolves are also able to adjust their activity patterns \u2013 and whether this flexibility evolved naturally in canines, or if it was imposed on dogs when we domesticated them.",
      "Much of the research into the impact of changing the clocks -  on health and sleep - is focused on humans. Previous studies have suggested that the time shift causes disrupted, or fragmented, sleep and that this can last up to a week. Research has even found an increase in fatal traffic accidents immediately after the clocks go back or forward.",
      "This is the first study to investigate its effect in domestic dogs.",
      "The researchers put their motion trackers on 25 sled dogs and 29 pets \u2013 all of which were in or near Ontario, in Canada.",
      "For the sled dogs, the time change was a sudden shift in a strict daily routine. Prior to the clocks going back, handlers would arrive at their kennels at sunrise. The morning when the clocks went back, those sled dogs were up, active and moving around an hour before the handlers appeared.",
      "For most of those working dogs, however, the disruption lasted just a day. The following morning, the majority of the dogs' activity again aligned with the arrival of their human handlers.",
      "However, for pet dogs there was no measurable disruption. After the clocks went back, their activity in the morning seemed to adjust to this new, human-imposed schedule.",
      "\"When we've spoken to pet owners, everyone comments that \u2013 with that hour change - their dog or cat is up in the morning, going crazy, waiting to be fed.",
      "\"But we didn't really find that in pet dogs in our study.\"",
      "The team carried out their research in 2021, when Covid lockdown restrictions were in place in Canada. So they advertised for pet-owning participants, who had huskies or malamutes, to join their study remotely.",
      "\"They were amazing,\" recalled Li. \"They'd ask us questions, put the trackers we sent them by post on their dogs' [collars], most of them kept really good notes.\"",
      "The researchers say their \"takeaway finding\" is that, for working dogs, gradually easing into a timetable change might be beneficial.",
      "Because, while you can teach an old dog a new routine, such an abrupt, overnight shift can be unsettling. Unless, of course, you Are a pet with no work demands and a particularly comfortable dog bed."

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 22:11:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Scientists say the fires that engulfed Los Angeles were made 35% more likely due to climate warming.",
    "story": [
      "Climate change was a major factor behind the hot, dry weather that gave rise to the devastating LA fires, a scientific study has confirmed.",
      "It made those weather conditions about 35% more likely, according to World Weather Attribution - globally recognised for their studies linking extreme weather to climate change.",
      "The authors noted that the LA wildfire season is getting longer while the rains that normally put out the blazes have reduced.",
      "The scientists highlight that these wildfires are highly complex with multiple factors playing a role, but they are confident that a warming climate is making LA more prone to intense fire events.",
      "\"Climate change increased the risk of the devastating LA wildfires,\" said Dr Clair Barnes, from Imperial College London, the study's lead author.",
      "\"Drought conditions are more frequently pushing into winter, increasing the chance a fire will break out during strong Santa Ana winds that can turn small ignitions into deadly infernos.\"",
      "The Santa Ana winds are strong and gusty east or north-easterly winds that blow from inland California towards the coast.",
      "What are Santa Ana winds and how are they fuelling LA wildfires?",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Four ways climate change worsens extreme weather",
      "Around 30 people have died and more than 10,000 homes have been destroyed in the fast-spreading, destructive fires that broke out in early January.",
      "This new study looks at what are termed the fire-prone conditions that can lead to dangerous conflagrations.",
      "It's been carried out by a team of researchers from World Weather Attribution (WWA), a global group that publishes rapid analyses of climate-related weather events.",
      "They use climate models to simulate how the warming that has occurred since the middle of the 19th century is influencing heatwaves, droughts, floods and fires.",
      "The widespread burning of coal, oil and gas in the wake of the industrial revolution has driven billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.",
      "Acting like a blanket, these gases have driven up temperatures by around 1.2C since then.",
      "By using climate models and statistical methods along with real world observations, the WWA group have been able to show how much of an influence climate warming has had on extreme events.",
      "In the case of the LA fires, they found that the hot, dry conditions that drove them are expected to occur once every 17 years.",
      "This is an increase in likelihood of around 35% compared to a world that hadn't experienced warming.",
      "\"We actually see that the models show very much the same results that the [real world] observations have,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, the head of World Weather Attribution.",
      "\"So there, in this combined index, we are quite confident about the result... we have actually a signal that we can say that we definitely can attribute that, also quantitatively.\"",
      "The researchers also examined other important variables that can lead to wildfire including the length of the fire season.",
      "By analysing weather observations, the scientists found that this has increased by around 23 days since the world began warming, around 1850.",
      "The team say that this means the dry conditions and the Santa Ana winds that are crucial for the spread of fires, are increasingly overlapping.",
      "Another key element is drought.",
      "Dry conditions in the LA area over the October to December period are now about 2.4 times more likely than before humans starting using fossil fuels on a large scale.",
      "The researchers are clear that climate change increased the probability of the hot, dry conditions that gave rise to the fires.",
      "However, the authors are more cautious about the link between rising temperatures and the longer fire season or decreased rainfall, saying that the models did not show a significant connection.",
      "Despite these reservations, the conclusion is that a warmer world increased the chances of the devastating wildfires occurring - as more fossil fuels continue to be burnt, those chances will continue to rise.",
      "\"Overall the paper finds that climate change has made the Los Angeles fires more likely despite some statistical uncertainty,\" said Prof Gabi Hegerl, from the University of Edinburgh, who was not part of the study team.",
      "\"This is a carefully researched result that should be taken seriously,\" she said in a statement.",
      "The new work builds on research that was published while the fires were still burning fiercely.",
      "That study linked the wildfires to what's termed \"climate whiplash.\"",
      "The idea is that very wet years are followed almost immediately by very dry ones, which increases the risk of fires.",
      "This is what happened in LA, when two wet winters were followed by an extremely dry autumn and winter this year \u2013 the wet weather promoted the growth of grass and shrubs that became the fuel for the fires that took off in the gusting Santa Ana winds.",

      "\"It's just incredible how rich it is. It's full of these minerals that we haven't seen before in meteorites and the combination of them that we haven't seen before. It's been such an exciting thing to study,\" said Prof Russell.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The Microsoft co-founder says he enjoys giving away his fortune and it won't leave his kids poor.",
    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

      "It is rare that a video game series becomes so popular it inspires copycats - but it is rarer still that it's so unique it kicks off its own genre.",
      "But that's what happened with Dynasty Warriors, a series which pioneered the so-called \"1 vs 1,000\" gameplay, in which the player defeats thousands of enemies in each level.",
      "Throughout years of development - the series has been going since 1997 on the original PlayStation - hardware limitations meant at its best only a few hundred enemies could appear on-screen at any one time.",
      "But all that is now changing, with the power of modern consoles enabling as many as 10,000 opponents on-screen at once.",
      "In other words, the \"1 vs 1,000\" moniker is finally coming true.",
      "And with that new power comes a new game - after seven years in the wilderness, publisher Koei Tecmo is back with Dynasty Warriors: Origins.",
      "Throughout this period the series has faced a problem - despite selling 21 million copies throughout its history - Dynasty Warriors has always sold significantly better in Japan than in the West.",
      "\"It's something that we've been trying to get a lot of people overseas to play,\" the head of developer Omega Force, Tomohiko Sho, told the BBC.",
      "But times may be changing, as the release of Dynasty Warriors: Origins in January 2025 has seen encouraging sales.",
      "In the UK, it broke the top 10 of the retail sales charts, while online it was the top-selling game on PC retailer Steam - with just under 70,000 people playing the game at the same time on launch.",
      "There have been nine numbered entries in the series since it began in 1997, culminating in 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9 on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.",
      "But advances in hardware mean Mr Sho believes now is the time for a sequel.",
      "Though he did not call it a reboot, the team has ditched the numbered titles and simply called the game Dynasty Warriors: Origins - perhaps signalling that the studio believes this is a turning point for the franchise.",
      "It released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2025, becoming the first mainline entry in the series in seven years.",
      "Mr Sho told the BBC the team had been working on a sequel - which would have been called Dynasty Warriors 10 - but he felt it was simply too similar to previous games, which fans were \"starting to get a bit bored of\".",
      "Instead, the long-awaited game was scrapped in order to take advantage of the new hardware.",
      "DW10 cancelled",
      "The reason Dynasty Warriors: Origins seeks to break away from what came before is simple, Mr Sho said - it was a result of fan reaction to the last mainline game released in the series, 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9.",
      "\"Either you really liked it, or you didn't,\" he said.",
      "The unreleased sequel was too similar to what came before, he said, but by the time development was in full swing, a change in the games industry ultimately halted production.",

    "summary": "Yvette Cooper says the UK will make it illegal to own AI tools to make images of child sexual abuse.",
    "story": [
      "Four new laws will tackle the threat of child sexual abuse images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), the government has announced.",
      "The Home Office says the UK will be the first country in the world to make it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to create child sexual abuse material (CSAM), with a punishment of up to five years in prison.",
      "Possessing AI paedophile manuals - which teach people how to use AI for sexual abuse - will also be made illegal, and offenders will get up to three years in prison.",
      "\"What we're seeing is that AI is now putting the online child abuse on steroids,\" Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.",
      "Cooper said AI was \"industrialising the scale\" of sexual abuse against children and said government measures \"may have to go further.\"",
      "Other laws set to be introduced include making it an offence to run websites where paedophiles can share child sexual abuse content or provide advice on how to groom children. That would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "And the Border Force will be given powers to instruct individuals who they suspect of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection when they attempt to enter the UK, as CSAM is often filmed abroad. Depending on the severity of the images, this will be punishable by up to three years in prison.",
      "Artificially generated CSAM involves images that are either partly or completely computer generated. Software can \"nudify\" real images and replace the face of one child with another, creating a realistic image.",
      "In some cases, the real-life voices of children are also used, meaning innocent survivors of abuse are being re-victimised.",
      "Fake images are also being used to blackmail children and force victims into further abuse.",
      "The National Crime Agency (NCA) said that there are 800 arrests each month relating to threats posed to children online. It said 840,000 adults are a threat to children nationwide - both online and offline - which makes up 1.6% of the adult population.",
      "Cooper said: \"You have perpetrators who are using AI to help them better groom or blackmail teenagers and children, distorting images and using those to draw young people into further abuse, just the most horrific things taking place and also becoming more sadistic.\"",
      "She continued: \"This is an area where the technology doesn't stand still and our response cannot stand still to keep children safe.\"",
      "Some experts, however, believe the government could have gone further.",
      "Prof Clare McGlynn, an expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse, said the changes were \"welcome\" but that there were \"significant gaps\".",
      "The government should ban \"nudify\" apps and tackle the \"normalisation of sexual activity with young-looking girls on the mainstream porn sites\", she said, describing these videos as \"simulated child sexual abuse videos\".",
      "These videos \"involve adult actors but they look very young and are shown in children's bedrooms, with toys, pigtails, braces and other markers of childhood,\" she said. \"This material can be found with the most obvious search terms and legitimises and normalises child sexual abuse. Unlike in many other countries, this material remains lawful in the UK.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) warns that more sexual abuse AI images of children are being produced, with them becoming more prevalent on the open web.",
      "The charity's latest data shows reports of AI-generated CSAM have risen 380% with 245 confirmed reports in 2024 compared with 51 in 2023. Each report can contain thousands of images.",
      "In research last year it found that over a one-month period, 3,512 AI child sexual abuse and exploitation images were discovered on one dark website. Compared with a month in the previous year, the number of the most severe category images (Category A) had risen by 10%.",
      "Experts say AI CSAM can often look incredibly realistic, making it difficult to tell the real from the fake.",
      "The interim chief executive of the IWF, Derek Ray-Hill, said: \"The availability of this AI content further fuels sexual violence against children.",
      "\"It emboldens and encourages abusers, and it makes real children less safe. There is certainly more to be done to prevent AI technology from being exploited, but we welcome [the] announcement, and believe these measures are a vital starting point.\"",
      "Lynn Perry, chief executive of children's charity Barnardo's, welcomed government action to tackle AI-produced CSAM \"which normalises the abuse of children, putting more of them at risk, both on and offline\".",
      "\"It is vital that legislation keeps up with technological advances to prevent these horrific crimes,\" she added.",
      "\"Tech companies must make sure their platforms are safe for children. They need to take action to introduce stronger safeguards, and Ofcom must ensure that the Online Safety Act is implemented effectively and robustly.\"",

      "\"I do not think the use of generative AI for creative purposes should be banned, but I do think that generative AI for these purposes that is trained on people's work without permission should be banned,\" Mr Newton Rex adds. \"AI can be very powerful but let's build it ethically and fairly.\"",

      "The US may still go on to command the sector, but there is a sense that DeepSeek has shaken some of that swagger.",
      "Trump's words after the Chinese app's sudden emergence in recent days were probably cold comfort to the likes of Altman and Ellison. He called this moment a \"wake-up call\" for the American tech industry, and said finding a way to do cheaper AI is ultimately a \"good thing\".",

    "story": [
      "On March 21, 2006 the first ever tweet was posted by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey: \"Just setting up my twttr\". It was a simple introduction to a brand new platform.",
      "Backed by celebrities, it was different to other social media sites, like MySpace or Facebook, because you could interact with any user without them having to approve a request. Companies rushed to join the service, hoping to get closer to their customers.",
      "\"If you were a brand that wanted to be part of any cultural moments that were happening, Twitter was a great place to be,\" Alex Wilson, a senior strategist at the marketing agency Pitch tells BBC News.",
      "On June 4, 2010 Elon Musk, the owner of Space X, logged on for the first time: \"Please ignore prior tweets, as that was someone pretending to be me :) This is actually me.\"",
      "Twelve years later he would buy the platform for $44bn (\u00a338.1bn), reshape the algorithm, reinstate banned accounts, repurpose the policy around \"free speech\", and rename it X.",
      "He also fired thousands of staff - around 80% of the workforce.",
      "Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed \"the great X-odus\".",
      "One of their main concerns was the content that would be seen around their posts that users could screengrab and share.",
      "For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.",
      "More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.",
      "In particular, his posts on the subject of grooming gangs put pressure on the government, which announced a review of the issue.",
      "\"There is no doubt that Musk's ownership of X is having an impact on public opinion in the UK,\" Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common tells BBC News.",
      "However, according to More In Common, only 16% of Brits believe his interventions are designed to achieve justice for victims, whereas 44% think he is doing it for attention, and his approval rating with the British public sits at -35.",
      "The changing tone of X and the controversy surrounding its owner have spurred some firms to leave the platform and others have pulled their advertising as well.",
      "At the end of 2023 firms including Apple, IBM and Disney paused advertisement on the platform.",
      "Others brands including Unilever and Mars were sued by Mr Musk, who accused them of unlawfully agreeing to boycott the site.",
      "\"It's broadly fair to say Twitter is becoming less relevant across the world,\" Mr Wilson says in the Pitch office in central London, with posters of clients ranging from charities, telecommunications, and sports leagues.",
      "\"It's been a very long time since clients came to us and say: 'Twitter's fun and exciting. We want to be in that space'.",
      "\"Unless you are targeting specific audiences, maybe certain political audiences or sports  - football is still big on Twitter - it's hard to see the value in it.\"",
      "Trump's election victory has prompted other organisations to leave X, with others considering their positions as Mr Musk's influence in the White House grows.",
      "Beginning in 2013, German football team FC St Pauli, which plays in Germany's top league, the Bundesliga, posted more than 60,000 times, racking up nearly 250,000 followers.",
      "But less than 10 days after Trump's return to the White House was confirmed, the club posted: \"You can find our statement about saying goodbye to X on BlueSky. Feel free to follow us there. We're out of here.\"",
      "\"We discussed the decision for a year. We were mostly posting content with counter speech to hate. We had a lot of content for diversity, anti-racism, and anti-sexism,\" club spokesperson, Patrick Gensing told the BBC.",
      "\"We have seen assaults on X, antisemitism, conspiracy theories,\" he says.",
      "The argument that such posts are justified by freedom of speech, does not convince him.",
      "\"We don't think racism is freedom of speech,\" says Mr Gensing.",
      "One of the most recent departures from X was by the UK arm of BMW. In late January it announced it was no longer posting on X and directed people to its posts on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "There's no definitive way to know how many brands are choosing to leave or reduce their posts on the platform.",
      "When approached, X did not respond to the points raised in this article. But last year Mr Musk claimed X had 600 million monthly active users, and said the platform maintains its \"purpose is to serve the public conversation\".",
      "Mr Musk \"has been clear that X is willing to make trade-offs to adopt a more open, less moderated approach compared to Twitter\", says Goran Calic, visiting scholar at Harvard Business School.",
      "But leaving X can have negative consequences for organisations and their relationships with customers.",
      "\"When users leave, the impact depends on who is leaving and why. A local authority posting news provides significant value to the network. If such an account leaves, it can hurt both the platform and its users,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"Users protesting by leaving should weigh the broader social implications of staying versus exiting.\"",
      "For some organisations who need to get their message out quickly, X still has value that other competitors simply can't offer.",
      "\"For us there is still that value [on being on X],\" says Andrew Cassidy, senior director of digital strategy and engagement at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).",
      "\"We try to match where our riders are. When people are tweeting at the MBTA someone can provide a definitive answer in the moment. Our broadcasting system is exclusively tied into our X account, but we still field customer service questions across other platforms.\"",
      "\"Our focus is providing customer service to the largest number of riders that we possibly can,\" Mr Cassidy says.",
      "\"With the current landscape being what it is, X still feeds that need.\"",
      "It's \"unthinkable\", Mr Gensing explains, not to have a presence on social media in 2025.",
      "\"We have to view all the platforms critically, it's not only X. The companies behind them set up the rules of the game and they can change them.\"",

      "Many of us have prepared instructions and critical information for our family in the event of our sudden demise. For Daniel Stenberg, that includes passwords for his Google and GitHub accounts.",
      "That\u2019s because he\u2019s the founder of curl, an open source internet transfer engine that has been downloaded billions of times and is used to transfer data to and from computer servers.",
      "It was first released by Mr Stenberg in 1996 and is now used by millions every day.",
      "It's important that someone is able to maintain curl when he steps away.",
      "\u201cI just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,\u201d Mr Stenberg says.",
      "It\u2019s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system \u2013 and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.",
      "The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today\u2019s technology landscape.",
      "In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master\u2019s thesis. \u201cMy concern was graduating,\u201d he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.",
      "Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark.",
      "\u201cWe're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,\u201d he says.",
      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work after all.",
      "Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the \u201ckernel maintainers are aging\u201d.",
      "Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK\u2019s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades.",
      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",
      "Degioanni is more sanguine. Even if there\u2019s \u201cprobably less visceral enthusiasm\u201d for the concept of open source, he says, the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given.",
      "And, he continues, \u201cI've worked with open source my whole life. I've created my own projects. I've seen people join the projects that I created. I've seen people start their own open source projects.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, he says, there is a \u201cjoy, especially for a young person\u201d in creating software, seeing it being used and sparking a community.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 16:21:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Authorities advise against gatherings in enclosed spaces following a flurry of seismic activity nearby.",
    "story": [
      "Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has urged islanders on the Greek island of Santorini to \"stay calm\" after an increase in seismic activity in recent days.",
      "His remarks come as schools were told to close on Monday and authorities advised against \"large gatherings in enclosed spaces\" across the island, which is a popular tourist destination known for its whitewashed buildings and blue domed churches.",
      "More than 280 earthquakes were recorded across Greek islands in the past 48 hours, according to the University of Athens' Seismological Laboratory.",
      "Tremors of up to 4.9 in magnitude were recorded north-east of the island on Monday, while recent days have seen quakes of 4.3 and 3.9 magnitude reported nearby.",
      "Speaking from EU talks in Brussels, the prime minister said the country is working to manage \"a very intense geological phenomenon\", adding that he has asked the authorities to provide a \"comprehensive presentation\" of the geological data, to ensure everyone knows the scale of this seismic event.",
      "Mitsotakis's remarks come as many people in Santorini spent Sunday night outdoors, amid fears of potential damages to buildings during the quakes.",
      "Some focal points of the tremors have been recorded at a depth of just 2km (1.2miles) below the surface.",
      "Local media report other residents have left the island by sea or air while the seismic activity is ongoing.",
      "Santorini is on what is known as the Hellenic Volcanic Arc - a chain of volcanic islands created by plate tectonics - but the last major eruption was in the 1950s.",
      "Greek authorities said that the recent minor earthquakes were related to tectonic plate movements instead of volcanic activity.",
      "The tremors are being caused by the Aegean sea plate subducting beneath the African plate, causing resistance and friction to build up along the fault line.",
      "When the plate shifts, energy is released in the form of an earthquake.",
      "Earthquakes are very common in this region, but authorities say activity in the Santorini caldera - the volcanic basin the island sits around - remains in decline.",
      "A volcanic earthquake occurs when volcanic eruptions move magma and fluids towards the Earth's surface, this in turn leads to the movement of tectonic plates, which can be felt on the surface as earthquakes or tremors.",
      "The tremors recorded by geologists are considered minor or light, but authorities have recommended a number of preventative measures in addition to the school closures, including asking ships to avoid the ports of Ammoudi and Fira.",
      "Big cruise ships often anchor near the Old Port of Fira, with passengers being brought to shore on smaller boats.",
      "Schools were also told to close on the nearby islands of Anafi, Ios and Amorgos.",
      "On Sunday, Mitostakis chaired an emergency meeting at Maximos Palace with the head of Greece's earthquake planning and protection organisation (OSAP), Efthimios Lekkas, and the minister of civil protection, Vassilis Kikilias.",
      "Following the meeting to discuss the continuous earthquakes in the area between Santorini and Amorgos, Kikilias said the government remains alert and asked the people in affected islands to follow instructions issued by the authorities.",
      "People were advised to avoid abandoned buildings and travelling on routes where landslides are likely to occur.",
      "While the recent tremors are thought to be unlikely to be a precursor to an eruption, the possibility of a stronger eruption cannot be ruled out.",
      "Kostas Papazachos, a professor of geophysics at Thessaloniki Aristotle University, told public broadcaster ERT that the precautionary measures were \"precisely to limit the impact of a stronger earthquake\", as quakes cannot be predicted.",
      "He added: \"When you have a sequence next to you that is so vivid, so intense, you have to be a bit careful, precisely because there is always the risk of something like that happening.\"",
      "Earthquakes are measured on a scale called the Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw). This has replaced the better known Richter scale, now considered outdated and less accurate.",
      "The number attributed to an earthquake represents a combination of the distance the fault line has moved and the force that moved it .",
      "A tremor of 2.5 or less usually cannot be felt, but can be detected by instruments. Quakes of up to five are felt and cause minor damage.",
      "Prof Papazachos said that were a minor earthquake to occur while people were gathered in large crowds, it could create panic that may lead to people being injured.",
      "The South Aegean Regional Fire Department has been placed on general alert and rescue teams as well as the regional commander have been dispatched to Santorini.",
      "Though the island has a population of around 15,500, it welcomes millions of tourists each year. The UK Foreign Office updated its advice to British tourists on Sunday reiterating the recent measures and instructing visitors to follow guidance from local officials.",

    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains distressing details from the start",
      "A former surgeon who is accused of abusing hundreds of young patients, often while they were under anaesthetic, is set to go on trial this month in the largest child abuse trial in French history.",
      "Joel Le Scouarnec, 73, is accused of assaulting or raping 299 children \u2013 the majority former patients of his \u2013 between 1989 and 2014, mostly in Brittany.",
      "He has admitted to some charges, but not all.",
      "The trial in Vannes, north- west France, follows a painstaking police investigation lasting several years.",
      "It is likely to raise uncomfortable questions over whether Le Scouarnec was protected by his colleagues and the management of the hospitals that employed him, despite an FBI warning to the French authorities that he had been consulting child abuse websites, after which he was given only a suspended sentence.",
      "A staggering number of opportunities to stop the former surgeon from having contact with children appear to have been missed or rejected.",
      "Members of his own family also knew of Le Scouarnec's paedophilia but failed to stop him, it is claimed.",
      "\"It was the family's omert\u00e0 which meant his abuse was allowed to continue for decades,\" one lawyer involved in the case told the BBC.",
      "Le Scouarnec, once a respected small-town surgeon, has been in jail since 2017, when he was arrested on suspicion of raping his nieces, now in their 30s, as well as a six-year-old girl and a young patient. In 2020 he was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment.",
      "After his arrest, police searched his home and found child-sized sex dolls, more than 300,000 child abuse images, and thousands of pages of meticulously compiled diaries in which Le Scouarnec is alleged to have logged assaults he carried out on his young patients over 25 years.",
      "He has denied assaulting or raping children, arguing that his diaries merely detailed his \"fantasies\".",
      "In several instances, however, he had also written: \"I am a paedophile\".",
      "Le Scouarnec is facing more than 100 rape charges and more than 150 charges of sexual assault.",
      "Some of his former patients, who are all now adults, have said they remember the surgeon touching them under the guise of medical examinations, sometimes even when their parents or other doctors were in the room.",
      "But because a huge number of his alleged victims were under the effect of anaesthetics when it is claimed the assaults took place, they had no recollection of the events and were shocked to be contacted by police and told their names \u2013 alongside graphic descriptions of abuse \u2013 allegedly appeared in Le Scouarnec's diaries.",
      "Le Scouarnec felt \"all-powerful\" and liked the feeling of \"flirting with danger\" through \"calculated transgressions,\" French daily Le Monde quoted the court order against the former surgeon as saying.",
      "Some of the alleged victims have said the unsettling revelations helped them make sense of unexplained symptoms of trauma that had burdened them their whole lives.",
      "France's elite confronted by sexual abuse scandals",
      "French clergy abused 216,000 children since 1950",
      "'My father should die in prison', daughter of Dominique Pelicot tells BBC",
      "Lawyer Francesca Satta, who represents several alleged victims, told the BBC that among her clients are \"the families of two men who did remember, and who ended up taking their own lives.\"",
      "Olivia Mons of the France Victimes association spoke to many of the alleged victims and said several only had blurry recollections of events which they were never able to \"find the words to explain\".",
      "When the surgeon's case came to light, \"it provided them with the beginning of an explanation,\" Ms Mons said.",
      "But she added that most of the alleged victims were people who had no memories of being raped or assaulted, and who were living ordinary lives before police contacted them. \"Today, many of these people are understandably very shaken,\" Ms Mons said.",
      "One woman told French media that when police showed her an entry under her name in Le Scouarnec's diary, memories instantly flooded in. \"I had flashbacks of someone coming into my hospital room, lifting the bedsheets, saying he would check if everything had gone well,\" she said. \"He raped me.\"",
      "Margaux Castex, a lawyer for one of the alleged victims, told the BBC her client is \"traumatised that he ever gave his trust to a medical professional, and that's been hard to shake\".",
      "\"He wishes he had never been told what happened,\" Ms Castex said.",
      "Another woman called Marie, now a married mother in her mid-thirties, said that police came to her house and revealed that her name appeared in the diaries of a surgeon who was accused of child abuse.",
      "\"They read out what he had written about me and I wanted to read it back myself but it was impossible,\" she told outlet France Bleu. \"Can you imagine reading hardcore pornography and knowing that it is about you, as a child?\"",
      "Marie said she had seen mental health specialists for years because of \"issues\" she had with regards to men, and that doctors had wondered whether she had experienced childhood trauma.",
      "\"I have to believe that my memory protected me from that. But the [police] examination brought it all back to the surface - images, sensations, memories came back to me day by day,\" she said. \"Today, I feel this as if it had just happened.\"",
      "Marie added that when she was shown a photo of Le Scouarnec, \"everything came back to me... I remembered his icy gaze.\"",
      "She wondered how the surgeon had been able to commit his alleged crimes unnoticed for so long.",
      "It is a haunting question that is bound to be explored at length during the trial.",
      "'Institutional and judicial missteps'",
      "The first court proceedings heard claims that several members of Le Scouarnec's family had been aware since the mid-1980s of his disturbing behaviour towards children, but did not intervene.",
      "His ex-wife has denied knowing what her husband \u2013 and father of their three children \u2013 allegedly did until he was arrested.",
      "Le Scouarnec \u2013 a medical professional and a lover of opera and literature \u2013 had long been the pride of his middle-class family. He was a respected small town medical practitioner for many years, which may have afforded him a significant degree of protection in the workplace.",
      "\"A huge degree of dysfunction allowed Le Scouarnec to commit his deeds,\" lawyer Frederic Benoist told the BBC.",
      "Mr Benoist represents child protection advocacy group La Voix de L'Enfant (The Child's Voice), which is pressing to highlight what it calls the \"crucial institutional and judicial missteps\" which allowed Le Scouarnec to allegedly continue abusing children for decades.",
      "In the early 2000s, an FBI alert to the French authorities that Le Scouarnec had been accessing child abuse websites only resulted in a four-month suspended sentence with no obligation to follow medical or psychological treatment.",
      "Mr Benoist said prosecutors never shared this information with the medical authorities and there were no consequences for Le Scouarnec, who continued in his role as a surgeon, often operating on children and managing their aftercare.",
      "When a colleague \u2013 who already harboured suspicions against Le Scouarnec \u2013 read about the charges against him in the local press in 2006, he urged the regional medical association to take action.",
      "All but one doctor - who abstained - voted that Le Scouarnec had not violated the medical code of ethics, which states that doctors \"must in all circumstances be trustworthy and act with integrity and devotion to duty\". No sanctions were imposed.",
      "\"We therefore have proof that all these colleagues knew, and none of them did anything,\" Mr Benoist said. \"There were many circumstances which meant he could have been stopped; he wasn't, and the consequences are tragic.\"",
      "The BBC has approached both the regional medical association and prosecutors for comment.",
      "Le Scouarnec was eventually arrested when the six-year-old victim told her parents that he had assaulted her. By then, he was living like a recluse in a large derelict home, surrounded by child-sized dolls.",
      "Moment of reckoning",
      "Ms Driguez, the nieces' lawyer, sat opposite Le Scouarnec during the 2020 trial in the south-western town of Saintes. \"His answers were cold and calculated,\" she said. \"He is extremely clever, but showed no empathy whatsoever.\"",
      "The trial uncovered more allegations of child abuse within Le Scouarnec's family, Ms Driguez said, but the former surgeon never had any particular reaction and mostly looked at the floor.",
      "At one point, the court was shown lurid videos of Le Scouarnec and his dolls. \"Everyone was watching the screen but I was watching him,\" Ms Driguez said. \"Up to that point he had always kept his gaze down. But at that moment, he looked up, staring intently at the video. His eyes were twinkling.\"",
      "As the city of Vannes prepares to host the trial, three lecture halls in a former university building nearby have been made available to accommodate the hundreds of alleged victims, their legal representatives and families. The trial starts on 24 February and is due to last until June.",
      "Whether the press and the public are allowed in will depend on all of the alleged victims giving up their right to a closed trial.",
      "Many lawyers believe the trial could be a moment of reckoning for the authorities that failed to take provisions against Le Scouarnec, as well as an important moment for the victims to voice their trauma.",
      "Ms Satta said that although many people involved in this case have no memory of what happened to them, they were still victims, adding that the former surgeon had enjoyed the \"impunity of silence\" for too long.",
      "\"The trial will be a moment for the victims to speak out,\" Mr Benoist agreed. \"It would be terrible, in my eyes, if it was held behind closed doors.\""

      "\"It's a shock,\" Michael Ignatieff, the former leader of Canada's Liberal Party, told the BBC.",
      "\"We're into a new world, in which the question on whether you can trust America becomes the fundamental question in foreign policy for every country.\"",
      "Pierre Poilievre, leader of Canada's opposition Conservative Party, called the tariffs on Sunday \"massive, unjust and unjustified.\"",
      "\"Canada is the United States' closest neighbour, greatest ally and best friend,\" he  said, noting that Canada fought alongside the US in two world wars, as well as in Korea and Afghanistan. \"There is no justification whatsoever for this treatment.\"",
      "Prime Minister Trudeau questioned in his Saturday address why the US would target Canada instead of looking to \"more challenging parts\" of the world.",
      "A portion of his speech was directly addressed to Americans, and he too, pointed to a history of shared bloodshed. \"We have fought, and died, alongside you,\" Trudeau said.",
      "Thomas Juneau, a professor at the University of Ottawa with a focus on national security, told the BBC that Trump's tariffs \"undoubtedly represent an earthquake in Canada-US relations.\"",
      "\"This is extremely destabilising for Canada,\" Prof Juneau said. \"As a country, we have massively benefited from our extremely close trade and security partnership with the US for decades.\"",
      "While the trade battle would likely force Canada to look for partners elsewhere, it ultimately can't escape geography, he said. It will remain reliant on the economic superpower next door.",
      "\"That is why Canada must absolutely now focus on salvaging the relationship as much as possible,\" Prof Juneau said.",
      "An unclear, costly fight ahead",
      "The big unknown remains how long the US will keep the tariffs in place, and what steps Canada could take to appease the Trump administration, which has said it expects action on cross-border fentanyl trafficking and illegal migration.",
      "TD Economics projects that the longer the tariffs remain in place, the worse the impact will be. Canada could enter a recession in five to six months, and its unemployment rate could hit more than 7%.",
      "Theo Argitis, managing director of the Ottawa-based public affairs firm Compass Rose Group, said the unknowns had left Canada no choice \"but to hit (Trump) back hard.\"",
      "\"At the end of the day, we don't even really know why he's doing this,\" Mr Argitis told the BBC.",
      "Trump says the flow of fentanyl, a highly potent and deadly drug, into the US from Canada and Mexico, is one key reason. US officials say the levies will remain in place \"until the crisis is alleviated.\"",
      "In response, the Canadian government has noted that less than 1% of fentanyl and illegal border crossings into the US come from Canada. It has offered to spend an additional C$1.3bn to secure the US-Canada border",
      "But Trump has also spoken publicly about his frustration with the trade deficit between Canada and the US, and more broadly his view that tariffs could be a source of revenue for Washington's coffers.",
      "On Sunday, he wrote on Truth Social that the US does not need Canadian products, and said the US pays \"hundreds of billions of dollars to subsidize Canada.\"",
      "\"Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable country,\" Trump wrote, before repeating his view that Canada should instead become a US state.",
      "He has warned that the White House will enact harsher penalties on Canada should it choose to retaliate. For now, Canada has chosen to try and inflict some targeted pain on its more powerful neighbour, even if the economic scales are tipped against it.",
      "\"We prefer to solve our disputes with diplomacy,\" Trudeau told his country on Saturday. \"But we are ready to fight when necessary.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The Microsoft co-founder says he enjoys giving away his fortune and it won't leave his kids poor.",
    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

    "summary": "Authorities advise against gatherings in enclosed spaces following a flurry of seismic activity nearby.",
    "story": [
      "Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has urged islanders on the Greek island of Santorini to \"stay calm\" after an increase in seismic activity in recent days.",
      "His remarks come as schools were told to close on Monday and authorities advised against \"large gatherings in enclosed spaces\" across the island, which is a popular tourist destination known for its whitewashed buildings and blue domed churches.",
      "More than 280 earthquakes were recorded across Greek islands in the past 48 hours, according to the University of Athens' Seismological Laboratory.",
      "Tremors of up to 4.9 in magnitude were recorded north-east of the island on Monday, while recent days have seen quakes of 4.3 and 3.9 magnitude reported nearby.",
      "Speaking from EU talks in Brussels, the prime minister said the country is working to manage \"a very intense geological phenomenon\", adding that he has asked the authorities to provide a \"comprehensive presentation\" of the geological data, to ensure everyone knows the scale of this seismic event.",
      "Mitsotakis's remarks come as many people in Santorini spent Sunday night outdoors, amid fears of potential damages to buildings during the quakes.",
      "Some focal points of the tremors have been recorded at a depth of just 2km (1.2miles) below the surface.",
      "Local media report other residents have left the island by sea or air while the seismic activity is ongoing.",
      "Santorini is on what is known as the Hellenic Volcanic Arc - a chain of volcanic islands created by plate tectonics - but the last major eruption was in the 1950s.",
      "Greek authorities said that the recent minor earthquakes were related to tectonic plate movements instead of volcanic activity.",
      "The tremors are being caused by the Aegean sea plate subducting beneath the African plate, causing resistance and friction to build up along the fault line.",
      "When the plate shifts, energy is released in the form of an earthquake.",
      "Earthquakes are very common in this region, but authorities say activity in the Santorini caldera - the volcanic basin the island sits around - remains in decline.",
      "A volcanic earthquake occurs when volcanic eruptions move magma and fluids towards the Earth's surface, this in turn leads to the movement of tectonic plates, which can be felt on the surface as earthquakes or tremors.",
      "The tremors recorded by geologists are considered minor or light, but authorities have recommended a number of preventative measures in addition to the school closures, including asking ships to avoid the ports of Ammoudi and Fira.",
      "Big cruise ships often anchor near the Old Port of Fira, with passengers being brought to shore on smaller boats.",
      "Schools were also told to close on the nearby islands of Anafi, Ios and Amorgos.",
      "On Sunday, Mitostakis chaired an emergency meeting at Maximos Palace with the head of Greece's earthquake planning and protection organisation (OSAP), Efthimios Lekkas, and the minister of civil protection, Vassilis Kikilias.",
      "Following the meeting to discuss the continuous earthquakes in the area between Santorini and Amorgos, Kikilias said the government remains alert and asked the people in affected islands to follow instructions issued by the authorities.",
      "People were advised to avoid abandoned buildings and travelling on routes where landslides are likely to occur.",
      "While the recent tremors are thought to be unlikely to be a precursor to an eruption, the possibility of a stronger eruption cannot be ruled out.",
      "Kostas Papazachos, a professor of geophysics at Thessaloniki Aristotle University, told public broadcaster ERT that the precautionary measures were \"precisely to limit the impact of a stronger earthquake\", as quakes cannot be predicted.",
      "He added: \"When you have a sequence next to you that is so vivid, so intense, you have to be a bit careful, precisely because there is always the risk of something like that happening.\"",
      "Earthquakes are measured on a scale called the Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw). This has replaced the better known Richter scale, now considered outdated and less accurate.",
      "The number attributed to an earthquake represents a combination of the distance the fault line has moved and the force that moved it .",
      "A tremor of 2.5 or less usually cannot be felt, but can be detected by instruments. Quakes of up to five are felt and cause minor damage.",
      "Prof Papazachos said that were a minor earthquake to occur while people were gathered in large crowds, it could create panic that may lead to people being injured.",
      "The South Aegean Regional Fire Department has been placed on general alert and rescue teams as well as the regional commander have been dispatched to Santorini.",
      "Though the island has a population of around 15,500, it welcomes millions of tourists each year. The UK Foreign Office updated its advice to British tourists on Sunday reiterating the recent measures and instructing visitors to follow guidance from local officials.",

      "On a hill above Nuuk's cathedral stands a 7ft statue of the protestant missionary Hans Egede. He had reopened Greenland's link with Northern Europe in the early 1700s and laid the groundwork for the establishment of Denmark's proudest colonial possession.",
      "One day in the late 1970s, the bronze figure was suddenly covered in red paint.",
      "I remember that day well - I passed the statue every day on my mile long walk to school. I spent two years living on Greenland while my father taught geography at Nuuk's teacher training college.",
      "It was apparent not everyone among the Inuit majority was happy about the changes that Egede had brought to Greenland a quarter of a millennium earlier.",
      "The clinking of beer bottles in filled plastic bags carried home by the Inuit to their tiny apartments \u2013 much smaller, usually, than the ones we Danes lived in \u2013 was testimony to pervasive alcoholism, one of the ills that Denmark had brought to Greenland, amid a lot that was undeniably good: modern health, good education.",
      "But apart from the paint-covered statue, the dream of Greenland being independent from Denmark was only slowly beginning to manifest itself.",
      "At the Teacher Training College right next to my school, the closest Greenland got to having a radical student movement was developing - some young people at the college demanded to be taught in their native Greenland language.",
      "By the late 1970s, the capital was called Nuuk and no longer Godthaab, its official name for well over two centuries.",
      "Now, decades on, change is afoot once again, as Donald Trump has his eyes on gaining control of the country.",
      "Asked in January if he would rule out using military or economic force in order to take over the autonomous Danish territory or the Panama canal, he responded: \"No, I can't assure you on either of those two. But I can say this, we need them for economic security.\"",

      "One poll of Greenlanders suggested only 6% of Greenlanders want their country to become part of the US, with 9% undecided and 85% against. But despite this, Frederiksen knows that the question of what Greenlanders want is a delicate one.",
      "Traditionally, Danes have viewed themselves as the world's nicest imperialists ever since they started to colonise Greenland in the 1720s.",
      "This self-image has been eroded in recent years, however, by a string of revelations about past high-handedness in dealing with the island's population.",
      "In particular, there have been reports of serious wrongs committed against Greenlanders - not in the distant past, but within living memory.",

In some cases, this happened without the consent of the biological mothers, and in other instances, they were not informed that their ties with their children would be cut completely.",
      "This left a raw emotional wound that often was not healed decades later. Some of the adopted Greenlandic children were later able to trace their biological parents, but many others were not.",

      "Iben Mondrup, a novelist who was born in Denmark and spent her childhood in Greenland, sees the recent events as a rude wake-up call for the Danes who have been accustomed to viewing themselves as a benign influence in Greenland.",
      "\"The entire relationship has been based on a narrative that Denmark was helping Greenland, without getting anything in return,\" she says.",
      "\"We have talked about Denmark as the motherland that took Greenland under its wing and taught it gradually to stand on its own feet. There has been a widespread use of educational metaphors.",
      "\"We Danes constantly return to the idea that Greenland owes us something, at least gratitude.\"",
      "'Greenland has now grown up'",
      "Opinion polls carried out in recent years indicate a fairly consistent pattern in which around two-thirds of Greenland's population say they want to be independent. A survey carried out in 2019 showed support of 67.7% for the move among adult Greenlanders.",
      "Jenseeraq Poulsen, director of Oceans North Kalaallit Nunaat, an environmental charity in Nuuk, says: \"As I see it, Greenland has now grown up, and our sense of self-worth and our self-confidence requires that we can start making our own decisions as adults on an equal footing with other nations.",
      "\"It's important for a country to not be in a straitjacket,\" Nunaat continues.",
      "\"We shouldn't have to ask for permission to do anything. You know the feeling [as a child] when you have to ask your parents something and they say you can't? That's what it's like.\"",
      "And yet the word \"independence\" may not fully capture the complexity of the challenges and choices that Greenland faces, according to Poulsen.",
      "He says he doesn't like the word \"since everyone is interdependent in the modern world\".",
      "He adds: \"Even Denmark, which is a sovereign state, is interdependent\u2026 I prefer the word statehood.\"",
      "Ingredients for independence",
      "Not a huge amount is known about the mechanics of how Trump proposes to acquire Greenland. When he first floated the idea in 2019 he said it would be \"essentially a large real-estate deal\".",
      "The extent to which Greenland would remain autonomous under US rule is unclear. So too is how its benefits system would work.",
      "After the proposal to buy the island, Trump has now doubled down on his rhetoric, apparently open to satisfying his territorial ambitions in the North Atlantic by military means.",
      "The visit by Donald Trump Jr and members of Trump's team added visual emphasis to the then president-elect's words but not everyone on Greenland was wowed.",
      "\"That makes us dig in our heels and say, 'Please control yourself,'\" says Janus Chemnitz Kleist, an IT manager for the Greenland government. \"Some people who might previously have had a positive attitude towards closer ties with the United States have started reconsidering.\"",
      "Aaja Chemnitz, a member of Danish parliament for the left-leaning party Inuit Ataqatigiit, has her own take on what needs to be done to pave the way for independence, in whatever form that may take.",
      "First, she argues that it is important to reverse what she describes as a mild brain drain out of Greenland. She says only 56% of young Greenlanders who are educated at universities and colleges in Denmark and other countries return upon graduation.",
      "\"That's not a very high number. It would be good if we could make it more attractive for them to return home and take up some of the positions that are important in Greenland society,\" she says.",
      "But in her view there is a broader economic issue too.",
      "\"Political and economic independence are interconnected,\" she says, \"and it's crucial that we cooperate with Denmark on the development of business in Greenland but also work with the Americans on the extraction of raw materials and the development of tourism.\"",
      "At present, the Greenland economy is heavily reliant on the so-called block grant, a subsidy paid by the Danish government that in 2024 amounted to the equivalent of around \u00a3480m a year.",
      "As this subsidy would likely disappear after independence, one of the most important challenges facing the Greenlanders is to find ways to replace it, explains Javier Arnaut, an economist at the University of Greenland in Nuuk.",
      "\"The economy is one of the main factors holding back the movement towards independence,\" he says. \"The economy is reliant on the Danish block grant, and if it disappeared, Greenland would have a large hole in the public budget that would need to be filled.",
      "\"The question is how. If the gap could be filled, for example, by increasing fiscal revenue through projects in mining with new partners, a clearer path towards economic independence could emerge.\"",
      "The welfare factor",
      "There is another question \u2013 not unimportant in a Nordic-style welfare state where a large part of the economy is under government control \u2013 of what would happen to all those health and social benefits that Greenland currently receives as a result of its relationship with Denmark.",
      "Currently, these benefits include access to treatment in Danish hospitals.",
      "Ask Greenlanders whether they want separation from Denmark, and most who say they do have a caveat - only if it does not cost them their welfare system.",
      "The question of what happens to the welfare system would be particularly acute in the event of a US takeover of Greenland given the American welfare state is not only smaller than those in the Nordic countries but of those in most other Western countries.",
      "But not everyone is convinced by suggestions that Greenland's cancer patients, for example, would suddenly have nowhere to go in case of independence. Pele Broberg, Greenland's former foreign minister and now chairman of the political party Naleraq, cites Iceland, which left the Danish kingdom in 1944 as an example.",
      "\"Iceland still sends medical patients to Denmark,\" he says. \"They still have students studying in Denmark, and vice versa. I have a hard time seeing what kind of obstacles Denmark would like to put up if we decide to leave the kingdom.",
      "\"It's rhetoric meant to scare us from having a discussion about independence,\" he argues.",
      "However, some Greenlanders believe that true independence may never be accomplished because of these very concerns. Mr Chemnitz Kleist argues: \"The kind of independence that you see in countries like Denmark or Belgium or Angola will never happen here.",
      "\"With such a small population, some of it not well educated, and with a complex welfare system which we would like to keep, we can never become independent in the way the word is usually understood.\"",
      "Trump's tactics and the case for the US",
      "All of these issues have been discussed for years, but they have suddenly attained a new sense of urgency with Trump's apparent bid for control of Greenland.",
      "But regardless of who sits in the White House, the question is whether Greenlanders would see any benefit in raising cooperation levels with the United States - and if so, to what extent?",
      "\"Greenland's national project is all about spreading out the island's dependence in order to have as many ties as possible with the outside world,\" says Ulrik Pram Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies and an expert on the Arctic region.",
      "The search for Ukraine's missing - 'no one could have foreseen this nightmare'",
      "Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this time",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "It is in this context that some Greenlanders are warming to the model of a \"free association\" with either Denmark or the United States \u2013 replicating a similar loose arrangement between the United States and certain islands in the Pacific.",
      "\"The problem is that Greenland feels swallowed up by Denmark,\" says Mr Pram Gad. \"It aims to feel less constrained and less dependent on just one country. Free association is not so much about 'association' and more about 'free'. It's about having one's own sovereignty.\"",
      "Donald Trump's threat to take over Greenland may have been unexpected but with the trip to Nuuk his team were well aware there was a thread to be pulled at, that his security concerns come at a time when many Greenlanders are considering their future.",
      "\"In recent years all these stories have emerged and placed the modernisation narrative in a different light. The whole idea that Denmark was pursuing an altruistic project in Greenland has been challenged,\" says Iben Mondrup.",
      "\"The project that the Greenlanders were told was for their own good was actually not good for them after all. This gives rise to all kinds of thoughts about the status of the Greenlanders inside the Danish kingdom. It adds fuel to the criticism that has developed in Greenland in recent years about the idea of a community with Denmark.\"",
      "Norway, Iceland and Canada",
      "But if it's not only Denmark and it's not only America, who else can Greenland turn to? Surveys suggest that a majority of the island's inhabitants would like to step up cooperation with Canada and Iceland. Mr Broberg, the party chairman, likes the idea, and he throws Norway into the equation as well.",
      "\"We have more in common with Norway and Iceland than we have with Denmark,\" he says. \"All three of us have a presence in the Arctic, unlike Denmark. The only reason I leave open the possibility of a free association with Denmark after independence is it may put some Greenlanders at ease because they are used to the relationship with Denmark.\"",
      "Still, the question is: Would Canada and Iceland want to take on the task of providing the social benefits that Greenlanders covet? The answer would almost certainly be no.",
      "In this way, the future presenting itself to the Greenlanders is both exhilaratingly open and at the same time depressingly narrow.",

    "title": "Dying with dignity: Breaking the taboo around 'living wills' in India",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:56:52 GMT",
    "summary": "A living will lets people choose the medical care they want to receive if they develop a terminal illness.",
    "story": [
      "In 2010, IP Yadev, a surgeon from the southern Indian state of Kerala, was confronted with one of the hardest decisions of his life.",
      "He had to decide between keeping his father - a terminal cancer patient - alive, and honouring his wish, expressed verbally, to stop all treatments and put an end to his suffering.",
      "Warning: This article contains some distressing details",
      "\"As a son, I felt it was my duty to do whatever I could to prolong my father's life. This made him unhappy and he ended up dying alone in an intensive-care unit. The doctor's last efforts to revive him using CPR crushed his ribs. It was a horrible death,\" Dr Yadev says.",
      "The experience, he says, deeply impacted him and helped him realise the importance of advance medical directives (AMDs), also known as living wills.",
      "A living will is a legal document that allows a person over 18 years to choose the medical care they would want to receive if they develop a terminal illness or condition with no hope of recovery and are unable to make decisions by themselves.",
      "For example, they could specify that they don't want to be put on life-support machines or insist that they want to be given adequate pain-relieving medication.",
      "In 2018, India's Supreme Court allowed people to draw up living wills and thereby choose passive euthanasia, where medical treatment can be withdrawn under strict guidelines to hasten a person's death. Active euthanasia - any act that intentionally helps a person kill themselves - is illegal in the country.",
      "But despite the legal go-ahead, the concept of living wills hasn't really taken off in India. Experts say that this has much to do with the way Indians talk, or rather, don't talk about death. Death is often considered to be a taboo subject and any mention of it is thought to bring bad luck.",
      "But there are now efforts underway to change this.",
      "In November, Dr Yadev and his team launched India's first programme - at the Government Medical College in Kerala's Kollam district - to educate people about living wills, offering information in person and over the phone. Volunteers also conduct awareness campaigns and distribute will templates.",
      "Creating a living will requires family members to have open and honest conversations about death. Despite some resistance, activists and institutions are taking steps to raise awareness, and there's a growing, though cautious, interest.",
      "Kerala leads the way in these conversations. Currently, it has the country's  best palliative care network, and organisations that offer end-of-life care have also started awareness campaigns around living wills.",
      "In March, around 30 people from the Pain and Palliative Care society in Thrissur city signed living wills. Dr E Divakaran, founder of the society, says that the gesture is aimed at make the idea more popular among people.",
      "\"Most people have never heard of the term so they have many questions, like whether such a directive can be misused or if they can make changes to their wills later on,\" Mr Yadev says, adding that most inquiries have come from people in their 50s and 60s.",
      "\"Right now, it's the educated, upper-middle class that's making use of the facility. But with grassroot awareness campaigns, we're expecting the demographic to widen,\" he says.",
      "According to the Supreme Court order, a person must draft the will, sign it in the presence of two witnesses, and have it attested by a notary or gazetted officer. A copy of the will must then be submitted to a state government-appointed custodian.",
      "While the guidelines exist on paper, many state governments are yet to set up mechanisms to implement them. This is what Dr Nikhil Datar, a gynaecologist from Mumbai city, realised when he made his living will two years ago as there was no custodian to whom he could submit it.",
      "So he went to court and it resulted in the Maharashtra government appointing about 400 officials across local bodies in the state to serve as custodians of living wills.",
      "In June, Goa state implemented the Supreme Court's orders around living wills and a high court judge became the first person in the state to register one.",
      "On Saturday, Karnataka state ordered district health officers to nominate people to serve on a key medical board required to certify living wills. [Two medical boards have to certify that a patient meets necessary criteria for the implementation of a living will before medical practitioners can act on it.]",
      "Mr Datar is also advocating for a centralised digital repository for living wills, accessible nationwide. He has also made his own will available for free on his website as a template. He believes a will helps prevent problems for both families and doctors when a patient is in a vegetative state and beyond recovery.",
      "\"Very often, family members don't want the person to endure more treatment but because they can't care for the patient at home, they keep them in the hospital. Doctors, bound by medical ethics, can't withhold treatment, so the patient ends up suffering with no way to express their wishes,\" Mr Datar says.",
      "Living wills aren't just about choosing passive euthanasia. Dr Yadev recalls a case where a person wanted his will to specify that he should be placed on life support if his condition ever required it.",
      "\"He explained that his only child was living abroad and that he didn't want to die until his son got to meet him,\" Mr Yadev says. \"You have the freedom to choose how you want to die. It is one of the greatest rights available to us, so why not exercise it?\" he says.",
      "Healthcare advocates say that conversations around palliative care are slowly growing in the country, giving an impetus to living wills.",
      "Dr Sushma Bhatnagar of Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences says the hospital is launching a department to educate patients about living wills. \"Ideally, doctors should discuss living wills with patients, but there's a communication gap,\" she says, adding that training doctors for these conversations can help ensure a person dies with dignity.",
      "\"Throughout our lives, our choices are coloured by our loved ones' wishes or by what society thinks is right,\" Mr Yadev says.",
      "\"At least in death, let us make choices that are in our interest and fully our own.\""

    "summary": "Retaliatory taxes against the US by other nations could lead global trade into uncharted territory.",
    "story": [
      "It was not a bluff, the tariffs are here - and this is just the opening salvo from the Oval Office.",
      "The world trading system has not been here before. A slide towards a wider trade conflict is very much on the cards, as President Trump prepares similar tariffs firstly against Europe, and then at a lower level universally.",
      "But what matters as much as the actions the US takes, is how the rest of the world responds.",
      "That, in turn, requires a judgement about what the president is actually trying to achieve.",
      "Trump regularly changes his rationale for tariffs - either to coerce diplomatic change, to deal with trade imbalances or to raise significant revenues.",
      "These policy objectives cannot all be achieved simultaneously.",
      "For example, learning from the experience of Trump's first term \"China deal\", Western diplomats have been scrambling to find lists of US goods they might buy more of, in order to give the White House some wins.",
      "Europe could say it is increasing its purchases of US shipments of liquefied natural gas, or arms, or specialised magnets for wind farms.",
      "It doesn't really matter if these trends were already in train, as long as the US president can be allowed to chalk up a \"win\".",
      "But is changing trade deficit numbers really the aim here?",
      "Officially, the rationale for Trump's move is punishment for the trade in the synthetic opioid fentanyl, but that is widely seen as a legal pretext for \"emergency\" action that would normally require a congressional decision.",
      "Canada has signalled it will take a robust approach to Trump, best articulated by the contender to be the country's next prime minister, Mark Carney.",
      "\"We will retaliate \u2026 dollar for dollar\" he told the BBC, ridiculing the fentanyl rationale and saying Canada would \"stand up to a bully\".",
      "This is significant whether or not Carney succeeds Justin Trudeau and ends up chairing the G7, which is the group of the world's seven largest so-called \"advanced\" economies.",
      "As a former governor of the Bank of England, Carney witnessed Trump on the world stage at G20 and G7 meetings first hand and has clearly concluded that the US leader only respects strength.",
      "He had a coded warning for any nation seeking to stay quiet and not catch the eye of the president: \"Good luck.\"",
      "In recent conversations I have had with European trade negotiators, they have stressed cooperation and partnership, as well as deals with the US. When asked, they avoided directly criticising even the extraordinary suggestion of using tariffs against Nato ally Denmark over the fate of Greenland.",
      "The real question here is whether the rest of the world, even tacitly, coordinates retaliatory tariffs on, for example, high profile political supporters of President Trump, such as Elon Musk, which is a typical feature of previous smaller disputes.",
      "Tesla, the electric vehicle maker led by Musk, last week warned on the impact of tit-for-tat tariffs.",
      "All of this would be aimed at making the rival courts around the Oval Office, and interests in Congress, assert their concerns about the impact on US factories' global exports.",
      "This is all before the impact on US domestic prices.",
      "This could also come, more circuitously, through the application of a planned carbon trade tax in various jurisdictions.",

      "Billionaire businessman Jared Isaacman has a big vision for the future of humanity.",
      "He set off on his first mission to space in 2021 \u2013 a private journey he paid an estimated $200m (\u00a3160m) for \u2013 and announced that he wanted space travel to be for the masses, not only for the 600 who have experienced it to date \u2013 most of them professional astronauts employed by Nasa and the wealthy.",
      "\"We want it to be 600,000,\" he told reporters.",
      "Later, he added: \"I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species\u2026 I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft.\"",
      "Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (\u00a31.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space.",
      "Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule and performing the first commercial spacewalk.",
      "During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock.",
      "The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic \u2013 it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology.",
      "And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still \u2013 being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa.",
      "The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do \u2013 especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX owner Elon Musk to a government role to cut $2 trillion (\u00a31.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.",
      "The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now.",
      "Brink of a second space age?",
      "In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs.",
      "Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values.",
      "And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space.",
      "They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.",
      "On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. \"This second space age has only just begun,\" he wrote.",
      "\"There will inevitably be a thriving space economy \u2013 one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space\u2026 At Nasa, we will\u2026 usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.\"",
      "Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, but Trump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan.",
      "But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets.",
      "That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank.",
      "\"You have a government looking to slash,\" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. \"If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget\u2026",
      "\"This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table.\"",
      "Future of Nasa's moon rocket",
      "One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn) for each and every launch.",
      "By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (\u00a380m) per launch \u2013 and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (\u00a38m) as he develops his system.",
      "Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (\u00a354.5m).",
      "Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further.",
      "Starship and New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But \"that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs\", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University.",
      "\"SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,\" he continues. \"They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs.",
      "\"A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way.",
      "\"There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future.\"",
      "Questions around spiralling costs",
      "The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: \"Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs.",
      "\"Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (\u00a320bn) for key activities\".",
      "Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration \u2013 some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (\u00a3800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 \u2013 but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of \"the telescope that ate astronomy\".",
      "(Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.)",
      "It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s.",
      "Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US.",
      "But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. \"Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue.\"",
      "New light on the 'old way of doing things'",
      "The current model is to give so-called \"cost-plus\" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit.",
      "The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns.",
      "Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things.",
      "\"We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things.\"",
      "Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget.",
      "Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo.",
      "The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job.",
      "SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years \u2013 only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station.",
      "The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule.",
      "\"Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,\" says Prof Logsdon. \"So, shaking up the system is very positive.\"",
      "On the brink of a big shakeup?",
      "Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS \"outrageously expensive\" and said that the major aerospace contractors are \"incentivised to be economically inefficient\".",
      "But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (\u00a320bn) annual budget.",
      "\"Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,\" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress.",
      "Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.",
      "The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt.",
      "\"The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,\" argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House.\"",
      "Where that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy \u2013 Musk \u2013 seated nearby.",
      "Others fear cuts in Nasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme.",
      "Where SpaceX fits in",
      "There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (\u00a316bn) in contracts from government since 2008.",
      "But if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players.",
      "And there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March.",
      "But industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"Isaacman is his own man,\" he adds. \"He is not a disciple of Elon Musk.\"",
      "Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution",
      "Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this time",
      "Future of space travel: Could robots really replace human astronauts?",
      "Ultimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue \u2013 Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion.",
      "But the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception.",
      "\"Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,\" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. \"That is frustrating for all of us.\"",
      "Asked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: \"Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service.",
      "\"The truth of Jared agreeing has something to do with him willing to take on these hard things \u2013 and there are so many hard things\".",

    "story": [
      "There is a good chance that inside your mobile phone is a miniscule amount of a metal that started its journey buried in the earth of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where a war is currently raging.",
      "It may even be directly connected to the M23 rebel group that made global headlines this week.",
      "The tantalum within your device weighs less than half of the average garden pea but is essential for the efficient functioning of a smartphone, and almost all other sophisticated electronic devices.",
      "The unique properties of this rare, blue-grey, lustrous metal \u2013 including being able to hold a high charge compared to its size, while operating in a range of temperatures - make it an ideal material for tiny capacitors, which temporarily store energy.",
      "It is also mined in Rwanda, Brazil and Nigeria but at least 40% - and maybe more \u2013 of the element's global supply comes from DR Congo and some of the key mining areas are now under the control of the M23.",
      "The current wave of fighting has been going on for months, but the rebels grabbed attention with Sunday's assault on the vital trading and transport hub of Goma. The city, bordering Rwanda, is a regional centre for the mining business",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?",
      "Over the past year, the M23 has made rapid advances across the mineral-rich east of DR Congo, taking areas where coltan \u2013 the ore from which tantalum is extracted \u2013 is mined.",
      "Like scores of other armed groups operating in the area, the M23 began as an outfit defending the rights of an ethnic group perceived to be under threat. But as its territory has expanded, mining has become a crucial source of income, paying for fighters and weapons.",
      "Last April, it seized Rubaya, the town at the heart of the country's coltan industry.",
      "Mineral extraction in this region is not in the hands of multinational conglomerates - instead thousands of individuals toil in open pits that honeycomb the landscape, or underground, in extremely unsafe and unhealthy conditions.",
      "They are part of a complex, and yet informal, network that sees the rocks removed from the ground using shovels, brought to the surface, crushed, washed, taxed, sold and then exported to be further purified and eventually smelted.",
      "Once the M23 moved into Rubaya, the rebels established what a UN group of experts described as a \"state-like administration\", issuing permits to the diggers and traders and demanding an annual fee of $25 (\u00a320) and $250 respectively. The M23 doubled the diggers' wages to ensure they would carry on working.",
      "It runs the area as a monopoly making sure \u2013 through the threat of arrest and detention \u2013 that only its authorised traders are able to do business.",
      "The M23 also charges a levy of $7 on each kilogramme of coltan. The UN group of experts estimated that as a result the M23 earns about $800,000 a month from coltan taxation in Rubaya. That money is almost certainly then used to fund the rebellion.",
      "There is a question mark hanging over how the ore extracted from M23-controlled areas gets into the global supply chain.",
      "Neighbouring Rwanda, which is seen as backing the M23, is at the centre of the answer, the UN experts say.",
      "Theoretically, a certification scheme - known as the Innovative Tin Supply Chain Initiative (Itsci) - should mean that what goes into a phone handset and other electronics does not come from areas of conflict where it could be used to fund armed groups responsible for carrying out atrocities.",
      "The US' Dodd-Frank Act passed in 2010, and a similar piece of EU legislation, is aimed at ensuring that companies purchasing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold \u2013 so-called \"conflict minerals\" \u2013 are not inadvertently funding violence.",
      "But Itsci has come under some criticism.",
      "Ken Matthysen, a security and resource management expert with independent research group Ipis, highlights that the dispersed nature of a lot of small-scale mines make it difficult for the local authorities to monitor exactly what is going on everywhere.",
      "Itsci tags should be put on bags at the mine itself, to prove the origin of the minerals inside, but often they get transported to a collection point where it becomes harder to trace where the ore actually came from, Mr Matthysen said.",
      "He added that there is also a possible issue with corruption.",
      "\"There is even an accusation of the state agents selling tags to traders, because they don't make a good living. So the traders then go around eastern DR Congo and they tag the bags themselves.\"",
      "Itsci did not respond to a BBC request for comment, but has in the past defended its record saying that the scheme has been subjected to a rigorous independent audit. It has also been praised for bringing \"prosperity for hundreds of thousands of small-scale miners\".",
      "The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
      "The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
      "In the case of Rubaya, Itsci suspended its operations there soon after the M23 entered the town.",
      "Nevertheless, the group has managed to continue exporting coltan.",
      "The UN experts map a circuitous route showing how it is transported to close to the Rwandan border. It is then transferred to \"heavy-duty trucks\" that needed the road to be widened in order to accommodate them.",
      "Rwanda has its own coltan mines but the experts say that the uncertified coltan is  mixed with Rwandan production leading to a \"significant contamination of supply chains\".",
      "The M23 was already involved in the coltan business before the capture of Rubaya -  setting up roadblocks and charging fees to cross them, according to Mr Matthysen.",
      "\"A lot of the trade of these minerals went through M23-controlled area towards Rwanda. So even then, Rwanda was profiting from the instability in eastern DR Congo and we saw the export volumes to Rwanda were already increasing,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Figures from the US Geological Survey show that Rwanda's coltan exports rose by 50% between 2022 and 2023. Mr Matthysen said this could not have all come from Rwanda.",
      "In a robust defence of Rwanda's position, government spokesperson Yolande Makolo reiterated to the BBC that there were minerals and refining capacity in her own country.",
      "\"It's very cynical to take an issue like what's happening in eastern DRC, where a persecuted community is fighting for its rights... and turning [it] into an issue of material benefit,\" she added.",
      "Rwandan President Paul Kagame has also dismissed the UN experts' reports, pouring scorn on their \"expertise\".",
      "Much of the east of DR Congo has been blighted by conflict for many years, raising questions about who has been benefitting and whether armed groups are profiting from what is dug out of the ground there.",
      "In order to highlight the issue and its connection to the smartphone industry, the Congolese government filed criminal complaints in France and Belgium at the end of last year against subsidiaries of the tech giant Apple, accusing it of using \"conflict minerals\".",
      "Apple has disputed the allegation and pointed out that since early 2024, because of the escalating conflict and the difficulties of certification, it stopped sourcing tantalum, among other metals, from both DR Congo and Rwanda.",
      "Other companies have not been so clear, which means that as the M23 seizes more territory those small bits of tantalum from the mines that they control could still make their way into the devices that we have come to rely on.",

      "Some of the children who were adopted within the church have told us they were then subjected to abuse and neglect in their adoptive families.",
      "The claims follow a BBC investigation last year into allegations of child sexual abuse spanning decades within the church, which is believed to have up to 100,000 members worldwide and is often referred to as The Truth or the Two by Twos. The FBI has since launched an investigation.",
      "Warning: this story contains details some may find distressing.",
      "Four women - who were all unmarried at the time - have told us they were given no option but to give up their babies. Three of them feared being cast out of the church and sent to hell if they refused.",
      "One says she was pressured into giving her baby to a married couple in the church after she was raped in 1988, age 17.",
      "\"My fear of going to hell was so great that it forced me to make up my mind to give up the baby to this couple in the church,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Another says she wasn't allowed to see her baby daughter before the child was taken away forever.",
      "The BBC has also spoken to six people given up for adoption as babies between the 1960s and 1980s. One woman says she was physically and emotionally abused in her first adoptive family in the church, and sexually abused in the second.",
      "The adopted children - born all over the US - are referred to within the church as \"Baldwin Babies\" because the adoptions were overseen by Wally Baldwin, a doctor from the sect who died in 2004.",
      "Some of the women would stay at his home in Oregon during pregnancy, according to a minister who used to work with Dr Baldwin.",
      "The exact number of Baldwin Babies is unclear. The BBC has spoken to the late doctor's adopted son, Gary Baldwin, who said the original records were no longer available but he believed the number to be \"less than 200\".",
      "He said that \"inevitably\" mistakes were made by his father's vetting system but that his intentions were good. Others we spoke to also said they remembered Dr Baldwin fondly.",
      "Because The Truth has no official leader, the BBC instead contacted six of its most senior current officials - known as \"overseers\" - for comment. We received one response. The overseer told us any adoptions he was aware of had been done \"through legal channels\" and he had \"heard some beautiful stories\".",
      "One woman who was adopted recalled seeing hundreds of photos in an album Dr Baldwin would keep of the children whose adoptions he had organised in The Truth.",

      "At 18, Melanie became pregnant after falling \"madly in love\" with a boy from her school.",
      "Not only were the pair unmarried, but the father was not a member of The Truth and refused to become one. This meant Melanie had committed a \"terrible sin\" in the eyes of local workers.",

      "Deb Adadjo, 54, was also unsure about giving up her baby, but felt too much pressure at the time to refuse the workers, who threatened to ban her from church meetings - which in The Truth meant you not only got thrown out of the church, but also ended up in hell.",

    "title": "Jesse Eisenberg on the bitter and sweet of \"A Real Pain\"",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 10:48:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The actor-writer-director's latest film, a poignant comic-drama costarring Kieran Culkin, earned him an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. But Jesse Eisenberg finds it difficult to not feel miserable.",
    "story": [
      "We'll tell you up front: Actor-director Jesse Eisenberg, who says he can appreciate a good Jewish deli, is a different kind of movie star. We joined him last week at the legendary Canter's Deli in Los Angeles, and shared some chocolate babka, with a dill pickle chaser. \"This is the real test,\" Eisenberg said.",
      "It was a little unusual, but for Eisenberg, it'd already been a pretty unusual day. Just a few hours earlier, he received his second Oscar nomination, this time for best original screenplay.",
      "And he was mortified.",
      "I asked, \"Are you able to enjoy moments like this?\"",
      "\"No, I'm not really wired to enjoy praise,\" he replied. \"I don't know why. I think it just, like, I don't know, triggers some guilt response in my brain and I try to find something to be miserable about. But I'll tell you what I do love: I love actually doing my job. Like, I feel so lucky that I found something I like to do.\"",
      "At the moment, his job is to promote the film he wrote, directed and starred in, \"A Real Pain,\" co-starring Kieran Culkin. The film is about two cousins who travel to Poland to see their ancestral home, and visit the actual home of their late grandmother, who barely survived the Holocaust.",
      "The film started out as a buddy movie about a trip to Mongolia. As he was writing the script, Eisenberg got stuck, until inspiration literally popped up on his computer. \"I was, like, 30 pages into the script and something was missing,\" he said. \"I knew the script was not going well. And so, I'm, like, kind of, like, banging my head against the keyboard. And an ad pops up online for 'Auschwitz tours.' And then in parentheses, 'with lunch.' And I was like, 'Auschwitz tours (with lunch)?' That's, like, the strangest pairing of four words I've ever seen. And once I saw that, and once I read that brochure, I was like, 'Oh, that's the movie. That is so interesting,' because I was trying to deal with these two characters who are both kind of, like, in pain in their own ways.\"",
      "\"Dude, we are Jews on a train in Poland, ******* think about it. \u2026 Does no one else see the irony here? Like, eating fancy food and sitting up here, when 80 years ago we would've been herded into the backs of these ******* things like cattle?\"",
      "Watch a scene with Jesse Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin in \"A Real Pain\" [Warning: Graphic language]",
      "Eisenberg has had those same thoughts. He is himself of Polish lineage, and he has relatives who were victims of the Holocaust. \"I come from a family who survived the war; a lot of, you know, cousins, aunts, and uncles who didn't,\" he said. \"And yet, I walk around New York City, like, kind of miserable. Like, I'm not, like, a happy person. I'm not asking for pity or anything; I'm just recognizing objectively, like, I'm not a happy person. And yet, I come from people who survived through miracles. Intellectually, I think I should be waking up every morning kissing the dirt that I'm here by virtue of a thousand miracles. And instead, I walk around, I'm like, Oh my God. What am I gonna do today? Oh my God. I shouldn't drink a coffee 'cause then I'll peak at noon.",
      "\"And so, I'm constantly trying to reconcile my fortunate life with how I feel about things, and my forebears' very unfortunate lives and how they appreciated things. And that's what this movie is kind of focusing on.\"",
      "It seems he's been feeling that same kind of anxiety all of his life. Raised in New Jersey, Jesse Eisenberg was, by his own admission, a \"sad kid\" who was uncomfortable at school, and took refuge in acting. By 2010 he'd made a name for himself in Hollywood, with roles like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in \"The Social Network.\" The part earned him an Oscar nod, and the juice to branch out into writing and directing.",
      "But when COVID shut down the film industry in 2020, Eisenberg and his wife, Anna Strout, moved back to her native Indiana, and spent their days volunteering at her mom's domestic violence shelter in Bloomington. \"I was just volunteering every day at the shelter,\" he said. \"It sounds weird to say this, and I don't mean this for any kind of \u2013 it was, like, the happiest time of my life. I was painting walls and fixing garbage disposals. And I just loved it so much. I loved being able to, like, accomplish something where there was no, like, critique of it, you know what I mean?\"",
      "\"It makes total sense,\" I said. \"You fix the garbage disposal, the garbage disposal's fixed. End of it.\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "But of all the roles he's played, on-screen and off-, he says the confident illusionist in the \"Now You See Me\" franchise is the most challenging, because it's absolutely nothing like him. \"We just did the third 'Now You See Me,' and it's such a blast,\" he said. \"And it's such a challenge, because I'm doing something that's, like, the exact opposite of my psychology. It's the only time I ever walk away thinking, 'I did a good job today.' But that's because my character thinks that they're doing well. And yes, they're Hollywood movies, and they're really fun. But, like, for me, it's been a kind of like a therapy.\"",
      "\"Does that confidence linger at all past the shoots?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, normally it will linger through dinner,\" he replied. \"Once I get on set and I'm in those clothes, and I'm speaking in the way they've written for me \u2026 I stand up straighter. I'm, like, an inch taller. It's amazing. I can make eye contact with my father!\"",
      "You'd think the success of \"A Real Pain\" would give Eisenberg some swagger. His movie also snagged Culkin an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. But like the babka and pickles at Canter's, Eisenberg can't seem to enjoy the sweet without just a little bit of sour.",
      "I asked, \"Is there a part of you that finds this whole experience, with the way that 'A Real Pain' has been received, kind of unreal? That at some moment you're gonna wake up?\"",
      "\"Oh, yeah, I assume a piano is gonna fall on my head every day,\" Eisenberg said. \"Because I feel like, I am so lucky. And, like, the way my mind does equations is that this lucky thing must mean this horrible upcoming thing. And so, yes, I'm not walking under any air conditioners in New York City. I don't know how to think about it any other way. And that's really unfortunate, but true!\"",

    "story": [
      "Like many homes, Suzanne de Passe's is filled with stuff. Her version of stuff? Gold and platinum albums. Snapshots with Stevie Wonder and a young Michael Jackson. The Oscar-nominated screenplay she co-wrote for \"Lady Sings the Blues.\" Her 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Award.",
      "De Passe is a giant in the music and entertainment industry \u2026 a trailblazing executive who moved Motown from Hitsville to Hollywood. She did it with raw talent and relentless determination.",
      "\"I had so many wonderful things to do,\" she said, \"and they were all hard, and they were all new \u2013 learning; making mistakes; getting my butt kicked; crying (tears of frustration, not sadness) \u2013 and little by little, I got my legs up under me.\"",
      "Born in Harlem and nurtured in the historic Black community of Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, de Passe says a supportive family gave her the tools to succeed.",
      "I asked, \"What were the lessons you learned from them?\"",
      "\"I think more than lessons, it was values,\" she replied.",
      "By 19, she left college to book performers at the Cheetah Club in Manhattan. Her friend, Cindy Birdsong, had just joined The Supremes, and introduced de Passe to her boss, Motown founder Berry Gordy, who hired de Passe as his creative assistant.",
      "\"When he decided that I should come to the company, I asked for a contract,\" she recalled. \"He said, 'I don't do contracts.' And I was there for 21 years without one, on a handshake.\"",
      "Part of her job was to find new talent, and that's what she did, when de Passe first heard about a group of brothers from Gary, Indiana. They called themselves The Jackson 5.",
      "\"The hair on the back of my neck stood up. They were great,\" she said.",
      "\"The hair literally stood up?\"",
      "\"Yeah, the hair. This is my big barometer, back there, absolutely. When you feel something, it's not intellectual, at all. I said, 'Oh, my gosh, Mr. Gordy, I saw this great act.' He said, 'Great.' I said, 'Wait till you see these kids.' He said, 'Kids? I don't want any kid acts. Are you crazy?'\"",
      "She wasn't. And Motown introduced The Jackson 5 to the world.",
      "de Passe took them to the dentist, worked on their early dance moves, and even picked out their wardrobe. She found Michael Jackson's hat on 8th Street in Greenwich Village. \"It was iconic, but nobody knew it at the time,\" she said.",
      "In the 1970s, she was discovering and developing artists for Motown in L.A., signing The Commodores, De Barge, and Rick James. \"I feel like I'm lucky to be alive,\" she laughed. Why? \"Because Rick was bigger than life. He was a great consumer of drugs, and just a brilliant, brilliant artist.\"",
      "It is a notorious business, and difficult to navigate, especially back then, especially for her.",
      "I asked, \"You weren't just a woman, you were a Black woman. Are you saying you faced, like, things coming at you, sexism, racism?\"",
      "\"I have had every 'ism' to deal with,\" said de Passe. \"Sexism, racism, pessimism, optimism, you know? And what I've found is that the moment you let yourself be defined by your 'isms' is when you've lost.\"",
      "de Passe always persevered. She was also a good persuader, convincing Diana Ross that the song \"I'm Coming Out\" would be a smash hit. Ross' first reaction, said de Passe, was, \"in very blatant terms, 'I hate these songs.' But I felt it would be [a hit]. Nobody knows. That's the thing about it. Nobody knows.\"",
      "\"But clearly you have really good sixth sense?\" I asked.",
      "\"I believe in what I believe in,\" de Passe replied. \"And some of it works and some of it doesn't. But I'm happy to say I have a good percentage.\"",
      "In 1982, de Passe was made president of Motown Productions. One of her first big projects was the TV special \"Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever.\" Nearly 50 million people watched Michael Jackson do the moonwalk. \"Oh, my God. and it was only six seconds,\" said de Passe. \"But the whole 'Billy Jean' of it all was just magic, I think, because nobody had ever seen anything like that before.\"",
      "de Passe also produced the landmark miniseries \"Lonesome Dove.\"",
      "I said, \"A lot of people would ask, 'What does Motown know about westerns?'\"",
      "\"Probably nothing; but I did,\" de Passe replied. \"I think the death of art is that you have to be gay to play gay. I think the death of art is that you have to be Black to direct or write a Black movie. The death of art is to not have the best person do what it is they are well-suited and passionate to do, regardless of all that other exterior stuff. And I am sick of it.\"",
      "At 78, she is still listening to her ear (and gut), finding new opportunities and stories to tell. And, with her induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Suzanne de Passe is recognized as a true pioneer.",
      "\"I am so grateful to have had that moment to really feel that energy coming back to me,\" she said. \"I will also say, I have worked really, really hard.\"",
      "\"For someone who worked behind the scenes and in the shadows, you felt seen?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh, definitely. I felt very seen, and very blessed.\"",

    "summary": "The multimedia artist talks about his cinematic timepiece, a 24-hour film comprised of scenes from movies and TV that track the viewer's own experience of time, minute by minute, currently screening at New York's Museum of Modern Art.",
    "story": [
      "From time to time, you might notice a shot of a clock in a movie. In a film like \"Back to the Future,\" they're key to the plot; lightning strikes the clock tower at exactly 10:04 p.m. But often, clocks are just ticking away in the background, or not ticking at all, like the watch from \"Pulp Fiction,\" stopped at 11:46.",
      "Compile enough of these seemingly minute details, and minutes can turn into hours, spanning decades of moving-image history. That is the case with artist Christian Marclay's \"The Clock,\" a 24-hour film comprised entirely of clips from movies and television.",
      "\"It's not to create a trick or to make you forget about time,\" Marclay said. \"I want you to be totally conscious about it throughout.\"",
      "Currently on view at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, \"The Clock\" runs on a continuous loop, synced to the precise time of day. When the kids in \"The Breakfast Club\" are whistling at 11:31 a.m., it's 11:31 in real life. An hour later, \"Rain Man\" announces \"Oh, it's 12:31.\" Minute by minute, the footage functions as an actual clock.",
      "Stuart Comer, the chief curator of media and performance at MoMA, calls watching Maclay's mash-up an uncanny experience. \"[You're] watching some of your favorite movies and realizing that it's telling the time that you're living in right now,\" Comer said. \"It's eliminating that barrier between you and the world on-screen.",
      "\"The effort that it took with Christian and the team of researchers locating 'The Clock' footage and all of these different clips is somewhat superhuman,\" he said.",
      "When Marclay won best artist for \"The Clock\" at the 2011 Venice Biennale, it turned him into a contemporary art superstar. But the 70-year-old first made a name for himself decades earlier as part of New York's underground DJ scene. \"In those days, you would find records \u2026 people would put them in their trash,\" he said.",
      "Born to an American mother and Swiss father, Marclay was raised in Switzerland and moved to the U.S. to attend art school in the late 1970s. \"I kept putting aside my work as a visual artist, 'cause I lived in a tiny East Village apartment, and I didn't have a studio,\" he said. \"So, music at that time was convenient.\"",
      "It was, he admitted, easier to store records than canvases. \"But you need tolerant neighbors!\" he laughed.",
      "Marclay's music was experimental. He was an early pioneer of \"turntablism,\" invited to spin on the short-lived show \"Night Music.\" \"I would destroy the records in performance, but then I had all these incredible covers, such an interesting history of graphic design. And I started collaging with them.\"",
      "One of Marclay's early successes in the visual art world arrived via his Body Mix series, in which he physically stitched together album covers to create new forms.",
      "He's unspooled cassette tapes to make prints and pillows. He's cut up everything from Japanese manga to movie subtitles, stacking cinematic fragments nearly 20 feet tall. He said he felt more comfortable as a collagist: \"I'm more interested in working with what exists rather than [to], you know, invent or draw something,\" he said.",
      "In 1995, Marclay created \"Telephones,\" a masterful mashup of film phone conversations.",
      "It's been more than a decade since \"The Clock\" was last in New York. Marclay is extremely precise about where and how it can be screened, insisting that any museum showing the work stay open at least once for 24 hours so audiences can see the nighttime section.",
      "Are there \"Clock\" completists? \"Oh, there are definitely 'Clock' squatters, I would say \u2013     people who really commit to watching it!\" Comer laughed.",
      "But Marclay insists the point isn't to see all of it; it's more to make you hyper-aware of the time you're spending literally watching a clock. \"Here, you're reminded that you have an appointment at a certain time, that you can't spend your whole day watching this thing,\" Marclay said. \"You're more than a viewer. You're a participant in a way, because your life infringes on this clock.\"",

      "\"It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of the singer, songwriter and actress Marianne Faithfull,\" her spokesperson said. \"Marianne passed away peacefully in London today, in the company of her loving family. She will be dearly missed.\"",
      "Faithfull was born in Hampstead, London, in December 1946. She was a folk singer who, one day, met with the manager of the Rolling Stones at a party, which led to her recording \"As Tears Go By\" by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in 1964. She was just 17 years old when she recorded the hit single.",
      "\"They came up and said to the person I was with, 'Can she sing?'\" Faithfull said to CBS Sunday Morning during a 2009 interview.",
      "The pop song ended up on the U.K. and American charts. Multiple hit singles and two debut albums followed.",
      "Jagger said on Thursday that he was \"so saddened to hear of the death\" of Faithfull.",
      "\"She was so much part of my life for so long,\" Jagger said on social media. \"She was a wonderful friend, a beautiful singer and a great actress. She will always be remembered.\"",
      "The daughter of an eccentric British professor and an Austrian baroness, Faithfull was just out of convent school when her career took off. At 18, she married a London art dealer and had a baby but later walked away from both her marriage and her career, for Jagger.",
      "She and Jagger began seeing each other in 1966 and became one of the most notorious couples of \"Swinging London,\" with Faithfull once declaring that if LSD \"wasn't meant to happen, it wouldn't have been invented.\"",

    "story": [
      "BATON ROUGE, La.\u00a0\u2014 A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the U.S.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "Prosecutors in Louisiana say a mother ordered the pill online and gave it to her child.",
      "\"The young child was told by the mother that she had to take the pill or else, and the child took the pill,\" District Attorney Tony Clayton said.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "\"To ship a pill from another state is equivalent to me of shipping fentanyl or any other type of drugs over here that end up in the mouths and stomachs of our minor kids,\" Clayton said.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "CBS News New York reached out to Carpenter, but has not heard back yet.",
      "Testing New York's shield laws",
      "The indictment could be the first direct test of New York's shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\"Earlier today, a New York doctor was indicted in Louisiana for using telemedicine to prescribe abortion medication to a patient. That's right: a doctor is being prosecuted for providing basic health care to her patient. We always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn't the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That's why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients. It's more critical than ever for states to step up and protect reproductive freedom \u2014 and I'll never back down from this fight,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Hochul signed the bill protecting doctors from out-of-state lawsuits\u00a0in 2023.",
      "\"I will never under any circumstances turn this doctor over to the state of Louisiana under any extradition request,\" Hochul said in a video posted to social media. \"I will do everything I can to protect this doctor and allow her to continue the work that she's doing that is so essential.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, said in a statement:",
      "\"Abortion care is health care. The criminalization of abortion care is a direct and brazen attack on Americans' bodily autonomy and their right to reproductive freedom. This cowardly attempt out of Louisiana to weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American. We will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers' ability to deliver critical care. Medication abortion is safe, effective, and necessary, and New York will ensure that it remains available to all Americans who need it.\"",
      "Legal experts say Carpenter may still face some hurdles.",
      "\"What happens when she tries to renew her medical license and she has a pending felony indictment in Louisiana? What happens to the doctor when she tries to fly somewhere and TSA says, hey, you have an active warrant?\" attorney Franz Borghardt said.",
      "Louisiana classifies abortion pills as \"controlled dangerous substances\"",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They're also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \"controlled dangerous substances.\" The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\"Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we've witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women's rights,\" the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \"It's no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\"",
      "Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency medicine physician in New York, said abortion bans are making it more dangerous for young girls and women.",

      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",

      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",

You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Devastating for farmers",
      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",

      "If confirmed as head of the department that oversees the FDA, Kennedy would have broad authority over how the pills are regulated, among a number of powers that HHS has to affect access to abortion nationwide.",
      "\"Today, we received clear signals that the prolife movement can work with RFK Junior. Acknowledging that every abortion is a tragedy left my team applauding,\" John Mize, head of the conservative group Americans United for Life, said in a statement.",
      "Mize's group led a \"coalition of leading pro-life organizations\" ahead of the hearing that called on the Trump administration to step up restrictions on the abortion pill or pull it from the U.S. market altogether, ending access to the medication abortion option, even in states where abortion is legal.",
      "\"President Trump has asked me to study the safety of mifepristone. He has not yet taken a stand on how to regulate it. Whatever he does, I will implement those policies and I will work with this committee, make those policies make sense,\" Kennedy told the Senate Committee on Finance.",

      "What Kennedy has described as his \"reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate\" dates back to 2005, when he wrote an article in Rolling Stone exploring supposed evidence for a link between autism and an ingredient that had formerly been used in some vaccines. The article contained numerous scientific and factual errors and was eventually retracted. Decades of research has established there is no such link.",
      "In 2016, Kennedy joined a nonprofit focused on mercury, which later broadened its focus and rebranded to Children's Health Defense. Kennedy chaired the group and served as one of its loudest voices raising doubts about vaccines and fighting against vaccine requirements and approvals.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, they clashed with federal health agencies over use of ivermectin and the federal mask mandate in travel. In 2021, the FDA denied their petition asking to revoke all COVID-19 vaccine authorizations and ban studies of the shots for children.",
      "As a candidate, Kennedy continued to say that he thought vaccines as well as \"a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods\" were to blame for rising rates of autism and other chronic diseases in U.S. children.

      "Joann Alker of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families had\u00a0called on\u00a0the administration to issue a statement clarifying that\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0should not be affected after its initial memo ordering the spending freeze late Monday, warning it is a\u00a0\"major crisis\"\u00a0as states look to draw down funding for the month.",
      "\"Any pause in federal funding of Medicaid \u2014 the largest source of federal funding received by states \u2014 would be disastrous for states as they need to draw down federal funds to meet their financial obligations to the health care providers and health plans serving Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries,\" Alker said.",
      "Health centers warn of \"irreversible\" consequences",
      "Even as the payment systems come back online, those who rely on the grants say they worry that new \"delays\" on payments imposed by the Trump administration could inflict permanent damage on stretched-thin health care systems.",
      "The HHS website currently warns that due \"to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "In a statement ahead of the lockout, HHS\u00a0announced\u00a0it would be reevaluating \"all programs, regulations, and guidance to ensure Federal taxpayer dollars are not being used to pay for or promote elective abortion\" following a previous\u00a0executive order.",
      "\"Even with the best of intentions, these types of funding freezes can do tremendous harm. And could be irreversible to some communities. What we're really talking about is a health center's ability to pay salaries,\" said Amanda Pears Kelly, CEO of the group Advocates for Community Health.",
      "The group lobbies on behalf of community health centers, which are subsidized by the federal government to offer health care to low-income communities.",
      "Pears Kelly said that health centers often rely on being able to request money every-other-week through the system, drawing down their grant to pay bills and make payroll for their staff. Without the money, she warned many health centers facing already slim margins could be forced to trim staff or close their doors.",
      "\"When the system's down, and there's no one to talk to to understand what they need to do, and then on top of that there's an uncertain time to the delay, it's paralyzing,\" said Pears Kelly.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association warned that health centers could face \"significant disruption\" to operations even with a \"temporary funding pause.\"",
      "\"For many patients, Title X-funded health centers serve as their sole source of health care. The Title X family planning program is already chronically underfunded, and this executive action risks destabilizing a health provider network that is already operating under immense strain,\" said Clare Coleman, president and CEO of the association.",
      "School lunches, other programs worry about impact",
      "The implications of the federal grant pause go beyond HHS, but the full effects are still unknown.",
      "It's unclear whether the National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools and school districts each month for the meals they serve children, will still receive funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture if the freeze takes effect. The program feeds about 28 million American schoolchildren each month.",

      "\"If in fact this order includes the Older Americans Act, this would presumably halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" a Meals on Wheels spokesperson said. \"And the lack of clarity and uncertainty right now is creating chaos for local Meals on Wheels providers not knowing for sure whether they should be serving meals today, which unfortunately means seniors will panic not knowing where their next meals will come from.\"",

    "title": "How are H5N9 and H5N1 different? What to know after California bird flu outbreak",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:28:23 -0500",
    "summary": "A different strain of H5N9 has shown up in U.S. birds before.",
    "story": [
      "A California duck farm made headlines this week after the World Organization of Animal Health published a report by U.S. authorities that a strain of bird flu that scientists call H5N9 had been found among sick birds in the flock.",
      "This is far from the first time that H5N9 has been found in birds around the country. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was the first time that H5N9 had been found in American poultry sick with \"highly pathogenic avian influenza,\" meaning it caused severe disease.",
      "\"Clinical signs included increased mortality. State officials have quarantined the affected premises,\" the USDA said of the flock.",
      "What is H5N9 and how is it different from H5N1?",
      "Scientists classify bird flu viruses by which kind of two key proteins are inside of them: the hemagglutinin, like H5 or H3, and the neuraminidase, like N1 or N9.",
      "Different blends of those two proteins alongside many other mutations elsewhere in the virus can affect how sick people and animals get and how it spreads.",
      "H5N1 has been the dominant grouping of strains fueling this past year's outbreaks in the U.S., with different variants of that virus spreading in wild birds, poultry flocks, dairy cattle, pets and into at least 67 confirmed human cases.",
      "A spokesperson for the department said that scientists believe the H5N9 was the result of a \"reassortment,\" where H5N1 was able to\u00a0genetically mix\u00a0with other influenza viruses inside of a duck.",
      "\"The finding was not unexpected, as it is not uncommon to see reassortments and ducks are reservoir hosts for influenza A viruses,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Both H5N9 and H5N1 were found to be infecting ducks at the farm, the USDA said.",
      "\"The H5N1 virus is widely circulating across North America, and these viruses can reassort in species that are susceptible to influenza viruses,\" said S. Mark Tompkins, director of the Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research at the University of Georgia. He agreed that it would not be \"terribly surprising\" to see a reassortment emerge to infect poultry.",
      "\"H5N1 reassorts with other avian influenza viruses quite frequently and even the current H5 HA protein that is infecting dairy cows and commercial poultry farms in the US has been shown to reassort,\"\u00a0Andy Pekosz, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an email.",
      "Has H5N9 been seen in the U.S. before?",
      "H5N9 has been seen before in U.S. birds, but often it results in less severe symptoms, called \"low pathogenic avian influenza\" by veterinarians.",
      "\"H5N9 viruses have been detected in North American wild birds in 2023 and 2024, and before the current outbreak,\" said Tompkins.",
      "Some of the\u00a0earliest records\u00a0of H5N9 around the world date back to turkeys infected in Wisconsin in the 1960s, which U.S. officials\u00a0reported had\u00a0\"mild respiratory symptoms and a severe drop in egg production.\"",
      "The California duck farm's strain of H5N9 is different from those earlier cases because this time it is closely related to a newer variant of the H5N1 virus. That variant is called H5N1 D1.1, the USDA spokesperson said, which has emerged over the past year to dominate U.S. cases in wild birds and poultry.",
      "\"The combination H5N9 is not new and other versions, like H5N5 also exist. Just because this was now detected, doesn't mean trouble necessarily,\" said virologist Florian Krammer, professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in an email.",
      "Krammer pointed to recent detections of the H5N5\u00a0strain spreading from Europe, and then jumping from birds to be able to infect mammals across Canada as prompting more worry for him.",
      "\"It's not really surprising, because we have a history of three years of H5N1 undergoing reassortments that would typically burn out and not emerge as a major one,\" said David Swayne, a private veterinarian and former director of the USDA's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory.",
      "Swayne said that past H5N9 outbreaks have been dead ends, in the handful of times they have been found to be causing severe disease in ducks.",
      "\"So far, I have not heard of any evidence to say this H5N9 has some kind of fitness that is better than the H5N1. If it doesn't have that, it can't outcompete,\" said Swayne.",
      "Is H5N9 a bigger risk to humans than H5N1?",
      "As with H5N1, H5N9 in birds would still need to achieve some key mutations before it is able to spread efficiently among humans.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the U.S. to date. Most cases were blamed on direct contact with sick animals, except for three that have befuddled investigators who failed to identify a likely source.",
      "It is unclear whether authorities followed up with workers at the Merced County farm about potential human infections. A spokesperson for the county did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "If H5N9 gains a foothold in humans, people may possibly have less immunity to the virus than they do to H5N1.",
      "\"The seasonal, human H1N1 virus has an NA protein that is related, but different from the bovine H5N1 NA protein. There is some cross-recognition of avian H5N1 NA in the human population because of this,\" said Pekosz.",
      "Where was the California H5N9 outbreak?",
      "The USDA said the virus was detected at a \"commercial duck meat\" farm in California's Merced County, in an outbreak that started on Nov. 23, 2024.",
      "A total of 118,954 birds were culled at the duck farm by Dec. 2 to stamp out the virus, in an effort to curb the risk of further bird flu spread.",
      "More than 3 million birds have been culled at farms in this California county over the past year due to bird flu outbreaks, the most of any county in the state. California has been hit hard by this past year's bird flu outbreaks, which have resulted in record cullings across the egg industry.",
      "Scientists say ducks are especially susceptible to harboring influenza viruses without being sick, making them common mixing vessels for bird flu strains.",
      "\"Unless you have very tight biosecurity, it is very hard to raise ducks without many low path influenza viruses,\" said Swayne.",
      "Swayne said ducks often need the lowest dose of virus to be infected with bird flu viruses, compared to other poultry, like chickens. One way the virus can spread onto farms is when they are raised outside, mixing with wild ducks.",
      "\"If you look at the natural history, wild ducks are the reservoir of genes for all influenza virus. There's probably an adaptation with the virus. These viruses infect without showing overt clinical disease, they spread very rapidly between the adults to the juveniles,\" said Swayne.",

      "\"It's no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator,\" the two-page letter said. \"His basement, his garage, and his dorm room were the centers of the action where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks. It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.\"",
      "Family members who followed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. down the path of substance abuse, Caroline Kennedy wrote, \"suffered addiction, illness and death, while Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\"",
      "She also said that while her cousin has discouraged parents from vaccinating their children, he has vaccinated his own.",
      "\"Even before he fills this job, his constant denigration of our health care system and the conspiratorial half-truths he has told about vaccines, including in connection with Samoa's deadly 2019 measles outbreak, have cost lives,\" Caroline Kennedy wrote.",
      "She also read her letter to the senators in a social media post on X.",
      "His \"crusade against vaccination\" serves to enrich him financially, she said. His financial disclosures\u00a0showed\u00a0RFK Jr. still intends to receive legal fees from Wisner Baum, a firm suing the maker of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil over its alleged failure to warn consumers about its risks.",
      "\"In other words,\" she said, \"he is willing to enrich himself by denying access to a vaccine that can prevent almost all forms of cervical cancer and which has been safely administered to millions of boys and girls.\" She went on to say that while she was ambassador to Australia, she learned it was one of the top three cancers afflicting women in a majority of countries.",
      "Caroline Kennedy also excoriated RFK Jr. over his presidential campaign: \"It also wasn't easy to remain silent last year when Bobby expropriated my father's image and distorted President Kennedy's legacy to advance his own failed presidential campaign \u2014 and then groveled to Donald Trump for a job. Bobby continues to grandstand off my father's assassination, and that of his own father. It is incomprehensible that someone who is willing to exploit their own painful family tragedies for publicity would be in charge of American life-and-death situations.\"",
      "Her cousin, she said, is \"addicted to attention and power.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's controversial pick is set to appear Wednesday before the Senate Committee on Finance, which will decide whether to advance his nomination. On Thursday, he is scheduled to testify before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.",

Conservatives groups have expressed concern about his past statements in support of abortion rights, though he has reassured them that he would follow Mr. Trump's promise to defer the issue to states. Democrats and vaccine experts have condemned him for spreading misleading claims on a range of vaccines, including the COVID-19 and polio shots.",

    "story": [
      "Republican officials have been quietly pointing out that the Trump administration's so-called buyout program is illegal, but they doubt that Congress will push back, sources told CBS News.",
      "Many federal workers saw an email first thing Monday morning when they arrived at their desks that offered more details of the deferred resignations program.",
      "Some lawmakers have noted the offer of pay through Sept. 30 violates the Anti-Deficiency Act, a law that prevents the government from promising or spending money in excess of what Congress has made available. Congress has funded the government only through mid-March, not through the end of the fiscal year at the end of September.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump administration's Office of Personnel Management stressed that no federal employees' pay will be guaranteed with the deadline looming.",

      "A: Any government shutdown could potentially affect an employee's pay regardless of whether he or she has accepted the deferred resignation offer. Moreover, if you accept the deferred resignation offer, you would still be entitled to backpay under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act.",

      "London \u2014\u00a0Canadian sports fans, angry at President Trump's unilateral imposition of 25% tariffs on virtually everything imported from Canada, reacted icily to the Star-Spangled Banner as it was sung at hockey and basketball games over the weekend. Many booed the U.S. national anthem in an uncharacteristic show of frustration after more than 150 years of peaceful, friendly relations along the vast border separating the neighbors.",
      "The reaction was representative of hurt feelings both north and south of the U.S. mainland's borders on Monday. Top officials in Canada and Mexico, which both faced 25% tariffs\u00a0with the stroke of Mr. Trump's pen on Saturday, were expected to hold conversations with the White House on the way forward in a new trade war that Mr. Trump had threatened for months. Both countries vowed to respond with their own trade measures.",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum announced in a brief statement Monday on social media that, after a phone call with Mr. Trump, the tariffs imposed on her country were \"on pause for one month from now.\" She said Mr. Trump had agreed to put the measures on hold after she committed to reinforcing Mexico's border with the U.S. \"with 10,000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States.\"",

Fruits and fruit juices including orange juice, along with vegetables, perfume, clothing and shoes. It will include major consumer products like household appliances, furniture and sports equipment, and materials like lumber and plastics, along with much, much more.\"",
      "\"Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada,\" Trudeau added to his own constituents in a post on social media. \"Check the labels. Let's do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.\"",

In 21 days, the remainder of the tariffs, covering an additional $125 billion worth of products, will kick in unless some new agreement is reached between the countries. The delay, said Trudeau, was aimed at giving Canadian companies time to seek supply chain options to soften the financial blow.",

      "For a quick fact check on Mr. Trump's criticism: He's not wrong about the lop-sided trade relationship between the U.S. and its close allies across the Atlantic. Through November 2024, the EU ran a trade deficit of $78 billion with the U.S., according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and reports indicate that's on track to be a new record.",

      "Mr. Trump's tariffs on the EU and his looming, if tempered threat to hit Britain with the same will complicate Starmer's nascent efforts to \"reset\" U.K. trade ties with the EU. He's at the helm of the U.K.'s first Labour Party government in a decade and a half, and it was the former Conservative leadership that ushered in Brexit and soured the long-standing close ties with Europe.",
      "Starmer has moved cautiously as he sets out to mend fences with the EU, wary of riling up conservative voters who supported Brexit and who, to some degree, now support populist politicians such as the Trump-aligned, anti-immigration leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister has ruled out rejoining the EU customs union or its single currency market, and he's so far resisted pressure from the continent to ease post-Brexit restrictions on U.K. and EU citizens living and working on either side of the border, at least for young people.",

      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that imposes 25%\u00a0tariffs on imports\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, while adding an additional 10% levy on goods from China. Hours later, Canada responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own, while Mexico said it was also planning to issue tariffs on the U.S. as well, adding to the potential fallout from a trade war with two of the U.S.' closest trading partners.",

      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move in a series of social media posts, one of which read: \"You're worried about grocery prices. Don's raising prices with his tariffs.\"",
      "Experts warn that the impact of the tariffs could affect the economies of Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 the nation's three biggest trading partners \u2014 as well as the U.S. itself. Canada's economy could shrink by 3.6%, while Mexico could take a 2% hit, according to Cornell University economics professor Wendong Zhang.",

      "\"We have stressed that steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock \u2014 a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse \u2014 while also triggering financial market volatility,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in a Jan. 31 report.",
      "Daco added, \"These tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China would mark the first major wave of trade levies in Trump's new term, with effects rippling far beyond those economies, as other nations brace for potential targeting and U.S. businesses navigate supply chain disruptions and retaliation risks.\"",
      "American consumers have been bracing for the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, telling pollsters that they expected to see higher prices if the president followed through on his plans to enact them. Those expectations may have prompted some consumers to purchase goods before Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists say.",
      "\"The mere prospect of tariffs appears to be influencing the behavior of consumers and businesses,\" analysts with Oxford Economics in a research note. \"Imports surged in December, likely an attempt to front-run any tariffs, while consumers may be bringing forward spending in anticipation of tariff-related price hikes.\"",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "All these years later it still amazes me how so many disparate things had to come together for me to use a computer in 1968. Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",
      "The page included a sample program written in BASIC telling the computer how to add two numbers.",

      "10 INPUT X,Y",
      "20 LET A=X+Y",
      "30 PRINT A",
      "40 END",
      "That was probably the first computer program I ever typed in. The elegance of the four lines of code appealed to my sense of order. Its instantaneous answer was like a jolt of electricity. From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

      "Americans could soon be paying more for everything from automobiles to avocados after the Trump administration levied\u00a0stiff new tariffs\u00a0on the nation's three largest trading partners.",
      "President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Saturday, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China.",
      "While Mr. Trump describes tariffs as import duties that are paid by foreign countries, they are in fact paid directly to the federal government by U.S. businesses,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank. Rather than swallowing the costs, corporations typically hike their prices for those imported goods to recoup all or some of the expense.",
      "Who pays the cost?",
      "\"If there is a significant increase in tariffs ... those costs will likely be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses,\" Brian Peck, executive director of University of Southern California's Center for Transnational Law and Business, told CBS Los Angeles.",
      "\"From Canada, we import oil, lumber, wood and cement,\" he added. \"Over 20% of the agriculture products we bring into the U.S. come from Mexico.\"",
      "One unknown is whether the Trump administration will carve out some exceptions, such as for oil and gas products. Canada provides about 20% of the oil used in the U.S., which means that a 25% tariff on Canadian imports could add 30 to 40 cents a gallon at the pump within days of the new duties taking effect, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has said.",
      "As painful as higher costs might be to U.S. consumers, the biggest impacts would likely be felt by the Canadian and Mexican economies, according to Wendong Zhang, assistant professor of applied economics and policy at Cornell University. A 25% tariff could cause Canada and Mexico to lose 3.6% and 2% of real GDP,\u00a0 respectively, versus a decline of 0.3% for the U.S., Zhang estimated.",
      "Here's what could get pricier for American shoppers if the Trump administration's tariffs take effect.",
      "Avocados, beef and other foods",
      "Inflation-pinched consumers may face a surge in prices for fruits, vegetables and nuts imported from Mexico, including avocados \u2014 just in time for the Super Bowl on Feb. 9.",
      "The U.S. imported more than $45 billion in agricultural products from Mexico in 2023, including fresh strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes and beef, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. also imports Mexican beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. imported about $40 billion of Canadian agricultural products that same year, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "A 25% tariff could push prices up for all those products.",
      "\"Grocery stores operate on really tiny margins,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute. \"They can't eat the tariffs ... especially when you talk about things like avocados that basically all of them \u2014 90% \u2014 come from Mexico. You're talking about guacamole tariffs right before the Super Bowl.\"",
      "Cars",
      "American consumers are increasingly buying cars that are either built in Canada or Mexico or that use parts imported from those nations. The U.S. imported $69 billion of cars and light trucks from Mexico in 2023, and another $37 billion from Canada, according to S&P Global Mobility.",
      "On top of that, about $78 billion in auto parts stemmed from Mexico and $20 billion from Canada. For instance, the engines used in Ford's F-series pickup trucks come from Canada.",
      "Because U.S. importers are expected to roll any added tariff costs into vehicle sticker prices, the average U.S. automobile price could jump by about $3,000, TD Economics estimates. That would come at a time when the average new car already sells for $50,000 and the average used car for $26,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Lumber",
      "About one-third of softwood lumber used in the U.S. is imported from Canada each year, according to Rajan Parajuli, an associate professor of forest economics and policy at North Carolina State University.",
      "Tacking a 25% tariff on Canadian lumber could cause a \"supply shock,\" the Forest Resources Association, a trade group, wrote in a December blog post. \"Regarding lumber, the U.S. still needs Canadian supplies to meet its domestic consumption demand,\" the group said.",
      "Still, the slow U.S. housing market, dampened by mortgage rates that remain close to 7%, could make it hard for companies to pass on the new tariffs through higher lumber prices, some economists said.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 17:38:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump is an avowed supporter of tariffs, but many experts say such trade measures can boost inflation.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, an avowed fan of tariffs, imposed a\u00a0wave of new import duties\u00a0Saturday on America's three closest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Although tariffs are a bane to most economists, they are a widely used as a tool for regulating international trade and for shielding domestic industries from foreign competition. At the simplest level, tariffs are taxes placed on goods made overseas that are imported into the country. Notably, foreign companies aren't responsible for paying the duties. Instead, U.S. businesses directly pay the tariffs on their imported goods to the federal government, according to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank.",
      "Because American businesses are on the hook for paying the tariffs on imports, they historically have passed on some or all of those costs to consumers. At the same time, tariff proponents like Mr. Trump argue that such levies can help protect manufacturers here at home. For instance, consumers may opt to buy U.S.-made products rather than newly pricier imports, while companies may choose to avoid tariffs by opening new plants in the U.S.",
      "\"Come make your product in America,\" Mr. Trump said last week at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland. \"But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff.\"",
      "Many economists and other trade experts say tariffs are not beneficial. The Peterson Institute for International Economics points out that tariffs \"have a poor record\" of sparking a resurgence in manufacturing.",
      "On Friday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump on Saturday will impose 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canadian imports and an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods entering the U.S. She cited \"illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country\" as the reason for the tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the possibility of additional tariffs, such as an across-the-board duty of 10% on all goods imported into the U.S. Here's what to know about tariffs.",
      "What exactly are tariffs?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S..",
      "The most common type are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value, which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of the imports. These are the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed as a 25% import tax on goods shipped from Mexico or Canada, such as avocados or lumber.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, such as if the U.S. were to propose a $1 tariff on each imported Mexican avocado.",
      "Another such type of levy are \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold. For instance, this type of quota was used by the first Trump administration in 2018 on\u00a0washing machines, when the first 1.2 million imported units faced a 20% duty, while units above that number were taxed at a 50% rate, according to the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which advocates for more restrictive trade policies.",
      "Who pays for tariffs?",
      "Companies that import the goods from abroad pay the tariffs to their own nation. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection collects tariffs from importers \u2014 say, Walmart or Target \u2014 and then deposits the money into the General Fund of the United States.",
      "Mr. Trump has\u00a0claimed\u00a0that foreign countries pay the duties. As part of his campaign, he vowed that tariffs would help raise \"trillions and trillions of dollars\" from foreign governments.",
      "In fact, American consumers would likely bear the brunt of the cost, as big U.S. importers are likely to pass on the tariffs they pay to the customs department to consumers, economists say. In some cases, foreign manufacturers may also choose to lower their prices to offset the impact of those tariffs in order to maintain their sales. And some U.S. businesses could absorb some of the tariff costs to avoid driving away consumers and potentially losing market share to competitors.",
      "If Mr. Trump enacts all the tariffs he's vowed to levy on imports, the typical U.S. consumer could face up to $2,400 in increased costs for every year the tariffs remain in force, according to an estimate from financial services firm ING.",
      "Could tariffs boost inflation?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs would sharply push the current effective U.S. tariff rate from 2.4% to 31%. That would be a historic high and surpass those seen under President McKinley in the 1890s, when U.S. trade policies were far more protectionist, and during the 1930s under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, according to Capital Economics.",
      "As a result, inflation would likely jump, rising from an annual rate of about 2.9% currently to as high as 4%, or about double the Federal Reserve's 2% target, Capital Economics noted. That would put inflation back to its mid-2023 levels, when the Fed was keeping interest rates near a two-decade as it tried bring inflation under control.",
      "\"[I]mposing any of these suggested tariffs would generate a rebound in consumer price inflation this year, taking it further above target and making it harder for the Fed to resume loosening monetary policy,\" Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "Why does Trump support tariffs?",
      "President Trump cites tariffs as a way to accomplish several policy goals, including raising more money to fund the government and protecting domestic industries.",
      "Both he and his allies, including his new Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0contend that tariffs enacted during the first Trump administration didn't boost inflation. But those tariffs, which applied to only some Chinese imports, \"were too small to matter\" and so didn't have an inflationary impact, Capital Economics said in its research note.",
      "Mr. Trump has also cited the need to boost U.S. manufacturing, saying in an October interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "The data to support that claim is mixed. The tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal to some extent, with the Brookings Institution\u00a0noting\u00a0that jobs in a few industries may have rebounded, such as adding 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other washing machine manufacturers.",
      "Overall, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers. A range of factors could account for that decline, such as the impact of the pandemic and broader economic issues facing manufacturing.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has fired the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, in the latest purge of a Biden Administrator holdover.",
      "Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. In a letter to the president shared on social media, Chopra said it was an \"extraordinary privilege\" to serve as director of the CFPB.",
      "\"With so much power concentrated in the hands of a few, agencies like the CFPB have never been more critical,\" he wrote. \"I'm proud that the CFPB has done so much to restore the rule of law.\"",
      "Chopra was notified of his firing via an email from the White House, a person familiar with the notice who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly told the Associated Press.",
      "During his term, Mr. Trump had picked Chopra as a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "An ally of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Chopra then was\u00a0tapped by former President Joe Biden\u00a0to lead the consumer agency that he helped launch after the 2008-09 financial crisis. He served as its deputy director, sounding the alarm about skyrocketing levels of student loan debt.",
      "Warren, one of Mr. Trump's favorite targets, said in a statement that the CFPB under Chopra held \"Wall Street accountable for cheating hard-working families\" and prevented \"the de-banking of Americans across the country, including consumers locked out of the financial system due to overdraft fees, religious organizations, and conservatives.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump will enact 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1, as well as a 10% tariff on imports from China, according to White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.",
      "\"The president will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China, for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,\" Leavitt said at a White House briefing on Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he's\u00a0targeting Canada and Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the nation's biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S. The president has also said tariffs will generate money for the federal government, although the import duties are paid by U.S. importers. Companies such as Walmart, Target and other U.S. importers typically pass tariff-related costs onto American consumers.",
      "Asked whether Mr. Trump's new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China would include any exemptions, Leavitt said she didn't have information about that issue.",
      "Mr. Trump's goals include narrowing the trade surplus between those nations and the U.S. The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has surged from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023, largely reflecting growing American imports of Canadian energy. Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Experts warn that steep new tariffs on imports could cause U.S. economic growth to slow and inflation to flare, noting that companies in the U.S. are likely to pass on the added costs to consumers. A sustained burst of inflation, in turn, could also deter the Federal Reserve from pushing down borrowing costs, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Even the prospect of higher import duties is influencing spending by consumers and businesses, according to Oxford Economics. Analysts with the investment adviser note that U.S. imports surged in December, a sign Americans are buying appliances, furniture and other goods now to get ahead of possible price increases.",
      "Retaliation risks",
      "A volley of new U.S. tariffs is likely to invite swift retaliation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that his country is prepared to fire back if Mr. Trump proceeds with his plan, but he did not give details.",
      "\"We're ready with a response, a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,\" he said. \"It's not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act.\"",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that Mexico has conferred with Trump's team since before he returned to the White House, but she emphasized that Mexico has a \"Plan A, Plan B, Plan C for what the United States government decides.\"",
      "\"Now it is very important that the Mexican people know that we are always going to defend the dignity of our people, we are always going to defend the respect of our sovereignty and a dialogue between equals, as we have always said, without subordination,\" she said.",
      "The ultimate economic damage from the U.S. tariffs would hinge on how long they are in place, Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator, told the Associated Press.",
      "If it's just a few days, \"that's one thing. If they are in place for weeks onto months, we're going to see supply chain disruptions, higher costs for U.S. manufacturers, leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers,\" said Cutler, now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \"It could have macroeconomic impacts.

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, faces scrutiny for fees he may earn from lawsuits against Merck.",
    "story": [
      "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation hearings to serve as the nation's top health official play out on Capitol Hill, President Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services is facing scrutiny not only for his anti-vaccine views, but whether he profits from them.",
      "If confirmed, Kennedy would wield control over federal vaccine policy and the regulation of drugmakers, even as he stands to potentially profit from vaccine-related litigation.",
      "How Kennedy made money from lawsuits",
      "Kennedy for years has earned referral fees from Wisner Baum, a Los Angeles personal injury law firm that is currently suing Merck, alleging the pharmaceutical giant failed to properly warn the public about risks from its vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), Gardasil, according to financial disclosure documents filed by Kennedy with the Office of Government Ethics.",
      "Wisner Baum is representing a plaintiff in a trial against Merck and other lawsuits are in the works in North Carolina.",
      "\"An overwhelming body of scientific evidence, including more than 30 years of research and development along with real world evidence generated by Merck and by independent investigators, continues to support the safety and efficacy profiles of our HPV vaccines,\" Rahway, New Jersey-based Merck said Tuesday in a\u00a0statement on the litigation. \"The plaintiff's allegations have no merit, and we remain committed to vigorously defending against these claims in the upcoming trial.\"",
      "In a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, repeatedly asked Kennedy if he would agree to forgo payments stemming from litigation against drugmakers after disclosing in Ethics Office filings that he might collect legal fees for referring potential plaintiffs in Wisner Baum's suits against Merck over its HPV vaccine, which is to prevent cervical cancer.",
      "Kennedy has made about $2.5 million since 2022 in his work with the law firm, including $850,000 last year, public records show. Kennedy, himself a longtime personal injury lawyer, could earn even more if the litigation against Merck prevails given that he is opting to keep his stake in the pending court case, according to ethics documents filed before his confirmation hearings.",
      "Kennedy has a consulting arrangement to refer cases to Wisner Baum, which is pursuing cases related to the HPV vaccine Gardasil. If Kennedy is confirmed, he said he would resign from that arrangement.",
      "\"I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,\" Kennedy stated in his ethics pledge. According to the document, Kennedy will retain an interest in cases that do not involve the U.S. as a party and in which the U.S. does not have a \"direct and substantial interest.\"",
      "At the same time, Kennedy vowed to divest his rights to payment in contingency fee cases in which the U.S. is a party or has a direct or large interest to a \"non-dependent, adult family member.\"",
      "Financial conflict of interest?",
      "Kennedy's plan to continue collecting contingency fees while serving as Health and Human Services secretary raises questions as a matter of ethics and policy, according to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, \"It's very unusual for a cabinet secretary to retain an interest in contingency fee litigation,\" Clark told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's troubling.\"",
      "For example, if Kennedy stands to financially gain in lawsuits against Merck or other drugmakers, his impartiality as HHS secretary could face scrutiny if the companies faced a federal enforcement action or submitted a drug for government approval, Clark added.",
      "Wisner Baum said it hasn't paid Kennedy for his work linked to the firm's suits against Merck, which is just getting started in California.",
      "The firm \"has only compensated Mr. Kennedy for Monsanto Roundup-induced non-Hodgkins lymphoma cases, Woolsey Fire cases and Paradise/Camp Fire cases. All of these cases alleged corporate wrongdoing that caused life-changing harm to victims,\" Wisner Baum said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We are currently in trial in the first Gardasil case in Los Angeles. We hope, like in Roundup, soundbites take a backseat to truth, take a backseat to actual evidence, and a jury returns a verdict sending the same message multiple juries did in Roundup \u2014 consumers deserve to know the truth, and politics has nothing to do with it,\" said Wisner Baum's managing partner, R. Brent Wisner, alluding to long-running ligation against Monsanto, now owned by Germany's Bayner, over a weedkiller alleged to cause cancer.",
      "Kennedy also made another $326,056 in salary and benefits from the Children's Health Defense, which he founded and formerly chaired, according to his ethics filings. The nonprofit has filed dozens of state and federal lawsuits challenging vaccine and public health mandates. Its targets include the federal agencies that Kennedy would run at HHS.",
      "During the hearing, Warren pointed to several changes Kennedy could make that might enrich him in connection with such lawsuits if he is approved as health secretary. That includes appointing anti-vaccine advocates to vaccine advisory panels, removing vaccines from recommendations or changing the way the vaccine injury compensation program works.",
      "Kennedy would not commit to Warren's request to forgo contingency fees while serving as HHS secretary. However, in written responses\u00a0to Warren on Friday, Kennedy agreed to amend his ethics agreement, a document that should be \"thoroughly reviewed\" before the Senate moves forward on Kennedy's nominatioin, the senator's office stated.",
      "\"It would be insufficient for RFK Jr. to only divest his interest in the Gardasil case while leaving the window open to profit from other anti-vax lawsuits, including future cases he could bring after leaving office,\" Warren said in a statement on Friday.",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a phone message requesting comment. Representatives for the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "MAHA trademark pending",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican of Idaho, asked Kennedy if there was \"anything that you are aware of in your background that might present a conflict of interest within the duties of the office to which you have been nominated?\"",
      "Kennedy replied \"No, Mr. Chairman.\"",
      "As part of the confirmation proceedings, Kennedy in December disclosed earning $100,000 from variations of his slogan, \"Make America Healthy Again\" and its abbreviation \u2014 MAHA \u2014 on stickers, hats and hoodies. Kennedy had in recent months applied for trademark protection for the phrase, setting the stage for marketing supplements, vitamins, essential oils and cryptocurrency, according to documents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.",

      "Union members say Costco needs to offer a labor contract that reflects its sales and profit growth. The company's revenue rose 5% to $254 billion in its most recent fiscal year, which ended Sept. 1. It reported net income of $7.3 billion, double its profit in 2019.",

    "title": "Is Trump about to lead the U.S. into a trade war? Here's what to know.",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 14:13:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Less than two weeks into his second term, President Trump is poised to deploy steep tariffs against key U.S. trading partners.",
    "story": [
      "On the day of his inauguration, President Trump threatened steep new tariffs against key U.S. trading partners. Now he is primed to deliver.",
      "\"The president will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China, for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said at a Jan. 31 press briefing.",
      "Leavitt's confirmation of the tariffs comes after Trump on Thursday reiterated his earlier threat this month that he could announce 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1, telling reporters from the Oval Office that the duties \"may or may not rise with time.\" He had previously warned China could face a 10% tariff.",
      "Economists have warned that stiff tariffs\u00a0could reawaken U.S. inflation on a range of consumer goods and slow economic growth. Here's what experts have to say.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to hit countries with tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened tariffs against multiple nations for a range of reasons. He said he is specifically\u00a0targeting Canada, Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the U.S.' biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S., as well as to narrow their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has surged from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023, largely reflecting growing American imports of Canadian energy. Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Before Mr. Trump returned to power, he also had threatened tariffs of up to\u00a060% on Chinese goods\u00a0imported into the U.S., a measure experts say is intended to advance American interests in negotiating better trade terms with Beijing, as well as throttle the illegal entry of fentanyl into the country.",
      "In a show of how his administration uses tariff threats to pressure countries on other issues, Mr. Trump last week proposed potential 25% levies against Colombia unless it agreed to receive deportations of unauthorized immigrants. Colombia ultimately agreed to receive the immigrants,\u00a0and the tariffs were withheld.",
      "Colombia's about-face suggests that Canada and Mexico could also reach agreement with the U.S. and avert a painful trade war. To that end, Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, said at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that Canada and Mexico could avoid tariffs by closing their borders to fentanyl.",
      "\"As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,\" Lutnick told senators.",
      "Even so, Mr. Trump's brandishing of potential tariffs \u2014 even if they are never imposed \u2014 highlights his willingness to use tough trade measures to punish even the country's closest allies unless they make concessions.",
      "\"As we have previously noted, trade policy will be transactional over the next four years with protectionist measures used to extort trade, immigration and other political concessions,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "What exactly is Trump planning?",
      "Along with targeting Canada and Mexico, the Trump administration has floated the possibility of a blanket tariff on a range of countries in Asia, South America, Europe and other regions.",
      "\"I think we have to proceed on the assumption that some kinds of tariffs are going to be imposed on the United States' major trading partners,\" Brett House, professor of economics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In the end, there is a lot that gets announced by the president on social media that does not come to pass. I don't take it as bluffing, so much as a storm of possibilities, and it's hard to tell which bit of that storm is going to be pursued most aggressively, and most immediately.\"",
      "What's clear, by contrast, is that the new administration is picking up where Mr. Trump left off in his first term in using trade policy as an instrument of both economic and foreign policy. That is likely to lead to a period of uncertainty and volatility, said John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at supply-chain software firm E2open.",
      "\"A lot of alternatives are still possible,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch in an interview. \"We don't know, but game theory would suggest the president would implement tariffs in some form against Mexico and Canada \u2014 not blanket tariffs, but on a select number of imports from both nations... because otherwise his bluff is going to be called.\"",
      "On how soon any tariffs could take effect, Daco notes that Mr. Trump could move quickly by claiming authority under a 1977 law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "\"When he said he'll impose tariffs on Feb. 1, it is still an open question as to what means would be used. Do you want to implement tariffs immediately, as threatened against Colombia over the weekend, or are you threatening with a deadline to obtain concessions?\" Daco said.",
      "Would the U.S. face retaliation?",
      "Almost certainly, economists say. If Trump officials move ahead with tariffs on its northern neighbor, \"We anticipate Canada would then respond in kind by also implementing a 25% across-the-board tariff on U.S. imports,\" Satyam Panday, chief U.S. and Canada economist with S&P Global Ratings, said in an email.",
      "Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, previously vowed to remove U.S.-made alcoholic beverages from stores in the Canadian province, according to the Associated Press. Canada is the world's second-largest market for America's distilled spirits, behind European Union.",
      "Elijah Oliveros-Rosen, chief emerging markets economist at S&P Global Ratings, predicted Mexico also would fire back with targeted tariffs. \"In the case of Mexico, we think it's very unlikely the government would place tariffs on U.S.-manufactured imports, given most are intermediate goods eventually exported to the U.S. Therefore, we expect the Mexican government could impose tariffs on agricultural and food imports, but not manufacturing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that strengthening the U.S.' stance on trade issues will help protect American workers and lead to a resurgence of domestic manufacturing. Yet such policies could come at the cost of damaging critical relationships with other nations around the world, said Douglas Irwin, a U.S. trade policy expert and professor of economics at Dartmouth College.",
      "What is the risk to American consumers?",
      "Irwin and other economists say tariffs are all but certain to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. That's because companies that end up on the hook typically pass added costs along to consumers in order to protect their bottom lines.",
      "\"The notion this administration has been adhering to is somewhat surprising \u2014 the idea that if you implement gradual tariffs over time, such as in 5% increments, that these are less inflationary,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This idea is misguided, because if you have incremental price increases month after month, if anything that leads to higher inflation expectations. It leads to higher inflation on a month-to-month basis.\"",
      "If Mr. Trump's tariffs are implemented in full, including a universal 10% tax on all goods, consumer price inflation could rise to between 3% and 4%, according to an analysis this week from Capital Economics. To be sure, analysts with the investment advisory firm expect Mr. Trump to stop short of imposing a blanket tariff and instead pick his targets.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, suggested that a volley of tariffs between the countries would also impact U.S. consumers.",
      "\"From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose,\" he said in an email.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

They are also pulling back on efforts to include hiring and promoting women, minorities, LGBTQ+ people and veterans.",
      "Activists held a press conference at Target headquarters in downtown Minneapolis Thursday morning.",

In the past, Target was known for its diversity initiatives and reputation for supporting diverse communities,\" said civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. \"Now Target has shown its true face by deciding to roll back its focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion by putting profits and politics over people.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",

    "story": [
      "At Market Basket locations in some parts of Massachusetts, customers are being asked to limit their egg purchases\u00a0to two cartons per family. Another shopper on the hunt for eggs, this one in Las Vegas, reported finding\u00a0empty shelves\u00a0at a local grocery store. On social media, a consumer\u00a0accustomed to paying around $2 for a dozen eggs expressed shock over now having to pay more than double that amount.",
      "Egg restrictions, shortages and record-high prices are ruffling feathers at supermarkets across the U.S. as a deadly strain of avian flu\u00a0continues to decimate\u00a0the country's poultry flocks. To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "Like many diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green said that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. Like we, we have to figure out how to make it work,\" she said. \"Eggs are central to us, we are a diner. You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Devastating for farmers",
      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 12:48:00 -0500",
    "summary": "With tax season underway, here's what you need to know about tracking your tax refund and your new 2025 tax brackets.",
    "story": [
      "Tax season is now underway, with the IRS accepting returns for all taxpayers as of Jan. 27. That's prompting many people to turn to the \"Where's my refund?\" app from the tax agency to track when they'll get their check.",
      "Americans are expected to file about 140 million returns before the April 15 deadline. Last year, about two-thirds of taxpayers got a refund, with the average check at about $3,100,\u00a0according\u00a0to IRS data.",
      "A household's tax refund may represent their biggest check for the entire year, with many consumers planning to use the money for debt repayment, emergency savings or a big purchase. To be sure, while a large refund may feel like a financial windfall, it actually represents income that taxpayers have overpaid to the IRS throughout the year.",
      "That's why some financial experts describe refund checks as tax-free loans to the U.S. government. Yet other experts note that tax refunds can act as a form of forced savings that a household might not otherwise be able to accomplish, allowing those taxpayers to reap the benefit in their annual refund.",
      "Whatever the case might be, tracking your refund can be done through the IRS' \"Where's my refund\" app, which the agency has sought to improve over the last few years. Here's what to know.",
      "How does \"Where's my refund?\" work?",
      "The IRS operates the \"Where's my refund?\" service on its website, but taxpayers can also use a mobile app called IRS2Go\u00a0on their phones or other devices. Both services will provide information about your 2024 return about 24 hours after you e-file, the IRS says.",
      "However, people who file paper returns will need to wait about 4 weeks for their information to appear on \"Where's my refund?\" or the IRS2Go app.",
      "Both services require taxpayers to enter information to be able to track their refunds:",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification numberFiling status, such as single filer or married filing jointly\u00a0The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification number",
      "Filing status, such as single filer or married filing jointly",
      "The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "The IRS tracking services will then show you information on whether the agency has received your tax return, if the refund has been approved and when the money is scheduled to land in your account.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "That depends on whether you've file electronically or sent in a paper tax return, as well as if the IRS identifies any problems with your return.",
      "People who e-filed their returns typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days. In other words, a taxpayer who filed their 1040 on Jan. 27 could receive their payment by Feb. 17, if all goes smoothly.",
      "However, the IRS opened its Free File service on Jan. 10, which is a program offered through tax software companies for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024. Those using Free File could be on tap to receive their refunds by Jan. 31.",
      "What can delay your tax refund?",
      "Filing a paper return can delay your refund because it requires IRS employees to process them, which takes more time than e-filed returns, which are largely handled by computers.",
      "Claiming either the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) can also slow down a tax refund. That's because, by law, the IRS can't issue refunds for returns that have claimed those tax credits before mid-February.",
      "\"The IRS expects most EITC/ACTC-related refunds to be available in taxpayer bank accounts or on debit cards by March 3 if they chose direct deposit and there are no other issues with their tax return,\" the agency said on Monday.",
      "Some issues can also trip up tax refunds, such as if there are math errors on your return, missing or incorrect Social Security numbers or misspelled names, according to the IRS. While these might be innocent mistakes, it can cause the IRS to flag your return and delay your refund.",
      "What's my new 2025 tax bracket?",
      "The IRS has set new tax brackets for 2025, but that won't impact the return you'll file by April 15, since that 1040 reflects your 2024 income and taxes.",
      "Each year, the IRS adjusts its tax brackets and dozens of other provisions to account for inflation. The idea is to shield taxpayers from \"bracket creep\" \u2014 when workers are pushed into higher tax bands due to the impact of cost-of-living adjustments aimed at offsetting inflation \u2014 without a change in their standard of living.",
      "This year's tax brackets are adjusted 2.8% higher from 2024, representing the smallest jump in several years. Because inflation jumped during the pandemic, the bracket adjustments reached 7% in 2023\u00a0and\u00a05.4% in 2024.",

The Federal Reserve's favored inflation gauge \u2014 called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE \u2014 rose at a 2.3% annual pace last quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and above the Fed's 2% target. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.5%, up from 2.2% in the July-September quarter.",
      "A drop in business inventories shaved 0.93 percentage points off fourth-quarter growth.",
      "But a category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength rose at a healthy 3.2% annual rate from July through September, slipping from 3.4% in the third quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.",

      "President Donald Trump has inherited a healthy economy. Growth has been steady and unemployment low \u2014 4.1% in December.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged after making three cuts since September. With the economy rolling along, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, \"we do not need to be in a hurry'' to make more cuts. The Fed is also cautious because progress against inflation has stalled in recent months after falling from four-decade highs hit in mid-2022.",
      "The European Central Bank cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point Thursday, underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the end of last year.",
      "The U.S. economic outlook has become more cloudy, however. Trump has promised to cut taxes and ease regulations on business, which could speed GDP growth. But his plan to impose big taxes on imports and to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally could mean slower growth and higher prices.",
      "Trump said last week that he would lower oil prices and then \"demand'' lower interest rates \u2013 a topic he said he'd take up with Powell. But the Fed chair deflected questions about Trump's comments Wednesday and said he'd had no contact with the president.",

Another 46% were eligible to telework, and they spent an average of 61% of working hours in office. Only 10% of federal workers were in fully remote positions.",

The decision comes after the central bank trimmed rates three times starting in September 2024, which has pushed down the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one percentage point.",
      "The pause, the Fed's first rate decision since President Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, comes as economists predict the central bank is likely to take a wait-and-see approach to the president's economic policies, given that some, such as higher tariffs, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Fed's decision to keep rates steady reflects stubborn U.S. inflation, which remains close to 3% on an annual basis. That has fueled concerns that additional rate cuts could reignite price increases, making it more difficult to get to the Fed's 2% target. Notably, the Fed removed a line from its December statement expressing its belief that inflation \"has made progress\" toward its goal. Yet Powell struck a more dovish tone in a press conference to discuss the Fed's decision.",

      "Secondly, he added, \"Tariffs or mass deportations are expected to be inflationary. For that reason, the Fed is also right to be careful about lowering rates.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the rate pause by the fed.",
      "When did the Fed make its rate decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve announced its rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Jan. 29. It will be followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. EST.",
      "How will a pause on rate cuts impact my money?",
      "The Fed cut its benchmark rate three times last year, kicking off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September. That was followed by two consecutive\u00a00.25 percentage point cuts: one at its November meeting and a second at its December meeting.",
      "The pause in early 2025 means that consumers can't expect additional near-term relief on borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"Anyone hoping for the Fed to ride in as the cavalry and rescue you from high interest rates anytime soon is going to be really disappointed,\" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, in an email. \"That's true whether you're talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards or most anything else.\"",
      "Because credit card rates and other borrowing costs aren't likely to change, consumers should work on getting their higher-interest debt under control, Schulz added. Turning to a 0% balance transfer credit card or consolidating credit card debt with a personal loan can prove helpful with lowering interest payments, he noted.",
      "If there's a bright side, it's for savers, given that they should still be able to find solid rates on high-yield savings accounts, even though they've declined since the Fed began trimming its benchmark rate last year, Schulz said. Some savings accounts are still paying above 4%, down from about 5% a year ago.",
      "\"Returns on high-yield savings accounts have fallen from their record levels as the Fed has moved to lower rates. However, as the Fed pauses, that decline should slow as well,\" he said.",
      "When will mortgage rates come down?",
      "One of the disappointments for house hunters, as well as homeowners who want to refinance into lower rates, has been stubbornly high mortgage rates. Despite the Fed's three rate cuts last year, the average 30-year home loan remains near 7%, near 25-year highs.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't declined despite the Fed's cuts because home loans are based on a number of factors besides the federal funds rate, including broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "Given concerns from economists that President Trump's plans could prove inflationary, mortgage rates might not come down anytime soon, experts said.",
      "\"The general consensus is that rates will likely remain unchanged until the market has more clarity around potential policy impacts as it relates to immigration, taxes and tariffs,\" noted Austin Walker, CEO of A. Walker & Co., a housing finance company.",
      "Will interest rates go down under President Trump?",
      "Last week at the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would \"demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.\"",
      "It's unlikely that Mr. Trump could influence the Fed to lower rates, as the central bank is an independent institution that bases its decisions on economic data, rather than orders from elected officials, experts say.",
      "Rates are set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consists of 12 members \u2014 seven members come from the Fed's Board of Governors; four stem from the eleven Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis, and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Powell, meanwhile, has said he won't step down if Mr. Trump, who has previously criticized Powell's performance, asks him to resign, adding that the president doesn't have the power to fire or demote the Fed chair. His term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "At the same time, economists are forecasting more rate cuts in 2025, but not until May or even later, according to FactSet polling. But one wild card is whether inflation could tick higher in early 2025 due to the Trump administration's policies.",
      "\"Importantly, the outlook is clouded by heightened policy uncertainty as a new administration takes office,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in an email. Daco added he is forecasting three 0.25 percentage point cuts this year \u2014 in March, June and September. \"This year, we expect the Fed will tread carefully.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 14:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump executive order that reclassifies career civil servants risks politicizing thousands of government jobs, critics say.",
    "story": [
      "From meat inspectors to border patrol officers, many Americans who work for the federal government could soon see their jobs reclassified into at-will positions, meaning they can be dismissed for nearly any reason.",
      "In a related development, the White House expects up to 10% of federal employees to quit in September in a program meant to\u00a0end work-from-home practices, senior administration officials told CBS News.",
      "Depending on future court rulings and how effective the Trump administration proves to be in overriding existing federal regulations, an executive order signed by President Trump revives a policy from his first administration known as Schedule F. The Jan. 20\u00a0directive\u00a0creates a new employment classification for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of job protections.",
      "Likely to impact tens of thousands of civil servants, and potentially more, the order defines policymaking positions to include mundane tasks such as viewing and circulating proposed government regulations.",
      "\"We think this order affects at least 50,000 people who are currently protected, but the number could be much bigger,\" Nick Bednar, a University of Minnesota Law School associate professor, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Some scholars think it could reach into the hundreds of thousands. At the end of the first term, when the Trump administration sought to reclassify positions, it included executive assistants, toxicologists and scientists \u2014 it's not clear who this doesn't reach.\"",
      "\"Individuals in these policymaking positions don't have the same due process protections as other employees. They can be more easily removed,\" Bednar added. \"There are 2.8 million civilian employees in the federal government. Most, or the vast majority, enjoy some kind of protection from removal.\"",
      "For now, it remains unclear how far the Trump administration plans to go in implementing the order, said Steve Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE-IAM), a union representing 100,000 government workers.",
      "\"Technically, if you're a maintenance person pushing a broom on the floor, you are executing a policy,\" said Lenkart in offering an example of how virtually any government worker could be defined as being engaged in work that falls under Schedule F.",
      "\"President Trump has the executive power to make decisions to implement a government that reflects the will of the American people,\" Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"If an individual in the administration is working on policy, then they should align with President Trump's mission of putting America first.\"",
      "Hit to morale?",
      "President Trump is not unique in looking to have a stronger hand over the federal workforce, according to Bednar.",
      "\"A common strategy of presidents is trying to politicize federal employment positions so they have greater control over executive branch hiring and firing,\" said Bednar, who lists Dwight Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter among previous presidents who have sought to exert such influence. Still, he noted \"we haven't seen something that tries to reach this deep into the career staff.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump's Schedule F plan and other administration orders aimed a reshaping the federal workplace are being challenged in court, the Trump administration may succeed in its goal of downsizing government, regardless of whether it wins on the legal front, Bednar said.",
      "\"Even if the lawsuits slow down this process, there are many civil servants who might leave government fearing continuing to work in the Trump administration \u2014 employee moral is really affected,\" he said. \"They want a smaller government, and they view this as an opportunity to pursue that.\"",
      "Bednar also cautions that a smaller government workforce could hinder some Trump administration policy goals, including fewer agents to patrol U.S. borders and reduced staffing in immigration courts, adding to the current backlog.",
      "The case for and against Schedule F",
      "Mr. Trump originally implemented the Schedule F policy in 2020 as his first term was nearing an end, but it was repealed after former President Joe Biden took office. Mr. Trump said last week that the revived order is necessary to ensure that federal workers in roles that affect government policy remain accountable to the public.",
      "\"In recent years ... there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership,\" Mr. Trump's order states. \"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character.\"",
      "But critics of Schedule F argue it undermines the traditional principles behind civil service, which emphasize hiring based on professional qualifications. Should Schedule F survive legal challenges, they say, millions of government workers hired based on merit could be fired at will, including if they are deemed insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Is this really about making government more efficient and smaller, or targeting regulatory and law enforcement people?\" asked Lenkart, who noted that the number of workers employed in the executive branch has remained roughly the same for more than 70 years even as the nation's population has doubled.",
      "Unions representing public workers have blasted Schedule F. The policy is among a slew of executive orders \"designed to intimidate and attack nonpartisan civil servants under the guise of increasing efficiency,\" Randy Erwin, national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0last week. \"However, these orders will do the exact opposite.\"",
      "Members of the 100-year-old NFFE are employed\u00a0by\u00a0dozens of federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration and Social Security Administration.",
      "On Wednesday, the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) filed suit against the Trump administration, saying it was exceeding its authority in rolling back protections for workers.",
      "\"We can stop the efforts to fire hundreds of thousands of experienced, hard-working Americans who have dedicated their careers to serving their country and prevent these career civil servants from being replaced with unqualified political flunkies loyal to the president, but not the law or Constitution,\" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union also filed a suit to block Schedule F, calling it \"contrary to congressional intent.\" The\u00a0complaint, filed Jan. 20 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, argues that Mr. Trump's order reinstating Schedule F \"wrongly applies employment rules for political appointees to career staff, deprives federal employees of due process rights that they were promised when they were hired, and ignores Office of Personnel Management regulations.\"",
      "NTEU represents about 150,000 workers in 37 federal agencies and departments, including staff at the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Health and Human Services.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 14:36:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Many are unclear on how sweeping the federal funding freeze is intended to be. Here are programs it could affect.",
    "story": [
      "Update: The White House Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday, Jan. 29, rescinded a memo ordering a federal funding freeze less than two days after it caused chaos and stoked fear that the directive could adversely affect millions of Americans.",
      "A White House memo ordering a broad freeze on federal grants and loans by 5 p.m. Tuesday left ordinary Americans who depend on such aid, as well as seasoned budget experts, scratching their heads.",
      "The memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) suspending the federal funding was vague in its wording, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. Adding to the whiplash, a federal judge on Tuesday\u00a0temporarily blocked the freeze, and the Trump administration walked back the memo on Wednesday.",
      "\"In light of the injunction, OMB has rescinded the memo to end any confusion on federal policy created by the court ruling and the dishonest media coverage,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday. \"The executive orders issued by the president on funding reviews remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by all agencies and departments. This action should effectively end the court case and allow the government to focus on enforcing the president's orders on controlling federal spending.\"",
      "Trump administration rescinds federal funding freeze memo after chaos",
      "Trump administration rescinds federal funding freeze memo after chaos",
      "Before OMB abruptly reversed course, experts had questioned the policy, saying it was poorly thought out and implemented.",
      "\"If this was being undertaken pursuant to the executive orders on [diversity, equity and inclusion], why would the administration issue such broad, unclear and confusing directions?\" Tad DeHaven, a policy analyst focusing on economic and fiscal policy issues at the libertarian Cato Institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I don't really understand it, and I think even people who are in positions of power don't really understand it,\" added Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at Brookings, a liberal-leaning public policy research group.",
      "What programs aren't affected by the funding freeze?",
      "The memo, from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicated that Social Security and Medicare programs would be exempt from the suspension in federal funding. Additional guidance released Tuesday further specified that \"any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the updated guidance said.",
      "The memo adds that funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance and other similar programs are also exempt.",
      "But even if the order ends up being more narrowly tailored, it could still have serious financial implications for the millions of Americans who receive federal assistance, experts said.",
      "\"If it's resolved quickly, the aggregate economic effects for the first quarter will be modest, but it will matter a whole lot to people on the other side of these expected payments,\" Edelberg said. \"It could be the difference between having a job and not, getting evicted or affording food \u2014 and the economic numbers won't fully reflect how individuals are going to feel this.\"",
      "Here's what to know about who may be affected by the proposed pause in federal funding.",
      "Will I still get SNAP benefits?",
      "The freeze does not apply to all federal financial assistance, according to an Office of Management and Budget memo on Tuesday. The agency indicates that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, better known as food stamps, are excluded, specifying that \"... any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the memo reads.",
      "SNAP serves roughly 41 million low-income Americans.",
      "Yet while the program appears to be exempt from the freeze, \"You are still going to be really worried in the near term whether the federal government is going to make good on those promises,\" Edelberg said. \"And that kind of uncertainty is not good for the economy.\"",
      "Are meals for seniors affected?",
      "The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program, a federal initiative that supports community-based senior nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels, could be affected by the proposed funding pause.",
      "If the order includes the Older Americans Act, it \"would halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" Meals on Wheels said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lack of clarity is creating chaos for Meals on Wheels providers not knowing whether they should be serving meals today.\"",
      "Is housing assistance at risk?",
      "The OMB memo added that rental assistance and other similar programs will not be paused. Still, the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) expressed concern that Department of Housing and Urban Development programs could be covered by the freeze.",
      "\"Even a short pause in funding could cause significant harm to low-income families and their communities,\" NLIHC Interim President and CEO Renee Willis said in a\u00a0statement. \"The longer the freeze continues, the greater the risk that low-income households receiving federal rental assistance could face eviction, and in the worst cases, homelessness \u2014 homeless shelters may be forced to close their doors, and nonprofit organizations may have to lay off staff.\"",
      "Are student loans affected?",
      "The federal funding freeze does not apply to student loans and Pell grants, according to the Department of Education. The funding pause \"only applies to discretionary grants at the Department of Education,\" DOE spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, an advocate for students with government loans said they are worried about the impact of the freeze.",
      "\"Any kind of freeze to federal financial aid across the board is incredibly harmful to working families just trying to pay for college,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that \"Lots of questions remain about what the freeze applies to and what programs it does not,\"",
      "Meanwhile, many student borrowers rely on different kinds of government assistance to cover costs beyond tuition, Ba\u00f1ez noted.",
      "\"There are other types of federal work-study grants that go directly to colleges and universities, and supplemental education opportunities that go to some of the lowest-income students. People really rely on federal financial aid, and you could see families having to drop out of college or figure out how they will cover this gap,\" she said.",
      "The OMB memo also indicated that Head Start, a preschool program serving nearly 800,000 low-income children that receives federal health funds, is not impacted by the pause.",
      "But the National Head Start Association (NHSA) said that the OMB memo has already \"created panic among Head Start grant recipients who are currently not able to draw down any funds.\"",
      "\"While we understand that this is an evolving story, this disruption, at best, will slow down Head Start agencies' ability to pay hundreds of thousands of staff, contractors, and small businesses who support Head Start operations in every corner of the country,\" NHSA Executive Director Yasmina Vinci said in a statement. \"At worst, this means that hundreds of thousands of families will not be able to depend on the critical services and likely will not be able to work.\"",
      "Medicaid systems go down",
      "Despite the updated guidance issued Tuesday stating that programs including Medicaid were excluded from the funding pause, state Medicaid programs on Tuesday\u00a0said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "The White House late Tuesday pointed to an \"outage\" for blocking a range of organizations and agencies from accessing the online systems responsible for tapping federal health dollars.",
      "The Payment Management Services web portal displayed a message reading: \"Due to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "The National Association of Medicaid Directors is seeking clarification on the interruption from the White House, according to a spokesperson.",
      "By Wednesday, multiple state Medicaid programs had reported that they were able to resume accessing their payment systems after the nationwide lockout.",

Most recently, he underlined at a New York Times event in December that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials.

Its dual mandate was also established by Congress, as well as its structure of staggered appointments for Fed officials, designed to make the agency less vulnerable to pressures \"that could lead to undesirable outcomes,\" according to the Fed.",
      "What happens when a central bank isn't independent?",
      "Those \"undesirable outcomes\" can be seen in nations where central bankers are more vulnerable to political influence, economists say.",
      "That's because interest rates remain the most potent weapon that a central bank can wield against surging inflation \u2014 a tool that the Federal Reserve turned to in 2022 to tame the hottest U.S. inflation in 40 years. But elected officials sometimes decide that higher borrowing costs are politically inconvenient, because they make it more expensive for businesses to expand or for consumers to make purchases.",
      "In cases where a central bank isn't independent, officials may succeed in pressuring a central bank to keep a lid on rates.",
      "Experts point to Turkey as an example of what can occur when political interests dictate a central bank's monetary policies. Since 2010, its central bank has increasingly come under pressure from President Erdo\u011fan to keep its interest rates low, even as inflation surged during the pandemic, according to the non-partisan Centre for Economic Policy Research.",
      "Instead of hiking rates as Turkey's inflation rate topped 80% in October 2022 on an annual basis, the nation's central bank cut its benchmark rate several times in 2022 and 2023. While the bank reversed course and hiked rates starting in mid-2023, inflation there has proved tough to tame, with prices rising by 44% in December 2024.",
      "By comparison, the highest U.S. inflation rate during the post-pandemic period was in June 2022, when inflation hit 9.1% on an annual basis in June 2022. In the face of the Fed's rate hikes, inflation has cooled since then, deflating to 2.9% on an annual basis last month.",
      "\"The Fed has done really well \u2014 they have raised the rates enough to try to slowly squeeze inflation out of the market,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University. The Fed has \"done all that while avoiding a recession \u2014 that is a delicate needle to thread.\"",
      "Could Mr. Trump influence the Fed?",
      "Questions about Mr. Trump's ability to influence the Federal Reserve or shake up its leadership are intensifying amid the president's statements about his desire for lower interest rates. During his 2024 election campaign, Mr. Trump had insisted that as president he should have a \"say\" in the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in August.",
      "For his part, Powell said last year that he would not resign\u00a0even if asked to do so by Mr. Trump, adding that under the law presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "However, Mr. Trump has recently fired several government officials in ways that critics say violate the law, such as his administration's firing of more than a dozen federal inspectors general on Friday. Federal law requires the White House to give Congress a full month of warning and case-specific details before firing a federal inspector general.",
      "Removing Powell wouldn't necessarily change the Fed's monetary policy decisions, given that rates are set by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Seven members are from the Fed's Board of Governors; four are assigned from the 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis; and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Interfering with the Fed could have consequences, both legally and for the stock market, experts said.",
      "\"Should any president attempt to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve without cause other than doing the job they were appointed and confirmed to do, I expect there to be swift legal challenges,\" noted Tim Stretton at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog. \"I suspect the market would also react negatively. Markets like stability, and this level of unprecedented interference in the Federal Reserve would be anything but stable.\"",
      "Asked what advice he would give Mr. Trump about dealing with the Fed, Columbia Business School's House said, \"Stop talking.\"",
      "He added, \"Let the Fed conduct its business consistent with its mandate, and it'll be more likely to get interest rates down.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced he is pausing U.S. tariffs targeting imports from Mexico for a month after the country's president agreed to send 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to combat the flow of fentanyl and migrants.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social\u00a0on Monday that he and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \"agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period.\" The pause, he said, will allow \"negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and high-level Representatives of Mexico.\"",
      "The president wrote that he had a \"very friendly conversation\" with Sheinbaum in which she \"agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States.\"",
      "\"These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Sheinbaum unveiled the details of the deal in an earlier post on X, saying that the U.S. is \"committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico\" and that \"our teams will begin working today on two fronts: security and trade.\" She wrote in Spanish that Mexico \"will immediately reinforce the northern border with 10,000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, particularly fentanyl.\"",
      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump signed orders\u00a0imposing a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada on Saturday, in conjunction with a smaller levy on goods from China. The new tariffs are set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday. U.S. markets tumbled in early trading Monday morning amid fears that the tariffs could drive up prices for consumer goods. Mexico and Canada both said they would issue retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, raising fears of a trade war that could stifle economic activity between the U.S. and its neighbors.",
      "Before Mr. Trump announced the pause on Monday, Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, told CNBC that there were \"positive conversations that have happened over the weekend, and there are positive conversations that are going to happen between the leaders of these countries, you know, over the next hours.\"",
      "\"President Trump will then see what people have to offer and then make the call,\" Hassett said.",
      "Mr. Trump posted earlier Monday that he spoke to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a phone call Monday morning and would do so again in the afternoon.",

    "summary": "Some Republicans have pointed out at least two reasons the offer for \"deferred resignations\" to government employees is unlawful.",
    "story": [
      "Republican officials have been quietly pointing out that the Trump administration's so-called buyout program is illegal, but they doubt that Congress will push back, sources told CBS News.",
      "Many federal workers saw an email first thing Monday morning when they arrived at their desks that offered more details of the deferred resignations program.",
      "Some lawmakers have noted the offer of pay through Sept. 30 violates the Anti-Deficiency Act, a law that prevents the government from promising or spending money in excess of what Congress has made available. Congress has funded the government only through mid-March, not through the end of the fiscal year at the end of September.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump administration's Office of Personnel Management stressed that no federal employees' pay will be guaranteed with the deadline looming.",
      "The new email, with \"Fork in the Road\" in the subject line, is the third sent by OPM on the resignation plan. It reads:",
      "Q: The current funding bill for the federal government expires on March 14. Will I still receive full pay and benefits if the money runs out?",
      "A: Any government shutdown could potentially affect an employee's pay regardless of whether he or she has accepted the deferred resignation offer. Moreover, if you accept the deferred resignation offer, you would still be entitled to backpay under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act.",
      "One Republican said in a text message, \"Anybody else would be walked out of an agency for going $1 beyond appropriated dollars. Back of the napkin math of offering to pay all federal employees for 6.5 months beyond current appropriations is about $50 billion \u2014 not everyone will take the offer, but it was offered to all of them, thus it incurs an obligation.\"",
      "Two lawmakers said the Trump administration's offer to pay any federal employees who accept the resignation proposal is not within OPM's power. They say the proposal, which gives workers until Thursday to accept the buyout terms paying them through September, incurs a cost on behalf of the government that has not been authorized by Congress.",

      "London \u2014\u00a0Canadian sports fans, angry at President Trump's unilateral imposition of 25% tariffs on virtually everything imported from Canada, reacted icily to the Star-Spangled Banner as it was sung at hockey and basketball games over the weekend. Many booed the U.S. national anthem in an uncharacteristic show of frustration after more than 150 years of peaceful, friendly relations along the vast border separating the neighbors.",
      "The reaction was representative of hurt feelings both north and south of the U.S. mainland's borders on Monday. Top officials in Canada and Mexico, which both faced 25% tariffs\u00a0with the stroke of Mr. Trump's pen on Saturday, were expected to hold conversations with the White House on the way forward in a new trade war that Mr. Trump had threatened for months. Both countries vowed to respond with their own trade measures.",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum announced in a brief statement Monday on social media that, after a phone call with Mr. Trump, the tariffs imposed on her country were \"on pause for one month from now.\" She said Mr. Trump had agreed to put the measures on hold after she committed to reinforcing Mexico's border with the U.S. \"with 10,000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States.\"",

      "Sheinbaum said Mr. Trump had \"committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.\"",
      "China was also hit by a new raft of tariffs and has warned that it, too, will respond in kind. America's major allies and trade partners in Europe, meanwhile, have been warned by Mr. Trump that the European Union is next on his list, while the United Kingdom appears to have a chance to negotiate a trade deal, but will find itself torn between its next-door neighbors and its storied \"special relationship\" with the U.S. if it hopes to dodge the same fate.",
      "Canada is the biggest export market for products coming from 36 U.S. states, according to the Reuters news agency, while Mexico is broadly considered the U.S.' largest trading partner overall.",

      "Canada:",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government had no choice but to strike back with 25% tariffs of its own on more than $150 billion worth of U.S.-made imports.",
      "\"First, I want to speak directly to Americans, our closest friends and neighbors,\" said Trudeau. \"This is a choice that, yes, will harm Canadians, but beyond that, it will have real consequences for you, the American people.\"",
      "\"Like the American tariffs, our response will also be far reaching and include everyday items such as American beer, wine and bourbon. Fruits and fruit juices including orange juice, along with vegetables, perfume, clothing and shoes. It will include major consumer products like household appliances, furniture and sports equipment, and materials like lumber and plastics, along with much, much more.\"",
      "\"Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada,\" Trudeau added to his own constituents in a post on social media. \"Check the labels. Let's do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.\"",
      "The first round of Canada's tariffs will kick in at the stroke of midnight on Monday evening \u2013 on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods. In 21 days, the remainder of the tariffs, covering an additional $125 billion worth of products, will kick in unless some new agreement is reached between the countries. The delay, said Trudeau, was aimed at giving Canadian companies time to seek supply chain options to soften the financial blow.",
      "Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Canada's Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman said many people in her country \"just don't understand where this is coming from... and probably, there's a little bit of hurt.\"",
      "Mexico:",
      "Canada's government is now looking south of the U.S. border, hoping to band together and increase trade ties with Mexico to help both nations absorb the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. The two countries have agreed \"to enhance the strong bilateral relations\" they share and officials have had extensive bilateral meetings with their counterparts.",
      "President Sheinbaum, who haD already mocked Mr.Trump's move to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, said on social media before the pause was announced that countermeasures against the U.S. tariffs would soon be implemented.",
      "\"I've instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we've been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,\" Sheinbaum said, without specifying which U.S. goods her government might target, or whether she would seek to match the 25% retaliatory tariffs set to be imposed by Canada.",
      "Mexican goods exported to the U.S. are wide-ranging, and include vehicles and other auto industry components, crude oil, natural gas, avocados, tomatoes, pork and cheese.",
      "China:",
      "For Beijing, it was deja-vu. During Mr. Trump's first term, he slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, then 10% on an additional $300 billion worth of imports, which meant virtually everything Chinese was tariffed.",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement over the weekend saying Beijing was \"strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes\" the new 10% tariffs, that the U.S.'s \"unilateral increase in tariffs seriously violates WTO rules,\" and that China \"will file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization and take corresponding countermeasures,\" which implies Beijing will impose 10% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S.-made goods.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",

      "The ministry said the U.S. should \"view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way,\" rather than \"threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was imposing the new 10% tariff on Chinese goods in part due to what he considers Beijing's failure to stem the flow of fentanyl and chemicals used to make the drug.",
      "The foreign ministry in Beijing said China was \"one of the world's toughest countries on counternarcotics, both in terms of policy and its implementation.\"",
      "The European Union:",
      "Mr. Trump said over the weekend that tariffs on the European Union were coming, but he did not say when or how steep they would be.",
      "\"It will definitely happen with the European Union. I can tell you that because they've really taken advantage of us,\" the U.S. president told reporters Sunday. \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them.\"",
      "European leaders were meeting Monday in Brussels, where they were discussing how to collectively address the threat.",

      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the leader of Europe's biggest economy, Germany, said the EU was strong enough to take the blow and respond to any U.S. tariffs, but added that \"the goal should be that things result in cooperation\" within Europe.",
      "For a quick fact check on Mr. Trump's criticism: He's not wrong about the lop-sided trade relationship between the U.S. and its close allies across the Atlantic. Through November 2024, the EU ran a trade deficit of $78 billion with the U.S., according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and reports indicate that's on track to be a new record.",
      "The question many economic analysts and politicians across the world will keep asking, however, is whether huge tariffs taxing that trade are likely to help balance the books.",
      "The United Kingdom:",
      "Speaking to reporters early on Monday, Mr. Trump said \"the U.K. is out of line but\u2026 I think that one can be worked out,\" suggesting his administration was at least willing to negotiate with London over a new bilateral trade deal.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and stressed that he wants \"a strong trading relationship\" with the U.S., but the U.K. leader, five years after the \"Brexit\" withdrawal from the European Union, may now find himself caught between the formidable trade forces of the EU on his doorstep and Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs on the EU and his looming, if tempered threat to hit Britain with the same will complicate Starmer's nascent efforts to \"reset\" U.K. trade ties with the EU. He's at the helm of the U.K.'s first Labour Party government in a decade and a half, and it was the former Conservative leadership that ushered in Brexit and soured the long-standing close ties with Europe.",
      "Starmer has moved cautiously as he sets out to mend fences with the EU, wary of riling up conservative voters who supported Brexit and who, to some degree, now support populist politicians such as the Trump-aligned, anti-immigration leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister has ruled out rejoining the EU customs union or its single currency market, and he's so far resisted pressure from the continent to ease post-Brexit restrictions on U.K. and EU citizens living and working on either side of the border, at least for young people.",
      "But he still needs to get U.K.-EU trade moving again, and the extent to which he chooses to keep the bloc next door at arm's length, or to try to reinstate the close trade ties of before Brexit, could directly impact his chances of nailing down a favorable new trade agreement with Washington.",
      "Speaking Monday, a spokesperson for Starmer's government called the U.K.'s trade relationship with the U.S. \"fair and balanced,\" calling Washington \"an indispensable ally and one of our closest trading partners.\"",

      "The Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, run by President Donald Trump's billionaire adviser and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, has gained access to sensitive Treasury data including Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems, according to two people familiar with the situation.",
      "The move by DOGE, a Trump administration task force assigned to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations, means it could have wide leeway to access important taxpayer data, among other things.",
      "The New York Times first reported the news of the group's access of the massive federal payment system. The two people who spoke to The Associated Press spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Ron Wyden of Oregon, on Friday sent a letter to Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressing concern that \"officials associated with Musk may have intended to access these payment systems to illegally withhold payments to any number of programs.\"",
      "\"To put it bluntly, these payment systems simply cannot fail, and any politically motivated meddling in them risks severe damage to our country and the economy,\" Wyden said.",
      "Top Treasury official resigns",
      "The news also comes after Treasury's acting Deputy Secretary David Lebryk resigned from his position at Treasury after more than 30 years of service. The Washington Post on Friday reported that Lebryk resigned his position after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data.",
      "\"The Fiscal Service performs some of the most vital functions in government,\" Lebryk said in a letter to Treasury employees sent out Friday. \"Our work may be unknown to most of the public, but that doesn't mean it isn't exceptionally important. I am grateful for having been able to work alongside some of the nation's best and most talented operations staff.\"",

They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 22:54:35 -0500",
    "summary": "USAID Director for Security John Vorhees and Deputy Director for Security Brian McGill were put on leave last night, two sources confirmed to CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Two top security officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development have been placed on administrative leave, the latest in a series of suspensions and layoffs at the American government's primary humanitarian aid agency.",
      "President Trump is considering dramatic changes to USAID, as advisers examine where there's overlap with other agencies or where its spending runs counter to the president's stances.",
      "USAID Director for Security John Vorhees and Deputy Director for Security Brian McGill were put on leave Saturday night, two sources confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Two sources told the Associated Press that move came after the two officials refused to allow personnel from the Elon Musk-run Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to access classified material in restricted areas. DOGE spokesperson Katie Miller did not respond to requests for comment, but did repost the AP article on X with the comment, \"No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance is in charge of figuring out next steps for USAID reform, per one person familiar with Trump's decision. A spokesperson for Vance declined to comment.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday night upon returning to Washington, D.C., from Palm Beach, Florida, that USAID has been run by \"a bunch of radical lunatics.\"",
      "\"We're getting them out,\" he said, \"and then we'll make a decision.\"",
      "No executive order was imminent \u2014 officials are still in the planning phase, sources said last week. But the president is interested in reforming the agency, they said.",
      "One option is to possibly fold it into the State Department, but other possibilities are on the table, two sources told CBS News.",
      "Republican Rep. Brian Mast, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which provides oversight of the State Department, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that USAID is \"likely going to be rolled more closely under Secretary Rubio.\" USAID already reports to the Secretary of State but the Trump administration is looking at ways to combine it or fold it into the State Department.",
      "Mast did not detail what specific changes will be made but indicated that he intends to initiate changes via Congress as well. USAID was established in 1961 by an act of Congress.",
      "\"I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department, and having it fall under whether the other parts of the United States, Department of State, because of its failure,\" Mast claimed on \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "CBS previously reported that the person heading up the efforts to reshape USAID is Pete Marocco, a former deputy assistant secretary of African Affairs at the Pentagon. Marocco is now serving in a senior directing role in the State Department's Foreign Assistance Office, which oversees foreign assistance programs administered by the State Department and USAID.",
      "Freezing foreign aid was a Trump campaign promise to only support efforts that serve America's national security interest and to cut costs. However, foreign aid makes up just 1% of the federal budget.",
      "U.S. foreign aid agencies almost never directly implement aid programs, choosing to partner with non-governmental organizations, public international organizations, and sometimes foreign governments to carry them out. The Trump administration's 90-day freeze on almost all foreign aid means that these contractors are not being paid for work already in progress.",
      "With no indication that the aid freeze will be lifted soon, contractors are furloughing and/or terminating employees en masse.",
      "An aid worker with contracts around the world told CBS that organizations are expecting to face lawsuits in foreign countries from governments who consider them in breach.",
      "USAID viewed by some Trump officials as too influenced by \"woke\" politics",
      "Some top officials in the Trump administration view USAID, created by President John F. Kennedy to counter Cold War geopolitics, as an agency that has become overly influenced by left-wing and \"woke\" politics. They had privately voiced concerns that it hasn't had enough oversight, including from Congress.",
      "Some in the administration, including Musk, have argued that Trump should shut USAID down altogether. On Sunday, Musk posted on his social media platform X: \"USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die.\"",
      "But not all of Trump's top advisors agree with Musk, multiple sources said.",
      "USAID website goes dark, multiple aid agencies say they are hobbled by funding freeze",
      "The USAID website went offline on Saturday, and remained inaccessible on Sunday. Dozens of employees in the legislative and public affairs offices at the agency suddenly lost system and email access on Saturday night, three sources told CBS News.",
      "Trump officials want to look into ways to streamline programs with a footprint in more than one government agency. USAID also contracts with multiple non-profits to implement programs.",
      "As the Trump administration weighs restructuring USAID, the humanitarian aid program that does everything from funding polio and malaria eradication efforts overseas to emergency response to natural disasters, and removing old U.S. bombs from battlefields, aid organizations told CBS News that they are already preparing to lay off thousands of U.S. based aid workers this week.",
      "Multiple aid organizations told CBS News that they are hobbled by Trump's funding freeze as contractors front money for projects and then apply for reimbursement from the U.S. government. As a result, the stop work order issued by Secretary of State Marco Rubio triggered financial crises at these international organizations who are also unable to receive backpay for work already performed, multiple aid organizations told CBS news.",
      "Tom Hart, President and CEO of InterAction told CBS News that even after Rubio issued waivers to some organizations, the changes have not resulted in a flow of funds.",
      "\"The current reality is life-saving medications expiring on shelves while children fall ill. Food aid rotting in warehouses while families go hungry. This isn't just a humanitarian catastrophe\u2014it's an unconscionable waste of taxpayer resources that undermines America's investments in global stability and human dignity.\"",
      "\"This disruption is upending relationships built with communities over the last 60 years\u2014relationships the Administration may find hard to restore after its review,\" Hart said.",
      "The Trump administration has disrupted operations at organizations that also seem to be consistent with the America First agenda and efforts to stem illegal migration to the U.S. CBS News obtained a list of 13 organizations in El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala whose efforts are aimed at countering factors that drive migration. In El Salvador, the Skills for Employment project helps some 12,000 Salvadorans get jobs so they don't migrate to the U.S. In Honduras, Effective Justice combats organizedf crime networks. In Colombia, the Venezuelan response ensures migrants do not migrate illegally to the U.S.",
      "Concerns over PEPFAR",
      "Another program, PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, received a waiver to resume specific types of operations within their broad portfolio of AIDS relief and HIV services, three sources confirmed this weekend to CBS News. Health officials indicated\u00a0 that they are still waiting to see how narrowly the services will be defined including the question of whether it will include preventative treatments. Former aid officials shared concerns that global health programs are not yet turned back on, including those aimed at preventing malaria and tuberculosis.",
      "\"This is not a pause, it is a demolition,\" Atul Gawande, former USAID Global Health Director, told CBS News. \"You cannot pause a flight in midair, that's what they're trying to do.\"",
      "The Trump administration has stipulated the review is to last 90 days but the stop work order from Rubio immediately ceased operations for many organizations. Since the freeze is taking place while the review is being conducted, it has caused an immediate disruption with real world impact such as disruption of anti-viral medication to HIV positive individuals, including children.",
      "\"There was a release of that hold that was put, that was authorized, but it shouldn't be the case that the American people fund HIV and AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa, where many of these countries are working very directly with our adversaries, like China,\" Mast told \"Face the Nation,\" confirming portions of PEPFAR had resumed. But he referred to it as a \"grift\" and raised questions about its fate.",
      "\"That is an example of them taking us for granted,\" Mast said. \"We need to be asking the question, should they be weaning off of this, should we be paying for these very expensive HIV and AIDS drugs?\"",
      "But these efforts have been deemed in U.S. national security interests by multiple presidents, and a type of \"soft power\" that wins goodwill for the U.S. in the competition for influence against adversaries. It is now China, but during the Cold War when the established the prime competition was the Soviet Union, USAID efforts were effective in Eastern Europe and elsewhere.",
      "CBS News reported last week\u00a0that roughly 450 contractors were terminated from the Bureau for Global Health, which is responsible for overseeing the implementation of PEPFAR. More federal employees in the Global Health bureau have since been placed on administrative leave, raising concerns about how these programs will be implemented, despite the foreign assistance waiver for HIV/AIDS programs.",

      "FBI supervisors across the country have received questionnaires to distribute to certain agents in their field offices containing questions about the agents' possible work on Jan 6. Capitol riot cases, according to two sources familiar with the matter.",
      "A source familiar with the matter told CBS News the questionnaires are being sent to more than 1,000 FBI agents and non-agent support personnel in field offices across the country, as well as FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.",
      "The questions, obtained by CBS News, ask what role the respondent may have played in any cases, such as acting as an agent, providing management support or collecting online data. The survey also asks if the respondent made any arrests, conducted interviews, participated in search warrants, testified in court or appeared before a grand jury.",
      "The questionnaires are to be completed and submitted by supervisors by Tuesday afternoon.",
      "The questionnaire comes days after Washington, D.C.'s top prosecutor, Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Martin, was directed to fire prosecutors who were assigned to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to a memo obtained by CBS News. A separate memo from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered that all FBI agents who were assigned to the Jan. 6 insurrection cases undergo review.",
      "Bove on Friday ordered the acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned \"at any time\" to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack investigation for review \"to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary,\" according to a memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "In a note to members regarding the questionnaire, the FBI Agents Association said,\u00a0\"We understand that this feels like agents and employees are being targeted, despite repeated assurances that 'all FBI employees will be protected against political retribution,'\" although it was not immediately clear who had provided such assurances. \"Employees carrying out their duties to investigate allegations of criminal activity with integrity and within the rule of law should never be treated as those who have engaged in actual misconduct,\" the note added.",
      "In a letter addressed to Bove, who previously served as a private defense attorney for Mr. Trump, attorneys representing some of the FBI employees have threatened legal action against the Justice Department over any forthcoming employment actions against FBI workers who followed \"procedures, norms and law\" in their investigations.",
      "The attorneys wrote that the termination of FBI employees over their involvement in investigating Jan. 6 rioters and President Trump's classified documents case, \"appear to be in violation of the due process rights of those to be unlawfully discharged.\"",
      "\"Moreover, if information about these individuals is made publicly available, it also threatens the safety of dedicated career public servants and potentially of their innocent family members. The continuation of this course of action is a direct assault on the national security of American citizens you have sworn to faithfully and unselfishly serve,\" the letter read.",
      "James Dennehy, assistant director in charge of the New York FBI office, said in a memo to 1,200 agents and support personnel on Friday, \"Today we find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own as good people are being walked out of the FBI and others are being targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI policy.\"",
      "He noted that some may be contemplating resigning as part of the \"deferred resignation\" offers from the Trump administration.",
      "\"As part of what is being offered to you right now, my only ask of you is that you do the homework, gather all the information, and talk it through with your loved ones before you make an informed decision.\"",
      "He called Driscoll and acting FBI Deputy Director Robert Kissane \"total warriors\" and concluded the memo saying, \"I mourn the forced retirements of the [executive assistant directors] and fired field office heads, all of whom are extraordinary individuals who have dedicated decades of their lives to this joint just to be robbed of their title and profession but not their dignity.\"",

      "Rubio, the first Latino secretary of state, made the trip in part to reiterate President Trump's concern that China has too much influence over the Panama Canal, and needs control of the waterway for economic security, though Mulino has refuted the claim. Rubio toured the canal on Sunday and doubled down on the administration's plan to make immediate changes, according to his office spokesperson, Tammy Bruce.",
      "\"Secretary Rubio also emphasized the importance of collaborative efforts to end the hemisphere's illegal migration crisis and thanked President Mulino for his support of a joint repatriation program, which has reduced illegal migration through the Darien Gap,\" Bruce said in a statement.",
      "Speaking at the U.S. embassy, the secretary of state said that Panama is very important to the U.S. and thanked all the staff that serve the embassy.",
      "The Panama Canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. And although the U.S. led the construction of the major waterway that around 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic now moves through, its control was given to Panama in 1999.",
      "In the meeting, Rubio told the Panamanian leader that Mr. Trump has determined that China's influence on the Panama Canal is \"a threat to the canal and represents a violation of the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump on Saturday signed an executive order that imposes 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which come after months of threatening to do so as he seeks to leverage trade policy even against some of the U.S.' largest economic allies.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged Sunday that there may be \"some pain\" with the tariffs in a social media post. But he argued that \"it will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "The tariffs come in part to curb the flow of undocumented immigrants, as well as illicit drugs, into the U.S. And Rubio's first overseas visit to Central America and the Caribbean, of which Panama is the initial stop, also comes as the Trump administration seeks cooperation on its immigration policy from nearby countries, like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.",

      "ED O'KEEFE: Well, we should anticipate there could be a tit for tat here, because the orders that the president signed Saturday night give him the authority to keep raising tariffs on the three countries if they respond in kind. And that could contribute to an uptick in inflation, which we have seen in recent weeks.",

The question around cars, I have read already about $3,000 of additional price on cars, up to $10,000 on trucks, because we have actually integrated very well our auto production with Canada and Mexico.",
      "I think as well about the fact that for years we have been encouraging businesses to leave China and nearshore to a place like Mexico. Now that is going to end up costing consumers more.

      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Listen, Margaret, Edward Snowden released more information, probably did as much damage to our intelligence community as anyone in history.",
      "And the fact that Ms. Gabbard, who actually had legislation to pardon Edward Snowden \u2013 she called him a brave whistle-blower \u2013 couldn't bring herself to call him a traitor, I think, is disqualifying just on plain judgment.",

      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: I know there are a number \u2013 our committee is historically the most bipartisan. We check our partisan hats at the door.",
      "There is enormous MAGA pressure that \u2013 as we have seen, put on senators who are willing to stand up. We will know this coming week. But \u2013 and it's not just Snowden. It was America's most powerful intelligence tool is a law called \u2013 or something we call Section 702. She left us totally confused on her views on that.",

Seems like he's implementing that this week. So far, between the FBI and Justice Department, we have seen at least 20 terminations.",
      "Some are calling this a purge, but is it overstating it if we're seeing 20 people lose their jobs?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, if you are suddenly taking out the most experienced folks at Justice or at the FBI, how does that make us stronger?",
      "And what he's saying is, every FBI agent that somehow touched the January 6 investigation \u2013 that was a comprehensive investigation. I have been told there were \u2013 almost half of all the FBI agents at least had some involvement. Remember, this was a case that was taken up against these rioters all across the country.",
      "If you're suddenly going to get rid of all of those, that could be thousands.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: What does that mean for our cybersecurity? What does it mean for our trafficking and stop against fentanyl and other drugs? What does it mean in terms of serious crime investigations?",
      "This would be devastating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's \u2013 well, our reporting is that the order was for a list to be drawn up of those 1,500 or so people who worked on those cases. We're going to try to get to the bottom of whether they're actually going to be fired or not. That's not clear.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: But, Margaret \u2013 Margaret, it \u2013 we have seen \u2013 but we have seen, you get your name on these lists. It's like \u2013 it's like Trump's potentially illegal offer to buy out all the federal employees, where we have no money in the budget for.",
      "But we had a great tragedy this week in D.C. with the air \u2013 the crash.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: We are already short air traffic controllers. If suddenly 2,000 or 3,000 air traffic controllers were to say, hey, I'm going to take this buyout, our airspace couldn't operate.",
      "And yet he's doing this so recklessly and, frankly, again\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it being offered to them?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 without legal authority.",
      "Pardon me. Say again?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that open to \u2013 is it being offered to air traffic controllers?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: All federal employees. My understanding, went out to two million federal employees this offer, which, again, OPM does not have that authority to start with. That was who it came from.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: But it is \u2013 I can tell you, with lots of federal employees, we got chaos on steroids going on.",
      "And we had heard from Trump's supporters, the OMB director, for example, that he wanted to traumatize federal workers. Well, that is happening. And these workers are the folks that inspect our fruit, our milk, our eggs.",
      "What happens if they all quit?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you \u2013 and I know many of those people live in the state of Virginia. They are your constituents.",
      "I want to ask you about your former partner on the Intelligence Committee Marco Rubio, now secretary of state. He told a podcaster this week the president made the decision to cancel security protection for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who served during the first term, because he looked through a threat versus cost risk assessment.",
      "I know you're briefed on intelligence. Did the threat from Iran to assassinate former U.S. officials go away?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: No.",
      "I have seen no intelligence that would indicate that that threat has been diminished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Secretary Rubio endorsed this.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: I think this is payback. And it's not just Pompeo.",
      "Listen, I have not seen any intelligence. And, here, I agree with my partner Tom Cotton, the now-chair of the Intel Committee. We have seen nothing to indicate less threat, and also taking out, for example \u2013 down the security detail for former General Chief of Staff Mark Milley, this is all about retribution.",
      "And he's putting people's lives in danger, which is just unbelievable. And I wish more people would stand up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Florida Republican Congressman Brian Mast, who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has oversight over the State Department and its programs.",
      "He joins us from Fort Pierce, Florida.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST (R-Florida): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start first on the tariffs that were announced overnight by President Trump. You know there's a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. President Trump negotiated it during his first term.",
      "The tariffs may violate that deal. If he's invoking tariffs on a national security basis, can you explain the threat posed by Canada?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes, and he was \u2013 President Trump, that is to say, was very specific in his executive order, outlined that it's specifically related to fentanyl. It's specifically related to human trafficking.",
      "And there's a trust, but verify situation that has to go on here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Through Canada?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Through Canada as well, absolutely, fentanyl through Canada, human trafficking through Canada, also with China in that mix for fentanyl as well.",
      "That was specifically outlined in it. And until that comes to an end, this is what's going to be on the table. And bear in mind as well that USMCA reauthorization is coming up in the coming-up months and years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't believe that this violates the trade agreement, the treaty?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: The violation has been to the United States of America. It's been to our sovereignty. It's been to our people. We've been taken for granted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but Congress votes on these things. So\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: And I will make sure certainly, as the Foreign Affairs chairman, that we give every single authority as we go through State Department reauthorization, to make sure that this moves forward, as well as purging of people throughout the State Department, other agencies, where we're freezing aid.",
      "These are all very important and necessary steps to make sure that we secure America. And we're going to support that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry. Can I follow up on what you just said there?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Please do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to authorize purging of State Department personnel? What does that mean exactly?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, if you want to take a look at the State Department, where DEI has been a priority over, let's say, diplomacy on many accounts, I can give you hundreds of examples of where they were authorizing\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What proof do you have of that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Sure, let's list them off, half-a-million dollars to expand atheism in Nepal, $50,000 to do, let's see, a transgender opera in Colombia, $47,000 to do an LGBTQ trans comic book in Peru, $20,000 a pop to do drag shows in Ecuador.",
      "Shall I continue with more examples of where DEI was a priority?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, it certainly seems like there could be a review of things. Foreign aid, as you know, is less than 1 percent of the entire federal budget. So we're talking small amounts of money by comparison. But when\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: We're still talking about tens and tens of billions of dollars.",
      "And if you want to go to somebody else, on the other side of the aisle, Samantha Power, she had a worthy goal, although it was a stupid goal. She said she was hoping to get the amount of foreign aid, U.S. aid dollars that go to actual aid up to 30 cents on the dollar from 10 cents on the dollar. That's a major problem that we have this agency that that's all that goes abroad\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you're talking about\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: \u2026 when it should be the American worker's dollar.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think now you're talking about the USAID, the aid agency\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 which is a \u2013 separate from the State Department currently and has about $40 billion worth\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Which is likely going to be rolled more closely under Secretary Rubio.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell \u2013 yes, tell me about that, because that's where I was going.",
      "Has the Trump administration informed you of plans to dismantle or significantly shrink this agency?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: This is something that I'm working on very specifically, in conjunction with Secretary Rubio, to make sure that there's the appropriate command-and-control of these agencies, where, again, to make that same point, right now, maybe 10 to 30 cents\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They already report to the secretary of state.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But 10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid. So there's not the right amount of command-and- control that's going on with the way that it's set up currently.",
      "And let's make another point on this as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress \u2013 Congress authorizes and earmarks funding.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Most of these dollars \u2013 most of these dollars that go out of USAID, 70-plus percent don't come from U.S. growers, U.S. farmers, U.S. ranchers, or go through us ports. And that's another big problem for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 I'm sorry. If Congress already authorizes and earmarks the funding, just to be very clear, you're not endorsing getting rid of USAID as a separate department, which already reports to the secretary of state, are you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department and having it fall under one of the other parts of United States Department of State, because of its failure.",
      "I just went over the numbers twice with you in the amount of aid that actually makes it into the hands. I mean, you could you could almost say \u2013 this is a little bit hyperbole \u2013 but there's probably more dollars that go towards state dinners around the D.C. Beltway than what actually goes into rice and beans abroad.",
      "That's the state of what's going on with USAID. And Samantha Power said no less herself.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think every single administration authorizes reviews, could increase efficiencies. There are plenty of people who propose bringing it more under the authority of the State Department. Madeleine Albright tried to do that. That's not a new MAGA idea.",
      "I think the question here, though, is about how you do it. Do you still believe that in the law signed in the 1960s that Congress has to sign off on any changes to USAID? Or do you think President Trump can just make all of this happen through executive order?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: So, all of those examples that you just gave of those historical figures, the difference is now the job is going to get done.",
      "It's going to be 99.99 percent of cents on the dollar actually go towards what it's intended, instead of people around the Beltway.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so you're talking about \u2013 you're talking about\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: That's what's going to happen. That's the change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 efficiencies in aids versus restructuring.",
      "So let me ask you about that. Well, like I said\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, that requires restructuring, 100 percent. You can't create that efficiency just by wishing it into existence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: You have to restructure where the failures are and put the right things in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course.",
      "But what we're hearing from many of these aid organizations and officials is that, can you restructure after you finish the review and not freeze funding now, immediately? I spoke to former USAID global health head Atul Gawande yesterday. He told me this isn't a pause in foreign aid. It is a demolition of USAID.",
      "As he put it, you can't pause a flight in midair. That's what's happening.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This immediate freeze in funding is stopping agencies in the field from being able to do the work they do.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's say why that is so important. And let's talk about the real facts on the ground.",
      "The Trump administration comes in or representatives like myself that do oversight. The agencies will literally not tell us what they are writing grants for, literally, or they will lie about it, or they will tell the new political appointees under the Trump administration, I'm just not going to tell you that. Those are real things that have happened.",
      "So the way that you make them come and answer for where they are actually sending dollars is to say, we're freezing that. We're putting it on hold. You need to come to us and explain what it is you're doing, why you're doing it and where it's actually saving life. And guess what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: When they don't come explain something, that also begs the question, why were they doing it in the first place?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the way these things work is, the contractors have to front the cash, then go to the U.S. government for reimbursement.",
      "So when you put in an immediate freeze, that means drugs don't get delivered. That means they don't get distributed. That means bomb disposal units don't get to go out there in places like Cambodia and remove ordnance or provide help to people who receive it.",
      "That's the pushback from aid organizations, who are saying they're going to have to carry out layoffs in the thousands in the coming week. Does that concern you at all?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: They will have an opportunity. It doesn't concern me because of the grift that has been going on to the American taxpayer, the American worker.",
      "That's what needs to be answered for. And so you look at this. Let's use PEPFAR as an example. You were talking about drugs going to individuals. There was a release of that hold that was put \u2013 that was authorized. But it shouldn't be the case that the American people fund HIV and AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa, where many of these countries are working very directly with our adversaries like China.",
      "That is an example of them taking us for granted. We need to be asking the question, should they be weaning off of this? Should we be paying it for these very expensive HIV and AIDS drugs?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Should the American worker be footing the bill for that? Those are real questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, real questions, but, in the meantime, people need their drugs while you ask those questions. So that's where the disagreement is with the aid organizations.",
      "But let me ask you about air traffic controllers and what's happening here at home.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Not with all the leaders of other countries, though. I believe I saw the leader of Kenya as one step up and say, hey, this is an example where we need to step up for ourselves and show how we can take care of ourselves. And I believe that was the president there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, as I was saying, about another committee you sit on, Transportation Committee.",
      "The FAA hiring policy for air traffic controllers, including under the first Trump administration, offered equal opportunity to those with targeted disabilities, including, as the president read, hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, severe intellectual debility \u2013 disability. Excuse me.",
      "The president singled this out, this policy, as a contributor possibly to the crash. Do you agree with the diversity policy, or do you agree with the president? I know you lost two limbs serving this country in Afghanistan. Do you hear those words and take offense to them or\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: No, no offense. Let's unpack it.",
      "Number one, I will use myself as an example, right? There are things that I am suited to do, no doubt. But flying an aircraft, to stick with the subject at hand, would not be one of them. I could fly a personal \u2013 a personal aircraft.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is air traffic controllers.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But to put me in charge of traffic or 150 lives, that would not be the right case for me personally, given my physical disabilities and foot pedals on an aircraft.",
      "To go to the diversity side of it and the actual crash, yes, there were very real errors that took place both in the air traffic control tower and with the helicopter pilots, it seems. But, more systemically, is there a big hiring problem across all federal agencies, to include the FAA, where they made the priority diversity and inclusion\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: \u2026 instead of excellence and performance? Yes, that's the case. They made the priority appearance and lifestyle and not the big deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today.",
      "We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to independent Senator Bernie Sanders from Burlington, Vermont.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "Very quickly, do you have a sense of the impact of these tariffs on your state?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont): Well, it's going to be very severe.",
      "But this is not the only thing that worries me. Margaret, we are living in an unprecedented moment in American history. We're looking at a rapid growth of oligarchy. We're looking at a rapid growth of authoritarianism. And I fear that we're looking at a rapid growth of kleptocracy as well.",
      "And I'm going to do everything I can to work with my supporters all over this country to stand up and fight back to make sure we have an economy that works for everybody\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: \u2026 not just Elon Musk, and that we maintain American democracy. Difficult times.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator \u2013 Senator, I'm going to have to ask you more about what you mean by that on the other side of this commercial break, because I have to take it.",
      "Stay with us. We hope all of you will as well.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation with Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders.",
      "Senator, thank you for sticking with us through the break.",
      "I want to ask you about some of the rather fiery hearings you were a part of this past week, in particular with the potential Health and Human Services secretary to be, RFK Jr. You told CBS in December you think he's right about the food industry and obesity and what he says about high prices for prescription drugs. But during the hearing, you had some sharp exchanges. Are you, at this point, decided on your vote? Will you cross over and help Republicans confirm him?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Well, I have - Margaret, I have up to now voted for some Trump appointee. A few. I voted against most. And I'll make my decisions next week.",
      "Where Kennedy is right is, we are an unhealthy society. A point I've been making, many others have been making for a long time.",
      "One of the things that concerns me very much, and Kennedy mentioned it, is our life expectancy. How long our people live is five years less than other wealthy countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And if you're working class in this countries, you live six or seven years lower than if you are rich. It is an issue we have to deal with. And I think the kind of addictive and poisonous food that the food industry is providing our kids is one of the factors, not many.",
      "But when you have Kennedy come forward and saying he cannot, he believes, continues to believe, that autism is caused by vaccines, despite the fact that there have been a dozen studies over the years which disprove that, when he has other conspiracy theories, when he cannot acknowledge that if you're going to make America healthy, we've got to guarantee health care to all people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: He was not clear about the need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug costs. So, I was not particularly happy with his presentation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the autism point, there is no established cause of autism spectrum disorder, but one in 36 children have been identified with it, according to the CDC.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern in this space, including from your Republican colleague, Cassidy. He is a medical doctor. He said he's struggling with the nomination because he fears Kennedy may undermine faith in vaccines.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): I recognize, man, if you come out unequivocally, vaccines are safe, it does not cause autism, that would have an incredible impact. That's your power. So, what's it going to be? Will it be using the credibility to support lots of articles, or will it be using credibility to undermine?",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The senator seemed to be saying, if you want my vote, answer the question. You said you haven't decided on RFK and how you're going to vote. Is this a red line for you?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, look, I - I don't want - I - I - I - Margaret, what I'm saying is, I just don't go around making these announcements. I will vote when I'll vote. But anybody who watched that hearing understands my deep concerns about Kennedy.",
      "But I've got to tell you, the conspiracy theories that he is throwing out is not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration. And, to me, what is most important in terms of what's been happening since Trump has been president is not just him having the three wealthiest people in the country stand behind him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And, by the way, anybody, any working person in this country should understand what that means. It means that you're going to have a government working for the very rich, not for the working class of this country. But the movement toward authoritarianism -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But -",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, go ahead. I'm sorry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no, I want to ask you about that, but just to push you on this point, because it's not just a matter of a vote, like, what you are saying is that someone at the top of the - the health department who is rejecting science or rejecting data that says there's no linkage here, no proven linkage here, by not being clear and saying that's a red line, doesn't that lend itself to misinterpretation? Why wouldn't you say that's disqualifying for him?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Because I have not said - I have not said to anybody how I will vote. It doesn't matter. I will vote when I'll vote. But let me just tell you -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because Republicans were hoping you would help them.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: The idea that -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why I'm asking you.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I know, they hope for a lot of things. It just may not happen. But I think -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ah -",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: All right, go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead. I'm sorry.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Look, the bottom line is, we have a health care crisis in America. We're the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. We pay by far the highest prices in the world, for prescription drugs. Our life expectancy is shorter than other countries. Yes, we've got to deal with it in a very direct and forceful manner. You've got to take on the insurance companies. You've got to move to Medicare for all. You've got to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We have to understand why our life expectancy is lower.",
      "And, by the way, it's not just health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: It's the fact that so many of our working people are stressed out by inadequate incomes that that's having an impact on not only their life spans but their well-being. Those are issues we've got to address.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: During the campaign, then candidate Trump and Vance, they - they were very much championing working class people, as you have through the years. They said they support unions, they don't want to tax tips, they want child care tax credits, they're pro worker. Do you see any opportunities to work with them on specific policies and, if so, where?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, if they were telling the truth and they will go forward in trying to stand up for the working class, of course I will work with them. But I've got to tell you, just last week what Trump did is essentially neuter the National Labor Relations Board. This is something that Bezos wanted. It's something that Elon Musk wanted. What that means, if you are a worker right now, and there are millions of workers who want to join a union because they know unions will give you better wages and better working conditions, better benefits. What they have done is neutered that so right now union busting corporations, like Amazon and others, can do what they do against workers with impunity. That is not standing with workers. We need to raise the starvation minimum wage, which is now $7.25 an hour, to a living wage. I've not heard one word from the Trump administration about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they want to leave that up to states and corporations as well to - to make a decision, not -",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, but that's - that ain't going to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance told us last Sunday, despite those big tech CEOs giving money to the inauguration for Donald Trump, he still believing they have too much power in big tech and that he says, you know, they're still very much on notice in regard to his past warnings they could be broken up.",
      "Is that a place you are also concerned and could work with him on?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I think Lina Khan, the former head of the FTC, did a great job. And if Vance wants to work with us on that, he's right. You have right now not only more income and wealth inequality in this country than ever before, more concentration of ownership in the tech industry and in other industries. Do I think we should start breaking up some of these large corporations? Absolutely I do. And we'll be happy to work with them if they're serious about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Bernie Sanders, independent from Vermont, thank you for joining us.",
      "We'll be right back.",

      "And you cover justice and FBI. A lot happening in both of the departments. And I want to bottom line first with Frank, if I could, digging into your experience here. If you can help us understand the reporting from Andres Triay and Pat Milton that the executive assistant directors, those in national security, cyber, criminal division, are being forced to resign, retire or face termination. What does it mean to have those positions forced out?",
      "FRANK FIGLIUZZI (Retired FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence and Author of \"The FBI War: Inside the Bureau's Code of Excellence\"): Yes, when you combine that essential layer of leadership, executive assistant directors control multiple operational divisions. So, at least a half a dozen of those reportedly are gone. And then you get down to the level of at least two or three special agents in charge in the field, including Miami, Washington field office. You are starting to lose too much experience. And if this plays out next week as reportedly it might, with regard to dismissing hundreds or thousands of special agents in the field who have touched January 6th cases or Trump related cases, this makes America less safe. This is not reduction, this is not efficiency, it makes America less safe when you lose that much expertise this quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Just to follow up there, Scott Macfarlane, what Frank was referring to is a list that was requested. CBS' Rob Legare actually obtained the memo from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who was previously the personal attorney for Donald Trump.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He ordered the acting director of the FBI to compile everyone who was an employee who was assigned to the 1,500 January 6th cases. There were also eight executives pushed out.",
      "Is this a legal and lawful order? Are FBI officials going to actually fire the people on these lists?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: The list is required, and must be produced by 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time Tuesday according to our latest reporting. Whether it is produced is a different question. But the bottom line here is that such a list, Margaret, would include FBI employees from every FBI field office across the country. This is not just a Washington investigation. The January 6th cases went nationwide.",
      "What's more, a lot of the names that are going to be on this list, according to my reporting, are already public domain. They're in the court filings, they're in the court docket, they're already out there. So, it's going to be difficult to mask anybody's name or anybody's identity.",
      "Whether this is legally permissible is a different question. Whether these firings are legally permissible is a different question. We know the acting FBI director, in a memo sent to his employees, he emphasized that there are robust protections. His word is robust protections for FBI agents against employment actions.",
      "Feels to me like there's an galvanization of FBI employees, if they want to fight this, to try to make some effort to push back. Whether they do so is a different question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why was asking, is it actually going to be firings or is this actually just going to be, you can't do what - what the president's team is pressing to do.",
      "Brian Fitzpatrick, you know him from covering The Hill, he's a Republican from Pennsylvania, used to be an FBI agent, gave CBS a statement I want to read here. He says he wants to emphasize to the administration, \"line level street agents have little to no control over the office to which they're sent, the cases to which they're assigned, and leads which they are asked to cover. Much like the military, they go where they are told and perform the investigative duties that their chain of command orders them to do.\"",
      "Frank, I know you know this, but that is a Republican explaining the basic function of how law enforcement works. It sounds like there's going to be pushback on the potential of these firings.",
      "FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Yes, indeed. It's been reported by multiple media outlets that the acting director pushed back very hard and very loudly against the DOJ request. And reportedly he may have been threatened with termination himself. Interest only enough, both the acting director and acting assistant director would be on that list. They both worked January 6 related cases or Trump related cases. So, we've got a potential standoff that's here.",
      "But yes, line agents did nothing outside of the law or attorney general guidelines. They simply worked criminal cases, in many cases gained convictions and guilty pleas. And if they were literally all to be pushed out the door, we would be talking about thousands of FBI agents. There's only 14,000 agents in the field and we'd be talking close to 6,000 of them who worked such cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Scott, we were just talking about Kash Patel, the boss isn't in place yet. He was asked under oath before Congress if he knew of some of these actions that were underway literally as he was testifying. He said he didn't know anything about the firings. Is this going to - is it credible and is it going to be a problem for his confirmation?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: This might have been simultaneous, Margaret. These questions, including from Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey were happening as a lot of this communication was going back and forth over terminations, resignations, retirements.",
      "Kash Patel has been on a trajectory towards confirmation as the next FBI director almost from the jump. The one vote I've been watching closely, Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican, up for re-election in 2026, he introduced Kash Patel and validated him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: It seems nobody has jumped up this weekend to say, I'm now opposed.",

And actually his youngest daughter, Shir, got engaged a month before October 7th. And so the wedding planning began and then abruptly came to a stop as both of her parents, Keith and my aunt Aviva (Ph), who was released in the November 2023 deal, were taken hostage. So, what we've talked about is that, you know, someday we're all going to get together and throw an absolutely epic wedding. And that's what we're looking forward to now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you've been an advocate for the family here in Washington, both with the Biden and the Trump administrations. In your view, do you think this deal, this hostage release, would have happened without American pressure?",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: No, definitely not. And I do want to say, so the Biden team, Jake Sullivan, Brett McGurk, President Biden, Secretary Blinken, Bill Burns, they were so tireless in their commit to get this deal done. But the really amazing thing is that the minute that President Trump was elected, his team started working hand in glove with the Biden administration. We felt no break in the commitment to get Keith home. Steve Witkoff and Adam Boehler, along with President Trump, started working hand in hand with the Biden team.

We worked with Global Reach, Mickey Bergman, Stacia George and Eric Lebson, they're a non-profit. We would not have gotten Keith home without them.",
      "So, it was just a tremendous group effort across the board, across political lines, and that's heartening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You told us back in April on this program that you were worried, quote, \"it's not arguably in Prime Minister Netanyahu's political interest to close a deal\" And you were worried he was going to sink it.

      "HANNA SIEGEL: I think that the Trump team has done a really tremendous job of putting serious pressure on him and that that is making a difference. I think that he - you know, we're ecstatic that Keith is home, but it took almost 500 days. And that is in part because of Netanyahu.",
      "This deal was available for months. The Biden team was working on it. And - and he wouldn't come to the table often. I mean there are - this is such a complicated issue, but I am worried - I think this is a really fragile deal, as we all understand. And so, you know, I have a lot of faith in the Trump team and in all of the people working on this to put serious pressure on him to see it through.",
      "I think what we've seen is that diplomacy and political agreement is the only way to get all of the hostages home. And, you know, we're - we're one of the lucky ones, but there remain five American citizens and dozens of other hostages who still need to come home.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 18:14:50 -0500",
    "summary": "The Temporary Protected Status designation has been used by Republican and Democratic administrations to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is terminating an immigration program that currently protects hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants in the U.S. from deportation, paving the way for many of them to lose their legal status this spring, according to a government notice obtained by CBS News.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this weekend revoked one of two Temporary Protected Status designations for Venezuela, which the U.S. government had previously determined was too dangerous to allow Venezuelans to return to their homeland safely.",
      "Created in 1990, TPS has been used by Republican and Democratic administrations to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants from nations beset by war, environmental disasters or other emergencies that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The policy shields beneficiaries from deportation and makes them eligible for work permits but it does not give them permanent legal status.",
      "The Venezuela TPS program is by far the biggest of its kind, protecting more than 600,000 migrants from deportation, government statistics show.",
      "The move by the Trump administration will mean that an estimated 350,000 Venezuelans\u00a0covered under a 2023 TPS designation will lose their work permits and deportation protections two months after Noem's decision is officially published. Venezuelans enrolled in TPS under an earlier 2021 designation will continue to have that status through September, though those protections could also be phased out.",
      "Those whose TPS protections lapse and lack another immigration status will lose their ability to work in the U.S. legally and become vulnerable to being detained and deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has dramatically increased arrests across the country under President Trump. On Saturday, Mr. Trump said the Venezuelan government had agreed to accept migrant deportees from the U.S., after rejecting American deportation flights for years.",
      "The efforts to scale back TPS, first reported by The New York Times,\u00a0echo a broader crackdown by Mr. Trump on illegal immigration and humanitarian programs that allowed some migrants to come or stay in the U.S. legally. Administration officials have also drafted plans to revoke the legal status of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who arrived in the U.S. under a sponsorship process established by the Biden administration.",
      "Venezuelan migrants were first granted TPS in 2021 by the Biden administration, which cited the deteriorating economic and political conditions in Venezuela under the authoritarian rule of President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Nearly 8 million people have left Venezuela as part of the largest exodus recorded in the Western Hemisphere, according to the United Nations. While millions of Venezuelans have settled in other South American countries like Colombia, hundreds of thousands traveled to the U.S. southern border during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "While Noem acknowledged in her decision that some conditions in Venezuela cited by the Biden administration \"continue,\" she determined it was \"contrary to the national interest\" to continue the TPS program. She cited challenges some communities in the U.S. have faced in absorbing migrants in recent years and the arrival of members of the Venezuelan prison gang, Tren de Aragua.",
      "Noem also suggested policies like TPS encourage illegal immigration, saying extensions of the policy could amount to \"pull factors\" that attract people to the U.S. border.",
      "Biden extended TPS protections to a record number of people, offering them to hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Ukraine and other countries in turmoil. It also reversed the first Trump administration's attempts to terminate TPS programs for several countries, including El Salvador.",
      "Trump officials and many Republican lawmakers believe the TPS policy has been abused and improperly extended too often, despite the program's temporary nature. In one of his first executive orders, Mr. Trump instructed his administration to ensure TPS is \"limited in scope.\"",
      "Still, a handful of Republican lawmakers had urged Mr. Trump to protect Venezuelans from deportation. In a letter Friday, Florida GOP Congressman Carlos Gimenez called on the Trump administration to offer Venezuelan TPS holders a \"solution,\" saying that most are law-abiding migrants \"seeking freedom.\"",

      "SEN. SANDERS: No, I have- Margaret, I have up to now, voted for some Trump appointees. A few. I voted against most, and I'll make my decisions next week. Where Kennedy is right is, we are an unhealthy society- a point I've been making, many others have been making for a long time. One of the things that concerns me very much, and Kennedy mentioned it, is our life expectancy. How long our people live is five years less--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yep--",
      "SEN. SANDERS: --than other wealthy countries. And if you're working class in this country, you live six or seven years lower than if you are rich. It is an issue we have to deal with. And I think the kind of addictive and poisonous food that the food industry is providing our kids is one of the factors, not many. But when you have Kennedy come forward in saying he cannot- he believes- continues to believe that autism is caused by vaccines despite the fact that there have been a dozen studies over the years which disprove that. When he has other conspiracy theories- when he cannot acknowledge that if you're going to make America healthy, you've got to guarantee health care to all people. He was not clear about the need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug costs. So I was not particularly happy with his presentation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the autism point, there is no established cause of autism spectrum disorder, but one in 36 children have been identified with it. According to the CDC, there is concern in this space, including from your Republican colleague, Cassidy. He is a medical doctor. He said he's struggling with the nomination because he fears Kennedy may undermine faith in vaccines. Take a listen.",
      "[SEN. BILL CASSIDY SOT]",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I recognize, man, if you come out unequivocally, vaccines are safe, it does not cause autism. That would have an incredible impact. That's your power. So what's it going to be? Will it be using the credibility to support lots of articles, or will it be using credibility to undermine",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Senator seemed to be saying, If you want my vote, answer the question you said you haven't decided on RFK and how you're going to vote. Is this a red line for you?",
      "SEN. SANDERS: Well, look I don't want to- I- Margaret, what I'm saying is I just don't go around making these announcements. I will vote when I'll vote. But anybody who watched that hearing understands my deep concerns about Kennedy, but I got to tell you, the conspiracy theories that he is throwing out is not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration. And to me, what is most important in terms of what's been happening since Trump has been president, it's not just him having the three wealthiest people in the country stand behind them. By the way, anybody, any working person in this country, should understand what that means. It means that you can have a government working for the very rich, not for the working class of this country, but the movement toward authoritarianism. Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No- No, I want to ask you about that, but just to push you on this point, because it's not just a matter of a vote, like what you are saying is that someone at the top of the health department who is rejecting science or rejecting data that says there's no linkage here, no proven linkage here, by not being clear and saying that's a red line, doesn't that lend itself to misinterpretation? Why won't you say that's disqualifying for him?",
      "SEN. SANDERS: Because I have not said- I have not said to anybody how I will vote. It doesn't matter. I will vote when I vote, but let me just tell you--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Okay, because Republicans were hoping you would help them. That's why I'm asking you.",
      "SEN. SANDERS: Well, I know they hope for a lot of things that just may not happen. But I think- go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Go ahead. I'm sorry.",
      "SEN. SANDERS: Look, the bottom line is, we have a health care crisis in America. We're the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. We pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Our life expectancy is shorter than other countries. Yes, we've got to deal with it in a very direct and forceful manner. You got to take on the insurance companies. Got to move to Medicare for All, got to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We have to understand why our life expectancy is low. And by the way, it's not just health care. It's the fact that so many of our working people are stressed out by inadequate incomes that that's having an impact on not only their lifespans, but their well being. Those are issues we've got to address.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: During the campaign then candidate Trump and Vance, they were very much championing working class people, as you have through the years. They said they support unions. They don't want to tax tips. They want child care tax credits. They're pro-worker. Do you see any opportunities to work with them on specific policies? And if so, where?",
      "SEN. SANDERS: Well, if they were telling the truth and they will go forward in trying to stand up for the working class, of course I will work with them. But I got to tell you, just last week, what Trump did is essentially neuter the National Labor Relations Board. This is something that Bezos wanted. It's something that Elon Musk wanted. What that means if you are a worker right now- and there are millions of workers who want to join a union, because they know unions will give you better wages and better working conditions, better benefits, what they have done is neuter that. So right now, union busting corporations, like Amazon and others, can do what they do against workers with impunity. That is not standing with workers. We need to raise the starvation minimum wage, which is now seven and a quarter an hour, to a living wage. I've not heard one word from the Trump administration about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they want to leave that up to states and corporations as well to make a decision\u2013",
      "SEN. SANDERS: --That- that ain't going to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance told us last Sunday, despite those big tech CEOs giving money to the inauguration for Donald Trump, he still believes they have too much power in big tech and that he says they're still very much on notice. In regard to his past warnings they could be broken up. Is that a place you are also concerned and could work with him on?",
      "SEN. SANDERS: Well, I think Lina Khan, the former head of the FTC, did a great job, and if Vance wants to work with us on that. He's right. You have right now, not only more income and wealth inequality in this country than ever before, more concentration of ownership in the tech industry and in other industries. Do I think we should start breaking up some of these large corporations? Absolutely, I do, and we'd be happy to work with them if they're serious about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Bernie Sanders, Independent from Vermont, thank you for joining us. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Florida Republican Congressman Brian Mast, who is the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has oversight over the State Department and its programs. He joins us from Fort Pierce, Florida. Good morning to you.",
      "REP. BRIAN MAST: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start first on- on the tariffs that were announced overnight by President Trump. You know there is a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. President Trump negotiated it during his first term. The tariffs may violate that deal. If he's invoking tariffs on a national security basis, can you explain the threat posed by Canada?",
      "REP. MAST: Yeah, and he was- President Trump, that is to say, was very specific in his executive order outline, that it's specifically related to fentanyl, it's specifically related to human trafficking. And there's a trust but verify situation that has to- goes on--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Through Canada--",
      "REP. MAST: --go on here- through Canada as well. Absolutely. Fentanyl through Canada, human trafficking through Canada, also with China in that mix for fentanyl as well. That was specifically outlined in it. And until that comes to an end, this is what's going to be on the table. And bear in mind as well that USMCA reauthorization is coming up in the- the coming up- months and years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't believe that this violates the trade agreement? The treaty?",
      "REP. MAST: The- the violation has been to the United States of America. It's been to our sovereignty. It's been to our people--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but Congress votes on these things, so--",
      "REP. MAST: --it's been taken for granted, and I will make sure, certainly, as the Foreign Affairs Chairman, that we give every single authority, as we go through State Department reauthorization, to make sure that this moves forward, as well as purging of people throughout the State Department, other agencies, where we're freezing aid, these are all very important and necessary steps to make sure that we secure America, and we're going to support that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry. Can I follow up on what you just said there?",
      "REP. MAST: Please do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to authorize purging of State Department personnel? What does that mean exactly?",
      "REP. MAST: Well, if you want to take a look at the State Department, where DEI has been a priority over, let's say, diplomacy, in many accounts, I can give you hundreds of examples of where they were authorizing--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --What proof do you have of that?",
      "REP. MAST: Sure. Let's list them off. Half a million dollars to expand atheism in Nepal, $50,000 to do, let's see, a transgender opera in Colombia. $47,000 to do an LGBTQ trans comic book in Peru. $20,000 a pop to do drag shows in Ecuador. Shall I continue with more examples of where DEI was the priority?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh it- it certainly seems like there- there could be a review of things. Foreign aid, as you know, is less than 1% of the entire federal budget. So we're talking small amounts of money by comparison, but--",
      "REP. MAST: We're still talking about tens and tens of billions of dollars. And if you want to go to somebody else on the other side of the aisle, Samantha Powers, she had a worthy goal, although it was a stupid goal, she said she was hoping to get the amount of foreign aid, U.S. aid dollars that go to actual aid, up to 30 cents on the dollar, from 10 cents on the dollar. That's a major problem, that we have this agency that that's all that goes abroad--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- I think you're talking about--",
      "REP. MAST: --when it's the American worker's dollar.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think now you're talking about the- the USAID, the aid--",
      "REP. MAST: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --agency, which is a- sep- separate from the State Department currently, and has about $40 billion worth--",
      "REP. MAST: Which is likely going to be rolled more closely under- under Secretary Rubio.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell- yeah, tell me about that, because that's what I- where I was going. Has the Trump administration informed you of plans to dismantle or significantly shrink this agency?",
      "REP. MAST: This is something that I'm working on very specifically, in conjunction with Secretary Rubio, to make sure that there's the appropriate command and control of these agencies, where again, to make that same point, right now, maybe 10 to 30 cents--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They already report to the Secretary of State.",
      "REP. MAST: --but 10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid. So there's not the right amount of command and control that's going on with the way that it's set up currently.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress--",
      "REP. MAST:--And let's make another point as well--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Congress authorizes and earmarks funding--",
      "REP. MAST: --most of these dollars- most of these dollars that go out of USAID, 70 plus percent, don't come from U.S. growers, U.S. farmers, U.S. ranchers, or go through U.S. ports, and that's another big problem for America.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "So- I'm sorry, Congress already authorizes and earmarks the funding. Just to be very clear, you're not endorsing getting rid of USAID as a separate department, which already reports to the Secretary of State. Are you?",
      "REP. MAST: I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department, and having it fall under whether the other parts of the United States, Department of State, because of its failure, I just went over the numbers twice with you, in the amount of aid that actually makes it into the hands- I mean, you could- you could almost say, this a little bit hyperbole, but there's probably more dollars that go towards state dinners around the DC beltway than what actually goes into rice and beans abroad. That's the- the state of what's going on with USAID. And Samantha Power said no less herself.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think every single administration authorizes reviews, could increase efficiencies. There are plenty of people who propose bringing it more under the authority of the State Department. Madeleine Albright tried to do that. That's not a new MAGA idea. I think the question here, though, is about how you do it. Do you still believe that- that- in the law, signed in in the 1960s, that Congress has to sign off on any changes to USAID. Or do you think President Trump can just make all of this happen through executive order?",
      "REP. MAST: So all of those examples that you just gave of those historical figures, the difference is, now the job is going to get done. It's going to be 99.99% of cents on the dollar actually go--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay--",
      "REP. MAST: --towards what it's intended--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --okay, so you're talking about--",
      "REP. MAST: -- instead of people around the beltway.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --you're talking about--",
      "REP. MAST: That's what's going to happen. That's the change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --efficiencies and aids versus restructuring. So let me ask you about that. Like I said--",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "REP. MAST: Well, that requires restructuring, 100%. You can't create that efficiency just by wishing it into existence, you have to restructure where the failures are and put the right things in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course. But what we're hearing from many of these aid organizations and officials is that, can you restructure after you finish the review and not freeze funding now, immediately? I spoke to former USAID Global Health head Atul Gawande yesterday. He told me, this isn't a pause in foreign aid. It is a demolition of USAID. As he put it, you can't pause a flight in mid air. That's what's happening. This immediate freeze in funding is stopping agencies in the field from being able to do the work they do.",
      "REP. MAST: Let's say why that is so important. And let's talk about the real facts on the ground. The Trump administration comes in, or representatives like myself that do oversight, the agencies will literally not tell us what they are writing grants for, literally. Or they will lie about it, or they will tell the new political appointees under the Trump administration, I'm just not going to tell you that. Those are real things that have happened. So the way that you make them come and answer for where they are actually sending dollars is to say, we're freezing that, we're putting it on hold. You need to come to us and explain what it is you're doing, why you're doing it, and where it's actually saving life. And guess what, when they don't come explain something that also begs the question, why were they doing it in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the way these things work, is the contractors have to front the cash then go to the U.S. government for reimbursement. So when you put in an immediate freeze, that means drugs don't get delivered. That means they don't get distributed. That means bomb disposal units don't get to go out there in places like Cambodia and remove ordinance or provide help to people who receive it. That's the pushback from aid organizations who are saying they're going to have to carry out layoffs in the thousands in the coming week. Does that concern you at all?",
      "REP. MAST:\u00a0 They will have an opportunity- it doesn't concern me, because of the grift that has been going on to the American taxpayer, the American worker. That's what needs to be answered for. And so you look at this, let's use PEPFAR as an example. You're talking about drugs going to individuals. There was a release of that hold that was put, that was authorized, but it shouldn't be the case that the American people fund HIV and AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa, where many of these countries are working very directly with our adversaries, like China. That is an example of them taking us for granted. We need to be asking the question, should they be weaning off of this, should we be paying for these very expensive HIV and AIDS drugs? Should the American worker be- be footing the bill for that? Those are real questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, real questions. But in the meantime, people need their drugs while you ask those questions. So that's where the- the disagreement is with the aid organizations. But let me ask you about air traffic controllers and what's happening here at home.",
      "REP. MAST: Not with all the leaders of other countries though. I believe I saw the leader of Kenya as one step up and say, hey, this is an example where we need to step up for ourselves and show how we can take care of ourselves. And I believe that was the president there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, as I was saying, about another committee you sit on, Transportation Committee. The FAA hiring policy for air traffic controllers, including under the first Trump administration, offered equal opportunity to those with targeted disabilities, including, as the president read, hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, severe intellectual debility- disability, excuse me. The president singled this out, this policy, as a contributor, possibly, to the crash. Do you agree with the diversity policy or do you agree with the president? I know you lost two limbs serving this country in Afghanistan. Do you hear those words and take offense to them? Or--",
      "REP. MAST: No, no offense. Let's- let's unpack it. Number one, I'll use myself as an example, right? There are things that I am suited to do, no doubt, but flying an aircraft, to stick with the subject at hand, would not be one of them. I could fly a personal- personal aircraft, but to put me in charge--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is an air traffic controller.",
      "REP. MAST: --of 50 or 150 lives, that would not be the right case for me personally, given my physical disabilities, and foot pedals on an aircraft. To go to the diversity side of it and the actual crash. Yes, there were very real errors that took place, both in the air traffic control tower and with the helicopter pilots, it seems. But more systemically, is there a big hiring problem across all federal agencies, to include the FAA, where they made the priority diversity and inclusion instead of excellence and performance? Yes, that's the case. They made the priority appearance and lifestyle and not the big deal.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any sense yet what the cost of these tariffs could be for Virginia, which does have a wine industry, for example?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Yeah. Well, first of all, Margaret, I think we might want to call this the Donald Trump Super Bowl tax, with the big game coming next week. If you- you know, avocados, tomatoes, beer from Mexico, price is going to go up. The question around cars- I've read already about $3,000 of additional price on cars, up to 10,000 on trucks, because we've actually integrated very well our auto production with Canada and Mexico. I think it's well about the fact that for years, we've been encouraging businesses to leave China and near shore to a place like Mexico. Now that is going to end up costing consumers more. And for industries like ours- like the wine industry, where we are growing rapidly in Virginia, those folks are going to get socked as well. So this is- remember Donald Trump got hired trying to lower grocery- saying he was going to lower grocery prices\u2013",

You are, as we said, the Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, we watched that hearing this week for Tulsi Gabbard, she had two particular exchanges with Republican senators, Todd Young and James Lankford, who pressed her to say that Edward Snowden was a traitor. Lankford said it was a softball. But listen to what happened.",

I know they're Republicans and you're from a different party, but when you speak to them privately, do you think they can get over that- her refusal to call him a traitor and actually vote to confirm her or even move her out of committee?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Listen, Margaret, Edward Snowden released more information- probably did as much damage to our intelligence community as anyone in history. And the fact that Ms. Gabbard- who actually had legislation to pardon Edward Snowden, she called him a brave whistleblower, couldn't bring herself to call him a traitor, I think is disqualifying just on plain judgment. What would that- what signal if she got in, would that send to the IC workers or contractors? Is she going to suddenly enforce the law if she called Snowden a brave whistleblower? And what I'm particularly concerned about, Margaret, is our sharing of information with our allies, that's not written into law that's based on trust. Will they really trust to share their intelligence with us if she can't call out one of the worst traders in recent American history as- as such, as a traitor.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think she can even make it out of committee and make it to a full vote on the floor of the Senate?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I know there are a number- our committee is the- historically the most bipartisan. We check our partisan hats at the door. There is enormous MAGA pressure that, as we've seen, put on senators who are willing to stand up. We'll know this coming week, but it's not just Snowden, it was- America's most powerful intelligence tool is a law called- something we call Section 702, she left us totally confused on her views on that. And as well, her lack of judgment, whether it's going to visit Assad when he was head of Syria, whether it was taking trips paid for by sketchy groups or echoing Putin's comments somehow NATO started the war in Ukraine, that is not the judgment of somebody that would run 18 intelligence communities- agencies",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch to see those Republican senators. I want to ask you as well about what's happening at the FBI and the Justice Department. President Trump- he campaigned on this promise to restructure the government. Seems like he's implementing that this week. So far between the FBI and Justice Department, we've seen at least 20 terminations. Some are calling this a purge. But is it overstating it if we're seeing 20 people lose their jobs?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, if you are suddenly taking out the most experienced folks at justice or at the FBI, how does that make us stronger? And what he's saying is, every FBI agent that somehow touched the January 6 investigation- that was a comprehensive investigation. I've been told there were almost half of all the FBI agents at least had some involvement. Remember, this was a case that was taken up against these rioters all across the country. If you're suddenly going to get rid of all of those- that could be thousands--",
      "MARGARET BRENN: Yeah--",
      "SEN. WARNER: --what does that mean for our cyber security? What does it mean for our trafficking and stop against fentanyl and other drugs? What does it mean in terms of, you know, serious crime investigations? This would be devastating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's- our reporting is that the order was for a list to be drawn up of those 1500 or so people who worked on those cases. We're going to try to get to the bottom of whether they're actually going to be fired or not--",
      "SEN. WARNER: --But, Margaret. Margaret--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's not clear.",
      "SEN. WARNER: We've seen- but we've seen you get your name on these lists. It's like- it's like, Trump's potentially illegal offer to buy out all the federal employees, where we have no money in the budget for but we had a great tragedy this week in DC with the air- the crash. We are already short air traffic controllers. If suddenly 2 or 3000 air traffic controllers were to say, hey, I'm going to take this buyout, our airspace couldn't operate. And yet he's doing this so recklessly, frankly again, without legal authority\u2013",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it being offered to air traffic controllers?",
      "SEN. WARNER: All federal employees- my understanding it went out to two million federal employees. This offer- which, again, OPM does not have that authority to start with. That was who it came from, but it is- I can tell you, with lots of federal employees, we got chaos on steroids going on, and we had heard from Trump's supporters, the OMB director, for example, that he wanted to traumatize federal workers. Well, that is happening, and these workers are the folks that inspect our- our fruit, our milk, our eggs. You know, what happens if they all quit?",

I want to ask you about your former partner on the Intelligence Committee, Marco Rubio, now Secretary of State. He told a podcaster this week, the president made the decision to cancel security protection for Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, who served during the first term, because he looked through a \"threat versus cost risk assessment.\" I know you're briefed on intelligence. Did the threat from Iran to assassinate former US officials go away?",
      "SEN. WARNER: No. I've seen no intelligence that would indicate that that threat has been diminished. I think this is payback and it's not just Pompeo--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But Secretary Rubio endorsed this.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Listen I have not seen any intelligence- and here I agree with my partner Tom Cotton, the now chair of the intel committee- we've seen nothing to indicate less threat. And also taking out, for example, down the security detail for former General Chief of Staff, Mark Milley. This is all about retribution. And he's putting people's lives in danger, which is just unbelievable and I wish more people would stand up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Thank you, Margaret.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Frank Figliuzzi, former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, and CBS News Justice correspondent Scott MacFarlane on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Feb. 2, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The FBI is without a permanent director at this point, although Mr. Trump's nominee, Kash Patel could get a vote as early as this week. We turn now to Frank Figliuzzi. He is a former FBI Assistant Director for counterintelligence who joins us from Houston. Also here Is CBS News Justice Correspondent Scott McFarlane, and you cover justice and FBI, a lot happening in both of the departments. And I want to bottom line first with Frank, if I could, digging into your experience here. If you can help us understand the reporting from our Andy Triay\u00a0and Pat Milton that the executive assistant directors, those in national security, cyber-criminal divisions are being forced to resign, retire or face termination. What does it mean to have those positions forced out?",
      "FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Yeah, when you combine that essential layer of leadership, executive assistant directors control multiple operational divisions, so at least a half a dozen of those reportedly are gone, and then you get down to the level of at least two or three special agents in charge in the field, including Miami, Washington Field Office, you are starting to lose too much experience. And if this plays out next week, as reportedly it might, with regard to dismissing hundreds or thousands of special agents in the field who have touched January 6 cases or Trump related cases. This makes America less safe. This is not reduction. This is not efficiency. It makes America less safe when you lose that much expertise this quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just to follow up there, Scott McFarlane. What Frank was referring to is the list that was requested. CBS's Rob Legare actually obtained the memo from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who was previously the personal attorney for Donald Trump. He ordered the Acting Director of the FBI to compile everyone who is an employee who was assigned to the 1,500 January 6 cases; there were also eight executives pushed out. Is this a legal and lawful order are FBI officials going to actually fire the people on these lists?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: The list is required and must be produced by 12pm eastern time Tuesday, according to our latest reporting. Whether it is produced is a different question. But the bottom line here is that such a list Margaret would include FBI employees from every FBI field office across the country. This is not just a Washington investigation. The January 6 cases went nationwide. What's more, a lot of the names that are going to be on this list, according to my reporting, are already public domain. They're in the court filings, are in the court docket. They're already out there. So, it's going to be difficult to mask anybody's name or anybody's identity. Whether this is legally permissible, it's a different question, whether these firings are legally permissible? It's a different question. We know the acting FBI director in a memo sent to his employees, he emphasized that there are robust protections. His word is robust protections for FBI agents against employment actions, feels to me like there is a galvanization of FBI employees if they want to fight this, to try to make some effort to push back. Whether they do so it's a different question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why I was asking. Is it actually going to be firings, or is this actually just going to be you can't do what the President's team is pressing to do. Brian Fitzpatrick, you know him from covering the Hill. He's a Republican from Pennsylvania. Used to be an FBI agent. Gave CBS a statement I want to read here. He says he wants to emphasize to the administration, \"line level street agents have little to no control over the office to which they're sent, the cases to which they're assigned and the leads which they are asked to cover. Much like the military they go with they are told and perform the investigative duties that their chain of command orders them to do.\" Frank, I know you know this, but that is a Republican explaining the basic function of how law enforcement works. It sounds like there's going to be pushback on the potential of these firings.",
      "FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Yes, indeed, it's been reported by multiple media outlets that the acting director pushed back very hard and very loudly against the DOJ request, and reportedly he may have been threatened with termination himself. Interestingly enough, both the acting director and acting assistant director would be on that list. They both worked Jan 6 related cases or Trump related cases. So, we've got a potential standoff that's here, but yes, line agents did nothing outside of the law or attorney general guidelines. They simply worked criminal cases. In many cases, gained convictions and guilty pleas, and if they were literally all to be pushed out the door, we would be talking about thousands of FBI agents. There's only 14,000 agents in the field, and we'd be talking close to 6,000 of them who worked such cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Scott, we were just talking about Kash Patel, the boss, isn't in place yet. He was asked under oath before Congress if he knew of some of these actions that were underway literally as he was testifying, he said he didn't know anything about the firings. Is this going to- is it credible, and is it going to be a problem for his confirmation?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: This might have been simultaneous, Margaret. These questions, including from Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, were happening as a lot of this communication was going back and forth over terminations, resignations, retirements. Kash Patel has been on the trajectory towards confirmation as the next FBI director, almost from the jump. The one vote I've been watching closely Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican up for reelection in 2026, he introduced Kash Patel and validated him. It seems nobody has jumped up this weekend to say, I'm now opposed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott McFarlane, it's going to be another interesting week in Washington. Thank you for bottom-lining it. We'll be right back.",

Kennedy Jr.'s presentation before Senate committees last week, though he would not say how he plans to vote on Kennedy's nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "\"I will vote when I'll vote. But anybody who watched that hearing understands my deep concerns about Kennedy,\" Sanders said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats, is the ranking member on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee and also sits on the Senate Finance Committee, which Kennedy appeared before last week. The Finance Committee announced Sunday that it will vote on whether to advance RFK's nomination Tuesday.",
      "The Vermont independent outlined where he thinks Kennedy is right, pointing to his comments about the nation being unhealthy, about life expectancy relative to other wealthy countries and issues with the food industry. But he stressed that Kennedy \"continues to believe that autism is caused by vaccines,\" and was not aligned with him on issues like universal healthcare and targeting the pharmaceutical industry to lower prescription drug prices.",
      "Sanders also argued that \"the conspiracy theories\" that Kennedy has entertained are \"not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration.\"",
      "The comments come after Kennedy was grilled on his vaccine stance, among other things, during the hearings last week, as his advancement out of committee \u2014 and confirmation by the Senate more broadly \u2014 remains in question.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said he's been \"struggling\" with Kennedy's nomination due to concerns he may undermine faith in vaccines. And without support from Democrats and independents on the committee, Cassidy's opposition could tank a favorable recommendation for Kennedy. In a floor vote before the full Senate, Republicans can lose just three votes to confirm Kennedy without support across the aisle.",
      "Though Kennedy, 71, dropped out of the presidential race to endorse President Trump in August, he previously sought the Democratic nomination and has close ties to the party as the as the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of Robert F. Kennedy.",
      "Sanders, asked whether he would help Republicans to confirm Kennedy, said he will make his decision in the days ahead, noting that although he's voted for some of Mr. Trump's nominees, though he's voted against most.",

      "The meeting Tuesday at the White House will be Mr. Trump's first with a foreign leader since returning to office on Jan. 20. It comes as the fragile truce between Israel and Hamas in Gaza holds and mediators begin the daunting work of brokering the next phase of the agreement.",
      "Hamas, which has quickly reasserted its control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, \u00a0is expected to free a total of 33 Israeli hostages during the first, six-week phase of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, which took effect on Jan. 19. After the release on Saturday, 18 have been freed so far.",
      "The militant group has said it will not release the hostages slated to go free in the second phase without an end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "In a statement released ahead of his departure on Sunday, Netanyahu said he and Mr. Trump would discuss \"victory over Hamas, achieving the release of all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian terror axis in all its components,\" referring to Iran's alliance of militant groups across the region, including Hamas.",
      "He said that that by working together, they could \"strengthen security, broaden the circle of peace and achieve a remarkable era of peace through strength.\"",

      "It's unclear where Trump stands.",
      "He has been a staunch supporter of Israel but has also pledged to end wars in the Middle East and took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire agreement.",

      "An Israeli airstrike on a vehicle in central Gaza wounded five people on Sunday, including a child who was in critical condition, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military said it fired upon the vehicle because it was bypassing a checkpoint while heading north in violation of the ceasefire agreement. The military said it remains committed to the deal.",
      "The war began when thousands of Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostages. Over 100 hostages were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023, eight have been rescued alive and dozens of bodies have been recovered by Israeli forces.",
      "Israel's air and ground war has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Hamas-run health authorities who do not say how many of the dead were fighters.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase, in which the war would end and the remaining 60 or so hostages would be returned, are set to begin Monday. If the United States, Qatar and Egypt are unable to broker an agreement between Israel and Hamas, the war could resume in early March.",

      "Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, joined the yearlong ceasefire negotiations in their final weeks last month and helped push the agreement over the finish line. He met with Netanyahu in Israel last week and the two were expected to formally begin talks on the second phase in Washington on Monday.",
      "Trump, who brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab countries in his first term, is believed to be seeking a wider and potentially historic agreement in which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia.",
      "But the kingdom, which resisted similar entreaties from the Biden administration, has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Netanyahu's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood, and a key partner, far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to leave the governing coalition if the war is not resumed next month.

    "summary": "The DOJ's decision to delete Jan. 6 case summaries and related webpages has also drawn the ire of one of the rioters.",
    "story": [
      "A decision by the acting leadership at the U.S. Justice Department to delete its public webpages and case summaries of the Jan. 6 siege at the Capitol prosecution has triggered a legal challenge from a watchdog group and blowback from a federal judge who oversaw some of the cases.",
      "The controversial decision has also drawn the ire of one of the rioters who pleaded guilty.",
      "The Justice Department had built a comprehensive database of the approximately 1,600 defendants from the U.S. Capitol attack and had produced a monthly set of reports updating the prosecution, which was the largest in the agency's long history. Last week, the database and designated public web pages went dark, as the agency halted its prosecutions of the rioters, under orders from President Trump.",
      "The erasure of the public resources and information occurred during a period of transition at the agency, with confirmation votes still pending for Attorney General-nominee Pam Bondi and FBI Director-nominee Kash Patel.",
      "In an opinion issued Thursday, U.S. District court judge Paul Friedman noted the deletion of the public information by the acting Justice Department leadership. Friedman included a recent version of the lengthy database in his public ruling, which can be accessed on the federal court system's website.",
      "The list in Friedman's order mirrors the purged Justice Department database, listing riot defendants in alphabetical order and noting their conviction and sentences.",
      "Friedman also blistered the proclamation by Mr. Trump that the Jan. 6 prosecutions were a \"national injustice perpetrated\" on the American people. Friedman wrote, \"The proclamation's assertion if factually incorrect. There has been no 'grave national injustice.' And just because the proclamation was signed by the President does not transform up into down or down into up as if peering through the glass in 'Alice in Wonderland.'\"",
      "Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, a D.C.-based government watchdog group that frequently scrutinizes Mr. Trump, has issued a public letter seeking an investigation by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General and the Archivist of the United States to determine if the deletion of the Jan. 6 public data was a violation of law.",
      "The letter said, \"The Department of Justice's removal of this vital information about its prosecutions arising from the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol is consistent with President Trump's ongoing efforts to rewrite or erase the insurrection, and also a likely violation of federal law.\"",
      "The watchdog group's letter also read, \"Despite the agency's requirement to notify the archivist of the deletion of these records, there is no indication that they reported this matter to NARA, and a list of open 'unauthorized disposition cases' on NARA's website does not reveal any such reporting. Given DOJ's apparent failure to report this matter to NARA as required by law, we are doing so now and request that NARA take appropriate action, including instructing the agency to issue a report in accordance with 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 1230.14 and \u00a7 1230.16.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's allies in Congress have been accused of their own efforts to erase the history of Jan. 6. House Republican leadership has defied a 2022 law requiring the hanging of a formal plaque on the US Capitol grounds to honor police heroes who saved the Capitol and Congress from the attack.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson has declined to specify if or when the plaque will ever be hung.",
      "Democrats also blasted Republicans for failing to acknowledge the Capitol Insurrection and its victims on the four-year mark of the attack, on Jan. 6, 2025. Republican leaders in the House and Senate did not hold a vigil or commemoration for the victims, which had previously been staged at the Capitol in prior years.",
      "Pam Hemphill, an Idaho woman who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for her role in the US Capitol breach, told CBS News that the deletion of Jan. 6 public records \"is just the latest step in rewriting history for his benefit and is more proof of his utter contempt for the Rule of Law.\"",

      "Asteroid samples fetched by NASA hold not only the pristine building blocks for life but also the salty remains of an ancient water world, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The findings provide the strongest evidence yet that asteroids may have planted the seeds of life on Earth and that these ingredients were mingling with water almost right from the start.",
      "\"That's the kind of environment that could have been essential to the steps that lead from elements to life,\" said the Smithsonian Institution's Tim McCoy, one of the lead study authors.",
      "NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft returned 122 grams (4 ounces) of dust and pebbles from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, delivering the sample canister to the Utah desert in 2023 before swooping off after another space rock. It remains the biggest cosmic haul from beyond the moon. The two previous asteroid sample missions, by Japan, yielded considerably less material.",
      "Small amounts of Bennu's precious black grains \u2014 leftovers from the solar system's formation 4.5 billion years ago \u2014 were doled out to the two separate research teams whose studies appeared in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. But it was more than enough to tease out the sodium-rich minerals and confirm the presence of amino acids, nitrogen in the form of ammonia and even parts of the genetic code.",
      "Some if not all of the delicate salts found at Bennu \u2014 similar to what's in the dry lakebeds of California's Mojave Desert and Africa's Sahara \u2014 would be stripped away if present in falling meteorites.",
      "\"This discovery was only possible by analyzing samples that were collected directly from the asteroid then carefully preserved back on Earth,\" the Institute of Science Tokyo's Yasuhito Sekine, who was not involved in the studies, said in an accompanying editorial.",
      "Combining the ingredients of life with an environment of sodium-rich salt water, or brines, \"that's really the pathway to life,\" said McCoy, the National Museum of Natural History's curator of meteorites. \"These processes probably occurred much earlier and were much more widespread than we had thought before.\"",
      "NASA's Daniel Glavin said one of the biggest surprises was the relatively high abundance of nitrogen, including ammonia. While all of the organic molecules found in the Bennu samples have been identified before in meteorites, Glavin said the ones from Bennu are valid \u2014 \"real extraterrestrial organic material formed in space and not a result of contamination from Earth.\"",
      "Bennu \u2014 a rubble pile just one-third of a mile (one-half of a kilometer) across \u2014 was originally part of a much larger asteroid that got clobbered by other space rocks. The latest results suggest this parent body had an extensive underground network of lakes or even oceans, and that the water evaporated away, leaving behind the salty clues.",
      "Sixty labs around the world are analyzing bits of Bennu as part of initial studies, said the University of Arizona's Dante Lauretta, the mission's chief scientist who took part in both studies.",
      "Most of the $1 billion mission's cache has been set aside for future analysis. Scientists stress more testing is needed to better understand the Bennu samples, as well as more asteroid and comet sample returns. China plans to launch an asteroid sample return mission this year.",
      "Many are pushing for a mission to collect rocks and dirt from the potentially waterlogged dwarf planet Ceres in the main asteroid belt. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus also beckon as enticing water worlds. Meanwhile, NASA has core samples awaiting pickup at Mars, but their delivery is on hold while the space agency studies the quickest and cheapest way to get them here.",
      "\"Are we alone?\" McCoy said. \"That's one of the questions we're trying to answer.\"",

      "A palm-sized mammal that lives underground in California  has been caught alive on camera for the first time.",
      "Three undergraduate students came up with an idea to capture the elusive Mount Lyell shrew, native to the Eastern Sierra Nevada region, as part of their fall 2024 project. Vishal Subramanyan, Prakrit Jain and Harper Forbes laid out over 100 traps last November and checked them every two hours, for three days and four nights, to photograph the tiny creatures.",
      "\"The hardest part of getting the photos was one, they're incredibly fast cuz they're always running around,\" Subramanyan told CBS News.",
      "Another reason the Mount Lynell shrews had never been captured alive on camera is that they have an incredibly fast metabolism, Subramanyan said. He and Jain were already taking photos of small mammals for their mammalogy class when they learned that this particular animal had never been photographed before, so they devised a plan.",
      "Researchers have set up similar pitfall traps to capture the shrews, but if they're left in the trap for more than two hours, they'll simply starve to death. That's why Subramanyan, Jain and Forbes had to check their traps every two hours.",
      "To take the photos, the students set up a white background on the bottom of a box, using glass on the top so they could photograph through it. They also had a terrarium with soil and mealworms for the shrews.",
      "The tiny mammals are active through day and night because they have to constantly feed on insects and arachnids to survive. Another challenge in getting the photos were cold fingers, Subramanyan said.",
      "Temperatures in the mountain fell to 15 degrees during the expedition funded with the help of Cal Academy. Subramanyan was part of the organization's inaugural California Creators for Nature program that aims to engage people on social media in conversations about nature, climate and environmental justice.",

      "The shrews are \"highly prolific predators\" that can eat several times their body mass on a daily basis, Jain said. He noted they also serve as an important part in the food chain for other predators such as snakes, owls and wild cats.",

In the process, Williams became the world's most experienced female spacewalker, logging more than 62 hours outside the lab over nine excursions across multiple missions.",
      "Her latest outing began at 7:43 a.m. EST when she and Wilmore switched their spacesuits to battery power and headed out to retrieve a faulty S-band antenna assembly mounted on an external storage platform. Two earlier attempts to retrieve the unit were unsuccessful.",
      "The device wasn't designed for spacewalk retrieval and it took Williams and Wilmore longer than had been planned to get the job done. But thanks to improvisation and muscle power, the third time was the charm.",
      "\"The team has just been incredible,\" Williams radioed from the Quest airlock when the five-hour 26-minute EVA came to an end. \"I know we were not the first, we weren't even the second crew to do this, but somehow, with all of their great work, we were able to get it done.\"",

A third task, prepping a spare robot arm joint for possible use if arm repairs are ever needed, was deferred to a future spacewalk.",
      "Going into Thursday's spacewalk, or EVA, Williams had logged 56 hours and 40 minutes outside the station during eight previous outings while Wilmore had chalked up 25 hours and 35 minutes of EVA time during four excursions.",
      "With her latest spacewalk, Williams moved past retired astronaut Peggy Whitson's mark of 60 hours and 21 minutes of spacewalk time to become the world's most experienced female spacewalker, moving up to number four overall.",
      "Stuck aboard the station since last June because of NASA concerns about the safety of their Starliner capsule, Williams and Wilmore are now planning to return to Earth around the end of March aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship that carried two other station fliers \u2014 Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 to the lab last September.",
      "That Crew Dragon was launched with two empty seats specifically to carry Williams and Wilmore back to Earth at the end of the Crew 9 mission, originally planned for late February. But an extra month was tacked on later to give SpaceX more time to complete pre-flight checks of the Crew 10 Dragon, which will be making its maiden flight.",
      "President Trump earlier this week blamed their long stay in space on the Biden administration and said that he'd asked SpaceX owner Elon Musk to bring Williams and Wilmore back home as soon as possible.",
      "But the astronauts are not stranded. Their ride home has been docked to the station since last September and could bring them back to Earth in short order if NASA so ordered.",
      "But that would cause major disruptions to U.S. research aboard the lab because only a single NASA astronaut \u2014 Don Pettit \u2014 would remain aboard the station with two Russian crewmates until the Crew 10 fliers arrive around the end of March.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 13:13:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A NASA spacecraft has returned asteroid samples that hold not only the pristine building blocks for life but also the salty remains of an ancient water world.",
    "story": [
      "Asteroid samples fetched by NASA hold not only the pristine building blocks for life but also the salty remains of an ancient water world, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The findings provide the strongest evidence yet that asteroids may have planted the seeds of life on Earth and that these ingredients were mingling with water almost right from the start.",
      "\"That's the kind of environment that could have been essential to the steps that lead from elements to life,\" said the Smithsonian Institution's Tim McCoy, one of the lead study authors.",
      "NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft returned 122 grams (4 ounces) of dust and pebbles from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, delivering the sample canister to the Utah desert in 2023 before swooping off after another space rock. It remains the biggest cosmic haul from beyond the moon. The two previous asteroid sample missions, by Japan, yielded considerably less material.",
      "Small amounts of Bennu's precious black grains \u2014 leftovers from the solar system's formation 4.5 billion years ago \u2014 were doled out to the two separate research teams whose studies appeared in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. But it was more than enough to tease out the sodium-rich minerals and confirm the presence of amino acids, nitrogen in the form of ammonia and even parts of the genetic code.",
      "Some if not all of the delicate salts found at Bennu \u2014 similar to what's in the dry lakebeds of California's Mojave Desert and Africa's Sahara \u2014 would be stripped away if present in falling meteorites.",
      "\"This discovery was only possible by analyzing samples that were collected directly from the asteroid then carefully preserved back on Earth,\" the Institute of Science Tokyo's Yasuhito Sekine, who was not involved in the studies, said in an accompanying editorial.",
      "Combining the ingredients of life with an environment of sodium-rich salt water, or brines, \"that's really the pathway to life,\" said McCoy, the National Museum of Natural History's curator of meteorites. \"These processes probably occurred much earlier and were much more widespread than we had thought before.\"",
      "NASA's Daniel Glavin said one of the biggest surprises was the relatively high abundance of nitrogen, including ammonia. While all of the organic molecules found in the Bennu samples have been identified before in meteorites, Glavin said the ones from Bennu are valid \u2014 \"real extraterrestrial organic material formed in space and not a result of contamination from Earth.\"",
      "Bennu \u2014 a rubble pile just one-third of a mile (one-half of a kilometer) across \u2014 was originally part of a much larger asteroid that got clobbered by other space rocks. The latest results suggest this parent body had an extensive underground network of lakes or even oceans, and that the water evaporated away, leaving behind the salty clues.",
      "Sixty labs around the world are analyzing bits of Bennu as part of initial studies, said the University of Arizona's Dante Lauretta, the mission's chief scientist who took part in both studies.",
      "Most of the $1 billion mission's cache has been set aside for future analysis. Scientists stress more testing is needed to better understand the Bennu samples, as well as more asteroid and comet sample returns. China plans to launch an asteroid sample return mission this year.",
      "Many are pushing for a mission to collect rocks and dirt from the potentially waterlogged dwarf planet Ceres in the main asteroid belt. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus also beckon as enticing water worlds. Meanwhile, NASA has core samples awaiting pickup at Mars, but their delivery is on hold while the space agency studies the quickest and cheapest way to get them here.",
      "\"Are we alone?\" McCoy said. \"That's one of the questions we're trying to answer.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 22:56:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Posts by President Trump and Elon Musk roiled the space community, raising the prospect of an earlier-than-planned return for the Starliner crew.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump blamed the Biden administration Tuesday for \"abandoning\" two astronauts who have been stuck aboard the International Space Station in the wake of problems last summer with their Boeing Starliner capsule.",
      "In a post to his Truth Social platform, the president said he has asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration. They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!\"",
      "For his part, Musk had written in an earlier post on his own social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding that \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's post made it sound like Musk himself would be going to space, adding to widespread confusion about what was being planned, in part because the astronauts in question, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, are not \"stranded\" in any conventional sense, and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "They could return to Earth anytime NASA so decides, riding down in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that carried two station crew members to orbit last September with two empty seats specifically for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "They blasted off aboard the Starliner capsule last June 5 for a presumed eight-to-10-day mission. It was the first piloted flight of a Starliner, a key step toward beginning service as an operational alternative to SpaceX's Crew Dragon.",
      "But the flight was marred by propellant leaks and pressurization problems with the Starliner's propulsion system.",
      "After multiple extensions to carry out tests and analyses, NASA managers decided on Aug. 24 to leave Wilmore and Williams aboard the station for an extended stay, bringing the Starliner down under remote control, without its crew, on Sept. 7. There were no major problems.",
      "The decision to keep Wilmore and Williams aloft on the station was made by NASA management based on a risk assessment and a desire to minimize long-range disruption to the carefully choreographed schedule of crew rotation and cargo delivery missions.",
      "In any case, in the wake of NASA's decision, SpaceX launched a four-seat Crew Dragon spacecraft to the space station on Sept. 28 with just two crew members aboard \u2014 NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 leaving two seats available for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "NASA opted to carry out a normal long-duration stay by Hague and Gorbunov, who launched with an expectation of returning to Earth at the end of February with Wilmore and Williams. All of that was known last September.",
      "The return flight was later delayed an additional month or so to give SpaceX more time to ready a new Crew Dragon capsule for launch on its maiden flight to ferry a replacement crew \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to the station.",
      "As it now stands, Crew 9 commander Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams are expecting to return to Earth at the end of March. By that point, the two Starliner astronauts will have logged around 300 days in space. Both astronauts have said they understood NASA's decision to extend their mission.",
      "As the founder of SpaceX, Musk was certainly aware of those decisions when they were made and the rationale behind them. There have been no reports of any direct involvement of the Biden administration in the decisions to extend the Starliner crew's stay in space, and Musk offered no criticisms of NASA's decision at the time.",
      "As for what returning the Starliner crew to Earth \"as soon as possible\" might mean, the only obvious answer would be to bring Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams down ahead of schedule. They would not need anyone to come get them.",
      "But an early departure would leave a single U.S. astronaut behind on the space station: Don Pettit, who launched to the lab last year aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "NASA would then have just one astronaut on board the station to operate the multi-module U.S. segment of the lab, likely halting research in its tracks until Crew 10 could arrive aboard the next Crew Dragon.",
      "Rumors indicate the Crew 10 Dragon could be facing additional delays. NASA could opt to move the next station crew to a Crew Dragon earmarked for a commercial trip to the station carrying a crew sponsored by Houston-based Axiom Space. That might move the Crew 9 return up a few days, but not by any significant amount.",
      "A Crew Dragon that will be used for a commercial space tourism flight around Earth's poles this spring is not believed to be an option because it is not equipped with a space station docking mechanism.",

      "Read an excerpt below about how, in eighth grade, he discovered BASIC, which introduced him to the elegance and exacting demands of computer code; and don't miss Lee Cowan's interview with Bill Gates on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" February 2!",
      "\"Source Code: My Beginnings\" by Bill Gates",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "All these years later it still amazes me how so many disparate things had to come together for me to use a computer in 1968. Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",
      "The page included a sample program written in BASIC telling the computer how to add two numbers.",

      "10 INPUT X,Y",
      "20 LET A=X+Y",
      "30 PRINT A",
      "40 END",
      "That was probably the first computer program I ever typed in. The elegance of the four lines of code appealed to my sense of order. Its instantaneous answer was like a jolt of electricity. From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Chinese startup DeepSeek has debuted an AI app that challenges OpenAI's ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, sending a shock through Wall Street.",
    "story": [
      "A Chinese artificial intelligence company called DeepSeek is grabbing America's attention \u2014 and sending a shock wave through Wall Street \u2014 due to its new tech, which some experts say rivals that of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according\u00a0to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.",
      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "Are there privacy issues with DeepSeek?",
      "Some experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.",
      "That echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law\u00a0banning\u00a0 TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",
      "Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.",
      "What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.",
      "\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"",
      "But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\" wrote Google in a social media post Monday. Their policy is to implement title changes for geographic features in the U.S. after the adjustments appear in the Geographic Names Information System.",
      "\"When that happens, we will update Google Maps in the U.S. quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America,\" the tech company said.",
      "Also longstanding practice: When official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name. Everyone in the rest of the world sees both names. That applies here too.",
      "Google noted that a location's name may appear differently depending on where Maps users are. When a place's title varies between countries, users will see the official name used by the country where they're accessing Maps. Everyone elsewhere in the world sees both names.",
      "The Interior Department announced Friday that the Gulf of Mexico had been renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali had, again, been renamed Mount McKinley, in response to a directive signed by Mr. Trump shortly after he took office.",

The Associated Press, whose style guidance many news organizations typically follow, said it will call the Gulf of Mexico by its original name while acknowledging the name Gulf of America. The AP will also refer to Denali as Mount McKinley, since Mr. Trump's position gives him authority to alter geographical names of places inside the country.",
      "The Gulf of Mexico first appeared on a world map roughly 400 years ago, as Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum pointed out during a briefing earlier this month where she derided what was at the time Mr. Trump's proposal to rename the ocean basin that shares near-equal lengths of coastline with her country and the U.S. Citing one of Mexico's founding documents that dates to the early 1800s and preceded the nation's constitution, Sheinbaum sarcastically suggested renaming North America \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" which translates to \"Mexican America.\"",
      "Denali's name comes from the Koyukon Indigenous residents of Alaska who are native to area around the mountain. Subject to dispute over the decades, the U.S. designated it Mount McKinley in the early 1900s to commemorate a slain president.

      "Pasadena, Texas \u2014 A parent tackled a man who opened fire during a band competition at a Houston-area high school as several other people then helped disarm and detain him in a shooting that wounded one person, officials said.",
      "The man, in his 80s, entered Pasadena Memorial High School on Saturday evening during the competition that involved students from numerous school districts and discharged a small-caliber weapon, police said.",
      "The Angleton Independent School District said the wounded person was a percussion technical consultant for their band. Police said the man, who the district said was struck in the shoulder, was taken to a hospital and was in stable condition.",
      "The man who opened fire wasn't affiliated with the competition, according to the Pasadena Independent School District. He was tackled by a parent after discharging the weapon and then school district police and \"several good Samaritans\" helped apprehend him, the district said.",
      "\"Within 60 seconds, a suspect was disarmed and they prevented further shooting by this suspect,\" Pasadena Police Chief Jerry Wright said at a news conference.",
      "The Pearland Independent School District said in a statement that some parents of the students in their district \"bravely intervened, successfully subduing the individual and detaining them until law enforcement arrived.\"",
      "How the incident unfolded",
      "CBS Houston affiliate KHOU-TV reports that the parents were fathers who were helping with the competition.",
      "The four \u2014 13-year Air Force veteran Abram Trevino, 14-year Army veteran Adam Curow, 4-year Marine Corps veteran Efrain 'Polo' Castillo and long-time Houston police sergeant Joe Sanchez \u2014 quickly jumped into action.",
      "They're part of what's known as the Pearland Band Dads, and they help with band-related activities for Pearland High School. Students form the school were among those in Saturday's competition.",
      "The fathers told KHOU they were moving equipment around when they noticed a lot of commotion.",
      "\"People were coming out screaming, saying, 'Active shooter, active shooter,' so me and Polo were with the same prop, dropped everything and ran through the lobby door,\" Sanchez said.",
      "Sanchez said another man had already started to subdue the suspect, but then he and the other three Pearland Band Dads got involved.",
      "\"I grabbed his arms while Adam took the gun out, and once the gun was removed from his hand, we had no handcuffs, so I took off my belt, made handcuffs, got his right arm secured, got his left arm secured,\" Sanchez said.",
      "Possible motive",
      "The Pasadena Police Department identified the suspect as 83-year-old Dennis Erwin Brandl, Jr. Police said Brandl, Jr. told officers he thought he was being chased by someone and feared he and his wife were going to be killed. He left his home in Spring and ended up in Pasadena, where he then went into the school.",
      "Curow said he heard something similar directly from Brandl, Jr. on the night of the shooting.",
      "\"When the suspect was on the ground, he kept saying, 'Someone's trying to shoot me, someone's trying to shoot me,' and we would look around or scan the area to see if maybe there was an additional or potential second person that may be the person he's referencing, but there was nobody. It was all spectators, students and parents,\" Curow said.",

      "FBI supervisors across the country have received questionnaires to distribute to certain agents in their field offices containing questions about the agents' possible work on Jan 6. Capitol riot cases, according to two sources familiar with the matter.",
      "A source familiar with the matter told CBS News the questionnaires are being sent to more than 1,000 FBI agents and non-agent support personnel in field offices across the country, as well as FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.",
      "The questions, obtained by CBS News, ask what role the respondent may have played in any cases, such as acting as an agent, providing management support or collecting online data. The survey also asks if the respondent made any arrests, conducted interviews, participated in search warrants, testified in court or appeared before a grand jury.",
      "The questionnaires are to be completed and submitted by supervisors by Tuesday afternoon.",
      "The questionnaire comes days after Washington, D.C.'s top prosecutor, Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Martin, was directed to fire prosecutors who were assigned to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to a memo obtained by CBS News. A separate memo from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered that all FBI agents who were assigned to the Jan. 6 insurrection cases undergo review.",
      "Bove on Friday ordered the acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned \"at any time\" to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack investigation for review \"to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary,\" according to a memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "In a note to members regarding the questionnaire, the FBI Agents Association said,\u00a0\"We understand that this feels like agents and employees are being targeted, despite repeated assurances that 'all FBI employees will be protected against political retribution,'\" although it was not immediately clear who had provided such assurances. \"Employees carrying out their duties to investigate allegations of criminal activity with integrity and within the rule of law should never be treated as those who have engaged in actual misconduct,\" the note added.",
      "In a letter addressed to Bove, who previously served as a private defense attorney for Mr. Trump, attorneys representing some of the FBI employees have threatened legal action against the Justice Department over any forthcoming employment actions against FBI workers who followed \"procedures, norms and law\" in their investigations.",
      "The attorneys wrote that the termination of FBI employees over their involvement in investigating Jan. 6 rioters and President Trump's classified documents case, \"appear to be in violation of the due process rights of those to be unlawfully discharged.\"",
      "\"Moreover, if information about these individuals is made publicly available, it also threatens the safety of dedicated career public servants and potentially of their innocent family members. The continuation of this course of action is a direct assault on the national security of American citizens you have sworn to faithfully and unselfishly serve,\" the letter read.",
      "James Dennehy, assistant director in charge of the New York FBI office, said in a memo to 1,200 agents and support personnel on Friday, \"Today we find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own as good people are being walked out of the FBI and others are being targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI policy.\"",
      "He noted that some may be contemplating resigning as part of the \"deferred resignation\" offers from the Trump administration.",
      "\"As part of what is being offered to you right now, my only ask of you is that you do the homework, gather all the information, and talk it through with your loved ones before you make an informed decision.\"",
      "He called Driscoll and acting FBI Deputy Director Robert Kissane \"total warriors\" and concluded the memo saying, \"I mourn the forced retirements of the [executive assistant directors] and fired field office heads, all of whom are extraordinary individuals who have dedicated decades of their lives to this joint just to be robbed of their title and profession but not their dignity.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump picks a tariff fight with America's top trade partners, federal workers brace for another tumultuous week, and the fallout continues from Mr. Trump blaming diversity policies for the midair collision of an Army Black Hawk and a passenger jet.",
      "Washington and the rest of the world are waking up to what feels like a new reality show, as President Trump continues to make good on his campaign promises, despite the confusion and controversy surrounding some of them.",
      "We will talk with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia's Mark Warner, Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Brian Mast.",
      "On the good news front, American Keith Siegel has a happy family reunion following his release from Hamas captivity.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "One of the president's biggest campaign promises was to enact steep tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. Saturday night, he did just that. And the move has already sparked international backlash and sent chills through the financial world.",
      "We begin with senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe, who is traveling with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Panama \u2013 Ed.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Margaret, good morning.",
      "These are sweeping tariffs, the present using a 1977 law to suggest there is now an extraordinary threat from fentanyl and illegal immigration and that all three countries are failing to address those challenges.",
      "So, starting Tuesday, there will be 25 percent tariffs on all Mexican exports, 25 percent tariffs on most Canadian exports, 10 percent tariffs on Canadian energy exports and 10 percent tariffs on all goods from China.",
      "This morning, the president acknowledged this could lead to higher prices, writing: \"Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe and maybe not,\" he wrote on his social media platform, \"but we will make America great again and it will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This has triggered a trade war. Canada's prime minister announced tariffs on American beer, bourbon, wine, lumber, fruits, clothing, appliances.",
      "So, Ed, what else should we expect is coming that could hurt American consumers?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Well, we should anticipate there could be a tit for tat here, because the orders that the president signed Saturday night give him the authority to keep raising tariffs on the three countries if they respond in kind. And that could contribute to an uptick in inflation, which we have seen in recent weeks.",
      "Now, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, spoke directly to Americans last night, warning the tariffs \u2013 quote \u2013 \"will put your jobs at risk,\" potentially shutting down American auto assembly plants and other manufacturing facilities.",
      "And he said Canada's planned dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs will raise American grocery and gas prices. And while President Trump accused Mexico of having an alliance with drug cartels, President Claudia Sheinbaum said: \"If such alliances exist anywhere, they exist in the U.S. gun shops that sell high-powered weapons to criminal groups.\"",
      "And China says it firmly deplores and opposes this move and will take necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests. It is planning to protest these tariffs to the World Trade Organization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, what's on Secretary Rubio's agenda in Panama?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes, well, you know, Rubio, of course, the first Latino secretary of state, so he is taking his first overseas mission here to Central America and the Caribbean to reiterate President Trump's concern that China now has too much influence over the Panama Canal.",
      "The Panamanians insist they have full control \u2013 Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks, Ed.",
      "We go now to Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner. He is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and joins us from Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any sense yet what the cost of these tariffs could be for Virginia, which does have a wine industry, for example?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Yes.",
      "Well, first of all, Margaret, I think we might want to call this the Donald Trump Super Bowl tax with the big game coming next week, if \u2013 avocados, tomatoes, beer from Mexico, prices going to go up. The question around cars, I have read already about $3,000 of additional price on cars, up to $10,000 on trucks, because we have actually integrated very well our auto production with Canada and Mexico.",
      "I think as well about the fact that for years we have been encouraging businesses to leave China and nearshore to a place like Mexico. Now that is going to end up costing consumers more. And for industries like ours, like the wine industry, where we are growing rapidly in Virginia, those folks are going to get socked as well.",
      "So this is a \u2013 remember, Donald Trump got hired trying to lower \u2013 saying he was going to lower grocery prices.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Two weeks in, he's doing something that's going to do the absolute opposite.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will track the impact of this trade war.",
      "Senator, I want to switch topics. You are, as we said, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. We watched that hearing this week for Tulsi Gabbard. She had two particular exchanges with Republican senators, Todd Young and James Lankford, who pressed her to say that Edward Snowden was a traitor.",
      "Lankford said it was a softball, but listen to what happened.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "SENATOR TED BUDD (R-North Carolina): Did he betray a duty, did he betray the trust of the American people? Which is \u2013 according to Merriam-Webster, that's the definition of a traitor.",
      "FORMER REPRESENTATIVE TULSI GABBARD (D-Hawaii): Edward Snowden broke the law and he released this information in a way that he should not have. He also acknowledged and exposed information that was unconstitutional.",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD (R-Oklahoma): Was he a traitor at the time when he took America's secrets, released them in public, and then ran to China and became a Russian citizen?",
      "FORMER REPRESENTATIVE TULSI GABBARD: Senator, I'm focused on the future and how we can prevent something like this from happening again.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have worked closely with these senators. I know they're Republicans and you're from a different party, but when you speak to them privately, do you think they can get over that, her refusal to call him a traitor, and actually vote to confirm her or even move her out of committee?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Listen, Margaret, Edward Snowden released more information, probably did as much damage to our intelligence community as anyone in history.",
      "And the fact that Ms. Gabbard, who actually had legislation to pardon Edward Snowden \u2013 she called him a brave whistle-blower \u2013 couldn't bring herself to call him a traitor, I think, is disqualifying just on plain judgment.",
      "What would that \u2013 what signal, if she got in, would that send to the I.C. workers or contractors? Is she going to suddenly enforce the law, if she called Snowden a brave whistle-blower? And",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: what I'm particularly concerned about, Margaret, is, our sharing of information with our allies, that's not written into law. That's based on trust.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Will they really trust to share their intelligence with us if she can't call out one of the worst traitors in recent American history as such, as a traitor?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think she can even make it out of committee and make it to a full vote on the floor of the Senate?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: I know there are a number \u2013 our committee is historically the most bipartisan. We check our partisan hats at the door.",
      "There is enormous MAGA pressure that \u2013 as we have seen, put on senators who are willing to stand up. We will know this coming week. But \u2013 and it's not just Snowden. It was America's most powerful intelligence tool is a law called \u2013 or something we call Section 702. She left us totally confused on her views on that.",
      "And as well her lack of judgment, whether it's going to visit Assad when he was head of Syria, whether it was taking trips paid for by sketchy groups, or echoing Putin's comments that somehow NATO started the war in Ukraine\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 that is not the judgment of somebody that would run 18 intelligence communities \u2013 agencies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will watch to see those Republican senators.",
      "I want to ask you as well about what's happening at the FBI and the Justice Department. President Trump, he campaigned on this promise to restructure the government. Seems like he's implementing that this week. So far, between the FBI and Justice Department, we have seen at least 20 terminations.",
      "Some are calling this a purge, but is it overstating it if we're seeing 20 people lose their jobs?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, if you are suddenly taking out the most experienced folks at Justice or at the FBI, how does that make us stronger?",
      "And what he's saying is, every FBI agent that somehow touched the January 6 investigation \u2013 that was a comprehensive investigation. I have been told there were \u2013 almost half of all the FBI agents at least had some involvement. Remember, this was a case that was taken up against these rioters all across the country.",
      "If you're suddenly going to get rid of all of those, that could be thousands.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: What does that mean for our cybersecurity? What does it mean for our trafficking and stop against fentanyl and other drugs? What does it mean in terms of serious crime investigations?",
      "This would be devastating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's \u2013 well, our reporting is that the order was for a list to be drawn up of those 1,500 or so people who worked on those cases. We're going to try to get to the bottom of whether they're actually going to be fired or not. That's not clear.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: But, Margaret \u2013 Margaret, it \u2013 we have seen \u2013 but we have seen, you get your name on these lists. It's like \u2013 it's like Trump's potentially illegal offer to buy out all the federal employees, where we have no money in the budget for.",
      "But we had a great tragedy this week in D.C. with the air \u2013 the crash.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: We are already short air traffic controllers. If suddenly 2,000 or 3,000 air traffic controllers were to say, hey, I'm going to take this buyout, our airspace couldn't operate.",
      "And yet he's doing this so recklessly and, frankly, again\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it being offered to them?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 without legal authority.",
      "Pardon me. Say again?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that open to \u2013 is it being offered to air traffic controllers?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: All federal employees. My understanding, went out to two million federal employees this offer, which, again, OPM does not have that authority to start with. That was who it came from.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: But it is \u2013 I can tell you, with lots of federal employees, we got chaos on steroids going on.",
      "And we had heard from Trump's supporters, the OMB director, for example, that he wanted to traumatize federal workers. Well, that is happening. And these workers are the folks that inspect our fruit, our milk, our eggs.",
      "What happens if they all quit?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you \u2013 and I know many of those people live in the state of Virginia. They are your constituents.",
      "I want to ask you about your former partner on the Intelligence Committee Marco Rubio, now secretary of state. He told a podcaster this week the president made the decision to cancel security protection for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who served during the first term, because he looked through a threat versus cost risk assessment.",
      "I know you're briefed on intelligence. Did the threat from Iran to assassinate former U.S. officials go away?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: No.",
      "I have seen no intelligence that would indicate that that threat has been diminished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Secretary Rubio endorsed this.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: I think this is payback. And it's not just Pompeo.",
      "Listen, I have not seen any intelligence. And, here, I agree with my partner Tom Cotton, the now-chair of the Intel Committee. We have seen nothing to indicate less threat, and also taking out, for example \u2013 down the security detail for former General Chief of Staff Mark Milley, this is all about retribution.",
      "And he's putting people's lives in danger, which is just unbelievable. And I wish more people would stand up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Florida Republican Congressman Brian Mast, who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has oversight over the State Department and its programs.",
      "He joins us from Fort Pierce, Florida.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST (R-Florida): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start first on the tariffs that were announced overnight by President Trump. You know there's a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. President Trump negotiated it during his first term.",
      "The tariffs may violate that deal. If he's invoking tariffs on a national security basis, can you explain the threat posed by Canada?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes, and he was \u2013 President Trump, that is to say, was very specific in his executive order, outlined that it's specifically related to fentanyl. It's specifically related to human trafficking.",
      "And there's a trust, but verify situation that has to go on here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Through Canada?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Through Canada as well, absolutely, fentanyl through Canada, human trafficking through Canada, also with China in that mix for fentanyl as well.",
      "That was specifically outlined in it. And until that comes to an end, this is what's going to be on the table. And bear in mind as well that USMCA reauthorization is coming up in the coming-up months and years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't believe that this violates the trade agreement, the treaty?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: The violation has been to the United States of America. It's been to our sovereignty. It's been to our people. We've been taken for granted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but Congress votes on these things. So\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: And I will make sure certainly, as the Foreign Affairs chairman, that we give every single authority as we go through State Department reauthorization, to make sure that this moves forward, as well as purging of people throughout the State Department, other agencies, where we're freezing aid.",
      "These are all very important and necessary steps to make sure that we secure America. And we're going to support that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry. Can I follow up on what you just said there?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Please do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to authorize purging of State Department personnel? What does that mean exactly?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, if you want to take a look at the State Department, where DEI has been a priority over, let's say, diplomacy on many accounts, I can give you hundreds of examples of where they were authorizing\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What proof do you have of that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Sure, let's list them off, half-a-million dollars to expand atheism in Nepal, $50,000 to do, let's see, a transgender opera in Colombia, $47,000 to do an LGBTQ trans comic book in Peru, $20,000 a pop to do drag shows in Ecuador.",
      "Shall I continue with more examples of where DEI was a priority?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, it certainly seems like there could be a review of things. Foreign aid, as you know, is less than 1 percent of the entire federal budget. So we're talking small amounts of money by comparison. But when\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: We're still talking about tens and tens of billions of dollars.",
      "And if you want to go to somebody else, on the other side of the aisle, Samantha Power, she had a worthy goal, although it was a stupid goal. She said she was hoping to get the amount of foreign aid, U.S. aid dollars that go to actual aid up to 30 cents on the dollar from 10 cents on the dollar. That's a major problem that we have this agency that that's all that goes abroad\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you're talking about\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: \u2026 when it should be the American worker's dollar.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think now you're talking about the USAID, the aid agency\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 which is a \u2013 separate from the State Department currently and has about $40 billion worth\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Which is likely going to be rolled more closely under Secretary Rubio.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell \u2013 yes, tell me about that, because that's where I was going.",
      "Has the Trump administration informed you of plans to dismantle or significantly shrink this agency?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: This is something that I'm working on very specifically, in conjunction with Secretary Rubio, to make sure that there's the appropriate command-and-control of these agencies, where, again, to make that same point, right now, maybe 10 to 30 cents\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They already report to the secretary of state.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But 10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid. So there's not the right amount of command-and- control that's going on with the way that it's set up currently.",
      "And let's make another point on this as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress \u2013 Congress authorizes and earmarks funding.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Most of these dollars \u2013 most of these dollars that go out of USAID, 70-plus percent don't come from U.S. growers, U.S. farmers, U.S. ranchers, or go through us ports. And that's another big problem for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 I'm sorry. If Congress already authorizes and earmarks the funding, just to be very clear, you're not endorsing getting rid of USAID as a separate department, which already reports to the secretary of state, are you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department and having it fall under one of the other parts of United States Department of State, because of its failure.",
      "I just went over the numbers twice with you in the amount of aid that actually makes it into the hands. I mean, you could you could almost say \u2013 this is a little bit hyperbole \u2013 but there's probably more dollars that go towards state dinners around the D.C. Beltway than what actually goes into rice and beans abroad.",
      "That's the state of what's going on with USAID. And Samantha Power said no less herself.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think every single administration authorizes reviews, could increase efficiencies. There are plenty of people who propose bringing it more under the authority of the State Department. Madeleine Albright tried to do that. That's not a new MAGA idea.",
      "I think the question here, though, is about how you do it. Do you still believe that in the law signed in the 1960s that Congress has to sign off on any changes to USAID? Or do you think President Trump can just make all of this happen through executive order?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: So, all of those examples that you just gave of those historical figures, the difference is now the job is going to get done.",
      "It's going to be 99.99 percent of cents on the dollar actually go towards what it's intended, instead of people around the Beltway.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so you're talking about \u2013 you're talking about\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: That's what's going to happen. That's the change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 efficiencies in aids versus restructuring.",
      "So let me ask you about that. Well, like I said\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, that requires restructuring, 100 percent. You can't create that efficiency just by wishing it into existence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: You have to restructure where the failures are and put the right things in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course.",
      "But what we're hearing from many of these aid organizations and officials is that, can you restructure after you finish the review and not freeze funding now, immediately? I spoke to former USAID global health head Atul Gawande yesterday. He told me this isn't a pause in foreign aid. It is a demolition of USAID.",
      "As he put it, you can't pause a flight in midair. That's what's happening.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This immediate freeze in funding is stopping agencies in the field from being able to do the work they do.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's say why that is so important. And let's talk about the real facts on the ground.",
      "The Trump administration comes in or representatives like myself that do oversight. The agencies will literally not tell us what they are writing grants for, literally, or they will lie about it, or they will tell the new political appointees under the Trump administration, I'm just not going to tell you that. Those are real things that have happened.",
      "So the way that you make them come and answer for where they are actually sending dollars is to say, we're freezing that. We're putting it on hold. You need to come to us and explain what it is you're doing, why you're doing it and where it's actually saving life. And guess what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: When they don't come explain something, that also begs the question, why were they doing it in the first place?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the way these things work is, the contractors have to front the cash, then go to the U.S. government for reimbursement.",
      "So when you put in an immediate freeze, that means drugs don't get delivered. That means they don't get distributed. That means bomb disposal units don't get to go out there in places like Cambodia and remove ordnance or provide help to people who receive it.",
      "That's the pushback from aid organizations, who are saying they're going to have to carry out layoffs in the thousands in the coming week. Does that concern you at all?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: They will have an opportunity. It doesn't concern me because of the grift that has been going on to the American taxpayer, the American worker.",
      "That's what needs to be answered for. And so you look at this. Let's use PEPFAR as an example. You were talking about drugs going to individuals. There was a release of that hold that was put \u2013 that was authorized. But it shouldn't be the case that the American people fund HIV and AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa, where many of these countries are working very directly with our adversaries like China.",
      "That is an example of them taking us for granted. We need to be asking the question, should they be weaning off of this? Should we be paying it for these very expensive HIV and AIDS drugs?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Should the American worker be footing the bill for that? Those are real questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, real questions, but, in the meantime, people need their drugs while you ask those questions. So that's where the disagreement is with the aid organizations.",
      "But let me ask you about air traffic controllers and what's happening here at home.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Not with all the leaders of other countries, though. I believe I saw the leader of Kenya as one step up and say, hey, this is an example where we need to step up for ourselves and show how we can take care of ourselves. And I believe that was the president there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, as I was saying, about another committee you sit on, Transportation Committee.",
      "The FAA hiring policy for air traffic controllers, including under the first Trump administration, offered equal opportunity to those with targeted disabilities, including, as the president read, hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, severe intellectual debility \u2013 disability. Excuse me.",
      "The president singled this out, this policy, as a contributor possibly to the crash. Do you agree with the diversity policy, or do you agree with the president? I know you lost two limbs serving this country in Afghanistan. Do you hear those words and take offense to them or\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: No, no offense. Let's unpack it.",
      "Number one, I will use myself as an example, right? There are things that I am suited to do, no doubt. But flying an aircraft, to stick with the subject at hand, would not be one of them. I could fly a personal \u2013 a personal aircraft.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is air traffic controllers.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But to put me in charge of traffic or 150 lives, that would not be the right case for me personally, given my physical disabilities and foot pedals on an aircraft.",
      "To go to the diversity side of it and the actual crash, yes, there were very real errors that took place both in the air traffic control tower and with the helicopter pilots, it seems. But, more systemically, is there a big hiring problem across all federal agencies, to include the FAA, where they made the priority diversity and inclusion\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: \u2026 instead of excellence and performance? Yes, that's the case. They made the priority appearance and lifestyle and not the big deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today.",
      "We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to independent Senator Bernie Sanders from Burlington, Vermont.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "Very quickly, do you have a sense of the impact of these tariffs on your state?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont): Well, it's going to be very severe.",
      "But this is not the only thing that worries me. Margaret, we are living in an unprecedented moment in American history. We're looking at a rapid growth of oligarchy. We're looking at a rapid growth of authoritarianism. And I fear that we're looking at a rapid growth of kleptocracy as well.",
      "And I'm going to do everything I can to work with my supporters all over this country to stand up and fight back to make sure we have an economy that works for everybody\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: \u2026 not just Elon Musk, and that we maintain American democracy. Difficult times.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator \u2013 Senator, I'm going to have to ask you more about what you mean by that on the other side of this commercial break, because I have to take it.",
      "Stay with us. We hope all of you will as well.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation with Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders.",
      "Senator, thank you for sticking with us through the break.",
      "I want to ask you about some of the rather fiery hearings you were a part of this past week, in particular with the potential Health and Human Services secretary to be, RFK Jr. You told CBS in December you think he's right about the food industry and obesity and what he says about high prices for prescription drugs. But during the hearing, you had some sharp exchanges. Are you, at this point, decided on your vote? Will you cross over and help Republicans confirm him?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Well, I have - Margaret, I have up to now voted for some Trump appointee. A few. I voted against most. And I'll make my decisions next week.",
      "Where Kennedy is right is, we are an unhealthy society. A point I've been making, many others have been making for a long time.",
      "One of the things that concerns me very much, and Kennedy mentioned it, is our life expectancy. How long our people live is five years less than other wealthy countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And if you're working class in this countries, you live six or seven years lower than if you are rich. It is an issue we have to deal with. And I think the kind of addictive and poisonous food that the food industry is providing our kids is one of the factors, not many.",
      "But when you have Kennedy come forward and saying he cannot, he believes, continues to believe, that autism is caused by vaccines, despite the fact that there have been a dozen studies over the years which disprove that, when he has other conspiracy theories, when he cannot acknowledge that if you're going to make America healthy, we've got to guarantee health care to all people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: He was not clear about the need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug costs. So, I was not particularly happy with his presentation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the autism point, there is no established cause of autism spectrum disorder, but one in 36 children have been identified with it, according to the CDC.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern in this space, including from your Republican colleague, Cassidy. He is a medical doctor. He said he's struggling with the nomination because he fears Kennedy may undermine faith in vaccines.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): I recognize, man, if you come out unequivocally, vaccines are safe, it does not cause autism, that would have an incredible impact. That's your power. So, what's it going to be? Will it be using the credibility to support lots of articles, or will it be using credibility to undermine?",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The senator seemed to be saying, if you want my vote, answer the question. You said you haven't decided on RFK and how you're going to vote. Is this a red line for you?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, look, I - I don't want - I - I - I - Margaret, what I'm saying is, I just don't go around making these announcements. I will vote when I'll vote. But anybody who watched that hearing understands my deep concerns about Kennedy.",
      "But I've got to tell you, the conspiracy theories that he is throwing out is not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration. And, to me, what is most important in terms of what's been happening since Trump has been president is not just him having the three wealthiest people in the country stand behind him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And, by the way, anybody, any working person in this country should understand what that means. It means that you're going to have a government working for the very rich, not for the working class of this country. But the movement toward authoritarianism -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But -",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, go ahead. I'm sorry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no, I want to ask you about that, but just to push you on this point, because it's not just a matter of a vote, like, what you are saying is that someone at the top of the - the health department who is rejecting science or rejecting data that says there's no linkage here, no proven linkage here, by not being clear and saying that's a red line, doesn't that lend itself to misinterpretation? Why wouldn't you say that's disqualifying for him?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Because I have not said - I have not said to anybody how I will vote. It doesn't matter. I will vote when I'll vote. But let me just tell you -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because Republicans were hoping you would help them.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: The idea that -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why I'm asking you.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I know, they hope for a lot of things. It just may not happen. But I think -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ah -",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: All right, go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead. I'm sorry.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Look, the bottom line is, we have a health care crisis in America. We're the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. We pay by far the highest prices in the world, for prescription drugs. Our life expectancy is shorter than other countries. Yes, we've got to deal with it in a very direct and forceful manner. You've got to take on the insurance companies. You've got to move to Medicare for all. You've got to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We have to understand why our life expectancy is lower.",
      "And, by the way, it's not just health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: It's the fact that so many of our working people are stressed out by inadequate incomes that that's having an impact on not only their life spans but their well-being. Those are issues we've got to address.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: During the campaign, then candidate Trump and Vance, they - they were very much championing working class people, as you have through the years. They said they support unions, they don't want to tax tips, they want child care tax credits, they're pro worker. Do you see any opportunities to work with them on specific policies and, if so, where?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, if they were telling the truth and they will go forward in trying to stand up for the working class, of course I will work with them. But I've got to tell you, just last week what Trump did is essentially neuter the National Labor Relations Board. This is something that Bezos wanted. It's something that Elon Musk wanted. What that means, if you are a worker right now, and there are millions of workers who want to join a union because they know unions will give you better wages and better working conditions, better benefits. What they have done is neutered that so right now union busting corporations, like Amazon and others, can do what they do against workers with impunity. That is not standing with workers. We need to raise the starvation minimum wage, which is now $7.25 an hour, to a living wage. I've not heard one word from the Trump administration about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they want to leave that up to states and corporations as well to - to make a decision, not -",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, but that's - that ain't going to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance told us last Sunday, despite those big tech CEOs giving money to the inauguration for Donald Trump, he still believing they have too much power in big tech and that he says, you know, they're still very much on notice in regard to his past warnings they could be broken up.",
      "Is that a place you are also concerned and could work with him on?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I think Lina Khan, the former head of the FTC, did a great job. And if Vance wants to work with us on that, he's right. You have right now not only more income and wealth inequality in this country than ever before, more concentration of ownership in the tech industry and in other industries. Do I think we should start breaking up some of these large corporations? Absolutely I do. And we'll be happy to work with them if they're serious about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Bernie Sanders, independent from Vermont, thank you for joining us.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The FBI is without a permanent director at this point, although Mr. Trump's nominee, Kash Patel, could get a vote as early as this week.",
      "We turn now to Frank Figliuzzi, he is a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, who joins us from Houston. And here, CBS News justice correspondent Scott Macfarlane.",
      "And you cover justice and FBI. A lot happening in both of the departments. And I want to bottom line first with Frank, if I could, digging into your experience here. If you can help us understand the reporting from Andres Triay and Pat Milton that the executive assistant directors, those in national security, cyber, criminal division, are being forced to resign, retire or face termination. What does it mean to have those positions forced out?",
      "FRANK FIGLIUZZI (Retired FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence and Author of \"The FBI War: Inside the Bureau's Code of Excellence\"): Yes, when you combine that essential layer of leadership, executive assistant directors control multiple operational divisions. So, at least a half a dozen of those reportedly are gone. And then you get down to the level of at least two or three special agents in charge in the field, including Miami, Washington field office. You are starting to lose too much experience. And if this plays out next week as reportedly it might, with regard to dismissing hundreds or thousands of special agents in the field who have touched January 6th cases or Trump related cases, this makes America less safe. This is not reduction, this is not efficiency, it makes America less safe when you lose that much expertise this quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Just to follow up there, Scott Macfarlane, what Frank was referring to is a list that was requested. CBS' Rob Legare actually obtained the memo from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who was previously the personal attorney for Donald Trump.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He ordered the acting director of the FBI to compile everyone who was an employee who was assigned to the 1,500 January 6th cases. There were also eight executives pushed out.",
      "Is this a legal and lawful order? Are FBI officials going to actually fire the people on these lists?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: The list is required, and must be produced by 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time Tuesday according to our latest reporting. Whether it is produced is a different question. But the bottom line here is that such a list, Margaret, would include FBI employees from every FBI field office across the country. This is not just a Washington investigation. The January 6th cases went nationwide.",
      "What's more, a lot of the names that are going to be on this list, according to my reporting, are already public domain. They're in the court filings, they're in the court docket, they're already out there. So, it's going to be difficult to mask anybody's name or anybody's identity.",
      "Whether this is legally permissible is a different question. Whether these firings are legally permissible is a different question. We know the acting FBI director, in a memo sent to his employees, he emphasized that there are robust protections. His word is robust protections for FBI agents against employment actions.",
      "Feels to me like there's an galvanization of FBI employees, if they want to fight this, to try to make some effort to push back. Whether they do so is a different question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why was asking, is it actually going to be firings or is this actually just going to be, you can't do what - what the president's team is pressing to do.",
      "Brian Fitzpatrick, you know him from covering The Hill, he's a Republican from Pennsylvania, used to be an FBI agent, gave CBS a statement I want to read here. He says he wants to emphasize to the administration, \"line level street agents have little to no control over the office to which they're sent, the cases to which they're assigned, and leads which they are asked to cover. Much like the military, they go where they are told and perform the investigative duties that their chain of command orders them to do.\"",
      "Frank, I know you know this, but that is a Republican explaining the basic function of how law enforcement works. It sounds like there's going to be pushback on the potential of these firings.",
      "FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Yes, indeed. It's been reported by multiple media outlets that the acting director pushed back very hard and very loudly against the DOJ request. And reportedly he may have been threatened with termination himself. Interest only enough, both the acting director and acting assistant director would be on that list. They both worked January 6 related cases or Trump related cases. So, we've got a potential standoff that's here.",
      "But yes, line agents did nothing outside of the law or attorney general guidelines. They simply worked criminal cases, in many cases gained convictions and guilty pleas. And if they were literally all to be pushed out the door, we would be talking about thousands of FBI agents. There's only 14,000 agents in the field and we'd be talking close to 6,000 of them who worked such cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Scott, we were just talking about Kash Patel, the boss isn't in place yet. He was asked under oath before Congress if he knew of some of these actions that were underway literally as he was testifying. He said he didn't know anything about the firings. Is this going to - is it credible and is it going to be a problem for his confirmation?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: This might have been simultaneous, Margaret. These questions, including from Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey were happening as a lot of this communication was going back and forth over terminations, resignations, retirements.",
      "Kash Patel has been on a trajectory towards confirmation as the next FBI director almost from the jump. The one vote I've been watching closely, Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican, up for re-election in 2026, he introduced Kash Patel and validated him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: It seems nobody has jumped up this weekend to say, I'm now opposed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott Macfarlane, it's going to be another interesting week in Washington. Thank you for bottom lining it.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still holding and three more hostages were released yesterday, including American Israeli dual national Keith Siegel. His niece, Hanna Siegel, is here with us this morning.",
      "Good morning.",
      "You've been waiting for this for over 400 days. How is your uncle doing?",
      "HANNA SIEGEL (Niece of Freed U.S. Israeli Hostage Keith Siegel): I'm - first, thank you for having me. I've been dreaming about being here today.",
      "He's - he's doing OK. He's - he's lost some weight. He's pale. But he's strong. And he's doing OK. Somehow. We're incredibly grateful.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean we've seen the video and the images of him being reunited with family members. Will your father, his brother, see him soon?",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. Yes. He's on his way. We've been staggering the family visits so as not to overwhelm him. But, yes, we are all - we are all going to see him. And actually his youngest daughter, Shir, got engaged a month before October 7th. And so the wedding planning began and then abruptly came to a stop as both of her parents, Keith and my aunt Aviva (Ph), who was released in the November 2023 deal, were taken hostage. So, what we've talked about is that, you know, someday we're all going to get together and throw an absolutely epic wedding. And that's what we're looking forward to now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you've been an advocate for the family here in Washington, both with the Biden and the Trump administrations. In your view, do you think this deal, this hostage release, would have happened without American pressure?",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: No, definitely not. And I do want to say, so the Biden team, Jake Sullivan, Brett McGurk, President Biden, Secretary Blinken, Bill Burns, they were so tireless in their commit to get this deal done. But the really amazing thing is that the minute that President Trump was elected, his team started working hand in glove with the Biden administration. We felt no break in the commitment to get Keith home. Steve Witkoff and Adam Boehler, along with President Trump, started working hand in hand with the Biden team. And I don't know what other issue you can say that about with these administrations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: The Trump team really did push it over the finish line. And we're incredibly grateful, incredibly grateful to - to all of them for the work that they did.",
      "I also just want to say the Qatari negotiators, mediators, who were part of the November 2023 deal were also instrumental. And then what I've learned in this completely bizarre experience is that there is a whole industry of people, NGOs, who work on hostage negotiations on behalf of families. We worked with Global Reach, Mickey Bergman, Stacia George and Eric Lebson, they're a non-profit. We would not have gotten Keith home without them.",
      "So, it was just a tremendous group effort across the board, across political lines, and that's heartening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You told us back in April on this program that you were worried, quote, \"it's not arguably in Prime Minister Netanyahu's political interest to close a deal\" And you were worried he was going to sink it. He has announced phase two of the hostage framework begins getting negotiated tomorrow, Monday. Do you think he's incentivized now to actually see this deal through?",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: I think that the Trump team has done a really tremendous job of putting serious pressure on him and that that is making a difference. I think that he - you know, we're ecstatic that Keith is home, but it took almost 500 days. And that is in part because of Netanyahu.",
      "This deal was available for months. The Biden team was working on it. And - and he wouldn't come to the table often. I mean there are - this is such a complicated issue, but I am worried - I think this is a really fragile deal, as we all understand. And so, you know, I have a lot of faith in the Trump team and in all of the people working on this to put serious pressure on him to see it through.",
      "I think what we've seen is that diplomacy and political agreement is the only way to get all of the hostages home. And, you know, we're - we're one of the lucky ones, but there remain five American citizens and dozens of other hostages who still need to come home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the remains of some of those Americans wouldn't come through until phase three.",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And phase two, we know, Edan Alexander, a uniformed IDF soldier, who is a U.S. citizen -",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The deal would have to continue to work to actually bring him home. Sagui Chen, we're waiting on him to be released as well.",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: Exactly. Exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I - I emphasize that because when we talk about deals and diplomacy, these are lives at risk. And if the deal doesn't continue to stay in place, they may be at risk.",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: And - and these - and these are Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: These are Americans who need to come home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Hanna, thank you.",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you so much, Margaret.",

      "Vincent had undergone radiation and chemotherapy for bladder cancer and developed complications that included bleeding, said his wife, Christina. He asked that treatment be stopped and died Saturday at a hospital in Vero Beach, Florida.",
      "\"Fay Vincent played a vital role in ensuring that the 1989 Bay Area World Series resumed responsibly following the earthquake prior to Game Three, and he oversaw the process that resulted in the 1993 National League expansion to Denver and Miami,\" current MLB commissioner Robert Manfred said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"Mr. Vincent served the game during a time of many challenges, and he remained proud of his association with our National Pastime throughout his life.  On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my deepest condolences to Fay's family and friends,\" Manfred said.",

      "During his three-year tenure as commissioner, Vincent had a string of what he called \"three-cigar days,\" angering owners by becoming the first management official to admit the collusion among teams against free agents following the 1985, '86 and '87 seasons. He suspended the Yankees' George Steinbrenner, divided expansion fees among both leagues, attempted to force National League realignment and negotiated a settlement that ended a 1990 spring training lockout.",
      "\"I had the conviction that being commissioner was a public trust. I tried to do what I thought was best for the game and the public who cared so much about it,\" Vincent said in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press. \"I had mixed results. Sometimes I'm pleased with what I did. The tragedy of baseball is the single biggest thing I left undone was to build a decent relationship between the owners and the players. I thought somebody would take over after me and get that done. If I died tomorrow, that would be the big regret, is that the players and the owners still have to make some commitment to each other to be partners and to build the game.\"",

      "His first full season as commissioner began after a 32-day spring training lockout. The deal he reached angered owners seeking greater management gains, a group led by Bud Selig of the Milwaukee Brewers and Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox.",
      "In July 1990, Vincent signed an agreement with George Steinbrenner under which the New York Yankees principal owner resigned as managing general partner because of his dealings with a $40,000 payment to a gambler, Howard Spira, to find embarrassing information about outfielder Dave Winfield. Vincent later reinstated Steinbrenner as of 1993.",
      "The following June, Vincent ruled the American League was to receive $42 million of the $190 million in expansion fees due for the National League adding Colorado and Miami in 1993. He also ordered both leagues to supply players equally for the expansion draft and that any future expansion money be divided equally among all clubs.",
      "In July 1992 he ordered NL realignment for the following year, moving the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals to the West Division in 1993, and the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds to the East. The Cubs obtained an injunction in federal court, and the plan was dropped after Vincent's departure.",
      "By mid-August, Selig and Reinsdorf gained enough support to cause AL president Bobby Brown and NL head Bill White to call a special meeting aimed at ousting Vincent. Owners approved a resolution of no confidence in an 18-9 vote on Sept. 3. After a weekend of thought at his home on Cape Cod, Vincent quit four days later, on Labor Day.",
      "\"The commissioner has to look out for the fans, and the owners don't want to hear me speak that idea,\" Vincent said.",
      "Selig was installed as chairman of the executive council, a new position that made him in effect acting commissioner. He led owners through a 7 1/2-month strike in 1994-95, was voted commissioner in 1998 and remained on the job until retiring in 2015.",
      "A longtime Anglophile, Vincent wanted to decompress and rented the Mill House in the Berkshire village of Sutton Courtenay for the first six months of 1993. Living in the home of former British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, Vincent frequently entertained visitors during his sabbatical.",
      "Francis Thomas Vincent Jr. was born May 29, 1938, at Waterbury, Connecticut. His father, Francis, was a football and baseball star at Yale in the 1930s and became a college football official. His mother, the former Alice Lynch, was a housewife.",
      "Vincent was a tackle and center at Williams until he broke his back during his freshman year, falling four floors from an icy ledge outside his dormitory after his roommates locked him out as a prank. His left leg was partially paralyzed and he walked with a cane. Vincent, a Roman Catholic, gave up thoughts of Jesuit training because of the injury. Still, he managed to finish school on time and graduate Phi Beta Kappa.",
      "\"I've been lucky in a lot of ways \u2014 mostly I survived that terrible accident and being paralyzed for so long,\" Vincent said in 2023. \"I can't have any regrets.\"",
      "He went to Yale Law School, started as an associate at Whitman & Ransom in New York in 1963 and stayed there for five years.",
      "In 1968, he moved to Caplin & Drysdale Chartered in Washington and practiced securities law there for almost 10 years, becoming a partner. In March 1978 he quit the firm to become associate director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Corporate Finance. His stay there was rather brief.",
      "Allen, who was two years behind Vincent at Williams, decided that summer to fire Alan J. Hirschfield, Columbia Pictures Industries' CEO. For more than a year, the company had been in turmoil after David Begelman, president of the movie studio, was discovered to have forged checks.",
      "Vincent replaced Hirschfield on July 13 and ran the company so well that Allen & Co. sold it to Coca-Cola Co. in 1982 for $692 million. Vincent was promoted from president to chairman and was named executive vice president of Coca-Cola's new Entertainment Business Sector.",
      "He went to Hollywood only about six times a year and let his production heads \u2014Frank Price, Guy McIlwaine and David Puttnam \u2014 make the artistic decisions. While Vincent ran the company, Columbia released \"Ghostbusters,\" \"The Big Chill,\" \"Gandhi\" and \"Tootsie.\"",
      "Still, he remained devoted to baseball.",
      "\"He talked about baseball every day,\" Allen said. \"A couple of times I went with him to Mets' opening day.\"",
      "On Sept. 1, 1987, Coca-Cola bought Tri-Star Pictures and Tri-Star's Victor A. Kaufman replaced Vincent, who was reassigned to oversee equity investments in Coca-Cola Bottling's properties. Vincent quit in 1988 and went to Caplin & Drysdale's New York office as a partner. Before he settled in, Giamatti asked him to join baseball.",
      "\"I'd always been a baseball fan,\" Vincent said then. \"I've followed baseball as long as I can remember.\"",
      "In one of his lasting acts as commissioner, he chaired an eight-member committee for statistical accuracy, which removed the asterisk that had been next to Roger Maris' entry as the season home run leader and deleted 50 no-hitters. The group defined a no-hitter as games of nine innings or more that ended with no hits.",
      "He recorded interviews with Hall of Fame members and Negro Leagues players for an oral history project that led to three books: \"The Only Game in Town\" (2006), \"We Would Have Played for Nothing\" (2009) and \"It's What's Inside the Lines That Counts\" (2010). In 2024, he made a $2 million gift to Yale to endow the Yale baseball coach's position in the name of his father.",
      "Vincent married the former Valerie McMahon in 1965 and they had a daughter Anne and twin sons William, and Edward. They divorced in 1994 and he married Christina Watkins in 1998.",

      "Ashley White, 29, was found guilty of second-degree murder and other charges in connection with the 2020 death of her boyfriend, 28-year-old Cody DeLisa, Adams County District Attorney Brian Mason\u00a0announced this week. White was arrested in August 2020 after DeLisa was found shot to death inside their home in Commerce City, CBS Colorado reported at the time.",
      "In the months leading up to the murder, White and DeLisa had a \"volatile and strained relationship,\" in part because DeLisa had often criticized his girlfriend for being unable to secure a full-time job, according to the district attorney's office. Authorities say White grew so frustrated with DeLisa that she even tried to drown and burn his cat.",
      "On Aug. 13, 2020, authorities say White attended a job interview in Denver. On the bus ride home, DeLisa \"expressed skepticism about her chances of getting the job, which upset White.\"",
      "White met a stranger on the bus who introduced himself as \"Scott\" and after talking about DeLisa's alleged abusive behavior, they devised a plan to kill DeLisa, the DA's office said.",
      "After getting off the bus, authorities say, they walked to the home were White and DeLisa lived. A short time later, DeLisa was shot twice in the head, and his body was discovered the next day.",
      "Authorities did not explicitly identify who pulled the trigger but said the pair practiced firing Scott's gun before the murder.",
      "White and Scott allegedly stole DeLisa's wallet after the murder and spent the next few days in the area before Scott left, and White told authorities she never saw him again. White was later identified as a suspect and was arrested and charged.",
      "Three years after the killing, authorities made another breakthrough in the case. In 2023, a woman who identified herself as the girlfriend of Michael Stratton contacted the district attorney's office and said her boyfriend had confessed to being involved in DeLisa's killing.",
      "Authorities say her description matched White's account of the crime. Stratton had been arrested for a separate murder that happened after DeLisa's death. Authorities said Stratton was deemed incompetent to stand trial in that case, and he has not been charged in connection with DeLisa's murder.",
      "White's trial began on Jan. 6, and after about three weeks of testimony, the jury found her guilty of second-degree murder, conspiracy to commit second-degree murder and robbery.",
      "\"This was a tragic and senseless murder and Ashley White bears significant culpability for it,\" said District Attorney Brian Mason. \"Her callous actions led to the victim's death and now she will pay a significant price.\"",

      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, said Sunday that he was \"not particularly happy\" with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presentation before Senate committees last week, though he would not say how he plans to vote on Kennedy's nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "\"I will vote when I'll vote. But anybody who watched that hearing understands my deep concerns about Kennedy,\" Sanders said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats, is the ranking member on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee and also sits on the Senate Finance Committee, which Kennedy appeared before last week. The Finance Committee announced Sunday that it will vote on whether to advance RFK's nomination Tuesday.",
      "The Vermont independent outlined where he thinks Kennedy is right, pointing to his comments about the nation being unhealthy, about life expectancy relative to other wealthy countries and issues with the food industry. But he stressed that Kennedy \"continues to believe that autism is caused by vaccines,\" and was not aligned with him on issues like universal healthcare and targeting the pharmaceutical industry to lower prescription drug prices.",
      "Sanders also argued that \"the conspiracy theories\" that Kennedy has entertained are \"not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration.\"",
      "The comments come after Kennedy was grilled on his vaccine stance, among other things, during the hearings last week, as his advancement out of committee \u2014 and confirmation by the Senate more broadly \u2014 remains in question.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said he's been \"struggling\" with Kennedy's nomination due to concerns he may undermine faith in vaccines. And without support from Democrats and independents on the committee, Cassidy's opposition could tank a favorable recommendation for Kennedy. In a floor vote before the full Senate, Republicans can lose just three votes to confirm Kennedy without support across the aisle.",

      "The family members of the victims of the deadliest U.S. air disaster in nearly 25 years visited the crash site on Sunday just outside of Washington, D.C.",
      "Ten charter buses with a police escort transported the family members to the banks of the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport, close to where an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided Wednesday, killing all 67 aboard.",
      "Meanwhile, federal investigators are working to piece together the events that led to the crash and recovery crews are set to pull more wreckage from the chilly water.",
      "The American Airlines flight, with 64 people on board was preparing to land from Wichita, Kansas. The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a training mission and had three soldiers on board. Both aircraft plunged into the Potomac River after colliding.",
      "The plane's passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip.",
      "Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O'Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Cpt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were killed in the helicopter.",
      "The remains of 42 people had been pulled from the river as of Saturday afternoon, including 38 that have been positively identified, officials said. They expect to recover all of the remains, though the plane's fuselage will probably have to be pulled from the water to get the rest.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said Saturday that preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the airliner and the Army helicopter.",
      "Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet's flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.",
      "Data from the jet's flight recorder showed its altitude as 325 feet (99 meters), plus or minus 25 feet (7.6 meters), when the crash happened Wednesday night, NTSB officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the Black Hawk at 200 feet (61 meters), the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in the area.",
      "The discrepancy has yet to be explained.",
      "\"Our preliminary review of what the tower cab was showing on the data screen that would have been in front of the controllers, was 200 feet near the time of the accident,\" NTSB member Todd Inman said on Saturday.",
      "Investigators said they hoped to reconcile the difference with data from the helicopter's black box, which is taking more time to retrieve because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the Potomac. They also said they plan to refine the tower data, which can be less reliable.",
      "\"That's what our job is, to figure that out,\" Inman said.",
      "\"This is a complex investigation,\" investigator in charge Brice Banning said. \"There are a lot of pieces here. Our team is working hard to gather this data.\"",
      "Banning said the jet's cockpit voice recorder captured sound moments before the crash.",
      "\"The crew had a verbal reaction,\" Banning said, and the flight data recorder showed \"the airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of impact were audible about one second later, followed by the end of the recording.\"",
      "Full NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.",
      "Investigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller, a supervisor and supervisor in training.",
      "\"This is a controller's worst nightmare,\" said Inman. \"It hits everyone that works in that cab and knows them very hard. These interviews take a long time because there are several breaks that occur for emotions, just to be able to compose themselves to talk about what happened.\"",
      "According to an FAA report obtained by The Associated Press, one controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically combines them at 9:30 p.m., once traffic slows down. On Wednesday, the tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called \"not normal.\"",
      "\"Staffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem for years and years,\" Duffy said, promising that President Trump's administration would address shortages with \"bright, smart, brilliant people in towers controlling airspace.\"",
      "Wednesday's crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. The crash killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground.",

Many booed the U.S. national anthem in an uncharacteristic show of frustration after more than 150 years of peaceful, friendly relations along the vast border separating the neighbors.",

Fruits and fruit juices including orange juice, along with vegetables, perfume, clothing and shoes. It will include major consumer products like household appliances, furniture and sports equipment, and materials like lumber and plastics, along with much, much more.\"",
      "\"Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada,\" Trudeau added to his own constituents in a post on social media. \"Check the labels. Let's do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.\"",
      "The first round of Canada's tariffs will kick in at the stroke of midnight on Monday evening \u2013 on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods. In 21 days, the remainder of the tariffs, covering an additional $125 billion worth of products, will kick in unless some new agreement is reached between the countries. The delay, said Trudeau, was aimed at giving Canadian companies time to seek supply chain options to soften the financial blow.",
      "Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Canada's Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman said many people in her country \"just don't understand where this is coming from... and probably, there's a little bit of hurt.\"",
      "Mexico:",

      "China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement over the weekend saying Beijing was \"strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes\" the new 10% tariffs, that the U.S.'s \"unilateral increase in tariffs seriously violates WTO rules,\" and that China \"will file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization and take corresponding countermeasures,\" which implies Beijing will impose 10% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S.-made goods.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "In a Sunday statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't drop any hints as to what measures might be coming, but it said called \"on the United States to correct its wrongdoings, maintain the hard-won positive dynamics in the counternarcotics cooperation, and promote a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship.\"",
      "The ministry said the U.S. should \"view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way,\" rather than \"threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was imposing the new 10% tariff on Chinese goods in part due to what he considers Beijing's failure to stem the flow of fentanyl and chemicals used to make the drug.",
      "The foreign ministry in Beijing said China was \"one of the world's toughest countries on counternarcotics, both in terms of policy and its implementation.\"",
      "The European Union:",
      "Mr. Trump said over the weekend that tariffs on the European Union were coming, but he did not say when or how steep they would be.",
      "\"It will definitely happen with the European Union. I can tell you that because they've really taken advantage of us,\" the U.S. president told reporters Sunday. \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them.\"",
      "European leaders were meeting Monday in Brussels, where they were discussing how to collectively address the threat.",
      "\"We were listening carefully to those words, and of course we are preparing also on our side,\" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Monday in Brussels, adding a warning that \"there are no winners in trade wars.\"",

      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the leader of Europe's biggest economy, Germany, said the EU was strong enough to take the blow and respond to any U.S. tariffs, but added that \"the goal should be that things result in cooperation\" within Europe.",
      "For a quick fact check on Mr. Trump's criticism: He's not wrong about the lop-sided trade relationship between the U.S. and its close allies across the Atlantic. Through November 2024, the EU ran a trade deficit of $78 billion with the U.S., according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and reports indicate that's on track to be a new record.",
      "The question many economic analysts and politicians across the world will keep asking, however, is whether huge tariffs taxing that trade are likely to help balance the books.",
      "The United Kingdom:",
      "Speaking to reporters early on Monday, Mr. Trump said \"the U.K. is out of line but\u2026 I think that one can be worked out,\" suggesting his administration was at least willing to negotiate with London over a new bilateral trade deal.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and stressed that he wants \"a strong trading relationship\" with the U.S., but the U.K. leader, five years after the \"Brexit\" withdrawal from the European Union, may now find himself caught between the formidable trade forces of the EU on his doorstep and Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs on the EU and his looming, if tempered threat to hit Britain with the same will complicate Starmer's nascent efforts to \"reset\" U.K. trade ties with the EU. He's at the helm of the U.K.'s first Labour Party government in a decade and a half, and it was the former Conservative leadership that ushered in Brexit and soured the long-standing close ties with Europe.",
      "Starmer has moved cautiously as he sets out to mend fences with the EU, wary of riling up conservative voters who supported Brexit and who, to some degree, now support populist politicians such as the Trump-aligned, anti-immigration leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister has ruled out rejoining the EU customs union or its single currency market, and he's so far resisted pressure from the continent to ease post-Brexit restrictions on U.K. and EU citizens living and working on either side of the border, at least for young people.",
      "But he still needs to get U.K.-EU trade moving again, and the extent to which he chooses to keep the bloc next door at arm's length, or to try to reinstate the close trade ties of before Brexit, could directly impact his chances of nailing down a favorable new trade agreement with Washington.",
      "Speaking Monday, a spokesperson for Starmer's government called the U.K.'s trade relationship with the U.S. \"fair and balanced,\" calling Washington \"an indispensable ally and one of our closest trading partners.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. Agency for International Development is on the cusp of being shuttered, according to the Trump administration's billionaire adviser and X, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who's been wrestling for control of the agency in recent days.",
      "Early Monday, Musk held a live session on X Spaces, previously known as Twitter Spaces, and said he'd spoken in detail about USAID with President Trump. \"He agreed we should shut it down,\" Musk said.",
      "\"It became apparent that its not an apple with a worm it in,\" Musk said. \"What we have is just a ball of worms. You've got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It's beyond repair. ... We're shutting it down.\"",
      "Matt Hopson, who was recently appointed USAID chief of staff by Mr. Trump, resigned Sunday, according to two current USAID staffers. There was no mass email about it. The staffers said it happened after his involvement, alongside the two other security staffers, in blocking DOGE officials from getting access over the weekend.",
      "USAID staffers were instructed to stay out of the agency's Washington headquarters on Monday, according to a notice distributed to them. Staffers said they tracked 600 employees who reported being locked out of the agency's computer systems overnight. Those still in the system received emails saying that \"at the direction of Agency leadership\" the headquarters building \"will be closed to Agency personnel on Monday, Feb. 3.\"",
      "On Monday morning, staffers came by the agency's annex to get their belongings, but the turnstiles had been turned off and they were escorted from the building.",
      "USAID oversees humanitarian, development and security programs in about 120 countries around the world.\u00a0 According to the nonpartisan\u00a0Congressional Research Service, USAID \"provides assistance to strategically important countries and countries in conflict; leads U.S. efforts to alleviate poverty, disease, and humanitarian need; and assists U.S. commercial interests by supporting developing countries' economic growth.\"",

      "Sources said the move came after the two USAID officials refused to allow personnel from the Musk-run Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to access classified material in restricted areas. This was first reported by\u00a0The Associated Press\u00a0on Sunday.",
      "Musk's DOGE crew lacked high enough security clearance to access that information, so the two USAID officials believed themselves legally obligated to deny access, the AP reported.",
      "DOGE personnel did eventually gain access Saturday to the aid agency's classified information, which includes intelligence reports, the former official told the AP.",

      "Musk on Sunday responded to an X post about the news by saying, \"USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die.\" He followed with additional posts on X about the aid agency.",
      "This comes a day after DOGE carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining access to sensitive information including the Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems. The Washington Post reported that a senior Treasury official had resigned over Musk's team accessing sensitive information.",
      "Musk formed DOGE in cooperation with the Trump administration with the stated goal of finding ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations.",

      "Rep. Brian Mast, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, suggested Sunday\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that USAID could \"likely\" be \"rolled more closely\" under the State Department, though it already reports to the Secretary of State.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 06:39:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Keith Siegel, a 65-year-old dual U.S.-Israeli national, is the first American to be released since the Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect.",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0American-Israeli dual national Keith Siegel was among three hostages released by Hamas militants in the war-torn Gaza Strip on Saturday, more than 15 months after they were taken captive by the group during its Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack. Siegel was freed in Gaza City about two hours after Israelis Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon were released in the southern city of Khan Younis.",
      "The Israeli military confirmed that all three hostages were in its care and back in Israel after first being handed over to Red Cross personnel in Gaza. Siegel appeared to have lost weight during his captivity, but he waved and smiled as Hamas militants prepared to hand him over to Red Cross staff. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said the three freed men would be reunited with family members and taken for medical checks and care at hospitals in Israel.",
      "Both handovers were conducted quickly Saturday and without the chaos seen during the previous, third prisoner exchange, which angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who delayed the corresponding Israeli release of Palestinian prisoners by several hours.",
      "Israel was expected to free about 90 more Palestinians from its prisons on Saturday in exchange for the release of the three hostages, as stipulated in the ceasefire agreement that took effect on January 19.",
      "Keith Siegel is 1st American freed during new ceasefire",
      "Originally from North Carolina, Siegel moved to Israel four decades ago. He was among seven American citizens taken as hostages into Gaza during Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7 attack, which saw militants kill around 1,200 people in southern Israel and take 251 others captive.",
      "Israel's military assault on Hamas in response has killed more than 47,400 people, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Ministry of Health, left entire neighborhoods leveled and caused a humanitarian catastrophe by displacing virtually the entire enclave's population and destroying its infrastructure.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Saturday that Americans are celebrating the return of Siegel.",
      "\"President Trump and his administration have worked diligently to secure their release and are committed to freeing all remaining hostages,\" she said.",
      "It is believed that at least two of the six American hostages still held in Gaza are alive \u2014 Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, who grew up in Bloomfield, Connecticut, and Edan Alexander, 19, from Tenafly, New Jersey. Four other Americans are believed to have been killed in captivity.",
      "Siegel's wife Aviva was also taken hostage by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, but was released in an earlier hostage and prisoner swap in November 2023.",
      "Speaking to CBS News about a year after her release, Aviva Siegel said there were moments as Hamas militants forced her and her husband through tunnels under the Gaza Strip that they felt \"sure we were going to die.\"",
      "Yarden Bibas, 35, is the husband of Shiri Bibas, who was taken from their kibbutz with her two young children Ariel and Kfir during the terrorist attack. Hamas claimed just weeks after the attack that Shiri and her two children were killed in an Israeli bombing in Gaza.",
      "In a TV interview about a year later, then-Israeli government minister Benny Gantz indicated that officials knew what had happened to the Bibas family, but said he could not provide details. The fact that, under the terms of the ceasefire deal, Hamas has released women and children before male hostages, suggested the rest of Yarden Bibas' family was indeed dead.",
      "Ofer Calderon, 54, was among five members of his family seized by Hamas militants from their kibbutz near the Gaza border on Oct. 7, 2023. His two children were released during the ceasefire in November of that year, but two of his cousins were killed.",
      "Rafah crossing into Egypt reopened",
      "A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing through Gaza's Rafah crossing into Egypt for treatment on Saturday, the Associated Press reported. It marked the first opening of the border since Israel captured Gaza nearly nine months ago.",
      "Israel agreed to reopen the crossing after Hamas released the last living female hostages in Gaza.",
      "Egyptian television showed a Palestinian Red Cross ambulance pulling up to the crossing gate, and several children were brought out on stretchers and transferred to ambulances on the Egyptian side, the AP reported. Gaza's Health Ministry said around 60 family members were accompanying the children.",
      "Rafah is Gaza's only crossing that does not enter into Israel. It was closed by Israeli forces in early May after it was seized during an offensive on the southern city. Egypt shut down its side of the crossing in protest.",
      "Mohammed Zaqout, the director of hospitals in Gaza's Health Ministry, told the AP that more than 6,000 patients were ready to be evacuated abroad and more than 12,000 patients urgently needed treatment. He said the small numbers set to be evacuated will not cover the need, \"and we hope the number will increase.\"",
      "What has the ceasefire accomplished and what comes next?",
      "Hamas is expected to free a total of 33 Israeli hostages during the first, six-week phase of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, which took effect on January 19. After the release on Saturday, 18 have been freed so far. With each release of Israeli hostages, scores of Palestinians have been freed from Israeli prisons, with roughly 30 being set free for every hostage returned to Israel alive.",
      "Phase one of the deal was to see all Israeli women, children and male hostages over the age of 50 released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, in addition to a dramatically increased flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza and the partial withdrawal of Israeli forces from some areas of the territory.",
      "On the 16th day of the ceasefire, which would be Monday, negotiations to establish the steps for the second phase are meant to begin, according to a draft of the agreement shared with CBS News by a senior Hamas official.",
      "There have been a few moments where it appeared the fragile agreement could fall apart, including when hostage Arbel Yehoud was not released as Israel said she should have been in one of the first exchanges. Quick negotiations led to a resolution of the dispute, and Yehoud was among those freed by militants in Gaza in the third exchange on Thursday.",
      "\"Any deal that takes two or three months to end a war is a bad deal, because it can go off the rails at any point, and at any point either one of the sides can accuse the other of breaching,\" Israeli analyst and former hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"We've already had mutual accusations of breach. Right now, both sides are interested in at least bringing this forward to the end of the 42 days\" of phase one, Baskin said.",
      "Baskin, who has extensive experience negotiating with Hamas, cautioned that \"you couldn't have the two parties further apart\" ahead of the expected negotiations over the second phase of the deal.",
      "\"What we hear from the Israeli side is that they will not end the war or withdraw from Gaza, and what we hear from Hamas is that there is no deal unless it ends the war and brings about an Israeli withdrawal,\" he said.",
      "But Baskin added that the new Trump administration in the U.S. would likely play an integral role in determining how the negotiations actually go.",
      "\"I think it's all on the shoulders of Trump,\" Baskin told CBS News. \"If Trump is determined that this will take place, Netanyahu cannot go against him. Netanyahu may try to create some kind of provocation, leading Hamas to breach the ceasefire, in which case Israel will say to the Americans, 'They breached it and now we have to go back to war.' If Trump says yes, then that's the end. If Trump says 'no, you can't go back to war,' then we will move into phase two.\"",

      "Two top security officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development have been placed on administrative leave, the latest in a series of suspensions and layoffs at the American government's primary humanitarian aid agency.",
      "President Trump is considering dramatic changes to USAID, as advisers examine where there's overlap with other agencies or where its spending runs counter to the president's stances.",
      "USAID Director for Security John Vorhees and Deputy Director for Security Brian McGill were put on leave Saturday night, two sources confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Two sources told the Associated Press that move came after the two officials refused to allow personnel from the Elon Musk-run Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to access classified material in restricted areas. DOGE spokesperson Katie Miller did not respond to requests for comment, but did repost the AP article on X with the comment, \"No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance is in charge of figuring out next steps for USAID reform, per one person familiar with Trump's decision. A spokesperson for Vance declined to comment.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday night upon returning to Washington, D.C., from Palm Beach, Florida, that USAID has been run by \"a bunch of radical lunatics.\"",
      "\"We're getting them out,\" he said, \"and then we'll make a decision.\"",
      "No executive order was imminent \u2014 officials are still in the planning phase, sources said last week. But the president is interested in reforming the agency, they said.",
      "One option is to possibly fold it into the State Department, but other possibilities are on the table, two sources told CBS News.",
      "Republican Rep. Brian Mast, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which provides oversight of the State Department, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that USAID is \"likely going to be rolled more closely under Secretary Rubio.\" USAID already reports to the Secretary of State but the Trump administration is looking at ways to combine it or fold it into the State Department.",
      "Mast did not detail what specific changes will be made but indicated that he intends to initiate changes via Congress as well. USAID was established in 1961 by an act of Congress.",
      "\"I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department, and having it fall under whether the other parts of the United States, Department of State, because of its failure,\" Mast claimed on \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "CBS previously reported that the person heading up the efforts to reshape USAID is Pete Marocco, a former deputy assistant secretary of African Affairs at the Pentagon. Marocco is now serving in a senior directing role in the State Department's Foreign Assistance Office, which oversees foreign assistance programs administered by the State Department and USAID.",
      "Freezing foreign aid was a Trump campaign promise to only support efforts that serve America's national security interest and to cut costs. However, foreign aid makes up just 1% of the federal budget.",
      "U.S. foreign aid agencies almost never directly implement aid programs, choosing to partner with non-governmental organizations, public international organizations, and sometimes foreign governments to carry them out. The Trump administration's 90-day freeze on almost all foreign aid means that these contractors are not being paid for work already in progress.",
      "With no indication that the aid freeze will be lifted soon, contractors are furloughing and/or terminating employees en masse.",
      "An aid worker with contracts around the world told CBS that organizations are expecting to face lawsuits in foreign countries from governments who consider them in breach.",
      "USAID viewed by some Trump officials as too influenced by \"woke\" politics",
      "Some top officials in the Trump administration view USAID, created by President John F. Kennedy to counter Cold War geopolitics, as an agency that has become overly influenced by left-wing and \"woke\" politics. They had privately voiced concerns that it hasn't had enough oversight, including from Congress.",
      "Some in the administration, including Musk, have argued that Trump should shut USAID down altogether. On Sunday, Musk posted on his social media platform X: \"USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die.\"",
      "But not all of Trump's top advisors agree with Musk, multiple sources said.",
      "USAID website goes dark, multiple aid agencies say they are hobbled by funding freeze",
      "The USAID website went offline on Saturday, and remained inaccessible on Sunday. Dozens of employees in the legislative and public affairs offices at the agency suddenly lost system and email access on Saturday night, three sources told CBS News.",
      "Trump officials want to look into ways to streamline programs with a footprint in more than one government agency. USAID also contracts with multiple non-profits to implement programs.",
      "As the Trump administration weighs restructuring USAID, the humanitarian aid program that does everything from funding polio and malaria eradication efforts overseas to emergency response to natural disasters, and removing old U.S. bombs from battlefields, aid organizations told CBS News that they are already preparing to lay off thousands of U.S. based aid workers this week.",
      "Multiple aid organizations told CBS News that they are hobbled by Trump's funding freeze as contractors front money for projects and then apply for reimbursement from the U.S. government. As a result, the stop work order issued by Secretary of State Marco Rubio triggered financial crises at these international organizations who are also unable to receive backpay for work already performed, multiple aid organizations told CBS news.",
      "Tom Hart, President and CEO of InterAction told CBS News that even after Rubio issued waivers to some organizations, the changes have not resulted in a flow of funds.",
      "\"The current reality is life-saving medications expiring on shelves while children fall ill. Food aid rotting in warehouses while families go hungry. This isn't just a humanitarian catastrophe\u2014it's an unconscionable waste of taxpayer resources that undermines America's investments in global stability and human dignity.\"",
      "\"This disruption is upending relationships built with communities over the last 60 years\u2014relationships the Administration may find hard to restore after its review,\" Hart said.",
      "The Trump administration has disrupted operations at organizations that also seem to be consistent with the America First agenda and efforts to stem illegal migration to the U.S. CBS News obtained a list of 13 organizations in El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala whose efforts are aimed at countering factors that drive migration. In El Salvador, the Skills for Employment project helps some 12,000 Salvadorans get jobs so they don't migrate to the U.S. In Honduras, Effective Justice combats organizedf crime networks. In Colombia, the Venezuelan response ensures migrants do not migrate illegally to the U.S.",
      "Concerns over PEPFAR",
      "Another program, PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, received a waiver to resume specific types of operations within their broad portfolio of AIDS relief and HIV services, three sources confirmed this weekend to CBS News. Health officials indicated\u00a0 that they are still waiting to see how narrowly the services will be defined including the question of whether it will include preventative treatments. Former aid officials shared concerns that global health programs are not yet turned back on, including those aimed at preventing malaria and tuberculosis.",
      "\"This is not a pause, it is a demolition,\" Atul Gawande, former USAID Global Health Director, told CBS News. \"You cannot pause a flight in midair, that's what they're trying to do.\"",
      "The Trump administration has stipulated the review is to last 90 days but the stop work order from Rubio immediately ceased operations for many organizations. Since the freeze is taking place while the review is being conducted, it has caused an immediate disruption with real world impact such as disruption of anti-viral medication to HIV positive individuals, including children.",
      "\"There was a release of that hold that was put, that was authorized, but it shouldn't be the case that the American people fund HIV and AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa, where many of these countries are working very directly with our adversaries, like China,\" Mast told \"Face the Nation,\" confirming portions of PEPFAR had resumed. But he referred to it as a \"grift\" and raised questions about its fate.",
      "\"That is an example of them taking us for granted,\" Mast said. \"We need to be asking the question, should they be weaning off of this, should we be paying for these very expensive HIV and AIDS drugs?\"",
      "But these efforts have been deemed in U.S. national security interests by multiple presidents, and a type of \"soft power\" that wins goodwill for the U.S. in the competition for influence against adversaries. It is now China, but during the Cold War when the established the prime competition was the Soviet Union, USAID efforts were effective in Eastern Europe and elsewhere.",
      "CBS News reported last week\u00a0that roughly 450 contractors were terminated from the Bureau for Global Health, which is responsible for overseeing the implementation of PEPFAR. More federal employees in the Global Health bureau have since been placed on administrative leave, raising concerns about how these programs will be implemented, despite the foreign assistance waiver for HIV/AIDS programs.",

      "Rubio, the first Latino secretary of state, made the trip in part to reiterate President Trump's concern that China has too much influence over the Panama Canal, and needs control of the waterway for economic security, though Mulino has refuted the claim. Rubio toured the canal on Sunday and doubled down on the administration's plan to make immediate changes, according to his office spokesperson, Tammy Bruce.",
      "\"Secretary Rubio also emphasized the importance of collaborative efforts to end the hemisphere's illegal migration crisis and thanked President Mulino for his support of a joint repatriation program, which has reduced illegal migration through the Darien Gap,\" Bruce said in a statement.",

      "The Panama Canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. And although the U.S. led the construction of the major waterway that around 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic now moves through, its control was given to Panama in 1999.",
      "In the meeting, Rubio told the Panamanian leader that Mr. Trump has determined that China's influence on the Panama Canal is \"a threat to the canal and represents a violation of the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump on Saturday signed an executive order that imposes 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which come after months of threatening to do so as he seeks to leverage trade policy even against some of the U.S.' largest economic allies.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged Sunday that there may be \"some pain\" with the tariffs in a social media post. But he argued that \"it will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "The tariffs come in part to curb the flow of undocumented immigrants, as well as illicit drugs, into the U.S. And Rubio's first overseas visit to Central America and the Caribbean, of which Panama is the initial stop, also comes as the Trump administration seeks cooperation on its immigration policy from nearby countries, like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, criticized the president's move on Sunday, saying in an appearance on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the tariffs are \"going to end up costing consumers,\" with increased prices on goods from avocados and beer to cars and trucks.",

      "He has been a staunch supporter of Israel but has also pledged to end wars in the Middle East and took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire agreement.",
      "The deal has halted the fighting and led to the release of 18 hostages who had been held for over 15 months, as well as hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.",
      "An Israeli airstrike on a vehicle in central Gaza wounded five people on Sunday, including a child who was in critical condition, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military said it fired upon the vehicle because it was bypassing a checkpoint while heading north in violation of the ceasefire agreement. The military said it remains committed to the deal.",
      "The war began when thousands of Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostages. Over 100 hostages were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023, eight have been rescued alive and dozens of bodies have been recovered by Israeli forces.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 21:37:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The young woman is believed to have been part of the Mante\u00f1o people, who lived along the Ecuadorian coast and survived by agriculture and seafaring.",
    "story": [
      "A pregnant woman believed to have lived over a thousand years ago in Ecuador's coastal region may have been part of ritual sacrifice or punishment, according to archaeologists who excavated her remains in 2022.",
      "In a study published last month by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the\u00a0Society for American Archaeology, experts detailed their analysis of the remains of the young woman, dubbed Burial 10, which dated between AD 771 and AD 953. She was approximately 17 to 20 years old at the time of her death, and her hands and left leg were removed at or near the time of her death, researchers said.",
      "Archaeologists found that her burial is significant because she was pregnant at the time. The young woman's remains showed a cranial fracture and cut marks on her hand bones, which led them to hypothesize that she may have been sacrificed.",
      "\"Perimortem trauma, including a cranial fracture and cutmarks on hand bones, perimortem removal of the hands and left leg, and other body manipulation suggest she was sacrificed, a rare event for coastal Ecuadorian peoples,\" researchers wrote.",
      "Although human sacrifice in coastal Ecuador is rare, the positioning of the body and missing limbs suggest possible ritual significance, the study said.",
      "Her eyes were covered with two ark clam shells. There was a large green clay stone nearby and several ceramic fragments on her forehead, according to the study. Crescent-shaped spondylus mascaras, or mollusk shells, were found around the body.",
      "She was also buried with spondylus pendants and beads, known as chaquira, from various cultural traditions and periods.",
      "The woman is believed to be part of the Mante\u00f1o people, who lived along the Ecuadorian coast and survived by agriculture and seafaring, but the eye coverings were not consistent with typical Mante\u00f1o burials, researchers said. The green stone represented a link between death and fertility for Valdivian burials, a different group of coastal people which predated the Mante\u00f1o by nearly 2,000 years, according to experts. Mascaras were also typically linked to practices of Valdivians.",
      "\"To accumulate so many artifacts required purposeful collection and curation before inclusion in this burial,\" the study said. \"Interpretation of this burial must ultimately consider these repeated emphases and ties to the past to understand the reasons for this enigmatic burial.\"",
      "The burial also included a burnt offering placed in the thoracic cavity, researchers said. However, such rituals have been found to occur later between AD 991-1025, which would indicate that the woman's grave was revisited and possibly used for other rituals.",

    "summary": "President Trump and his envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, announced the release of the six men on social media.",
    "story": [
      "Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela in recent months were freed by the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro after he met Friday with a Trump administration official tasked with urging the authoritarian leader to take back deported migrants who have committed crimes in the United States.",
      "President Trump and his envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, announced the release of the six men on social media. The visit by Grenell came as a shock to many Venezuelans who hoped that Mr. Trump would continue the \"maximum pressure\" campaign he pursued against Maduro during his first term.",
      "Grenell later posted a photo of the six Americans aboard a flight headed back to the U.S.",
      "Grenell's hourslong trip to Venezuela, according to the White House, was focused on Mr. Trump's efforts to deport Venezuelans back to their home country, which currently does not accept them, and on the release of the detained Americans.",
      "\"We are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens,\" Grenell posted on X along with a photo showing him and the men aboard an aircraft. \"They just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and they couldn't stop thanking him.\"",
      "The meeting in Venezuela's capital took place less than a month after Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost last year's election. The U.S. government, along with several other Western nations, does not recognize Maduro's claim to victory and instead points to tally sheets collected by the opposition coalition showing that its candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, won by a more than a two-to-one margin.",
      "Venezuelan state television aired footage of Grenell and Maduro speaking in the Miraflores Palace and said the meeting had been requested by the U.S. government.",
      "Signing an executive order in the Oval Office on Friday, Mr. Trump was asked if Grenell being filmed meeting with Maduro lent legitimacy to an administration that the Trump White House hasn't officially recognized.",
      "\"No. We want to do something with Venezuela. I've been a very big opponent of Venezuela and Maduro,\" Trump responded. \"They've treated us not so good, but they've treated, more importantly, the Venezuelan people, very badly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump added that Grenell is \"meeting with a lot of different people, but we're for the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "Some Republicans criticized the visit.",
      "\"This is terrible timing,\" said Elliott Abrams, who served as special envoy to Venezuela and Iran during the first Trump administration. \"A meeting with Maduro will be used by him to legitimize his rule and show that the Americans recognize him as president. If the purpose is to deliver a tough message about migration issues, the president could've done that himself. There was no need to send someone to Caracas.\"",
      "The dispute over the election results sparked nationwide protests. More than 2,200 people were arrested during and after the demonstrations.",
      "Among those detained are as many as 10 Americans who the government has linked to alleged plots to destabilize the country. Neither the White House nor Maduro's government immediately released the names of the six who were freed Friday.",
      "A nonprofit group that had advocated for the release of a detainee said David Estrella, a 62-yer-old who was last heard from in September, was among those on their way back to the U.S. Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello had accused Estrella of being part of an alleged plot to assassinate Maduro.",
      "The Trump administration has taken a slew of actions to make good on promises to crack down on illegal immigration and carry out the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history.",
      "Those measures include the revocation earlier this week of a Biden administration decision that would have protected roughly 600,000 people from Venezuela from deportation, putting some at risk of being removed from the country in about two months.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Friday that Mr. Trump had instructed Grenell to \"identify a place and ensure that repatriation flights\" carrying Venezuelans, including members of the Tren de Aragua criminal organization, \"land in Venezuela.\" She said Mr. Trump also ordered Grenell to \"ensure that all U.S. detainees in Venezuela are returned home.\"",
      "Trump wrote Saturday on his social media site Truth Social that he was happy to have the Americans back home.",
      "\"And very important to note, that Venezuela has agreed to receive, back into their Country, all Venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the U.S., including gang members of Tren de Aragua. Venezuela has further agreed to supply the transportation back,\" he wrote. \"We are in the process of removing record numbers of illegal aliens from all Countries, and all Countries have agreed to accept these illegal aliens back.\"",
      "More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left their home country since 2013, when its economy unraveled and Maduro first took office. Most settled in Latin America and the Caribbean, but after the pandemic, migrants increasingly set their sights on the U.S.",
      "Venezuelans' desire for better living conditions and their rejection of Maduro are expected to keep pushing people to emigrate.",
      "Ahead of the presidential election last year, a nationwide poll by Venezuela-based research firm Delphos showed about a quarter of the population thinking about emigrating if Maduro was re-elected.",
      "Grenell has reached out to Maduro before on Mr. Trump's behalf to secure the release of imprisoned Americans only to come home empty handed.",
      "In 2020, he traveled with Erik Prince, the founder of controversial security firm Blackwater, to Mexico City for a secret meeting with a top Maduro aide. The backchannel talks centered on Maduro's offer to swap eight Americans then imprisoned in Venezuela for businessman Alex Saab, a close ally of the president charged in the U.S. with money laundering, The Associated Press previously reported.",
      "No deal was struck and Grenell's demand that Maduro step down was dismissed by the Venezuelan president's envoy. Grenell has always denied he was negotiating a hostage swap.",
      "Later, in December 2023, the Biden administration exchanged Saab for 10 Americans as part of a policy to re-engage Maduro ahead of presidential elections.",

      "He added, \"That said, Affleck is deliberate in his public appearances\u2014in some cases to support his friends and long-time collaborators, like Matt Damon, but in other cases to avoid controversy and conjecture, due to an unintended red carpet cross-over with his ex, Jennifer Lopez.

      "Eldridge also noted that as a woman, Lopez may be under more pressure to appear in public than her ex. \"Additionally, in a very archaic way, an actress must remain visible, in order to remain viable, in Hollywood,\" he explained. \"When was the last time you saw [Chris] Hemsworth, [Tom] Hardy or Harrison Ford, walking a red carpet for a project they weren't tied to?

They would not be doing themselves, their movies, reputations or individual teams any favors to force attendance at certain events or be together, front-and-center, for any promotional gigs if tensions are too high, and their visual\u00a0presence is less than ideal.

      "\"We still haven't seen the final proposal from the Democrats in Albany, but there's no doubt that Tammany Hall corruption is alive and well in the state capital,\" Republican New York Assemblyman Matt Slater, who represents the state's 94th district in areas of Putnam and Westchester counties, told Fox News Digital in an exclusive Zoom interview on Sunday morning.",
      "\"It is just blatantly corrupt for the New York State Democrats to keep changing the rules of engagement simply out of self-interest.

So they can get things done, but they only do it when it benefits them,\" Slater continued.",
      "Slater, who serves as the ranking Republican on the state's Election Law Committee, was reacting to state Democrats working to introduce legislation that could keep Stefanik's House seat vacant until June, when the state holds its scheduled primary elections.

      "Under current law, New York's governor has 10 days to declare a special election for a vacant seat and an additional 80 to 90 days to hold the election.

This obviously would make that margin of Republican control that much more thin and that much more challenging for the speaker and, again, jeopardizing President Trump's agenda to get through Congress. That's their entire mission and goal, the Albany Democrats, is to make sure that they're combating President Trump each step of the way. And this is their latest way of doing it,\" Slater said.",

Fact of the matter is, this has everything to do with the fact that this is a Republican seat. This is about control of Republicans in Congress, and this is about disrupting President Trump's agenda in Washington.\"",

The White House and U.S. Capitol are clearly visible when planes take off to the north.",
      "Moreover, the airport is known for notoriously short runways. The runway on which the American Eagle flight attempted to land stretches a little more than 5,200 feet. Slightly less than a mile in length.",
      "That\u2019s not even the main runway. Standard commercial runways average around 13,000 feet. The longest runway at Reagan National is about 7,000 feet. Plus, all three runways cross one another. Such a configuration is rarely seen at modern airports.",
      "DC PLANE CRASH: ATC STAFFING LEVELS UNDER SCRUTINY AS BARGES ARRIVE TO HELP SALVAGE OPS",
      "The midair crash between an American Airlines jet and Black Hawk military helicopter near Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C., was seen on dashcam video from Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. (Storyful)",
      "Last spring, there were two incidents where planes nearly crashed into one another while crossing runways.",
      "The runways are some of the most overused in the entire American flight system. The airport was designed to handle 14 million passengers annually. But that number spiked to 25 million in 2023. The airport accommodates a staggering 800 takeoffs and landings each day.",
      "There were efforts to close Reagan National when Dulles International Airport opened in 1962. Dulles is a monstrosity of a campus. However, it resides nearly 30 miles from Washington, D.C., proper. The nation\u2019s movers and shakers never gravitated to Dulles when it was so easy to fly into Reagan National, deplane, catch a cab and arrive at the State Department for a meeting 15 minutes later.",
      "Lawmakers, aviation, national security officials and the Secret Service conducted serious conversations about permanently closing the airport after 9/11. It was thought that air traffic in and out of Reagan National posed too much of a risk to the seat of government. It wouldn\u2019t take much for hijackers to commandeer an aircraft and reroute it to Capitol Hill.",
      "After all, one plane crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11. The fourth plane \u2013 which went down in a field near Shanksville, Penn. \u2013 was ultimately bound for the Capitol.",

      "That said, advocates for maintaining Reagan National argued it was nearly impossible to hijack a plane taking off and immediately send it barreling toward the Capitol. It takes a while to engineer a hijacking. There was simply not enough time to execute such a plan seconds after takeoff.",
      "Still, authorities shuttered Reagan National for more than three weeks following 9/11. New safety rules were in place once the airport re-opened. Planes couldn\u2019t have more than 156 seats. All passengers were required to be seated a half-hour before landing. Air marshals patrolled most if not all flights in and out of the airport.",
      "The feds loosened many of those restrictions anywhere from a few months to nearly four years after 9/11. But that didn\u2019t diminish questions about the safety of this particular airport.",
      "VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN DC PLANE CRASH INVOLVING AMERICAN AIRLINES JET AND MILITARY HELICOPTER",
      "However, proponents of maintaining Reagan National had some of the most powerful allies in the nation: Members of Congress.",
      "Lawmakers keep insane schedules. In fact, the invention of the jet airplane contributed to such bedlam. Lawmakers are in high demand in their districts or states \u2013 and on Capitol Hill. That\u2019s to say nothing of conferences in Aspen or Halifax \u2013 and glitzy fundraisers in New York or San Francisco. So air travel, coupled with access to a nearby airport, is paramount in the modern Congress.",
      "The importance of aviation is even incorporated into the Congressional vernacular.",
      "Mondays or Tuesdays are often deemed \"fly-in\" days. The House and Senate don\u2019t truly get going until late in the day during the first day of the week. Thus, votes on Monday might not unfold until 5:30 pm et in the Senate and 6:30 in the House. Depending on if the House (and sometimes the Senate) convenes on a Monday or Tuesday, Thursdays and Friday are considered \"getaway\" days. The House might cut town by late morning or noon on a getaway day. If the Senate doesn\u2019t toil for five days (which has happened a lot this year, but not this week), the last vote often hits around 2:15 or 2:30 pm. on a Thursday.",
      "Thus, lawmakers have a vested interest in keeping Reagan National operational. Even after 9/11.",
      "Congress reauthorized programs for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for five years in 2024. But one of the most contentious issues in the bill was whether Congress should authorize additional daily \"slots\" for Reagan National. New, regular flights commence in a few weeks to Las Vegas, San Diego, Seattle, San Antonio and San Francisco. Lawmakers have blessed an increase of about 50 additional daily \"slots\" at Reagan National since the turn of the century.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "It\u2019s telling that only four senators opposed the FAA bill last year. All four were the local Washington, D.C., area senators: former Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., \u2013 who just retired \u2013 along with Sens. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Mark Warner, D-Va., and Kaine.",
      "The Senate confirmed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on a bipartisan vote Tuesday. Duffy faced a crisis by Wednesday night. By Friday, the new secretary tightened up airspace around Reagan National for helicopters.",
      "But like everything in Washington, the key to Reagan National is all about access. It\u2019s hard to find any major airport on the planet located so close to the levers of power.",
      "And as long as the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, a myriad of federal agencies and lobbying shops exist in Washington, it\u2019s doubtful that Reagan National is going anywhere.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says cybercriminals are exploiting iMessage phishing protection, tricking users to reactivate links.",
      "Elon Musk, known for leading companies like Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and xAI and buying and rebranding Twitter as X, often finds his name linked to innovation and futuristic ideas. But his reputation also makes him a prime target for scammers.",
      "In the past, fraudsters have used Musk\u2019s name in cryptocurrency schemes. Now, a new scam is making the rounds. This time, scammers are promoting bogus \"energy-saving\" devices, falsely associating Musk with these products to gain credibility. These devices, which don\u2019t work as advertised, are being marketed as revolutionary solutions, duping people into spending money on what is essentially a scam.",
      "We received this email from Rick in Wilkesboro, North Carolina: \"I\u2019ve been receiving emails offering an energy-saving device developed by Elon Musk. It claims the device can reduce energy bills by 50%. I never attempted to contact anyone associated with Elon Musk, nor have I done any internet searches for such a device. Are these emails legit or another attempt by scammers hoping I click on their links?\"",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Rick, it sounds like those emails are likely scams. There have been numerous reports of scammers using Elon Musk's name to promote fake energy-saving devices. These scams often claim that the device can drastically reduce energy bills, but there is no evidence that Elon Musk or any of his companies are involved in such products.",
      "Let's dive into how this scam works and share some ways you can stay safe.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does Elon Musk's energy-saving scam work?",
      "The Elon Musk energy-saving scam works by using flashy online ads, unsolicited emails and other deceptive tactics to lure victims. Scammers promote so-called \"revolutionary\" devices through social media, pop-ups, emails and even search engine ads, claiming the products are backed by Musk.",
      "These ads often include fake customer reviews, exaggerated claims of slashing electricity bills by 50% or more and time-limited discounts to create urgency. Names of devices advertised in these scams include the Power Pro Save, Heunwa Power Save, Stop Watt, Miracle Watt, True Watt, Real Watt, Watt Rescue, Esaver Watt, Pro Power Save, Voltmod and more.",
      "Clicking on these ads leads you to sales websites designed to look legitimate. They feature fake logos, doctored before-and-after photos and bogus celebrity endorsements to build trust. The sites throw around pseudo-scientific jargon like \"stabilizing electrical currents\" or \"rebalancing loads\" to sound convincing. They also use tactics like showing inflated \"regular\" prices crossed out to make the current offer seem like a huge bargain.",
      "If you look closely, though, the red flags are clear. These sites lack basic details like a company address, contact number or business registration information. Instead, they push you to place an order through an online form, demanding full payment upfront via credit card or PayPal.",
      "After paying, customers might receive a cheap, non-functional plastic device, or sometimes nothing at all. These devices don\u2019t reduce electricity usage. They might even waste more power. But by the time you realize it, the scammers have already pocketed your money.",

      "DON\u2019T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "The truth about energy-saving devices",
      "Over the years, plenty of power-saving scams have promised to cut down or even eliminate your electricity bill by simply plugging in their devices. The reality is that there\u2019s no device you can plug in that will actually reduce your electricity usage or lower your household bill.",
      "These products often claim to \"stabilize voltage\" or \"reduce power waste.\" While voltage stabilization can be useful in industrial settings, it doesn\u2019t make much difference for typical home appliances. Most household appliances are already designed to run efficiently without the issues these devices claim to fix.",
      "If you\u2019re serious about saving on electricity, focus on\u00a0practical solutions like upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, using smart home devices or adjusting your energy usage schedule.",

      "Unsolicited emails: Receiving emails out of the blue, especially when you haven't shown interest in such products, is a common tactic used by scammers.",
      "Use of celebrity names: Scammers frequently use well-known names like Elon Musk to lend credibility to their schemes.",
      "Suspicious links: Be cautious of clicking on links in unsolicited emails. They can lead to phishing sites designed to steal your personal information. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "10 ways to stay safe from such scams",
      "1. Verify the email: Phishing emails are a common tool scammers use to trick people into buying fake products or giving away personal information. These emails often look like they\u2019re from legitimate sources, but they contain links that lead to fraudulent websites or prompt you to download malicious attachments. Always check the sender's email address and look for signs of a fake message, like poor grammar or urgent calls to action.",
      "2. Verify claims: If you're curious about a product, do some research from reputable sources before taking any action.",
      "3. Do not click links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from these emails. Instead, hover over the link to see its true destination. This can help you identify if it leads to a legitimate site or a malicious one.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software actively running on your devices: Ensure you have reliable antivirus software installed on your devices. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses and other security threats. Regularly update the software to ensure it can detect and remove the latest threats. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Examine the website carefully: Scammers often create websites that look professional, but they\u2019re easy to spot with a few simple checks. Look for missing or suspicious information, like the absence of a business address, phone number or business registration details. If there are fake testimonials or celebrity endorsements, that\u2019s a red flag.",

      "6. Don\u2019t fall for \"too good to be true\" deals:\u00a0Scammers rely on offering deals that seem too good to pass up, like massive discounts or a \"limited time offer.\" If an ad claims you can save 50% or more on a product, be skeptical. Real, quality products usually don\u2019t come with such extreme savings, and high-tech devices like those promoted by scammers rarely live up to the hype. If it feels like too good a deal, it probably is.",
      "7. Watch out for unusual payment methods: One of the easiest ways to spot a scam is by how the scammers ask you to pay. If a website asks for payment upfront via credit card or PayPal with no option to verify or ship the product first, it's a major red flag. Scammers take your money upfront and have no intention of sending you anything of value. Stick to reputable payment methods that offer buyer protection and avoid sites that ask for payment without proper verification.",
      "8. Mark spam email as junk or spam: Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "9. Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources: This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable email or email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "10. Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Impersonation scams are a common way scammers steal your money. They often use well-known names like Elon Musk or big companies like Microsoft and Walmart to make you trust them, then trick you into giving away your financial details. To stay safe, avoid unsolicited emails or texts that promote products or offers. If you need to buy something, stick to trusted sellers like Amazon, Best Buy or other reputable platforms. Always double-check the legitimacy of any offer before making a purchase, especially if it comes from an unfamiliar source.",

      "Apple\u2019s closed ecosystem and strict App Store policies limit the risk of malware, and its centralized software updates ensure better security. In contrast, Android\u2019s openness allows users to install apps from various sources, and updates are often rolled out at different times, making it more vulnerable to attacks.",
      "However, iPhones aren\u2019t immune to security flaws. Hackers occasionally find ways to exploit them, as seen in Apple\u2019s latest advisory. The company recently discovered that a vulnerability in iOS had been exploited for over a year.

      "Apple has\u00a0uncovered hackers exploiting a vulnerability in iOS that appears to have been lingering for more than a year. The vulnerability is a \"zero-day\" flaw, meaning criminals may have already exploited it, according to the latest security advisory from the company. Zero-day flaws like this are especially dangerous because they are exploited before developers can issue fixes. Apple confirmed this marks its first zero-day patch of 2025. The vulnerability affects iPhones dating back to 2018\u2019s XS model, as well as newer iPads, Macs, and even the Vision Pro headset.",
      "The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24085, resides in Apple\u2019s Core Media framework, a software layer responsible for processing multimedia files. A \"use after free\" memory corruption error enabled hackers to manipulate the system into executing unstable code, granting them elevated privileges to bypass security protocols. Apple\u2019s advisory suggests hackers weaponized the flaw through malicious apps disguised as legitimate media players. These apps likely abused the Core Media framework by triggering corrupted files, enabling attackers to infiltrate devices.",
      "The attacks reportedly targeted iOS versions predating 17.2, released in December 2023, meaning the vulnerability may have been active since late 2022. Security experts speculate that hackers focused on high-value individuals \u2014 such as activists, executives or journalists \u2014 to avoid detection. The prolonged stealth of the campaign underscores the challenges of identifying sophisticated, narrowly tailored exploits.",

      "2. Download apps only from the App Store: To minimize the risk of installing malware, only download apps from the official App Store. Apple\u2019s strict app review process helps prevent malicious apps from being published, but some threats can still slip through. Always verify app details, check reviews and be cautious about app permissions before installation.",
      "3. Enable lockdown mode for extra protection: For those of you who may be at higher risk, such as journalists or executives,\u00a0Lockdown Mode provides an additional layer of security. This feature limits certain device functionalities to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks. It can be turned on via\u00a0Settings >\u00a0Privacy & Security >\u00a0Lockdown Mode and is especially useful for those concerned about targeted threats.",

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Review your security and privacy settings: Regularly reviewing your iPhone\u2019s security settings can help you maintain strong protection. You should also review app permissions in\u00a0Settings > Privacy & Security to restrict access to sensitive data, such as location or contacts. Enable\u00a0Face ID or Touch ID for secure access and turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) for Apple ID and other accounts.\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message or authentication app, in addition to your password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: By reducing your online footprint, you make it harder for cybercriminals to obtain your contact information, potentially preventing them from sending you deceptive phishing texts and emails in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Be wary of messages asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. To protect yourself, ensure strong antivirus software is installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, regular monitoring of your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts is critical. Look for unauthorized transactions or suspicious activity and immediately report any issues to your bank or credit card provider.",
      "5. Recognize and report a Social Security scam:\u00a0If your Social Security number is exposed, you could become a target for related scams. Official communication regarding Social Security issues usually comes via mail, not phone calls or emails. Learn more about spotting and reporting scams by visiting the Social Security Administration\u2019s\u00a0scam information page.",
      "6. Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Data breaches happen every day, and most never make the headlines, but with an identity theft protection service, you\u2019ll be notified if and when you are affected. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "FIRST ON FOX: Pakistan\u2019s former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who was jailed last month on charges of corruption, is being compared by supporters to President Donald Trump given the way they say authorities in Pakistan have persecuted him.",
      "Many have linked his situation to Trump\u2019s and blamed the government for jailing the popular former prime minister. Khan\u2019s plight has also been highlighted by longtime Trump ally and adviser Richard Grenell, who took to social media late last year when he tweeted, \"Free Imran Khan!\"",
      "A Pakistani court sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 14 and seven years in jail after finding them guilty of corruption. They were convicted for allegedly accepting land as a bribe through the Al-Qadir Trust, which they had set up while Khan was in office. Khan, however, maintains his innocence, describing the events as a \"witch hunt\" in exclusive comments to Fox News Digital. It is just one of the more than 100 cases he is facing.",

      "In response to Fox News Digital questions about Khan's conviction, Pakistan's federal minister for information and broadcasting, Ata Ullah TararIn, defended Khan's conviction. \"The 190 million pound case is one of the biggest corruption cases in the history of Pakistan, and it is a mega scam in which former Prime Minister Imran Khan, and his wife, Bushra Bibi, have been found to be guilty. There is irrefutable evidence that they not only used the official position to grant illegal favor to a property tycoon, but they also received gratification and formed a sham trust in order to grant this favor to a property tycoon.\"",
      "He continued, \"This is corruption of the highest order, and the former prime minister has been convicted on the basis of irrefutable evidence of corruption and this, this scam, which is the biggest scam in the history of Pakistan, has reached its legal conclusion.\"",

      "Khan's responses to Fox News Digital questions came via his spokespeople, who communicated them with the former prime minister. Khan noted the parallels between himself and Trump, saying the two shared similar experiences. \"The world today needs steadfast leadership that champions peace, democracy, and human rights, and I hope that his leadership can contribute to that vision\".",
      "Trump's and Khan's experiences with the authorities share are a key similarity, but their stories mirror each other in ways that go beyond just that.",
      "While Trump transformed the U.S. political scene with his \"Make America Great Again\" movement, Khan energized Pakistanis with his \"Naya Pakistan\" (New Pakistan) vision. And in a manner similar to Trump, Khan did away with the elitism of politics, focusing on the average person instead.",
      "Khan told Fox News Digital that his political party \"is an inclusive party that represents the diverse fabric of Pakistan.\" He noted that while Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was initially perceived as a party of the educated elite, that notion was \"quickly dispelled.\"",

This inclusivity is what makes us the largest national party, uniting Pakistan under the principles of equity and fairness.\"",

Since Trump's return to office, the South Asian nation has been buzzing with speculation and hope over whether he will force Khan's release. The two have a friendly relationship, with Trump calling Khan \"a very good friend of mine\" at a 2020 forum in Davos. The two first met in Washington in July 2019, which at the time was considered a reset for U.S.-Pakistan relations.",
      "Shortly after Trump's win in November, Grenell wrote on X \"Watch Pakistan\u2026 Their Trump-like leader is in prison on phony charges, and the people have been inspired by the U.S. Red Wave. Stop the political prosecutions around the world!\"",

      "Explaining his aspirations, Khan concluded, \"Rather than relying on handouts, we must focus on self-sufficiency and leveraging our strengths to build sustainable economic relationships.

They see with clarity what is happening to their nation, and they understand the forces at play.\u00a0I firmly believe that truth and justice will ultimately prevail. And as long as I have breath, I will continue to fight for this cause and for a Pakistan that reflects the will and aspirations of its people.\"",

      "FIRST ON FOX: Expansionist rhetoric has been a major concern in NATO for several years amid Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but according to Greece\u2019s top defense official, the security alliance should take seriously similar threats from within its own coalition, in particular from Turkey.",
      "A decades-old feud over the island nation of Cyprus between Greece and Turkey, both of which have been members of NATO since 1952, has plagued the alliance for over half a century and spill-over conflicts pushed the two countries nearly to the brink of war in the 1990s.",
      "Though relations between Greece and Turkey have become less outwardly hostile in recent years, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s pursuit of regional natural resources coupled with his controversial geopolitical actions in the Middle East and Aegean Sea have long drawn criticism that he is looking to \"recreate\" the Ottoman Empire.",

      "\"There's some people in Turkey that go back to the Ottoman times and believe that they could recreate the Ottoman Empire, including parts of Greece, parts of Syria, parts of Iraq, parts of Iran, half of the Caucasus, etc.,\" Greek Defense Minister Nikos Dendias said during an interview with Fox News Digital.",
      "\"I hope that this is daydream, but it creates a lot of problems in the relations with Greece, a lot of problems within NATO.\"",
      "Erdo\u011fan, who has been president of Turkey since 2014, has long been criticized for his aggressive approach in dealing with regional nations like Iraq, Yemen, Libya and Israel, but also his oppressive practices at home that have targeted non-Sunni communities, including Shiites and Christians, journalists, women and Kurds. It's an issue that has not only blocked Turkey from joining the European Union, but has increasingly held geopolitical ramifications for the U.S.",
      "The U.S.\u2019s chief ally in the fight against ISIS in Syria, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), has found itself in Ankara\u2019s crosshairs as it views the Kurdish-affiliated force as being akin to the\u00a0terrorist network, the Kurdistan Workers Party\u00a0(PKK).",
      "Turkey\u00a0has routinely targeted the group and prompted international concern over how the SDF will be able to continue to effectively fight ISIS should the Trump administration withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.",

      "\"ISIS, let us be frank and honest, is down but not out,\" Dendias said. \"The ideology behind ISIS, the ideology behind the Muslim Brotherhood is there, is alive and kicking.",
      "\"And I have to say, the worst thing that you can do in life is forget your allies, forget the people who fought by your side in your hour of need, and turn against them or forget about them,\" the defense minister continued. \"I'm speaking about the Kurds fighting against ISIS for years.

      "The fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime has renewed concerns over regional stability, and the close dynamic between Trump and Erdo\u011fan has raised more questions about how the Turkish president will pursue his regional ambitions.",
      "Dendias argued that the close relationship allegedly shared between the two world leaders will not necessarily embolden Erdo\u011fan and could uniquely position Trump to \"whisper\" in the ear of the Turkish leader and remind him that \"international law, international [rules] of the sea, is a way of life in this modern world.\"",
      "\"I assume that it will not be good at all for NATO and would not be good at all for the United States of America to encourage Turkey to create a huge problem in the eastern front of NATO, taking also into account what's happening in the Middle East and what's happening between Russia and Ukraine,\" the defense minster added.",

      "\"And sometimes they even go further. They claim that Crete, a huge island with very important NATO presence and an American base in Souda \u2013 again, should belong to Turkey.\"",
      "The defense minster said Greece\u2019s tense relations with Turkey have made its defensive posture in NATO unique because it has forced Athens to be on top of its defense spending, an issue that has once again become a top matter of discussion in the NATO alliance due to Trump\u2019s push to have all nations meet a 5% GDP spending limit, up from 2%.",
      "The latest NATO spending figures released in June 2024 show Greece was the fifth-highest spender on defense in the alliance, spending more than 3% of its GPD, while Turkey came in 18th and spent just over 2% of its GDP on defense.",

      "Dendias said European nations need to collectively agree on how they view security threat levels and the importance of defense spending.",
      "\"Regardless of President Trump's position on 5%, it's an internal issue and needs to be resolved,\" Dendias added.",
      "\"The biggest threat is countries that do not abide by international law and do not abide by international law of the sea. Countries that believe that borders [are] something that you can disregard, that treaties and international treaties should work only if it's to your advantage,\" Dendias said. \"That is the biggest threat to the whole world, not just Greece.\"",

      "The Turkish embassy in Washington, D.C. did not respond to Fox News Digital's questions but instead pointed to a statement issued by the Turkish Minister of National Defense, Ya\u015far G\u00fcler, who ahead of the \"Blue Homeland\" exercises said, \"Our country, located at the very heart of a region surrounded by conflicts and disputes, consistently emphasizes its commitment to international law and peace in preventing tensions and resolving crises.",

The IRGC Brigadier General Hassan Tehrani Moghaddam, the father of the IRGC's missile program, personally pursued the project.\"",
      "It is unclear what level of nuclear payload the Ghaem-100 missile would be capable of carrying at the range of 1,800 miles, though this is still shy of the roughly 3,400 miles needed to be classified as an intercontinental missile.",

    "summary": "Some people caught in Trump administration immigration operations have already been released back into the United States on a monitoring program.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration aggressively publicized the arrests of more than 8,000 immigrants by federal agents since Inauguration Day, with the promise that those detained would be part of a historic mass deportation. But NBC News has learned that some have already been released back into the United States on a monitoring program, according to five sources familiar with the operations.",
      "Since he took office, President Donald Trump and his allies have promoted immigration operations in cities like Chicago and New York, where agents across federal agencies were called in to increase the number of arrests.",
      "But arresting more people inside the United States on allegations of immigration violations means they need to be held somewhere. And significant space constraints in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities \u2014 and federal court orders forbidding indefinite detention \u2014 have forced the agency to release some of those arrested in the roundups rather than hold them until deportation.",
      "ICE posts arrest figures daily on X, but it does not disclose how many of those arrested are released, remain in detention or have been deported.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, an ICE spokesperson acknowledged federal court cases limit ICE from detaining people indefinitely if their countries refuse to take them back, which can lead ICE to release them.",
      "\u201cThe agency\u2019s federal law enforcement officers do everything they can to keep our communities safe,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cIn some cases, ICE is required to release certain arrested aliens from custody.\u201d",
      "Those released are being kept on a monitoring program known as Alternatives to Detention, the five sources familiar with the releases said, which has for more than a decade been used to keep track of where migrants are as they make their way through the immigration system. ICE can track them by ankle monitors or wrist bands or through telephonic check-ins.",
      "As he did in his first administration, Trump vowed when he took office last month to end so-called catch-and-release policies under which migrants apprehended at the southern border are released back into the United States while their immigration cases are pending.",
      "Trump\u2019s ban on \u201ccatch and release\u201d appears to be in effect at the southern border, where few migrants are\u00a0being processed for asylum claims. But because ICE is funded for only 41,500 beds nationwide, it is still releasing some migrants who were detained in the interior of the country.",
      "Fox News reported in December that the incoming Trump administration was aware of the capacity issues in ICE detention and was considering expanding the ankle monitor program.",
      "ICE policy prioritizes immigrants deemed to be public safety threats for detention and allows officers to use their discretion when they decide to release migrants who do not have serious criminal convictions. There are no indications that the Trump administration has released anyone convicted of a serious crime.",
      "When they decide who should be detained, ICE officers also consider whether immigrants come from countries that refuse to take them back. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans living in the United States, for example, could not be deported and were considered for release if they were not deemed threats to public safety.",
      "On Saturday, Trump announced that Venezuela had agreed to take back its nationals who had emigrated to the United States.",
      "Other detainees may be released for medical reasons or if they are the only caretakers of children, three sources familiar with the decisions said."

The juror\u00a0went straight to police\u00a0instead.",

Thirty of them have already pleaded guilty to various charges, including some who had been scheduled to go on trial with Bock this week.

      "Here\u2019s a look at a trial that\u2019s expected to last around six weeks:",
      "Federal prosecutors allege that the conspiracy revolved around two groups \u2014 Feeding Our Future and Partners in Nutrition \u2014 that were both small nonprofits that were approved as sponsors of the Federal Child Nutrition Program before the pandemic. But the two groups dramatically increased the number of meal sites that they claimed to be sponsoring during the pandemic. Feeding Our Future went from receiving and disbursing $3.4 million in federal funds in 2019 to nearly $200 million in 2021. Sites sponsored by Feeding Our Future falsely claimed to be serving thousands of children daily, prosecutors allege.",

The total included administrative fees to which Feeding Our Future was not entitled, they said.",
      "\u201cBock and other Feeding Our Future employees also solicited and received bribes and kickbacks from individuals and companies sponsored by Feeding Our Future,\u201d prosecutors continued. \u201cFeeding Our Future operated a pay-to-play scheme, where individuals seeking to operate fraudulent sites under the sponsorship of Feeding Our Future had to kick back a portion of their fraudulent proceeds to Feeding Our Future employees.\u201d",

He said the jury will be able to see the difference between her and the rest of the defendants despite the complexities of the overall case.",
      "\u201cShe accepted no bribes or kickbacks from anybody. She did not know that the invoices were fraudulent. She was focused on providing as much access to needy people as possible, that is, feeding adults and children during COVID and during the George Floyd protests,\u201d Udoibok said.",
      "An attorney for Bock\u2019s co-defendant, Salim Ahmed Said, did not return a call seeking comment on the case.",
      "Five people were charged with bribery because of\u00a0the attempt\u00a0in the first trial, including three who were on trial at the time. Two of the five have already pleaded guilty, while one more is scheduled to change his plea to guilty in the bribery case in March. U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger described the elaborate scheme as \u201csomething out of a mob movie.\u201d",

His administration largely blamed federal authorities, saying the FBI asked them not to cut off the flow of funds to protect its investigation. Walz\u2019s critics insist he should have done more. While Walz comfortably won reelection in 2022,\u00a0the issue resurfaced\u00a0after presidential candidate Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate.",
      "This year, Republicans in the\u00a0closely divided Minnesota Legislature\u00a0have made fighting fraud in government programs one of their top issues, and not just because of Feeding our Future. Walz himself has proposed his own anti-fraud package. But the 2025 legislative session is off to a contentious start and it\u2019s not clear yet if the sides can reach the bipartisan consensus that will be needed to pass anything."

One of his security guards died and three more people were injured in the explosion, the newspaper reported, citing Moscow's health department.",

      "Trump also said on social media that he had spoken with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Monday morning and would speak with him again in the afternoon.",

      "That\u2019s a dramatic reversal of the policies of former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration \u2014 and of major medical organizations \u2014 that supported gender-affirming care.",
      "American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Sruti Swaminathan said that to be put into effect, provisions of the orders should first go through federal rulemaking procedures, which can be years long and include the chance for public comment.",
      "\u201cWhen you have the nation\u2019s commander-in-chief demonizing transgender people, it certainly sends a signal to all Americans,\u201d said Sarah Warbelow, the legal director at Human Rights Campaign.",
      "Things to know about Trump\u2019s actions:",
      "Recognizing people as only men or women",
      "On Trump\u2019s first day back in office, he issued a sweeping order that signaled a big change in how his administration would deal with transgender people and their rights.",
      "It questions their existence by saying the government would recognize only two unchangeable sexes: female and male.",

      "The document calls on government agencies to use the new definitions of the sexes, and to stop using taxpayer money to promote what it calls \u201cgender ideology,\u201d the idea broadly accepted by medical experts that gender falls along a spectrum.",
      "Federal agencies have been quick to comply. Andrea Lucas, the acting chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, for example, announced this week that she would remove identity pronouns from employees\u2019 online profiles and disallow the \u201cX\u201d gender marker for those filing discrimination charges.",

The Bureau of Prisons stopped reporting the number of transgender incarcerated people and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removed lessons on building supportive school environments for transgender and nonbinary students.",

      "The option to choose \u201cX\u201d was taken off online passport application forms Friday.",
      "The ACLU says it\u2019s considering a lawsuit.",
      "Trans women moved into men\u2019s prisons",

      "The Federal Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to requests for information about such moves.",

      "Opening the door to another ban on trans service members",
      "Trump set the stage for a ban on transgender people in the military, directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to come up with a new policy on the issue by late March.",
      "In the executive order, the president asserted that being transgender \u201cconflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\u2019s personal life.\u201d",
      "Trump barred transgender service members in his first term in office, but a court blocked the effort.",

      "The care in question includes puberty blocking drugs, hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgery, which is rare for minors.",
      "If fully implemented, the order would cut off government health insurance including Medicaid and TRICARE, which serves military families, for the treatments.",
      "It also calls on Congress to adopt a law against the care, though whether that happens is up to lawmakers.",

      "Some districts and states have passed those requirements to prevent deadnaming, the practice of referring to transgender people who have changed their name by the name they used before their transition. It is widely considered insensitive, offensive or traumatizing."

      "The complex job of lifting the stricken Flight 5432 from the Potomac River is due to begin Monday, with local and state officials promising that they will recover all 67 victims who died when the plane and a military helicopter collided and crashed last Wednesday.",
      "So far, 55 victims' remains have been recovered. D.C. Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly told a news conference Sunday: \"We\u2019re going to recover everyone.\"",
      "\"If we knew where they were, though, we would already have them out, so we have some work to do as the salvage operation goes on, and we will absolutely stay here and search until such point as we have everybody,\" he added. Recovery workers have been battling difficult conditions with near-zero visibility in the dark waters.",
      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, plans to lift the remains of the jet from the river in stages, a process that is expected to last three days.",
      "The operation will use a crane barge, deck barges, dive boats and two surface-supplied dive systems, the army said in a statement.",
      "The wreckage will be taken to a hangar for the National Transportation Safety Board to continue investigating the cause of the collision.",
      "Then the recovery teams will turn their attention to the remains of the Black Hawk helicopter. The \"large lifts\" portion of the operation is expected to be finished by Saturday, with the clearance of other debris lasting until at least Feb. 12. An automatic stop on this work will be ordered when a body is discovered.",
      "\u201cThe level of coordination both behind the scenes and out on the Potomac is exceptional,\u201d Baltimore District Commander Col. Francis Pera said. \u201cWe have not and will not lose focus of what is most important \u2014 the safety of our crews and accounting for those still missing to bring closure to their families and loved ones.\u201d",

Musk, the head of Trump\u2019s government efficiency initiative, announced the shutdown in the middle of the night in an audio-only appearance on his social media site X.",

      "Musk did not say what legal authority he believed the White House has to shut down a federal agency without congressional approval, or how quickly the administration planned to act. He said the idea had \u201cthe full support of the president\u201d and that he had spoken with Trump on the matter several times.",
      "\u201cWith regard to the USAID stuff, I went over [it] with him in detail, and he agreed that we should shut it down,\u201d he said. \u201cI actually checked with him a few times [and] said, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019\u201d he said. He said that Trump responded, \u201cYes.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 12:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Some people caught in Trump administration immigration operations have already been released back into the United States on a monitoring program.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration aggressively publicized the arrests of more than 8,000 immigrants by federal agents since Inauguration Day, with the promise that those detained would be part of a historic mass deportation. But NBC News has learned that some have already been released back into the United States on a monitoring program, according to five sources familiar with the operations.",
      "Since he took office, President Donald Trump and his allies have promoted immigration operations in cities like Chicago and New York, where agents across federal agencies were called in to increase the number of arrests.",
      "But arresting more people inside the United States on allegations of immigration violations means they need to be held somewhere. And significant space constraints in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities \u2014 and federal court orders forbidding indefinite detention \u2014 have forced the agency to release some of those arrested in the roundups rather than hold them until deportation.",
      "ICE posts arrest figures daily on X, but it does not disclose how many of those arrested are released, remain in detention or have been deported.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, an ICE spokesperson acknowledged federal court cases limit ICE from detaining people indefinitely if their countries refuse to take them back, which can lead ICE to release them.",
      "\u201cThe agency\u2019s federal law enforcement officers do everything they can to keep our communities safe,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cIn some cases, ICE is required to release certain arrested aliens from custody.\u201d",
      "Those released are being kept on a monitoring program known as Alternatives to Detention, the five sources familiar with the releases said, which has for more than a decade been used to keep track of where migrants are as they make their way through the immigration system. ICE can track them by ankle monitors or wrist bands or through telephonic check-ins.",
      "As he did in his first administration, Trump vowed when he took office last month to end so-called catch-and-release policies under which migrants apprehended at the southern border are released back into the United States while their immigration cases are pending.",
      "Trump\u2019s ban on \u201ccatch and release\u201d appears to be in effect at the southern border, where few migrants are\u00a0being processed for asylum claims. But because ICE is funded for only 41,500 beds nationwide, it is still releasing some migrants who were detained in the interior of the country.",
      "Fox News reported in December that the incoming Trump administration was aware of the capacity issues in ICE detention and was considering expanding the ankle monitor program.",
      "ICE policy prioritizes immigrants deemed to be public safety threats for detention and allows officers to use their discretion when they decide to release migrants who do not have serious criminal convictions. There are no indications that the Trump administration has released anyone convicted of a serious crime.",
      "When they decide who should be detained, ICE officers also consider whether immigrants come from countries that refuse to take them back. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans living in the United States, for example, could not be deported and were considered for release if they were not deemed threats to public safety.",
      "On Saturday, Trump announced that Venezuela had agreed to take back its nationals who had emigrated to the United States.",
      "Other detainees may be released for medical reasons or if they are the only caretakers of children, three sources familiar with the decisions said."

      "The full moment was caught on The Associated Press' livestream, and occurred when reporter Leslie Ambriz asked Babyface a question about the fusion of R&B with other genres like pop, hip-hop and rock.",
      "Babyface had started to answer the question when another reporter, Krysta Fauria, called out \"Chappell! Chappell!\" into the microphone as the singer made her way down the red carpet behind Babyface.",
      "\"I'm so sorry, Babyface,\" Ambriz said as she took his microphone and he walked away, before saying \"Hello!\" as Roan approached them.",
      "The reporters did apologize about two hours later on The Associated Press' livestream.",

      "The backlash from fans and celebrities regarding Babyface's treatment during the interview, however, was swift.",

Its maddening to see a LEGEND not get the respect and attention they deserve. He is a pioneer and deserves so much better than this.\"",
      "Kardashian cited his decades of work as a songwriter, producer and performer, calling him a \"class act.\"",

That same day, Lively filed a federal lawsuit against Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and his publicists, alleging she was retaliated against for reporting sexual harassment.",
      "Baldoni subsequently sued Lively, her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and her publicist, accusing them of defamation on Jan. 16.",
      "On Jan. 31, Baldoni filed a timeline and amended complaint, which names Lively, Reynolds, publicist Leslie Sloane, Sloane\u2019s company Vision PR and the New York Times as \u201cconsolidated defendants.\u201d",
      "The amended complaint includes text messages between Lively and Baldoni, as well as between Reynolds and Baldoni. It also alleges that the New York Times may have been working on its article about Lively\u2019s complaint for \u201cmonths before\u201d the complaint was filed.",
      "Baldoni\u2019s attorney Bryan Freedman said in a statement that the amended lawsuit \u201cwas a logical next step due to the overwhelming amount of new proof that has come to light.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis fresh evidence corroborates what we knew all along, that due to a blind pursuit of power, Ms. Lively and her entire team colluded for months to destroy reputations through a complex web of lies, false accusations and the manipulation of illicitly received communications,\u201d Freedman said in the statement.",
      "A New York Times spokesperson said in a statement, \u201cThe Baldoni/Wayfarer legal filings are rife with inaccuracies about The New York Times, including, for example, the bogus claim that The Times had early access to Ms. Lively\u2019s state civil rights complaint.",
      "\u201cMr. Baldoni\u2019s lawyers base their erroneous claim on postings by amateur internet sleuths, who, not surprisingly, are wrong,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe sleuths have noted that a version of the Lively state complaint published by The Times carries the date \u2018December 10\u2019 even though the\u00a0complaint wasn\u2019t filed until more than a week later. The problem: that date is generated by Google software and is unrelated to the date when The Times received it and posted it.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Lively, Reynolds and Sloane for comment on the amended complaint.",
      "The website launch comes weeks after Freedman released behind-the-scenes footage that he argues doesn't corroborate Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on set. In her December legal complaint, Lively alleged that Baldoni improvised scenes of physical intimacy and crossed boundaries.",
      "Her lawyers responded to the footage release in a statement to NBC News, claiming, \u201cThe video shows Mr. Baldoni repeatedly leaning in toward Ms. Lively, attempting to kiss her, kissing her forehead, rubbing his face and mouth against her neck, flicking her lip with his thumb, caressing her, telling her how good she smells, and talking with her out of character,\u201d Lively\u2019s legal team said. \u201cEvery moment of this was improvised by Mr. Baldoni with no discussion or consent in advance, and no intimacy coordinator present.\u00a0Mr. Baldoni was not only Ms. Lively\u2019s co-star, but the director, the head of studio and Ms. Lively\u2019s boss.\u201d",
      "Freedman previously said in a January interview on TODAY that his team planned  \u201cto release every single text message between the two of them,\u201d referring to Baldoni and Lively.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing that in any way is a concern about this entire situation from our perspective, and we want the truth to be out there,\u201d Freedman said at the time.",
      "A U.S. district court judge said Jan. 27 that Baldoni and Lively's lawsuits will be joined and both cases will go to trial March 9, 2026, according to documents obtained by NBC News.",
      "A pretrial conference is scheduled for Feb. 3."

      "The commercial starts with Chris Pratt using his Ray-Ban Meta AI-powered glasses to look at the fine art piece \"Comedian\" by Maurizio Cattelan, which features a banana duct taped to a wall. One of the three \"Comedian\" editions sold at auction this past November 2024 for $6.2 million.",
      "Pratt keeps looking around when Chris Hemsworth, who is also wearing a pair of the glasses, joins him while eating a banana. This prompts Pratt to look back and see the banana has been ripped away from the piece of duct tape.",
      "\"That's a 6.2 million dollar banana!\" Pratt exclaims to Hemsworth.",
      "\"Are you kidding?\" Hemsworth cooly responds.",
      "\"We need to find you another banana,\" Pratt says.",
      "The pair then search through a refrigerator filled with green vegetables in hopes of finding a new fruit to place on the wall. Suddenly, they stop in their tracks when they hear, \"Gentlemen.\"",
      "They turn to see Kris Jenner, as viewers discover the scene is taking place in her house and not some fancy gallery or museum.",
      "\"What a place you have,\" Hemsworth says, trying to make small talk.",
      "\u201cWho eats art?\u201d she quickly responds.",
      "Pratt and Hemsworth proceed to tell her the correct way to ask her question using AI-powered glasses.",
      "\"Like, 'Hey Meta, who eats art?'\" Pratt rephrases, pointing to Hemsworth for the answer, who says, \"Chris Pratt.\"",
      "\u201cHey Meta, call my lawyer,\u201d Jenner quips, using her own pair.",
      "The commercial, helmed by \u201cX-Men: First Class\u201d director Matthew Vaughn, is one of two ads featuring Pratt and Hemsworth for Meta.",
      "This spot also marks Meta\u2019s second time releasing a Super Bowl ad, after the company plugged its Quest 2 in a commercial in 2022."

On Friday, Myanmar state media reported that the state of emergency that has been in place since the coup had been extended for another six months, further delaying promised elections.",
      "Though the junta remains in charge, its hold on power has slipped in the face of a coordinated offensive by ethnic rebel groups that have fought the Myanmar military for decades. In the past year the government has lost control of vast swaths of territory around the country, creating instability along Myanmar\u2019s borders with Thailand, India, China and others.",
      "\u201cI want to help my friends, but I don\u2019t want to kill people,\u201d Thein said. \u201cSo I treated the wounded people or wounded soldiers.\u201d",

      "Mae Sot has long been a place for Burmese to seek sanctuary, but it is an uneasy refuge. It is filled with people waiting for resettlement, living with constant anguish while facing the risk of arrest and deportation.",
      "Every month, Burmese who lack the documents needed to stay in Thailand legally have to pay local police 300 baht ($9) to obtain a card that prevents them from being detained or deported, but many find this fee unaffordable.",
      "\u201cSome patients were arrested on the way to the clinic by the Thai police because they have no documents,\u201d Thein said.",
      "The clinic\u2019s founder, Cynthia Maung, was also a doctor in Myanmar before she fled in 1988 amid a crackdown by the military government on a pro-democracy uprising.",
      "\u201cI think the struggles now and back then are very similar,\u201d she said.",

      "Though she said she had not personally faced any abuse from the junta, \u201cit is so frustrating to see them brutally shoot the protesters,\u201d she said.",

      "Trudeau announced Saturday night that Canada would respond by issuing its own 25% tariff on $155 billion Canadian worth of U.S. goods. That would include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, the day the U.S. said it would begin collecting tariffs on Canadian goods.",
      "Trudeau said the rest of the tariffs would come in about three weeks \u201cto allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives.\u201d",
      "Since the announcement on Saturday, administration officials and Trump have shared mixed messages about the intention of the tariffs and what steps would need to be taken to have them lifted.",
      "The White House said in the executive order issuing the tariffs that the move was in response to the flow of fentanyl and immigrants coming into the country from Canada and Mexico, which Trump was declaring a national emergency. Under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the president has authority over trade in a national emergency.",
      "Nearly all of the 21,900 pounds of fentanyl seized by U.S. law enforcement in 2024 was at the southern border, with just 43 pounds of fentanyl seized at the northern border, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "But in several social media posts over the weekend, Trump seemed to contradict that rationale, instead citing a trade deficit with the three countries and calling on companies to make their products in America. In another posting, Trump said the tariffs would pressure Canada to join the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don\u2019t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada \u2014 AND NO TARIFFS!\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Administration officials went on cable news this morning to reiterate that the move was about drugs and immigration and accused Canada of misunderstanding the intention of the tariffs.",
      "\"This isn\u2019t a \u2018trade war\u2019 with Canada, or Mexico, or China \u2014 this is about fentanyl,\" said Interior Secretary Douglas Burgum on Fox News. \"We\u2019ve had a mass invasion of our country.\""

Canada and Mexico are also close partners. They\u2019re not adversaries. He is swinging the bat when you don\u2019t even need to do that. America already has the upper hand.\u201d",
      "Taking a tough stance with smaller, largely pro-American countries may seem a low-risk proposition for Trump. None wants to antagonize a superpower. Nor do any have nuclear missiles aimed at U.S. cities.",
      "But there are risks to Trump's brand of diplomacy, national security analysts and former officials say. Nations may rethink their ties to the United States and embrace an eager suitor with billions to spend: China.",
      "\"Colombia is one of a couple of dozen countries with important strategic relations with the U.S. that are increasingly hedging in their relations with China and Russia,\" said a former Biden administration national security official, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. \"This will demonstrate to them that the U.S. is the kind of partner that pulls this s---.

      "Vice President JD Vance defended Trump's actions Sunday on X.",
      "\u201cSpare me the sob story about how Canada is our 'best friend,'\" Vance wrote. \u201cI love Canada and have many Canadian friends. But is the government meeting their NATO target for military spending? Are they stopping the flow of drugs into our country? I\u2019m sick of being taken advantage of.\u201d",

By contrast, Pew wrote in 2021 that \"throughout Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, publics around the world held the United States in low regard, with most opposed to his foreign policies.\"",
      "\u201cLook, there\u2019s a problem with that [Trump's] approach, which is you\u2019ve got significant numbers of countries that have deepened and widened their relations with China over the past decade and a half,\u201d said Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States. \u201cSo this type of Frank Sinatra doctrine \u2014 my way or the highway \u2014 is going to throw a lot of these countries deeper into the embrace of China.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s not clear, though, that the dustup with Colombia was necessary. Colombian President Gustavo Petro had objected to the Trump administration\u2019s sending people back on military planes, saying they shouldn\u2019t be treated like criminals.",

We did that over and over again. What\u2019s different is Trump wanted to do this with military flights. Colombia initially said no to that. Now they\u2019ll take the flights. In terms of limiting migration, it doesn\u2019t matter if the flights are military or civilian.\u201d",

      "Officials from the Trump administration had said earlier on Friday that one of Grenell\u2019s top aims for the visit was to secure the release of Americans detained in the country, at a time when the Trump administration has been driving a deportation and anti-gang push in the United States.",
      "Grenell did not name the six men, shown with him aboard an airplane in a photo he posted online. They were dressed in light blue outfits used by the Venezuelan prison system.",
      "\u201cWe are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens,\u201d Grenell posted on X. \u201cThey just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and they couldn\u2019t stop thanking him.\u201d",
      "Trump cheered the move in his own post, saying Grenell was bringing \u201csix hostages home from Venezuela.\u201d",
      "It is unclear exactly how many Americans were being held by Venezuela, but Venezuelan officials have spoken publicly of at least nine.",
      "Maduro\u2019s officials have accused most of them of terrorism and said some were high-level \u201cmercenaries.\u201d The Venezuelan government regularly accuses members of the opposition and foreign detainees of conspiring with the U.S. to commit terrorism. U.S. officials have always denied any plots.",
      "\u201cAmerican hostages that are being held in Venezuela ... must be released immediately,\u201d Mauricio Claver-Carone, the U.S. special\u00a0envoy\u00a0for Latin America, said earlier on Friday, adding the Grenell-Maduro meeting was \u201cnot a negotiation in exchange for anything.\u201d",
      "In late 2023, Venezuela\u2019s government released\u00a0dozens of prisoners, including 10 Americans, after months of negotiations, while the U.S. released a close ally of Maduro.",

      "\u201cThere are things where we\u2019ve reached initial deals and when they are complied with, new issues will open, hopefully new deals for the good of the two countries and the region,\u201d Maduro said, adding he would be looking to see if what had been discussed with Grenell was reflected in what is communicated by the U.S. about the meeting.",
      "\u201cPresident Donald Trump, we have made a first step, hopefully it can continue,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cWe would like it to continue.\u201d",

      "An agreement on Tren de Aragua deportations was \u201cnon-negotiable,\u201d Claver-Carone said.",
      "Venezuelan attorney general Tarek Saab said last week that the gang had been dismantled in Venezuela in 2023, but that it was willing to restart legal cooperation with the U.S. in order to extradite gang members.",
      "Since taking power on Jan. 20, Trump has kicked off a\u00a0sweeping immigration crackdown, pledging mass deportations.",
      "Some 600,000 Venezuelans in the United States were eligible for deportation reprieves granted by the previous administration, but U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she would cut the duration of the protections. She must\u00a0decide by Saturday\u00a0whether to terminate them.",
      "Grenell\u2019s visit does not mean the United States recognizes Maduro as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader, Leavitt said.",
      "The two countries have a fraught recent history marked by broken relations, sanctions and accusations of coup-plotting.",
      "But they share interest in several\u00a0pending bilateral issues, including a license allowing U.S. oil major Chevron\u00a0to operate in Venezuela.",
      "The administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden reinstated broad oil sanctions after it said Maduro failed to keep promises for a free presidential election and later\u00a0increased rewards\u00a0for the capture or conviction of leaders including Maduro, leaving Trump limited options for further penalties.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government-backed victory in the July 2024 vote is contested by the opposition, international observers and numerous countries, including the United States.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government has always rejected sanctions by the United States and others, saying they are illegitimate measures which amount to an \u201ceconomic war\u201d designed to cripple Venezuela.",

      "The White House said Friday that President Donald Trump would impose a 25% tariff on goods coming to the U.S. from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on those from China on Saturday, a move that could drive up prices for products coming into the U.S. from those countries.",
      "Trump had said he would issue those tariffs on the first day of his presidency, then said on Inauguration Day that the tariffs would be put in place on Feb. 1. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Friday that Trump would carry through on that Feb. 1 deadline.",
      "Trump said Friday that there was nothing that the three countries could do to avoid the tariffs, which he said were in response to the import of fentanyl into the U.S. and because the U.S. has a trade deficit with the three countries. The U.S. is considered to have a trade deficit with those countries because it buys more goods and services from them than it sells to them.",
      "The tariffs could increase how much U.S. consumers and businesses pay for goods coming from Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 including electronics, toys, shoes, fresh produce, lumber and cars. Tariffs are paid by companies importing goods into the U.S., similar to a tax.",
      "While some businesses will look to source goods elsewhere, others with no alternatives will be forced to pay the fees. Companies will have to decide whether to pass these higher costs to consumers or absorb them, which would dent profits or require cuts to protect their margins. The implications could be wide-reaching across the U.S. economy, in part because American consumers and businesses imported more goods from Mexico than any other country.",
      "Trump also said he would be putting tariffs on oil and gas imports in the next several weeks as well as on computer chips, steel and aluminum, but didn't provide any details. In addition, he said he would be putting a \"tariff wall\" around pharmaceuticals to bring the industry back to the U.S.",
      "\"It'll be a tremendous amount of money for our country, tremendous amount, these are big numbers,\" Trump told reporters Friday. \"And in addition to that, and you see the power of the tariff, I mean, the tariff is good, and nobody can compete with us because we have by far the biggest piggy bank.\"",
      "When asked about the impact tariffs will have on inflation, Leavitt cited relatively low inflation during Trump's first term when he placed tariffs on billions of Chinese goods.",
      "\"President Trump is going to do everything he possibly can to cut the inflation crisis that the previous administration imposed on the American people, and he will continue to effectively utilize tariffs,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Tariffs during Trump's first term were more limited in scope than the current proposal and included a long list of exemptions and delays for certain products and industries. Economists have found those tariffs drove up prices for some imports, led to a net loss of manufacturing jobs and reduced corporate investments as a result of higher costs companies had to pay to import materials and parts.",
      "Mexico and Canada have threatened to retaliate with their own tariffs on U.S. imports, which could hurt American businesses that sell to those countries, like oil producers, farmers and manufacturers.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that he was meeting with U.S. and Canadian officials to try to prevent the tariffs from being put in place, but that Canada was prepared to respond if tariffs were enacted.",
      "\u201cIf the President does choose to implement any tariffs against Canada, we\u2019re ready with a response. A purposeful, forceful, but reasonable immediate response,\u201d Trudeau said Friday. \"We won\u2019t relent until tariffs are removed and, of course, everything is on the table.\u201d",
      "During Trump's first term, China placed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agriculture products, and nearly all the revenue collected by the U.S. from the tariffs on China went to payments to American farmers to offset their losses from those Chinese tariffs.",
      "The U.S. auto industry is among the most vulnerable to the tariffs on Mexico and Canada. For decades, its supply chains have been heavily intertwined with America\u2019s neighbors to the north and south. As vehicles and components cross borders multiple times during the production process, repeated 25% levies could quickly drive up vehicle costs.",
      "The U.S. also depends on agricultural products from Mexico, one of the top suppliers of tomatoes, avocados, berries and peppers. Rising food prices have been a top concern for consumers and voters, with grocery costs up around 25% over the past four years \u2014 an issue Trump hammered on the campaign trail.",
      "The tariffs on Canada could also drive up prices of oil imported from Canada and Canadian lumber,  which could drive up the cost of new homes and other construction projects.",
