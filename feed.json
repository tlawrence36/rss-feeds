      "Speaking to the press on Tuesday, Soyinka said he believed it had little to do with him and was instead a product of the United States' immigration policies. He said he was told to reapply if he wished to enter again.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about me, I\u2019m not really interested in going back to the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a principle is involved. Human beings deserve to be treated decently wherever they are.\u201d",
      "Soyinka, who has taught in the U.S. and previously held a green card, joked on Tuesday that his green card \u201chad an accident\u201d eight years ago and \u201cfell between a pair of scissors.\u201d In 2017, he destroyed his green card in protest of President Trump's first inauguration.",
      "The letter he received informing him of his visa revocation cites \u201cadditional information became available after the visa was issued,\u201d as the reason for its revocation, but does not describe what that information was.",

      "More than 100 investigators are racing to solve a daring heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris",
      "PARIS -- More than 100 investigators are racing to piece together how thieves pulled off the brazen heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, working to recover the stolen gems and bring those responsible to justice.",
      "The daytime theft of centuries-old jewels from the world's most-visited museum thought to be of significant cultural and monetary value has captured the world's attention for its audacity and movie plot-like details.",
      "But thus far little has been revealed about how the investigation is unfolding, a source of frustration for those accustomed to the 24-hour flow of information in American true crime or British tabloids.",
      "Suspects, like the jewels themselves, have remained out of sight, the case file cloaked in mystery and French authorities characteristically discreet.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on Sunday that more details would come once the suspects\u2019 custody period ends, likely around midweek, depending on the charges. But here's what we know so far about the case:",
      "Authorities said it took mere minutes for thieves to ride a lift up the side of the museum, smash display cases and steal eight objects worth an estimated 88 million euros ($102 million) on Oct. 19. The haul included a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense.",
      "Beccuau has not publicly announced what charges the suspects could face, though French media have reported that the charges include criminal conspiracy and organized theft, which can carry hefty fines and yearslong prison sentences.",
      "Beccuau said investigators made several arrests Saturday evening but didn\u2019t name them or say how many. One suspect, she added, was stopped at a Paris airport while trying to leave the country.",
      "In France, where privacy laws are strict, images of criminal suspects are not made public as they often are elsewhere. Suspects aren\u2019t paraded before cameras upon arrest or shown in mugshots.",
      "The presumption of innocence is inscribed in France's constitution and deeply valued throughout society. The French often express shock at the spectacle of criminal trials in the United States, including in 2011 when media outlets photographed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then a candidate in France's presidential election, on a \u201cperp walk\u201d to a New York prison after he was indicted on charges he sexually assaulted a hotel maid. The charges were eventually dismissed.",
      "Information about investigations is meant to be secret under French law, a policy known as \u2033secret d\u2019instruction\" and only the prosecutor can speak publicly about developments.",
      "Police and investigators are not supposed to divulge information about arrests or suspects without the prosecutor's approval, though in previous high-profile cases, police union officials have leaked partial details. Beccuau on Saturday rued the leak of information about the ongoing investigation.",
      "A police official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing case, told The Associated Press that two men in their 30s, both known to police, were taken into custody. He said one suspect was arrested as he attempted to board a plane bound for Algeria.",

      "Those assigned include the Brigade for the Repression of Banditry, the special police unit in charge of armed robberies, serious burglaries and art thefts.",
      "Recovering the jewels could be among the most difficult parts of investigators' work. French authorities have added the jewels to Interpol\u2019s Stolen Works of Art Database, a global repository of about 57,000 missing cultural items.",
      "Interpol, the world\u2019s largest international police network, does not issue arrest warrants. But if authorities worry a suspect may flee, Interpol can circulate the information using a color-coded notice system.",
      "The French investigators can also work with European authorities if required. They can turn to the European Union\u2019s judicial cooperation agency, Eurojust, or its law enforcement agency, Europol. Eurojust works through judicial cooperation between prosecutors and magistrates, while Europol works with police agencies.",
      "Both can help facilitate investigations and arrests throughout the 27-member bloc. Requests for help must come from the national authorities, and neither organization can initiate an investigation.",
      "Beccuau said more details would be released once the suspects' time in custody expires. How long that lasts depends on what they\u2019re accused of. If, as French media have reported, they\u2019re being investigated for criminal conspiracy, they can be held for up to 96 hours before charges are filed.",
      "But don\u2019t expect a flood of updates. Indictments and verdicts are not routinely made public in France. French trials are not televised, and journalists are not allowed to film or photograph anything inside the courtroom during a trial.",

      "Her portrayals of warm, compassionate mothers endeared her to young viewers, and decades later baby boomers flocked to nostalgia conventions to meet Lockhart and buy her autographed photos.",
      "Offscreen, Lockhart insisted, she was nothing like the women she portrayed.",
      "\u201cI must quote Dan Rather,\u201d she said in a 1994 interview. \u201cI can control my reputation, but not my image, because my image is how you see me.",
      "\u201cI love rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and going to the concerts. I have driven Army tanks and flown in hot air balloons. And I go plane-gliding \u2014 the ones with no motors. I do a lot of things that don\u2019t go with my image.\u201d",
      "Early in her career, Lockhart appeared in numerous films. Among them: \u201cAll This and Heaven Too,\u201d \u201cAdam Had Four Sons,\u201d \u201cSergeant York,\u201d \u201cMiss Annie Rooney,\u201d \u201cForever and a Day\u201d and \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis.\u201d",
      "She also made \u201cSon of Lassie,\u201d the 1945 sequel to \u201cLassie, Come Home,\u201d playing the grown-up version of the role created by Elizabeth Taylor.",
      "When her movie career as an adult faltered, Lockhart shifted to television, appearing in live drama from New York and game and talk shows. She was the third actress to play the female lead in \u201cLassie\u201d on TV, following Jan Clayton and Cloris Leachman. (Provost had replaced the show\u2019s original child star, Tommy Rettig, in 1957.)",
      "Lockhart spoke frankly about her canine co-star. In the first place, she said in 1989, Lassie was a laddie, because male collies \u201care bigger, the ruff is bigger, they\u2019re more imposing looking.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cI worked with four Lassies. There was only one main Lassie at a time. Then there was a dog that did the running, a dog that did the fighting, and a dog that was a stand-in, because only humans can work 14 hours a day without needing a nap.",
      "\u201cLassie was not especially friendly with anybody. Lassie was wholly concentrated on the trainers.\u201d",
      "After six years in the rural setting of \u201cLassie,\u201d Lockhart moved to outer space, embarking on the role of Maureen Robinson, the wise, reassuring mother of a family that departs on a five-year flight to a faraway planet in \u201cLost in Space.\u201d",

      "\u201cHer true passion was journalism,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cShe loved going to the White House briefing rooms.\u201d",

      "Their daughter was born June 25, 1925, in New York City. The family moved to Hollywood 10 years later, and Gene Lockhart worked steadily as a character actor, usually in avuncular roles, sometimes as a villain. His wife, Kathleen, often appeared with him.",

      "She was married and divorced twice: to John Maloney, a physician, father of her daughters Anne Kathleen and June Elizabeth; and architect John C. Lindsay.",
      "Throughout her later career, Lockhart was connected in the public mind with \u201cLassie.\u201d",
      "Even though she sometimes mocked the show, she conceded: \u201cHow wonderful that in a career there is one role for which you are known. Many actors work all their lives and never have one part that is really theirs.\u201d",

      "The presence of a Greek navy band playing mournful music was indicative of the change in Savvopoulos\u2019s status, from someone lionized by anarchist-leaning leftists in the 1960s and 1970s and dismissed by the establishment as a long-haired freak, to a figure embraced by the same establishment and cultural mainstream.",

Always a political animal, he didn't shy away from criticizing the left and its illusions, especially on his 1989 album \u201cThe Haircut,\u201d whose sleeve showed him beardless with long locks. A few of his songs drew the enmity of some of his longtime admirers. The beard grew back but his politics remained moderate.",
      "Conservative Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the first of many who eulogized Savvopoulos during the funeral service, used the lyrics of the 1972 song \u201cMessenger Angel\" to portray the artist as a speaker of uncomfortable truths that many did not want to hear. \u201cIf he had no pleasant news to tell/better tell us none,\u201d he quoted the song's ending.",
      "Others who joined in eulogizing Savvopoulos were former President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, fellow musicians, artists and literary figures, some from his hometown of Thessaloniki, and one of his two grandsons.",

I hadn\u2019t really listened to their music or their voices at all growing up and getting introduced to them in college, it just felt like another world had opened up and I felt like I wanna sing, I wanna be able to move people the way that they move me with their voices.",

      "Bill Swick, who has a rare degenerative brain disease, has lost access to virtual speech therapy due to the federal government shutdown",
      "MINOOKA, Ill. -- Bill Swick has a rare degenerative brain disease that inhibits his mobility and speech. Instead of the hassle of traveling an hour to a clinic in downtown Chicago to visit a speech therapist, he has benefited from virtual appointments from the comfort of his home.",
      "But Swick, 53, hasn\u2019t had access to those appointments for the last month.",
      "The federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, halted funding for the Medicare telehealth program that pays his provider for her services. So, Swick and his wife are practicing old strategies rather than learning new skills to manage his growing difficulties with processing language, connecting words and pacing himself while speaking.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because we want to continue with his journey, with his progress,\u201d 45-year-old Martha Swick, a caregiver for her husband since his diagnosis three years ago, said during an interview at their home in Minooka, Illinois. \u201cI try to have all his therapy and everything organized for him, to make his day easier and smoother, and then everything has a hitch, and we have to stop and wait.\u201d",
      "Their experience has become common in recent weeks among the millions of patients with Medicare fee-for-service plans who count on pandemic-era telehealth waivers to attend medical appointments from home.",
      "With Congress unable to agree on a deal to fund the government, the waivers have lapsed, even with support from Republicans and Democrats. As a result, medical providers are deciding whether they can continue offering telehealth services without the guarantee of reimbursement or whether they need to halt virtual visits altogether.",
      "That\u2019s left a patient population of mostly older adults with fewer options to seek specialists or get help when they can\u2019t physically travel far from home.",
      "Swick, whose corticobasal degeneration causes symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, can\u2019t feed or dress himself anymore and struggles with balance and walking. Add on the logistical nightmare of driving to the city in traffic, and in-person speech therapy appointments aren\u2019t a worthwhile ordeal for him and his wife.",
      "But missing even a few appointments can impede progress for patients with dementia and other degenerative conditions who depend on continuity of care, experts said.",
      "It \u201cfeels like you\u2019re taking a step back,\u201d Swick said in the interview.",
      "Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Medicare only paid for virtual medical appointments under narrow circumstances, including in designated rural areas and when patients logged in from eligible sites, like hospitals and clinics.",
      "That changed in 2020, when Trump\u2019s first administration dramatically expanded telehealth coverage in response to the public health emergency. Medicare started reimbursing a wide range of telehealth visits, stripping the geographic requirement, and allowing patients to take calls from their homes.",
      "Congress has routinely extended the telehealth flexibilities and was poised to do so again before their Sept. 30 expiration. But when budget negotiations stalled and the government shut down Oct. 1, the vote never happened, leaving the program temporarily unfunded.",
      "With more than 4 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries using telehealth in the first half of 2025, according to Brown University\u2019s School of Public Health, the pause has had a major impact on an already vulnerable population.",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The Alaska Supreme Court is weighing a case that is expected to determine who can provide abortion care in the state.",
      "The court heard arguments Wednesday in a 2019 case challenging the constitutionality of a law that states only a doctor licensed by the State Medical Board can perform an abortion in Alaska.",
      "The law, dating to the 1970s, was struck down as unconstitutional by Superior Court judge Josie Garton last year, a victory for the group that brought the challenge, Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky. The state appealed Garton's ruling.",
      "Planned Parenthood has argued there is no medical justification for the restriction and that it unfairly burdens those seeking an abortion by limiting the pool of those qualified to provide care. In 2021, Garton granted the group\u2019s request to allow advanced practice clinicians \u2014 health care workers, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants \u2014 to provide medication abortion pending her decision in the underlying case. They have continued to do so and since the 2024 ruling also have been able to provide procedural abortions, Planned Parenthood says.",
      "Advanced practice clinicians routinely provide care similar in risk and complexity to that of providing abortion services, and in 25 states can provide medication abortion, attorneys for Planned Parenthood said in court documents. Planned Parenthood's advanced practice clinicians seek to provide abortion care in just the first trimester, the attorneys said.",
      "Since Garton's 2021 decision, advanced practice clinicians have been providing \u201cnearly all\u201d medication abortions in Alaska, and Planned Parenthood clinics in the state have been able to offer medication abortion each day they've been open, the attorneys wrote. Before that, doctors hired by Planned Parenthood on a per diem basis \u2014 at the clinics on limited days \u2014 were able to offer medication abortions perhaps once or twice a week at each clinic, they wrote.",
      "A vital statistics report released by the state this year shows that the total number of abortions in Alaska has been fairly consistent \u2014 1,229 in 2021, 1,247 in 2022, 1,222 in 2023 and 1,224 last year. The report says that could include cases where medication was provided to manage a miscarriage, but without providing a number. It also says reasons for ending pregnancies are not reported to the state.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a federal right to abortion, leaving it up to each state to regulate.",

      "The compensation was negotiated with Germany\u2019s finance ministry and is the largest budget for frail and vulnerable Holocaust survivor home care in the organization\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cThis historic increase to home care funding reflects the complex and growing needs of Holocaust survivors worldwide,\u201d said Gideon Taylor, the president of the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference.",
      "\u201cWhile we are losing survivors at a rapid pace each year, those who remain are older, frailer and in greater need than ever before,\u201d Taylor said in a written statement. \"This budget is critical in providing each of them the opportunity to age in place, a dignity that was stolen from them in their youth.\u201d",
      "The average age of survivors receiving home care through Claims Conference funding has increased from 86 in 2018 to 88.5 in 2024. Data collected by the organization show that survivors are experiencing more complicated health needs and increased disability, with the number of survivors who qualify for full-time assistance due to extreme disability \u2014 such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia \u2014 has nearly doubled during that time period.",
      "Additionally, the Hardship Fund Supplemental payments, which were previously guaranteed to be paid annually to eligible Holocaust survivors until 2027, have been extended through 2028 at an amount of \u20ac1,450 per survivor, impacting more than 127,000 Holocaust survivors globally.",
      "The Claims Conference projected in April that approximately 200,000 survivors are still alive, most of them living in Israel, the United States and Europe, but also scattered all over the globe.",
      "Also, righteous rescuers \u2013 non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust - currently receiving a monthly pension from the Claims Conference, will be eligible to receive home care similar to that provided to Jewish survivors, allowing them to live their final years with dignity in their own homes, the group announced.",

      "Younger generations of Americans are increasingly citing climate change as making them reticent to have children, according to several studies. They are worried about bringing children into a world with increasing and more intense extreme weather events, a result of climate change, which is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when oil, gas coal are burned. And they are concerned about the impact their offspring will have on the planet.",
      "In a 2024 Lancet study of people 16 to 25 years old, the majority of respondents were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d worried about climate change. The study also found that 52% said they were hesitant to have children because of climate change. Adults under 50 years old without children were four times more likely than adults over 50 without children to say that climate plays a factor in their decision, according to a Pew Research Center report published last year. And a study published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found more than half of respondents said \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cmaybe\u201d to whether climate change made them question having children.",
      "Parenthood and climate change are related not just because of fears for a child's well-being, but also by concern for the planet's well-being.",
      "Compared to the carbon emissions of all the other decisions, \"having a child is by far, by orders of magnitude, larger,\u201d said Nandita Bajaj, executive director of Population Balance, which is a nonprofit focused on humans' environmental impact.",
      "Unlike other choices, procreation comes with something that bioethics professor Travis Rieder of Johns Hopkins University calls \u201ccarbon legacy.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not only doing carbon expensive activities like buying a larger house and a larger car and diapers and all that,\" said Rieder. \u201cYou\u2019re also creating someone who is going to have their own carbon footprint for the rest of their lives.\u201d",
      "That child might have children, and those children might have children, creating an impact that lasts generations, Rieder added. Of course, the logical extreme of minimizing an environmental footprint means having no children, Rieder said, which he is not advocating.",
      "It's tricky to quantify the impact of a child. That's because there's no consensus on what percentage of their impact is the parent's responsibility, and partly because the impact of that child depends on their parents' lifestyle.",
      "\u201cOne of the best predictors of how carbon-expensive they\u2019ll be is how wealthy you are,\u201d Rieder said.",
      "For example, the U.S. emits 123 times more carbon emissions than Ghana, according to the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. Adjusted for population size, that means the average American emits more than 12 times as much as the average Ghanan.",
      "Procreation might have the largest climate impact, but when it comes to actions people can take to reduce their personal contribution to global warming, having fewer children often isn't discussed.",
      "Researchers who study climate change and family planning give two reasons.",
      "\u201cIf a person tells you that they\u2019re expecting or that they are pregnant, the immediate response is to offer some kind of support, congratulate them, that sort of thing,\" said Trevor Hedberg, who teaches moral philosophy at the University of Arizona.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A New Hampshire man is resuming dialysis after living with a gene-edited pig kidney for a record 271 days, doctors said Monday. His experience is helping researchers in their quest for animal-to-human transplants.",
      "Tim Andrews, 67, had the organ removed on Oct. 23 because its function was declining, according to Mass General Brigham. In a statement, his transplant team called Andrews \u201ca selfless medical pioneer and an inspiration\u201d to patients with kidney failure.",
      "Andrews\u2019 experience illustrates lessons researchers have learned with each experiment involving what's called xenotransplantation. The first attempts using pig organs gene-edited to be more humanlike \u2013 two hearts and two kidneys \u2013 were short-lived.",
      "Then researchers began considering patients not nearly as sick as prior recipients for these experiments \u2014 and an Alabama woman\u2019s pig kidney lasted 130 days before it had to be removed last spring, the record Andrews surpassed.",
      "More than 100,000 people, most needing kidneys, are on the U.S. transplant list, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Andrews, of Concord, New Hampshire, knew his blood type is particularly hard to match and sought an alternative, getting into shape to qualify for Mass General\u2019s xenotransplant pilot study. His doctors said he remains on the transplant list.",
      "In June, the Mass General team transplanted a pig kidney into another New Hampshire man who continues to fare well. The pilot study is set to conclude with a third pig kidney transplant later this year.",

      "HOUSTON -- HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Hurricane season can be stressful for anyone near the potential path of a storm, as powerful winds and heavy rain can cause widespread damage, cut power for days or weeks and otherwise upend people's lives.",
      "But the stress can be reduced if people have a plan for preparing their homes and for deciding whether to stay and ride out a storm or evacuate, according to emergency management officials. That preparation, which includes putting together a kit of essential supplies, should begin long before a storm is approaching.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t be complacent, take preparedness seriously, spend the time now to do the little things that will make a big difference for you and your loved ones when something does happen,\u201d said Brian Mason, director of Houston\u2019s Office of Emergency Management.",
      "Anything in the backyard that isn\u2019t tied down, such as furniture and barbecue grills, should be secured or brought inside so it doesn't become a projectile that can come through a window, said Shawn Schulze, regional CEO for the American Red Cross Texas Gulf Coast Region.",
      "If possible, board up windows and place important documents such as passports and birth certificates in a waterproof case or even a Ziploc bag, Schulze said. That will prevent damage and make documents easier to locate in a quick evacuation.",
      "Mason recommends that homeowners get their roofs inspected before each hurricane season and know how to turn off their utilities in case of damage.",
      "Well before a storm is brewing, people should trim or remove dead or weakened tree limbs and shrubs that hang over their homes to lessen potential damage from high winds, said Mistie Hinote, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Insurance.",
      "Hinote also urged people to review what type of insurance coverage they have and to make a home inventory of their possessions by taking photos of them in case an insurance claim needs to be made after a storm.",
      "\u201cIt is a lot of information and a lot of pre-storm steps but a little at a time,\u201d Hinote said.",
      "Every family should have an emergency kit with supplies to meet its basic needs.",
      "For people who stay, a kit should include at least 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water per day per person, with enough for up to seven days, Mason said. One way to have enough water is to fill a bathtub.",
      "People should also have enough nonperishable food for up to seven days, as well as flashlights, batteries, candles, medications, portable power banks or other power sources, and a radio that runs on batteries.",

    "story": [
      "Notices of rising health insurance premiums are landing in voters\u2019 mailboxes and sending some to town halls to vent their frustration",
      "WASHINGTON -- The first caller on a telephone town hall with Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, leader of the House\u2019s conservative Freedom Caucus, came ready with a question about the Affordable Care Act. Her cousin's disabled son is at risk of losing the insurance he gained under that law, the caller said.",
      "\u201cNow she\u2019s looking at two or three times the premium that she\u2019s been paying for the insurance,\u201d said the woman, identified as Lisa from Harford County, Maryland. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to elucidate what the Republicans\u2019 plan is for health insurance?\u201d",
      "Harris, a seven-term Republican, didn\u2019t have a clear answer. \u201cWe think the solution is to try to do something to make sure all the premiums go down,\u201d he said, predicting Congress would \u201cprobably negotiate some off-ramp\u201d later.",
      "His uncertainty reflected a familiar Republican dilemma: Fifteen years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, the party remains united in criticizing the law but divided on how to move forward. That tension has come into sharp focus during the government shutdown as Democrats seize on rising premiums to pressure Republicans into extending expiring subsidies for the law, often referred to as Obamacare.",
      "President Donald Trump and GOP leaders say they\u2019ll consider extending the enhanced tax credits that otherwise expire at year's end \u2014 but only after Democrats vote to reopen the government. In the meantime, people enrolled in the plans are already being notified of hefty premium increases for 2026.",
      "As town halls fill with frustrated voters and no clear Republican plan emerges, the issue appears to be gaining political strength heading into next year's midterm elections.",
      "\u201cPremiums are going up whether it gets extended or not,\u201d said GOP Sen. Rick Scott. \u201cPremiums are going up because health care costs are going up. Because Obamacare is a disaster.\u201d",
      "At the center of the shutdown \u2014 now in its fourth week with no end in sight \u2014 is a Democratic demand that Affordable Care Act subsidies passed in 2021 be extended.",
      "Trump has long promised an alternative. \u201cThe cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it\u2019s not good Healthcare,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social in November 2023. \u201cI\u2019m seriously looking at alternatives.\u201d",
      "Pressed on health care during a September 2024 presidential debate, Trump said he had \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d",
      "But nearly 10 months into his presidency, that plan has yet to come. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told NBC on Wednesday, \u201cI fully believe the president has a plan,\u201d but didn't go into details.",
      "Republicans say they want a broader overhaul of the health care system, though such a plan would be difficult to advance before next year. Party leaders have not outlined how they\u2019ll handle the expiring tax credits, insisting they won\u2019t negotiate on the issue until Democrats agree to end the shutdown.",
      "A September analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that permanently extending the tax credits would increase the deficit by $350 billion from 2026 to 2035. The number of people with health insurance would rise by 3.8 million in 2035 if the credits are kept, CBO projected.",
      "Asked Wednesday on CNN whether Republicans have a plan to address the subsidies if the government reopened, House Speaker Mike Johnson said they had \u201cproposals\u201d that can be \u201cready immediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated, very complex issue, that requires a long time to build consensus around,\u201d he said.",
      "With notices of premium spikes landing in mailboxes now and the open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act health plans beginning Nov. 1, the political pressure has been evident in Republican town halls.",
      "In Idaho, Rep. Russ Fulcher told concerned callers that \u201cgovernment provided health care is the wrong path\u201d and that \u201cprivate health care is the right path.\u201d In Texas, freshman Rep. Brandon Gill responded to a caller facing a sharp premium increase by saying Republicans are focused on cutting waste, fraud and abuse.",

More than 24 million people were enrolled in the marketplace plans in 2025, up from about 11 million in 2020, according to an analysis from the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Sara from Middleville, Michigan, told Rep. John Moolenaar during his town hall that if health insurance premiums go up by as much as 75%, most people will probably go without heath care. \"So how do you address that?\u201d she asked.",
      "Moolenaar, who represents a district he handily won last year, responded: \u201cWe have time to negotiate, figure out a plan going forward and I think that\u2019s something that could occur.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhile we did not create this crisis, we now have both the responsibility and the opportunity to address it,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.",
      "Some Republicans dismiss projections that ACA premiums will more than double without the subsidies, calling them exaggerated and arguing the law has fueled fraud and abuse that must be curbed.",
      "Many Democrats credited their ability to flip the House in 2018 during Trump\u2019s first term to the GOP\u2019s attempt at repealing Obamacare, and they\u2019re forecasting a similar outcome this time.",
      "About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they trust the Democrats to do a better job handling health care, compared with about one-quarter who trust the Republicans more, a recent AP-NORC poll found. About one-quarter trust neither party, and about 1 in 10 trust both equally, according to the poll.",
      "Even as GOP leaders pledge to discuss ending the subsidies when the government opens, it's clear that many Republican lawmakers are adamantly opposed to an extension.",
      "\u201cAt least among Republicans, there\u2019s a growing sense that just maintaining the status quo is very destructive,\u201d said Brian Blase, the president of Paragon Health Institute and a former health policy adviser to Trump during his first term.",
      "Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he\u2019s working with multiple congressional offices on alternatives that would let the subsidies end. For example, he wants to expand the Affordable Care Act exemption given to U.S. territories to all 50 states and reintroduce a first-term Trump policy that gave Americans access to short-term health insurance plans outside the Affordable Care Act marketplace.",
      "Cannon declined to name the lawmakers he\u2019s working with, but said he hopes they act on his ideas \u201csooner than later.\u201d",
      "David McIntosh, president of the influential conservative group Club For Growth, told reporters Thursday that the group has \u201curged the Republicans not to extend those COVID-era subsidies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have a big spending problem,\u201d McIntosh said.",
      "\u201cI think most people are going to say, OK, I had a great deal during COVID,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now it\u2019s back to business as usual, and I should be paying for health care.\u201d",

      "CAIRO -- Aid workers worried Thursday that only a trickle of the people believed to have fled a paramilitary force that seized a city in Sudan\u2019s Darfur region have reached safety, as hundreds reportedly have been killed in the attack and while making their escape.",
      "People have been arriving to a town west of el-Fasher, having fled on foot during the attack by the Rapid Support Forces, which has been fighting troops allied to Sudan's military since 2023 in the East African nation.",
      "Already, the World Health Organization has warned the violence reportedly killed 460 people in a hospital in el-Fasher. Witnesses have told The Associated Press that RSF fighters also went from house to house, beating and shooting people, including women and children.",
      "Disrupted communications around el-Fasher has made assessing the devastation that much more difficult. Experts have said satellite photos also appear to show bodies in the streets of the city after the RSF attack.",
      "The smaller number of people reaching the town of Tawila, about 60 kilometers (35 miles) west of el-Fasher and not under the paramilitary group's control, have aid workers fearing the worst.",
      "\u201cThe number of people who made it to Tawila is very small and that should be a concern for all of us,\u201d said Malthide Vu, advocacy manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which manages the camp in Tawila for those displaced. \u201cWhere are the others? That tells the horror of the journey.\u201d",
      "The International Rescue Committee separately warned \u201chundreds of thousands of people are in grave danger in and around el-Fasher.\u201d Those arriving in Tawila traveled by foot at night and told its aid workers there had been arbitrary killings by RSF forces along their escape, which had been littered with bodies.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we are seeing so few people arriving safely in Tawila should alarm everyone. It raises urgent warnings about what is happening to those trying to flee El Fasher,\u201d said David Miliband, president of the IRC.",

The AP has not been able to independently confirm the hospital attack and death toll, given the chaos and the challenges in communicating with those still there.",
      "Mini Minawi, the governor of Darfur, shared a video online that purported to show RSF fighters inside the Saudi Hospital. The minute-long footage shows bodies lying on the floor in pools of blood. A fighter fires a single shot from a Kalashnikov-style rifle into a lone man sitting up, who then slumps to the floor. Other bodies could be seen outside. The AP could not independently verify the date, location or condition under which the video was recorded.",

The AP accessed and analyzed the same imagery, seeing objects and red stains on the ground at the sites that the lab identified as blood and bodies.",

In his first comments since the fall of el-Fasher, posted Wednesday on the Telegram messaging app, he said an investigation was opened. He did not elaborate.",

The capture of el-Fasher by the powerful Arab-led force raises fears that Africa\u2019s third-largest nation may split again, nearly 15 years after the oil-rich South Sudan gained independence following years of civil war. Sudan's military now fully holds its capital, Khartoum.",
      "That's seen the RSF focus on Darfur, particularly el-Fasher, which its forces had been besieging for more than 500 days.

But he choose not to dwell on them long, and snapped into action to rebuild.",
      "The hotelier's response sums up a mindset of many of the 300-odd residents of Blatten: They could have left their bucolic village in the southern L\u00f6tschental valley for dead \u2014 but instead decided to try to see it come alive again one day, and are taking steps to rebuild.",
      "Authorities evacuated villagers and livestock, but a 64-year-old man was killed as 9 million cubic meters of ice, stone and earth tumbled down from the Kleines Nesthorn peak on May 28. The landslide left a trail about 2-1/2 kilometers (about 1-1/2 miles) wide and 100 meters (about 330 feet) high in places.",
      "It all came down in about a half-minute, coating the valley in plumes of dust for kilometers (miles). More than 90% of village homes and buildings were destroyed.",
      "\u201cA lot of people were emotional of course, but I didn\u2019t get much too emotional,\" Kalbermatten said. \"I was really realistic and the emotions, they came later after three or four days.\"",
      "If the toll had been higher, locals say, many might not have wanted to return to Blatten.",
      "Kalbermatten, whose website for his Hotel Edelweiss in Blatten shows it half-sunk in a pea-soup-green pond created by the disaster, joined up with other local families to set up a temporary hotel at the summit of a gondola lift in the neighboring village of Wiler \u2014 one of three villages in the valley where most Blatten residents relocated.",
      "\u201cFor tourism in this valley it\u2019s also a catastrophe because we don\u2019t have enough beds for all the tourists,\" he said Tuesday. \u201cThe most important for us is to do something quickly.\u201d",

His wife, Esther Bellwald, is spearheading the new hotel with Kalbermatten. Its website said the families of the staff were \u201call deeply shaken and endlessly sad\u201d after the hotel was destroyed.",
      "\u201cThis project is a bit of the light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Hubert said in knee-deep snow near the construction site, with crews in short sleeves working fast under sunny skies for a planned Dec. 18 opening of the \u201cMomentum\u201d hotel.",

Some used rowboats to access attics of inundated homes.",
      "Others queued up to claim lost items found by cleanup crews \u2014 books, family photos, and heirlooms like a wedding dress.",
      "Manfred Ebener, the construction coordinator in Blatten, said some 400,000 cubic meters of rock and ice remains unstable atop the mountain, making for delicate work in the warmer summer and fall months. The snowfall and cool temperatures have helped solidify the rock and ice overhead, lowering the risks, but frozen ground will make digging harder.",
      "\u201cThe movements are declining,\u201d he said on a hillside overlooking the snow-covered mud cone, referring to the shifting geology that set off the landslide. \"We are looking at next spring with a bit of concern: The whole process will take place the other way around. When the snow melts, a lot of water gets back into the rock.\u201d",
      "Ebener says several years of clearing work, followed by construction of a new village, should pave the way for inhabitants of Blatten to go back by 2030.

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders' far-right Party for Freedom and the centrist D66 were were tied with nearly all votes counted Thursday in the Dutch general election in an unprecedented neck-and-neck race to become the biggest party.",
      "The near total vote count showed each party winning 26 seats in Wednesday's election, according to the vote count tallied and published by Dutch national news agency ANP and cited by Dutch media.",
      "The nail-biting finish is expected to lead to delays in starting the process of forming a new coalition. No Dutch election has previously ended with two parties tied for the lead.",
      "Wilders\u2019 Party for Freedom is forecast to lose 11 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, while D66, led by Rob Jetten, gains 11, according to the vote count.",
      "Wilders insisted early Thursday that his party should play a leading role in coalition talks if it is the largest.",
      "\u201cAs long as there\u2019s no 100% clarity on this, no D66 scout can get started. We will do everything we can to prevent this,\u201d he said. A scout is an official appointed by the winning party to look into possible coalitions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s neck and neck, a few thousand votes\u201d difference, D66 lawmaker Jan Paternotte told national broadcaster NOS. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been this close in the Netherlands before. There are often close elections ... but this time it\u2019s exceptionally close.\u201d",
      "The NOS said that votes from a small number of municipalities including three overseas municipalities and postal votes were yet to be tallied. It was not immediately clear when those votes would be registered.",
      "The result remains a momentous win for D66, whose biggest previous seat tally was 24. When the party reached that number in 2021, the leader at the time, Sigrid Kaag, danced for joy on a table at a party meeting.",

      "Despite vying for the top spot, Wilders\u2019 party, known by its Dutch acronym PVV, saw a sharp decline in its support in the early election, which he forced when he torpedoed the outgoing four-party coalition in June in a dispute over migration. His party was the biggest in the coalition which lasted just 11 months and was marked by infighting between its members.",

She noted that another right-wing party, JA21, which she described as a \u201cPVV-light party with equally undemocratic ideas,\u201d made big gains.

Violence erupted at a recent anti-immigration rally in The Hague \u2014 when rioters smashed the windows of the D66 headquarters \u2014 and protests against new asylum-seeker centers have been seen in municipalities around the country.",

      "PARIS -- Three Bulgarian men are on trial in Paris this week for alleged involvement in spray-painting blood-red hands on the city's Holocaust Memorial, an act of vandalism that French intelligence services link to a campaign by Russia to destabilize France and other Western societies.",
      "Some 500 red hands were painted last year on a wall honoring those who helped rescue Jews during World War II and around nearby Paris neighborhoods. The graffiti was initially viewed in the context of the war in Gaza, which has led to a rise in antisemitic incidents and tensions around Europe.",
      "But French intelligence services say the red hands were part of a long-term strategy by Russia to use paid proxies to divide public opinion, stoke social tensions and spread false information, according to court documents. Governments across Europe have accused Russia in recent years of a campaign of sabotage that has included paying people to commit acts of vandalism, arson and bombing attempts.",
      "Four Bulgarians are charged in the Holocaust Memorial case, but only three are in custody and were present for Wednesday\u2019s trial. The alleged ringleader, Mircho Angelov, is at large.",
      "The first to testify, Georgi Filipov, said he painted the red hands in exchange for 1,000 euros to help pay child support for his 9-year-old son. He said he was paid by Angelov and did not address accusations of Russian involvement.",
      "\u201cI acknowledge having participated in these acts. I formally apologize to the victims, and I apologize for the damage. I also apologize to the French authorities,\u201d he told the court through translators.",
      "Filipov said he was a former neo-Nazi and that he might have been recruited because his social media feeds showed him with neo-Nazi tattoos and a t-shirt praising Hitler. He described the tattoos as a \u201cbad choice from my past\u201d and claimed he only understood the antisemitic nature of the act upon his return to Bulgaria.",
      "Kiril Milushev testified that he filmed the graffiti at Angelov\u2019s instruction in exchange for 500 euros.",
      "\u201cI regret having participated in this act,\u201d he told the court.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Lucia Ort\u00edz trudges through endless fields of cempasuchil flowers, the luminescent orange petals of which will soon cloak everything from city streets to cemeteries across Mexico.",
      "Here, in the winding canals and farms on the fringes of Mexico City, the flower also known as the Mexican marigold has been farmed for generations, and takes the spotlight every year in the country's Day of the Dead celebrations.",
      "But as 50-year-old Ort\u00edz and other farmers busily bundle clusters of the plant to sell in markets around the capital, they quietly wonder what will be left of their livelihood down the line.",
      "That\u2019s because cempasuchil growers say they\u2019ve been left reeling by torrential rains, stretching drought and other impacts from climate change \u2014 caused by the burning of fuels like gas, oil and coal \u2013 that have grown increasingly common.",
      "Farmers, who depend on the ebbs and flows of the weather to cultivate their crops, are on the front line on the climate crisis. This year alone, cempasuchil producers said they lost up to half their flower crop from heavy rains and flooding.",
      "\u201cThis year, we lost a lot. We struggled to even grow the cempasuchil. There were moments in which we didn\u2019t have the money to buy fertilizer we needed,\u201d Ort\u00edz said. \u201cWith the cempasuchil plants, we\u2019ve sometimes been left with nothing.\u201d",
      "The orange flower has become a symbol of the country\u2019s celebrations that take place every Nov. 1 and 2. Also known as the \u201cflower of the dead\u201d, the cempasuchil is believed to be a point of connection between the worlds of the dead and the living, with bright petals that light the path of dead souls to the altars set out by their family.",
      "The flowers are also a crucial economic engine across Mexico, which commerce groups predict will rake in nearly 2.7 million dollars for farmers in 2025.",
      "Ort\u00edz and her family began growing the flower 30 years ago in their small plot of land in Xochimilco, a rural borough in the south of Mexico City where residents have continued to carry on ancient farming techniques using canals that wind through farmlands like a maze.",
      "Every year, locals begin to plant the marigold seeds in July, and grow the plants as rainy season winds down. But they say that they\u2019ve been dealt a heavy blow for consecutive years as heavy rains, drought, floods and other climate shifts have made it increasingly difficult to keep their crops alive.",
      "This year, torrential rains stretching on for months wiped out more than 37,000 acres of crops across the country, according to government figures. In a visit to cempasuchil fields earlier this month in Xochimilco, Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada said that as many of 2 million marigold plants were put at risk. Despite that, she said that production this year simultaneously broke a record of 6 million plants as farmers ramp up to meet increasing demand even as growing the flower has become more precarious.",
      "Ort\u00edz said the excess of rain has brought on pests, diseases and rotted the roots of her plants. She estimates she lost at least 30% of her crop, while others say they\u2019ve lost closer to 50%.",
      "The family has been forced to drop money on insecticides, fertilizer and more to save their crops. As they have, razor thin profit margins have turned into losses, and they\u2019ve had to cut back on basics like beef and sweets to make ends meet.",
      "\u201cIf I were to take a hard look at all our losses, I\u2019d be incredibly disillusioned and even not want to grow them anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to push forward and make sure this keeps going on.\u201d",
      "Just down the road from Ort\u00edz\u2019s farm, government scientists are searching for long-term solutions beyond the short-term economic relief provided by the local government. In a small seed bank known as Toxinachcal, men in white suits meticulously pick through sprouts in a lab dish.",
      "The scientists have been at work for a year and a half saving up thousands of seed variants of native plant species, including 20 variants of cempasuchil, in jars lining giant freezers in the hopes that the storage facility will be a key tool in fighting the most averse effects of climate change.",

      "Biologist Clara Soto Cort\u00e9s, head of the seed bank, said part of the reason that the crop has been devastated is because farmers in recent years have elected to use a hybrid marigold seed variant from the United States.",
      "The seed produces a shorter more uniform-looking plant that are easier to sell en-masse and in places like supermarkets.",
      "But that means farmers have turned away from sturdier, native breeds, which have a longer stocks and widely vary in color, size and texture. The genetic diversity of these Mexican breeds makes them more resilient to drastic climate shifts like the ones seen this year, Soto said.",
      "\u201cThese native seeds have adapted to different geographies, in high altitudes and low, in places where there's a lot of rain or there's none at all, or where they need to be resistant to insects,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThe (hybrid) seeds have bred for another purpose. It doesn't have the genetic diversity needed to take on climate change.\u201d",
      "If more climate events, like the floods that roiled producers wipe out an entire crop, Soto said the bank will make seeds available to local producers to recover their crops \u2013 this time with a more resilient variant that their ancestors have been farming for centuries.",
      "Meanwhile, growers are scrambling to bounce back in the short term, saying the losses also represent a threat to the farming tradition their families have struggled to maintain on the edge of the dense city of 23 million people.",
      "Carlos Jim\u00e9nez, 61, has long worked the fields of Xochimilco, but began to grow the shorter marigold plants eight years ago when he noticed the hybrid was more marketable. As he's lost more crops and gotten lower prices for the plants because of the mildew gathering at their roots, he said he's begun considering ways to adapt, like building greenhouses.",
      "\u201cThe plants get sick, they rot, and our business is snuffed out,\u201d Jim\u00e9nez said. \u201cAnd with it goes our tradition because it's our economy.\"",
      "Producers like Ort\u00edz have considered the same. But their losses mean they have no money to build added infrastructure. Her family and other farmers have called on local authorities for help, but say they've received just pennies on the dollar of what they need to bounce back. Though the local government has said it continues to work to help offset the blow felt by farmers.",
      "She said she's begun to look at other crops she might be able to farm that are more resilient than the crinkled orange flowers.",
      "Others like Jim\u00e9nez said that while the roots of plants may rot around him, for now he's holding strong.",
      "\u201cThis plant has a deeper meaning to our lost loved ones,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are traditions we carry down from our ancestors. They can't just disappear.\u201d",

      "VILNIUS, Lithuania -- Lithuania said Wednesday it will keep the country's border crossings with Belarus closed for a month after balloons used to smuggle cigarettes across the frontier caused repeated disruption at the capital's airport, though there will be some exemptions.",
      "The two border crossings with Belarus were closed last week after balloon sightings prompted the suspension of air traffic at Vilnius Airport on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.",
      "Lithuanian officials view the balloon disruption as a deliberate act by Russia-allied Belarus. Lithuania is a NATO and European Union member on the Western alliance\u2019s eastern flank, and borders Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad exclave as well as Belarus.",
      "Lithuania's Cabinet decided Wednesday that the crossing at \u0160al\u010dininkai will be closed altogether and passage through the other \u2014 at Medininkai, near Vilnius \u2014 will be restricted for the next month, the BNS news agency reported.",
      "Some Lithuanian and EU citizens will still be allowed to pass through Medininkai. Officials also have said that Russians holding a transit document that allows them to travel to Kaliningrad will also be allowed through.",

      "CAIRO -- Sudan's brutal two-year war has entered a new, dangerous phase.",
      "The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces this week seized control of the entire Darfur region, after ousting the rival Sudanese army from its last stronghold there. The fighting for control of Sudan has killed over 40,000 people and created the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis with over 14 million displaced.",
      "The capture of el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur, by the powerful Arab-led force raises fears that Africa's third-largest nation may split again, nearly 15 years after the oil-rich South Sudan gained independence following years of civil war.",
      "The RSF is led by Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, a commander who had briefly ruled Sudan alongside his military rival, and whose meteoric rise to power has shaped Sudanese politics for the past decade.",
      "The RSF was formed in 2013, growing out of the Janjaweed militia that fought in Darfur since the early 2000s in a ruthless campaign against the region\u2019s non-Arab tribes and rebels.",
      "Sudan\u2019s former President Omar al-Bashir was indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and genocide in Darfur in 2009. Some 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.",
      "The RSF was founded initially as an attempt to instill discipline among Arab militias that were accused of ethnically motivated violence, abuse and rape in Darfur and other regions.",
      "A native of Darfur, Dagalo hails from an Arab camel-trading tribe. He was handpicked by al-Bashir to lead the RSF on a series of counterinsurgency campaigns against the largely non-Arab rebels in Darfur and other restive provinces.",
      "Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, drew on his family\u2019s vast livestock and gold mining operations in Darfur to expand his support among the local Arab militias. At the time, he commanded an estimated 10,000 fighters.",
      "But the force also gained notoriety in 2014 and 2015. Rights groups have accused it of forcibly displacing entire communities, torture, extrajudicial killings, mass rapes and plunder.",
      "The former Biden administration accused the RSF of genocide and imposed sanctions on Dagalo, his family and associated businesses.",
      "Dagalo has since expanded his powerful militia and financial network. His fighters were sent to fight in Yemen, as part of a Saudi-led coalition, and in Libya, with support from the United Arab Emirates. The RSF also protected the country's borders from illegal migration to Europe in a controversial deal between the European Union and a bloc of African countries. The EU said it did not directly pay the RSF.",
      "Dagalo's gold mining operations thrived, making it a key source of income for his powerful group as well as Sudan\u2019s biggest export after the secession of oil-rich South Sudan in 2011.",

      "The United States is experiencing a shortage of pennies after President Trump decided to stop their production earlier this year",
      "NEW YORK -- The United States is running out of pennies.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to stop producing the penny earlier this year is starting to have real implications for the nation\u2019s commerce. Merchants in multiple regions of the country have run out of pennies and are unable to produce exact change. Meanwhile, banks are unable to order fresh pennies and are rationing pennies for their customers.",
      "One convenience store chain, Sheetz, got so desperate for pennies that it briefly ran a promotion offering a free soda to customers who bring in 100 pennies. Another retailer says the lack of pennies will end up costing it millions this year, because of the need to round down to avoid lawsuits.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a chunk of change,\u201d said Dylan Jeon, senior director of government relations with the National Retail Federation.",
      "The penny problem started in late summer and is only getting worse as the country heads into the holiday shopping season.",
      "To be sure, not one retailer or bank has called for the penny to stick around. Pennies, especially in bulk, are heavy and are more often than not used exclusively to give customers change. But the abrupt decision to get rid of the penny has come with no guidance from the federal government. Many stores have been left pleading for Americans to pay in exact change.",
      "\u201cWe have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years. But this is not the way we wanted it to go,\u201d said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",
      "Trump announced on Feb. 9 that the U.S. would no longer mint pennies, citing the high costs. Both the penny and the nickel have been more expensive to produce than they are worth for several years, despite efforts by the U.S. Mint to reduce costs. The Mint spent 3.7 cents to make a penny in 2024, according to its most recent annual report, and it spends 13.8 cents to make a nickel.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s rip the waste out of our great nation\u2019s budget, even if it\u2019s a penny at a time,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The Treasury Department said in May that it was placing its last order of copper-zinc planchets \u2014 the blank metal disks that are minted into coins. In June, the last pennies were minted and by August, those pennies were distributed to banks and armored vehicle service companies.",
      "Troy Richards, president and chief operations officer at Louisiana-based Guaranty Bank & Trust Co., said he's had to scramble to have enough pennies on hand for his customers since August.",
      "\u201cWe got an email announcement from the Federal Reserve that penny shipments would be curtailed. Little did we know that those shipments were already over for us,\u201d Richards said.",
      "Richards said the $1,800 in pennies the bank had were gone in two weeks. His branches are keeping small amounts of pennies for customers who need to cash checks, but that\u2019s it.",
      "The U.S. Mint issued 3.23 billion pennies in 2024, the last full year of production, more than double that of the second-most minted coin in the country: the quarter. But the problem with pennies is they are issued, given as change, and rarely recirculated back into the economy. Americans store their pennies in jars or use them for decoration. This requires the Mint to produce significant sums of pennies each year.",
      "The government is expected to save $56 million by not minting pennies, according to the Treasury Department. Despite losing money on the penny, the Mint is profitable for the U.S. government through its production of other circulating coins as well as coin proof and commemorative sets that appeal to numismatic collectors.",
      "In 2024, the Mint made $182 million in seigniorage, which is its equivalent of profit.",

Roughly a third of these 170 coin terminals are now closed to both penny deposits as well as penny withdrawals.",
      "Bank lobbyists say these terminals being closed to penny deposits is exacerbating the penny shortage, because parts of the country that may have some surplus pennies are unable to get those pennies to parts of country with shortages.",
      "\u201cAs a result of the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s decision to end production of the penny, coin distribution locations accepting penny deposits and fulfilling orders will vary over time as (penny) inventory is depleted\u201d a Federal Reserve spokeswoman said.",
      "The lack of pennies has also become a legal minefield for stores and retailers. In some states and cities, it is illegal to round up a transaction to the nearest nickel or dime because doing so would run afoul of laws that are supposed to place cash customers and debit and credit card customers on an equal playing field when it comes to item costs.",
      "So, to avoid lawsuits, retailers are rounding down. While two or three cents may not seem like much, that extra change can add up over tens of thousands of transactions. A spokesman for Kwik Trip, the Midwest convenience store chain, says it has been rounding down every cash transaction to the nearest nickel. That's expected to cost the company roughly $3 million this year. Some retailers are asking customers to give their change to local or affiliated charities at the cash register, in an effort to avoid pennies as well.",
      "A bill currently pending in Congress, known as the Common Cents Act, calls for cash transactions to be rounded to the nearest nickel, up or down. While the proposal is palatable to businesses, rounding up could be costly for consumers.",
      "The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment on whether they had any guidance for retailers or banks regarding the penny shortage, or the issues regarding penny circulation.",
      "The United States is not the first country to transition away from small denomination coins or discontinue out-of-date coins. But in all of these cases, governments wound down the use of their out-of-date coins over a period of, often, years.",
      "For example, Canada announced it would eliminate its one-cent coin in 2012, transitioning away from one-cent cash transactions starting in 2013 and is still redeeming and recycling one-cent coins a decade later. The \u201cdecimalization\u201d process of converting British coins from farthings and shillings to a 100-pence-to-a-pound system took much of the 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "The U.S. removed the penny from commerce abruptly, without any action by Congress or any regulatory guidance for banks, retailers or states. The retail and banking industries, rarely allies in Washington on policy matters related to point-of-sale, are demanding that Washington issue guidance or pass a law fixing the issues that are arising due to the shortage.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want the penny back. We just want some sort of clarity from the federal government on what to do, as this issue is only going to get worse,\u201d the NACS' Lenard said.",

      "GYEONGJU, South Korea -- South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Japan\u2019s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi met in their first summit Thursday, pledging to strengthen ties that have been frequently strained by their bitter wartime history.",
      "Their meeting in South Korea came after both launched charm offensives toward U.S. President Donald Trump, who visited their countries and pressed the two key U.S. allies to complete their massive U.S. investment pledges.",
      "Meeting with Takaichi ahead of the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, Lee said South Korea and Japan share common challenges in the face of \u201crapidly changing international dynamics and trade conditions\u201d and that their future-oriented cooperation was more important than ever.",
      "Takaichi said trilateral cooperation between Tokyo, Seoul and Washington is becoming increasingly crucial \u201cunder the current strategic environment,\u201d according to Lee\u2019s office.",
      "The two leaders agreed to continue their \u201cshuttle diplomacy,\u201d in which they take turns hosting summits, Lee\u2019s office said in a statement.",
      "Takaichi described her first talks with Lee as \u201cvery enjoyable and meaningful\" and that she believes \u201cwe will welcome (Lee) in Japan next time.\u201d",
      "The Oct. 22 election of Takaichi raised concern in Seoul about a potential deterioration in ties, as South Koreans view her right-wing views on history as hawkish. She has resisted acknowledging Japanese aggression in World War II and atrocities and denied that coercion was used against Korean laborers and women held as sexual slaves for Japanese troops.",
      "But many experts say Seoul and Tokyo will more likely continue to tighten cooperation as they both struggle to defend their economic interests in face of Trump\u2019s unilateral push to reset global trade. They also face other common challenges like supply chain vulnerabilities and North Korea's nuclear program.",

      "Basketball players who frequent a South Florida park feel like they\u2019re being run off in favor of wealthy residents of a new luxury development",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Basketball players who frequent a South Florida park feel like they\u2019re being run off in favor of wealthy residents of a new luxury development.",
      "The city of Fort Lauderdale is planning to replace the decades-old, beachside basketball courts with pickleball courts, part of a deal with developers for a massive condo and hotel project.",
      "Local basketball players have generated a groundswell of support online, but city officials and developers have said the changes are part of larger improvement plan for the park that now includes building new basketball courts several hundred yards away.",
      "Ozzie McRea said most people who use the basketball courts only found out about the changes to Fort Lauderdale Beach Park in April. He helped organize a group called Fort Lauderdale Beach Ballers to preserve the courts, located just a few dozen steps from the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "\u201cWe saw a sign put up that says that there was going to be a conversion from a basketball court to a pickleball court,\u201d McRea said. \u201cAnd that raised a lot of flags, and it was a very surreal moment, because everybody that\u2019s seen that sign, you see that their heart just dropped like out of nowhere.\u201d",
      "McRea said the message is clear: developers want to change the demographics of the area, allowing condo residents to use the public park across the street as a private club where working-class and diverse people aren\u2019t welcome.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very multicultural atmosphere out here. We have people from all ages, every ethnicity,\u201d McRea said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a beautiful thing because we all come in harmony over here. We all play basketball.\u201d",
      "Some advocates have linked the old basketball courts to the Civil Rights Movement and the push to desegregate the beaches. Photographs show basketball courts on Fort Lauderdale beach in the 1960s, but local historians believe those courts were in a different location. The current courts were likely installed at least a decade or so later.",
      "Fort Lauderdale city commissioners approved a deal with developers in January 2024 for the construction of The St. Regis Resort & Residences Bahia Mar. The $2 billion project includes four residential towers and a hotel tower next to an existing marina on city-owned land under a 100-year lease.",
      "Developers agreed to pay $1 million for improvements at the park, including replacing what they described as dilapidated and rarely used basketball courts with pickleball courts.",
      "These types of public-private partnerships are nothing new.",
      "Maria Ilcheva, a Florida International University professor with a focus in public policy, said partnerships between local governments and private companies have become more common over the past two decades in South Florida and other places around the U.S. with growing populations and rapid development. She said there\u2019s nothing inherently bad about these agreements, and governments can often negotiate improvements to transportation, parks and other infrastructure in exchange for a project\u2019s approval.",
      "\u201cIf these partnerships take into account the local context and ensure that the community benefits from it, they could be a value,\u201d Ilcheva said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t take into account community perspectives and don\u2019t take a broader look at how it will impact values and how it could potentially incentivize or push out local residents, they could be detrimental to the community.\u201d",

      "Fort Lauderdale Commissioner Steve Glassman said while the developer is paying for park improvements, it will remain city property and accessible to the public.",
      "Glassman said it was all part of an agenda item that passed unanimously, with no opposition from the public during the meeting.",
      "When community members began raising concerns earlier this year, Glassman said the city worked with developers to plan new basketball courts several hundred yards away at the other end of the park.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got the pickleball, we\u2019ve got the basketball, we\u2019ve got new fitness equipment, we\u2019ve got new picnic tables, new grills,\u201d Glassman said. \u201cSo we\u2019re not removing the basketball courts, we\u2019re moving the basketball courts.\u201d",
      "But the Beach Ballers have their doubts, concerned that plans for the new basketball courts might be abandoned after the old courts are gone. The group is also supporting separate efforts to formally designate the park as a historically significant archaeological site. Experts believe the park was the site of a 19th century fort used during the Seminole Wars.",
      "\u201cWe feel that there\u2019s no reason to move these courts,\u201d McRea said. \u201cIf they want to add something, wherever they think they want to relocate these basketball courts, that\u2019s where they should relocate the pickleball courts.\u201d",
      "Developer Jimmy Tate said he\u2019d be happy to resolve the entire situation by keeping the basketball courts where they are and putting the pickleball courts elsewhere. But they\u2019ve already pre-sold several dozen condos and created millions of dollars in marketing materials, including a giant model, that show pickleball courts.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t do that right now, there\u2019s just too much out there, and we can\u2019t have anything that\u2019s misrepresenting facts for any contract,\u201d he said.",
      "Tate rejected the idea that he\u2019s trying to deny beach access to anyone based on race or socioeconomic status. He thinks opposition has less to do with the basketball courts and more to do with a small group of people who have opposed any redevelopment at the Bahia Mar for years, even derailing attempts by two previous developers.",
      "He said the fact that the city and developers have committed to brand new basketball courts at the same park proves the opposition is not really about the courts.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s the irony, I played basketball my whole life,\" Tate said. \u201cI don't play pickleball.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is pushing to build more homes to address the city's housing crisis",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is trying to get more homes built for people like Liam Murphy: a fifth-generation city kid who found himself repeatedly outbid for tiny two-bedroom houses that wound up selling for $1.6 million.",
      "Murphy, 39, now lives about an hour's drive away from his job as a San Francisco firefighter. He says it's too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.",
      "\u201cThat would just make for a better city overall,\u201d said Murphy, \u201cand the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more. They're exposed to all the cultures of San Francisco, which makes a more well-rounded person.\u201d",
      "Tiny, colorful San Francisco \u2014 just seven miles squared \u2014 embraces its image as a city that welcomes all. But its inability to build more housing has made it one of the world's toughest places to find a home, risking the diversity it prides itself on.",
      "Lurie hopes to change that, with a plan to allow for denser and taller buildings throughout much of the city, including the westside Sunset neighborhood of single-family homes and the tourist friendly Haight-Ashbury, which is studded with classic Victorian and Edwardian homes.",
      "The issue has roiled the city, and threats of recall loom over San Francisco supervisors who go along with Lurie. At a recent housing rally, the mayor who won a rare reprieve from President Donald Trump's threats to send in federal forces struggled to be heard over angry chants of \u201cshame!\u201d and \u201cliar.\u201d",
      "Protesters demanded the city invest in 100% below-market rate housing and accused him of being a gentrifier and a Republican.",
      "\u201cI truly believe that this has San Franciscans' best interests at heart. Are some people going to be fearful? Absolutely. I get it. Change is scary,\u201d said Lurie, who is a centrist Democrat. \u201cBut the status quo is not working. There's an affordability crisis right now.\u201d",
      "The city's estimated 830,000 residents are passionate over both land use and equity. Housing projects have died as pressure to create more affordable units made potential developments unprofitable. Residents also want their stunning views.",
      "But San Francisco is under pressure from the state to adopt a new zoning plan allowing for 36,000 more homes by 2031 \u2014 or else the state will decide what gets built where \u2014 and the mayor likely has the votes to pass his \u201cFamily Zoning Plan.\u201d",
      "Supporters say it's a matter of supply and demand, and that more homes will bring down the overall cost of housing.",
      "Critics say such trickle-down economics will not work in a city like San Francisco, which is in such global demand that some foreign investors buy properties sight-unseen. They say developers will only build luxury housing that's too costly for most workers, while displacing tenants and destroying the character of entire neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a herd of elephants in the room that no one will address,\u201d says Eric Jaye, a Democratic political consultant who opposes the plan.",
      "Much of the housing push has come from Democrats, including a former city mayor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed into law a proposal by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener to build more homes near transit.",
      "The city has made enormous strides in recent years, with whole districts of tall condo buildings cropping up around downtown, says Rafael Mandelman, president of the Board of Supervisors. But he acknowledges that people come to San Francisco for its more intimate neighborhoods and access to green space.",
      "\u201cSan Francisco, historically, was the city for people who didn\u2019t love cities,\" Mandelman said.",

      "For the most part, the new zoning plan allows for more housing to be packed into the space of a single-family home \u2014 say a duplex with a studio \u2014 without exceeding the city's height limit of roughly four stories for such properties. At least 15% of new housing must be below-market rate.",
      "Buildings on neighborhood commercial corridors could double to eight stories. Busier thoroughfares could see high-rises of 10 stories and more, and in a few spots, on Van Ness Avenue, heights could hit 650 feet (200 meters), rivaling some downtown skyscrapers.",
      "Passage of Lurie's proposal won't necessarily lead to more homes in a city with high labor and construction costs and \u201cnotoriously complex and cumbersome\" approval processes, as the state said in a scathing 2023 review.",

      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t kill each other,\u201d Foote said, \u201cbut it went on longer than it would have in a well-functioning housing market.\u201d",
      "Supervisors are still negotiating amendments to the zoning plan, which could be voted out of committee on Monday for consideration by the full board. Some supervisors want to exempt historic properties, or all buildings currently used for housing. The mayor agreed to exempt buildings with at least three rent-controlled units.",
      "The compromise was a major relief for Phyllis Nabhan, 78, who lives in the Richmond neighborhood, between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park. She fears becoming homeless if a developer scoops up the property she's called home for 47 years, starting with a rent of just $350 a month.",
      "But Nabhan still objects to the proposal. She says it would ruin her neighborhood's \u201ccozy and wonderful\u201d feel, and blames the state for forcing the city to change.",
      "\u201cI think that this mayor is trying,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible job, I wouldn\u2019t want to be mayor.\u201d",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Wednesday approved energy company Enbridge\u2019s plans to reroute an aging oil pipeline around a northern Wisconsin tribal reservation.",
      "Enbridge wants to build a new 41-mile (66-kilometer) segment of pipeline around the reservation of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa to replace a 12-mile (19-kilometer) segment that now crosses tribal land.",
      "The tribe wants the pipeline off its land.

      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has approved energy company Enbridge's plan to encase a segment of an aging oil pipeline beneath a Great Lakes channel",
      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Wednesday approved energy company Enbridge\u2019s plans to encase a segment of an aging oil pipeline that runs beneath a Great Lakes channel, pushing past its own findings that construction could ruin the environmentally sensitive area.",
      "The corps initially planned to issue a permitting decision early next year. The agency fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.",
      "\u201cThe approval of the Enbridge Line 5 reroute application is a great success and will advance the President\u2019s energy dominance agenda for America,\" Adam Telle, assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, said in a statement.",
      "The corps released an environmental analysis in May that concluded tunnel construction would protect the pipeline but the work could destroy wetlands and archeological sites, harm bat habitats, disturb aquatic life, mar lake vistas and potentially trigger an underwater explosion.",
      "The corps still issued Enbridge a permit, saying Wednesday that the application complied with all applicable federal laws and regulations.",
      "Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.",
      "Enbridge now needs only a permit from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to begin the $500 million-plus project. Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the application.",
      "Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac, a channel linking Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.",
      "Concerns about the segment rupturing and causing a catastrophic spill have been growing since 2017, when Enbridge officials revealed that engineers had known about gaps in the segment\u2019s coating for three years. A boat anchor damaged the line in 2018, further stoking fears.",

      "Conservationists and a number of Native American tribes have balked at the proposal, calling it too risky and demanding Enbridge simply shut down the pipeline. The project has become entangled in multiple lawsuits.",
      "Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Enbridge to operate the pipeline in the straits. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently weighing whether the case belongs in federal or state court.",
      "Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, ordered her regulators in 2020 to revoke the easement allowing the segment to operate in the straits. Enbridge filed a federal lawsuit that same year seeking to invalidate the order. Trump has inserted himself into that dispute, too. His administration filed briefs in September arguing Whitmer interfered with U.S. foreign policy when she revoked the easements.",
      "The Michigan Public Service Commission issued permits in 2023, prompting another lawsuit from environmental groups and tribes. A Michigan appeals court upheld the permits this past February.",

    "summary": "The Senate is passing legislation that would nullify U.S. tariffs on Canada",
    "story": [
      "The Senate is passing legislation that would nullify U.S. tariffs on Canada",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed legislation Wednesday that would nullify U.S. tariffs on Canada, just as President Donald Trump is engaged in trade talks in Asia as well as an increasingly bitter trade spat with U.S.'s northern neighbor that is one of its largest economic partners.",
      "The 50-46 tally was the latest in a series of votes this week to terminate the national emergencies that Trump has used to impose tariffs. While the resolutions won't ultimately take effect, they have proven to be an effective way for Democrats to expose cracks between the president's trade policy and Republican senators who have traditionally supported free trade arguments.",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, the Democrat pushing the resolutions, said that higher prices caused by tariffs would force Republicans to break with Trump. \u201cIt will become untenable for them to just close their eyes and say, \u2018I\u2019m signing up for whatever the president wants to do,\u2019\u201d Kaine told reporters.",
      "The Senate passed a similar resolution applying to Brazilian tariffs on Tuesday, and it has already passed a resolution on Canadian imports in April. The same four Republicans \u2014 Sens. Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2014 voted again with all Democrats to approve the resolution applying to Canada.",
      "Kaine, joined by other Democrats and Paul, has forced the votes under a decades-old law that allows Congress to block a president\u2019s emergency powers. However, House Republicans have passed new rules that allow leaders to prevent such resolutions from getting a vote in that chamber, and Trump could veto the legislation even if it did clear Congress.",
      "Wednesday's vote happened as Trump was in Asia to advance trade talks with partners there. The president has also been jousting with Canadian officials amid a delicate negotiation to reduce tariffs between the two countries.",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Finance, acknowledged in a floor speech that many \u201cmay be nervous about what comes next\u201d as Trump remakes global trade. But he urged Congress to stay out of the way.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s truly get a balanced, fair playing field in trade,\u201d Crapo added.",
      "Yet there is increasing tension between GOP senators and the president over how soybean farmers have suffered from the trade war with China, as well as his administration's plans to allow the purchase of more beef from Argentina.",
      "Vice President JD Vance visited Republicans during a closed-door luncheon this week and also argued that they should steer clear of trade policy while the president negotiates deals. But Vance's efforts appeared to have little impact on those determined to vote against the tariffs.",
      "\u201cRetaliatory tariffs on American products have turned agricultural income upside down for many of Kentucky\u2019s nearly 70,000 family farms,\u201d said Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former longtime Republican Senate leader, in a statement. \u201cBourbon has been caught in the crossfire from day one. And consumers are paying higher prices across the board as the true costs of trade barriers fall inevitably on them.\u201d",

      "Trump said earlier this week he wanted to impose another 10% tariff hike on imports of Canadian goods because of an anti-tariff television ad aired by the province of Ontario. The television ad used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has been trying to engage with Trump to ease the import taxes that have hit Canada hard. The U.S.-Canada economic relationship is one of the largest globally, totaling $909.1 billion in 2024, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion U.S.) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.",
      "Canada has also tried to turn to Asian trading partners amid the trade war.",
      "Democrats argued the trade war was impacting a range of industries, from farmers to shipbuilders. They also said it made little sense to engage in a trade war with a close military ally.",
      "Trump has invoked a national emergency to impose the tariffs, saying that fentanyl and other illegal drugs are entering the country from Canada. So far this year, less than 1% of the total fentanyl seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 66 pounds, was seized at the northern border.",
      "Kaine argued in a floor speech that Trump's trade policy was actually hinging on his personal feelings. He claimed that Trump had \u201csuch thin skin that an ad on television quoting Ronald Reagan\u201d had prompted an end to the negotiations.",
      "He asked, \u201cHow about that as a rationale for trade policy?\u201d",

      "Transport Minister and Deputy Premier Matteo Salvini \u2014 the main sponsor of the Strait of Messina Bridge project \u2014 denounced the ruling as \u201ca political decision,\u201d not a technical one, and vowed to pursue all possible ways to bring the plan forward.",
      "The Court of Auditors' decision doesn\u2019t definitively block the bridge project, but can long delay its final approval, possibly forcing the government to a new vote to override the court\u2019s objections.",

      "NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point Wednesday for the second time since September. Before that, it had gone nine months without a cut.",
      "The federal funds rate is the rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another. While the rates consumers pay to borrow money aren\u2019t directly linked to this rate, shifts affect what you pay for credit cards, auto loans, mortgages, and other financial products.",
      "\u201cWhile the full economic impact of such a move will unfold over time, early indicators suggest that even modest rate cuts can have meaningful consequences for consumer behavior and financial health,\" said Michele Raneri, vice president and head of U.S. research at credit reporting agency TransUnion.",
      "The Fed has two goals when it sets the rate: one, to manage prices for goods and services, and two, to encourage full employment. Typically, the Fed might increase the rate to try to bring down inflation and decrease it to encourage faster economic growth and increase hiring. The challenge now is that inflation is higher than the Fed\u2019s 2% target but the job market has been weak. The government shutdown has also prevented the collection and release of data the Fed relies on to monitor the health of the economy.",

      "For savers, falling interest rates will slowly erode attractive yields currently on offer with certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts.",
      "Three of the top five high yield savings accounts had rate cuts after the last Fed rate cut in September, according to Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com, while two of the big five banks (Ally and Discover/Capital One) cut their savings account rates. The top rates for high yield savings account right now remain around 4.46% to 4.6%.",
      "Those are still better than the trends of recent years, and a good option for consumers who want to earn a return on money they may want to access in the near-term. A high yield savings account generally has a much higher annual percentage yield than a traditional savings account. The national average for traditional savings accounts is currently 0.63%, according to Bankrate.",
      "There may be a few accounts with returns of about 4% through the end of 2025, according to Tumin, but the Fed cuts will filter down to these offerings, lowering the average yields as they do.",
      "For prospective homebuyers, the market has already priced in the rate cut.",
      "\u201cMortgage rates, in particular, have responded swiftly,\u201d said Raneri. \u201cJust in the past week, they fell to their lowest level in over a year. While mortgage rates don\u2019t always move in lockstep with the Fed\u2019s target rate \u2014 often pricing in anticipated future cuts, the continued easing of monetary policy may well push rates even lower.\u201d",

      "Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said a declining interest rate environment will provide some relief for borrowers over time.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s a homeowner with a 7% mortgage or a recent graduate hoping to refinance student loans and credit card debt, lower rates can ease the burden on many indebted households by opening opportunities to refinance or consolidate,\u201d he said.",
      "Americans have faced steeper auto loan rates over the last three years after the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate starting in early 2022. Those are not expected to decline anytime soon. While a cut will contribute to eventual relief, it might be slow in arriving, analysts say.",
      "\u201cIf the auto market starts to freeze up and people aren\u2019t buying cars, then we may see lending margins start to shrink, but auto loan rates don\u2019t move in lockstep with the Fed rate,\u201d Kates said.",
      "Prices for new cars remain at historically high levels, not adjusting for inflation.",
      "Generally speaking, an auto loan annual percentage rate can run from about 4% to 30%. Bankrate\u2019s most recent weekly survey found that average auto loan interest rates are currently at 7.10% on a 60-month new car loan.",
      "Interest rates for credit cards are currently at an average of 20.01%, and the Fed\u2019s rate cut may be slow to be felt by anyone carrying a large amount of credit card debt. That said, any reduction is positive news.",
      "\u201cWhile inflation continues to exert pressure on household budgets, rate cuts offer a potential counterbalance by lowering debt servicing costs,\u201d Raneri said.",
      "Still, the best thing for anyone carrying a large credit card balance is to prioritize paying down high-interest-rate debt, and to seek to transfer any amounts possible to lower APR cards or negotiate directly with credit card companies for accommodation.",

      "Boeing on Wednesday reported mixed third-quarter results, with higher aircraft deliveries and a growing order backlog offset by certification delays for its 777X jet",
      "Boeing reported mixed third-quarter results on Wednesday, as higher aircraft deliveries and a growing backlog of orders were offset by continued certification delays for its 777X jets.",
      "CEO Kelly Ortberg said the first delivery of its next generation of long-haul, wide-body jets is now expected in 2027 instead of 2026, resulting in a $4.9 billion charge in the quarter through September. But Ortberg emphasized in a call with analysts that the delays stemmed from the certification process, and not from any newly discovered technical issues.",
      "\u201cWhile we are disappointed in the 777 delays, it shouldn't overshadow the progress we're making,\" he said.",
      "Ortberg said Boeing was making progress on stabilizing its production. The aerospace giant delivered 160 planes in the third quarter, the most quarterly deliveries since 2018. The same time last year, Boeing said it delivered 116 planes.",
      "Boeing also reported that its backlog of orders, including 5,900 commercial planes, had grown to $636 billion in the third quarter.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s strong demand in our products,\u201d Ortberg said in an interview Wednesday morning with CNBC.",
      "In September, the Federal Aviation Administration restored Boeing's ability to perform final safety checks and certify 737 Max jets for flight more than six years after two crashes of the then-new aircraft killed 346 people.",
      "That decision was followed by the FAA's move this month to raise Boeing's 737 Max production limit that it had set in January 2024, after a door plug flew off an Alaska Airlines jet. Boeing is now allowed to build 42 Max jets per month, up from 38, and Ortberg said Wednesday that the company expects to raise that cap further once it demonstrates to the FAA that it can do so safely.",
      "If the FAA approves future production boosts, Ortberg said, they'd come in increments of five jets and wouldn't happen more than once every six months.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t move to higher rates until we reach stability and readiness,\u201d he said.",
      "Boeing also reported $238 million in free cash flow, marking its first cash flow-positive quarter since 2023. But that figure was partly boosted by a delay in a potential $700 million payment to the Justice Department, part of a still-pending deal under consideration by a federal judge that could spare Boeing from criminal prosecution in the two deadly 737 Max crashes.",

      "Researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute are developing tiny drones inspired by bats for search and rescue missions",
      "WORCESTER, Mass. -- Don't be fooled by the fog machine, spooky lights and fake bats: the robotics lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute lab isn't hosting a Halloween party.",
      "Instead, it\u2019s a testing ground for tiny drones that can be deployed in search and rescue missions even in dark, smoky or stormy conditions.",
      "\u201cWe all know that when there\u2019s an earthquake or a tsunami, the first thing that goes down is power lines. A lot of times, it\u2019s at night, and you\u2019re not going to wait until the next morning to go and rescue survivors,\u201d said Nitin Sanket, assistant professor of robotics engineering. \u201cSo we started looking at nature. Is there a creature in the world which can actually do this?\u201d",
      "Sanket and his students found their answer in bats and the winged mammal's highly sophisticated ability to echolocate, or navigate via reflected sound. With a National Science Foundation grant, they\u2019re developing small, inexpensive and energy-efficient aerial robots that can be flown where and when current drones can\u2019t operate.",
      "Last month, emergency workers in Pakistan used drones to find people stranded on rooftops by massive floods. In August, a rescue team used a drone to find a California man who got trapped for two days behind a waterfall. And in July, drones helped find a stable route to three mine workers who spent more than 60 hours trapped underground in Canada.",
      "But while drones are becoming more common in search and rescue, Sanket and researchers elsewhere want to move beyond the manually operated individual robots being used today. A key next step is developing aerial robots that can be deployed in swarms and make their own decisions about where to search, said Ryan Williams, an associate professor at Virginia Tech.",
      "\u201cThat type of deployment \u2014 autonomous drones \u2014 that is effectively nil,\u201d he said.",
      "Williams tackled that problem with a recent project that involved programming drones to choose search trajectories in coordination with human searchers. Among other things, his team used historical data from thousands of missing person cases to create a model predicting how someone would behave if lost in the woods.",
      "\u201cAnd then we used that model to better localize our drones, to search in locations with higher chances of finding someone,\u201d he said.",
      "At WPI, Sanket\u2019s project addresses other limitations of current drones, including their size and perception capabilities.",
      "\u201cCurrent robots are big, bulky, expensive and cannot work in all sorts of scenarios,\u201d he said.",

      "By contrast, his drone fits in the palm of his hand, is made mostly from inexpensive hobby-grade materials and can operate in the dark. A small ultrasonic sensor, not unlike those used in automatic faucets in public restrooms, mimics bat behavior, sending out a pulse of high-frequency sound and using the echo to detect obstacles in its path.",
      "During a recent demonstration, a student used a remote control to launch the drone in a brightly lit room and then again after turning off all but a faintly glowing red light. As it approached a clear, Plexiglas wall, the drone repeatedly halted and backed away, even with the lights off and with fog and fake snow swirling through the air.",
      "\u201cCurrently, search and rescue robots are mainly operational in broad daylight,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cThe problem is that search and rescues are dull, dangerous and dirty jobs that happen a lot of times in darkness.\u201d",
      "But development didn\u2019t go completely smoothly. The researchers realized that the noise of the bat robot\u2019s propellers interfered with the ultrasound, requiring 3D printed shells to minimize the interference. They also used artificial intelligence to teach the drone how to filter and interpret sound signals.",
      "Still, there\u2019s a long way to go to match bats, which can contract and compress their muscles to listen only to certain echoes and can detect something as small as a human hair from several meters away.",
      "\u201cBats are amazing,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cWe are nowhere close to what nature has achieved. But the goal is that one day in the future, we will be there and these will be useful for deployment in the wild.\u201d",

      "A Yup'ik community near the Bering Sea in southwest Alaska was spared the widespread devastation other communities experienced from the remnants of Typhoon Halong earlier this month",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- A fragment of a mask that was preserved for hundreds of years in permafrost sat in the muck of a low tide in the western Alaska community of Quinhagak. Wooden spoons, toys, a fishing lure and other artifacts were strewn, in some cases for miles, along the beach.",
      "The Yup'ik community near the edge of the Bering Sea was spared the widespread devastation wrought by the remnants of Typhoon Halong on its neighbors further west earlier this month. But it suffered a different kind of blow: The lashing winds and storm surge devoured dozens of feet of shoreline, disrupting a culturally significant archaeological site and washing away possibly thousands of unearthed artifacts.",
      "About 1,000 pieces, including wooden masks and tools, were recovered in Quinhagak after the storm ravaged parts of southwest Alaska on Oct. 11 and 12. But many more pieces \u2014 perhaps up to 100,000 \u2014 were left scattered, said Rick Knecht, an archaeologist who has worked on the Nunalleq, or old village, project for 17 years. That's roughly the number of pieces previously recovered from the archaeological site.",
      "Meanwhile, freezing temperatures and ice have settled into the region, stalling immediate efforts to find and recover more displaced artifacts on searches done by four-wheeler and foot.",
      "Knecht called what happened a major loss. The site has yielded the world's largest collection of pre-contact Yup'ik artifacts. Much of what's known about Yup'ik life before outsiders arrived stems from the project, said Knecht, an emeritus senior lecturer in archaeology at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.",
      "\u201cWhen there are holes or disturbances in the site, it\u2019s like trying to read a book with holes in the pages. You're going to miss a few things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the bigger those holes are, the weaker the story gets. There\u2019s a few holes in the book right now.\u201d",
      "While the name of the original village isn't known, it was attacked by another village and burned around 1650, he said. Knecht has worked with elders and others in Quinhagak to combine their traditional knowledge with the technology and techniques used by the archaeology teams to study the past together.",
      "Quinhagak has about 800 residents, and subsistence food gathering is critically important to them.",
      "The storm dispersed artifacts from a site long preserved by permafrost, Knecht said. A longstanding concern has been the threat that climate change \u2014 melting permafrost, coastal erosion, the potential for more frequent or stronger storms \u2014 has posed to the site, he said.",
      "It poses risks to the community itself. Erosion threatens major infrastructure in Quinhagak, including a sewage lagoon, homes and fish camps. Thawing permafrost is also unsettling and undermining buildings, according to a 2024 report from the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.",
      "The excavation project itself began after artifacts began appearing on the beach around 2007. Part of the site that washed out had been excavated previously.",

      "When he left in July, there was a roughly 30-foot buffer to the sea. The storm took out the buffer and another 30 feet of the site, he said. It also left what Knecht described as piano-sized clumps of tundra on the tidal flats.",
      "Knecht didn't recognize the site at first after Halong.",
      "\u201cI just drove right by it because all the landmarks I\u2019m used to on the beach and at the site were gone or changed,\u201d he said.",
      "Work to preserve the rescued artifacts has included soaking the marine salts from the wood and placing the pieces in special chemicals that will help them hold together when they dry out, he said. If one were to just take one of the wooden artifacts off the beach and let them dry, they'd \u201ccrack to pieces, sometimes in a matter of hours.\u201d",
      "There is a lab at the museum in Quinhagak where the artifacts are kept.",

In some ways, it feels like when teams saw the site in 2009: \u201cWe\u2019ve got this raw site with artifacts popping off in every way,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re starting from scratch again.\u201d",

      "Microsoft on Wednesday reported its quarterly sales grew 18% to $77.7 billion, beating Wall Street expectations while also surprising some investors with the huge amounts of money it is spending to expand its cloud computing infrastructure and meet demand for artificial intelligence tools.",
      "The software maker said it spent nearly $35 billion in the July-September quarter on capital expenditures to support AI and cloud demand, nearly half of that on computer chips and much of the rest related to data center real estate.",
      "That overshadowed Microsoft's report of a 22% increase in quarterly profit to $30.8 billion, or $4.13 per share, which easily beat Wall Street expectations for the period.

But shares in Microsoft then dropped in the hours before it disclosed its earnings Wednesday as the company battled an outage affecting its Azure cloud computing platform. They dropped even more \u2014 about 1% \u2014 in after-hours trading Wednesday as investors considered the significance of the earnings report.",
      "Driving investor enthusiasm on Tuesday was the announcement of Microsoft's revised business deal with its longtime partner OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT and now the world's most valuable startup. While no longer OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider, a relationship that helped bankroll the startup's early growth, Microsoft will retain commercial rights to OpenAI products through 2032 and get a roughly 27% stake in OpenAI\u2019s new for-profit arm.",

    "story": [
      "Producing and manufacturing electric vehicles and their batteries uses a lot of energy, leading many to be skeptical about the environmental benefits of going electric",
      "DETROIT -- Making electric vehicles and their batteries is a dirty process that uses a lot of energy. But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.",
      "The study also estimated that gas-powered vehicles cause at least twice as much environmental damage over their lifetimes as EVs, and said the benefits of EVs can be expected to increase in coming decades as clean sources of power, such as solar and wind, are brought onto the grid.",
      "The work by researchers from Northern Arizona University and Duke University, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS Climate, offers insight into a transportation sector that makes up a big part of U.S. emissions. It also comes as some EV skeptics have raised concerns about whether the environmental impact of battery production, including mining, makes it worthwhile to switch to electric.",
      "\u201cWhile there is a bigger carbon footprint in the very short term because of the manufacturing process in creating the batteries for electric vehicles, very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three and then for all of the rest of the vehicle lifetime, you\u2019re far ahead and so cumulatively much lower carbon footprint,\" said Drew Shindell, an earth science professor at Duke University and study co-author.",
      "The researchers evaluated several harmful air pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as emissions data, to compare the relative impact over time of EVs and internal combustion engines on air quality and climate change.",
      "Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years. That can be attributed to the energy-intensive production and manufacturing processes involved in mining lithium for EV batteries.",
      "They also sought to account for how the U.S. energy system might develop in coming years, assuming growth in clean energy. And they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption, ranging from the lowest \u2014 a 31% share of vehicle sales \u2014 to the highest, 75% of sales, by 2050. (EV sales accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.)",
      "The researchers said the average of those four models found that for each additional kilowatt hour of lithium-ion battery output, carbon dioxide emissions drop by an average of 220 kilograms (485 pounds) in 2030, and another 127 kilograms (280 pounds) in 2050.",
      "The consistent decrease in CO2 emissions from EVs is \u201cnot only driven by the on-road vehicles, but also reduction that has been brought due to electricity production,\u201d said lead author Pankaj Sadavarte, a postdoctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University.",
      "Greg Keoleian, a University of Michigan professor of sustainable systems who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, called it a \u201cvaluable study\u201d that echoes other findings and \u201cconfirms the environmental and economic benefits\u201d of EVs.",
      "\u201cAccelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,\u201d he said.",
      "Shindell, the Duke researcher, said the grid will evolve to have more solar and wind power.",
      "\u201cWhen you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody\u2019s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.\"",
      "Outside experts agreed \u2014 as long as the policy landscape supports it. That hasn't been the case under President Donald Trump, who has worked to boost fossil fuels and restrain solar and wind power development.",

But Trump reversed that policy, and Congress has terminated federal tax credits for an EV purchase. The administration has also targeted vehicle pollution rules that would encourage greater uptake of EVs in the U.S., and the president has attempted to halt a nationwide EV charging buildout.",

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CBS's \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday that the two leaders will \u201cconsummate that transaction on Thursday in Korea.\u201d",
      "If it happens, the deal would mark the end of months of uncertainty about the fate of the popular video-sharing platform in the United States. After wide bipartisan majorities in Congress passed \u2014 and President Joe Biden signed \u2014 a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S. if it did not find a new owner in the place of China's ByteDance, the platform was set to go dark on the law's January deadline. For a several hours, it did. But on his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to keep it running while his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "Three more executive orders followed, as Trump, without a clear legal basis, continued to extend the deadline for a TikTok deal. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. The third came in June, then another in September, which Trump said would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns.",
      "Trump\u2019s order was meant to enable an American-led group of investors to buy the app from China\u2019s ByteDance, though the deal also requires China\u2019s approval.",
      "However, TikTok deal is \u201cnot really a big thing for Xi Jinping,\u201d said Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the German Marshall Fund's Indo-Pacific program, during a media briefing Tuesday. \u201c(China is) happy to let (Trump) declare that they have finally kept a deal. Whether or not that deal will protect the data of Americans is a big question going forward.\u201d",

If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won\u2019t agree with the memo,\u201d Gates said during a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the release. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who\u2019s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries.\u201d",
      "Every bit of additional warming correlates to more extreme weather, risks species extinction and brings the world closer to crossing tipping points where changes become irreversible, scientists say.",

      "With their distinctive shaggy orange manes, pale blue faces and dense fur covering their hands and feet, it's hard to mistake China's endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys for any other animal.",
      "These rare and charismatic monkeys, unique to the frigid mountains of central China, have recently joined the country's famous pandas as furry envoys to zoos in Europe for the first time \u2014 on loan for 10 years from the same government-overseen group that coordinates official panda exchanges.",
      "As with \u201c panda diplomacy,\u201d some observers cheer new opportunities for scientific and conservation collaboration, while others raise concerns about the welfare of individual animal ambassadors transported around the world.",
      "Three golden monkeys arrived at France\u2019s Beauval Zoo in the city of Saint-Aignan this April, following an agreement to mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People\u2019s Republic of China and France.",

      "At Pairi Daiza, the habitat enclosure for Liu Yun, Lu Lu and Juan Juan includes traditional Chinese gazebos with red columns and gray-tiled roofs, where the monkeys spend much of their time jumping between logs and rope ladders and scrambling over roofs.",
      "\u201cThe diplomatic aspect comes from this cultural awareness,\u201d said Pairi Daiza spokesperson Johan Vreys.",
      "The hope is to build longstanding scientific exchanges between the zoos and Chinese authorities, said Ana\u00efs Maury, the communications director for the Beauval Zoo.",
      "The zoo is in discussions with China to launch joint research and conservation programs \u201csimilar to those already in place for other emblematic species like pandas,\u201d Maury said.",

      "While both species are considered national treasures, only monkeys have deep roots in Chinese art and culture, appearing in countless paintings and as characters in classic literature, including the wily Monkey King in the 16th century novel \u201cJourney to the West.\"",
      "When pandas stepped, rolled, scratched and stumbled onto the world stage in recent decades, they quickly became symbols of modern China \u2014 in part to due to their own \u201ccuddly cuteness\u201d and deft diplomatic presentation, said Susan Brownell, a China historian at the University of Missouri, St. Louis.",

      "In some of the most agriculturally rich regions in the U.S., researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand how climate change is impacting heat in rural areas and the farmworkers who toil in them",
      "In the summers, the sky is jet black when Raul Cruz arrives at this Imperial Valley sugarcane field to start his day. He chops, cleans and bundles the crop, taking heed as the sun rises. It's hard work, but so is starting at 4 a.m., even though he knows it's the safest thing when temperatures in this California desert frequently soar into the triple digits.",
      "\u201cWe just have to because we need to beat the heat,\" said Cruz, who\u2019s worked here for 15 years. They finish work by 9 or 10 a.m. to avoid the risk of heat stroke, he added, but when heat starts creeping up around 8 a.m., \"mentally, it's stressful.\"",
      "The hot climate that makes this Southern California region a farming powerhouse is also what makes it dangerous for farmworkers, who are increasingly vulnerable to rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal, oil and natural gas. Researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand the health consequences of heat stress on farmworkers and where heat is most extreme in this rural landscape. They hope their findings can lead to a better understanding of rural heat islands, identify gaps in research and help develop interventions that better protect them in the face of climate change.",
      "\u201cWorkers could potentially be dying or having some serious issues,\" said project leader Nicolas Lopez-Galvez, assistant professor in the School of Public Health at SDSU. \u201cIt\u2019s better to start acting sooner.\"",
      "Since the start of the 20th century, California temperatures have increased almost 3 F (about 1.7 C), according to state and federal data. Warming has accelerated, and seven of the state\u2019s last eight years through 2024 were the warmest on record. While all areas of the state have warmed, Southern California is heating up about twice as fast as Northern California.",
      "Ana Solorio, an organizer with the farmworker advocacy group L\u00edderes Campesinas that is working with researchers, remembered feeling \u201csuffocated\u201d in the Coachella Valley summer heat when she was a farmworker. \"With the humidity, it felt awful,\" said Solorio, who's lived in the Imperial Valley for more than 30 years. The heat was so intense she didn\u2019t return for another season, preferring instead the cooler winter harvesting months of lettuce in the Imperial Valley.",
      "\u201cThis (heat) can cause a lot of harm to their health,\" she said.",
      "Researchers are trying to understand how farmworkers' heat stress might vary depending on the crops, the season and the number of breaks they take.",
      "Over the past two years, they've collected year-round data from some 300 farmworkers. Body sensors measure things like core body temperature and heart rate while they work. Elsewhere in the fields, environmental monitors measure the day's temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover, also known as the wet-bulb globe temperature, considered the best metric to understanding heat stress. Using satellite imagery along with historical and current wet-bulb globe temperature data, researchers are mapping areas of extreme heat, particularly in the Imperial and Coachella valleys.",
      "Researchers are learning that ground level crops can expose workers to higher heat levels compared to tree crops, for example, but it also depends on their harvesting months. In the summers, farmworkers who prepare fields for planting or help maintain irrigation systems are also more exposed.",
      "Rural heat can vary based on things like tree cover, proximity to a body of water and empty fields, which may be hotter. \u201cIt creates this island where people might be living or working that are higher in terms of heat stress compared to other places,\u201d said Lopez-Galvez.",

      "Bordered by the Colorado River to the east, the Salton Sea to the northwest and Mexico to the south, the Imperial Valley is home to hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland and produces billions of dollars in agricultural production. It grows two-thirds of winter vegetables consumed nationally and provides thousands of jobs. From 2023 to 2024 alone, about 17,579 migrant and seasonal farmworkers were employed in Imperial County, according to the state.",
      "It's also extremely hot. In a given year, there are about 123 days with temperatures over 95 F (35 C), often exceeding 110 F (43 C) in August and early September, according to calculations by Sagar Parajuli, research scientist and adjunct faculty with SDSU's geography department. The county has one of the largest Latino populations and the highest number of heat-related illnesses among workers than anywhere else in the state.",
      "Some of their data analysis has already been published.",
      "One study found that irrigating crop fields in the Imperial Valley reduced the wet-bulb globe temperature on summer days, thanks to the cooling effect of evaporating water. But on summer nights, the opposite occurred: irrigation increased the wet-bulb globe temperature as humidity spiked. Irrigation also heightened heat in nearby urban and fallow areas adjacent to crop fields due to moisture transport.",
      "\u201cIt is a concern because an elevated nighttime temperature restricts the ability of farmworkers to cool down,\u201d said Parajuli, the study's lead author. \u201cSo they can\u2019t recover from the heat stress they could be accumulating from the daytime.\"",
      "Through this research, the authors were able to recommend how frequently farmworkers should take rest breaks to protect themselves from heat stress, based on how often wet-bulb globe temperatures exceed safety thresholds across seasons and work shifts. While California has heat rules, they're not strictly enforced, he added.",
      "\u201cWe realized that farmworkers are not getting enough rest breaks, and also there are no clear policy guidelines in terms of heat-related rest breaks,\" he said.",

      "The inquiry found both companies had violated the Digital Services Act, the EU\u2019s trailblazing digital rule book that imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online, including making it easier to report counterfeit or unsafe goods or flag harmful or illegal content like hate speech, as well as a ban on ads targeted at children.",

That means platforms must empower users, respect their rights, and open their systems to scrutiny. The DSA makes this a duty, not a choice.\u201d",
      "The 27-nation bloc launched investigations in 2024 into both Meta and TikTok. They found that the companies did not allow easy access to data for researchers. They also found that Meta's Instagram and Facebook did not make it easy for users to flag illegal content and effectively challenge moderation decisions. \u201cAllowing researchers access to platforms\u2019 data is an essential transparency obligation under the DSA, as it provides public scrutiny into the potential impact of platforms on our physical and mental health,\u201d according to a statement by the European Commission, the EU's executive body. The inquiry found both Facebook and Instagram deployed \u201cdark patterns\u201d or deceptive interface designs for its protocol for flagging malicious content like child sex abuse or terrorist content.

      "On Thursday, Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., penned a letter to executives at the firm responsible for the demolition seeking evidence that the company complied with regulations dictating the safe removal of asbestos and lead -- or if, instead, they \"cut corners\" and \"gambled with people's health.\"",
      "\"The demolition of a structure of the age and historic national significance of the East Wing demands the highest possible standards of care, not the lowest bid and a blind eye toward regulation,\" Markey wrote to leaders of ACECO, a Maryland-based demolition contractor.",
      "The senator's overture comes days after the nation's largest asbestos victims' organization raised alarms about whether the White House may have deviated from accepted practices for handling these materials.",
      "\"Federal law requires comprehensive asbestos inspection, notification, and abatement before any demolition,\" wrote the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization (ADAO) last week. \"No publicly available information demonstrates that these statutory obligations have been fulfilled.\"",
      "A White House official would not say whether asbestos was found in the East Wing, but told ABC News that \"a very extensive abatement and remediation assessment was followed, complying with all applicable federal standards.\"",
      "The official said that \"any hazardous material abatement was done in September,\" prior to the demolition earlier this month.",
      "But Linda Reinstein, the president of ADAO, said she has seen no public evidence to suggest that an assessment or abatement took place. Federal standards require rigorous inspections to be done prior to demolition, and those inspections are then documented with a certification. If asbestos is found, workers on site would be observed wearing protective equipment, like hazmat suits.",
      "\"I am deeply concerned for White House staff and others working in or near the East Wing demolition site,\" Reinstein said. \"It remains unclear what measures have been taken to ensure the safe removal of deadly asbestos and other hazardous materials.\"",
      "Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that was commonly used in mid-century structures for fireproofing and insulation, before its deadly health risks were fully\u00a0known. Invisible asbestos fibers can become airborne whenever materials containing asbestos are disturbed during demolition, renovation, or even routine maintenance.",
      "Doctors warn\u00a0that there is no safe level of asbestos exposure,\u00a0and that even short, unprotected demolition work can damage the lungs and increase the risk of developing mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lungs. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, exposure to asbestos fibers can cause scarring in the lungs and increases the risk of mesothelioma and lung cancer.",
      "Dr. Raja Flores, a top lung doctor who is a professor and Chairman of Thoracic Surgery at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, said it can take years after inhaling the fibers for symptoms to arise.",
      "The progressive lung disease and cancer that can occur after asbestos exposure\u00a0\"makes you weak, you feel short of breath, feel like you're drowning and all these symptoms develop over a long period of time,\" Flores said. \"It is a prolonged and agonizing torture.\"",
      "\"You wouldn't catch me in there -- not without a mask\" and \"not without precautions,\" Flores said, referring to the White House complex during demolition.",

He\u2019s got men that he\u2019s in charge of. He\u2019s got enough to deal with.\u201d",
      "Even though the Trump administration has found ways to pay the troops twice since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the process has been fraught with anxiety for many Americans in uniform and their loved ones. Both times, they were left hanging until the last minute.",
      "Four days before paychecks were supposed to go out on Oct. 15, President Donald Trump directed the Pentagon to use \u201call available funds\u201d to ensure U.S. troops were paid. With the next payday approaching Friday, the White House confirmed Wednesday that it had found the money.",
      "The Trump administration plans to move around $5.3 billion from various accounts, with about $2.5 billion coming from Trump\u2019s big tax and spending cuts bill that was signed into law this summer.",
      "But the scrounging in Washington for troop pay can only last for so long.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation\u201d that the government will soon run out of ways to compensate the military and that by Nov. 15, the troops \"aren\u2019t going to be able to get paid.\u201d",

      "The Oct. 15 paychecks arrived days after they usually do for many people with early direct deposit to their bank accounts, disrupting their ability to pay bills on time and forcing some to pay late fees or rack up debt, Johnson said. Active duty troops also may be dealing with the added expense of moving from one base to another, which she said occurs for roughly 400,000 military households each year.",
      "And many military spouses lose their jobs because of the move or are underemployed from frequent relocations, Johnson said. Reimbursements for moving costs are paused for many during the shutdown, while not all expenses are being repaid.",
      "Monthly weekend drills for many reservists also have been canceled, eliminating a chunk of pay that can be several hundred dollars each month, military advocates said. Besides helping with mortgages and other bills, the drill money is used by some reservists to cover premiums for military health insurance, said John Hashem, executive director of the Reserve Organization of America, an advocacy group.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is forging ahead with plans to eject some nonprofits from a popular student loan forgiveness program if their work is deemed to have a \u201csubstantial illegal purpose\u201d \u2014 a move that could cut off some teachers, doctors and other public workers from federal loan cancellation.",
      "New rules finalized Thursday give the Education Department expanded power to ban organizations from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The Trump administration calls it necessary to block taxpayer money from lawbreakers. Critics say it turns the program into a tool of political retribution.",
      "Set to take effect in July, the policy is aimed primarily at organizations that work with immigrants and transgender youth.",
      "It grants the education secretary power to exclude groups from the program if they engage in activities including the trafficking or \u201cchemical castration\u201d of children, illegal immigration and supporting terrorist organizations. \u201cChemical castration\u201d is defined as using hormone therapy or drugs that delay puberty \u2014 gender-affirming care common for transgender children or teens.",
      "It amounts to a major reworking of a program that has canceled loans for more than 1 million Americans and was created by Congress in 2007 to steer more college graduates into lower-paying public sector jobs. The Trump administration has yet to identify specific groups it intends to target, but it estimates fewer than 10 would be barred per year.",
      "\u201cIllegal activity by its very nature runs contrary to the public good,\u201d the Education Department wrote in a fact sheet. \u201cCongress focuses on public service, and the Trump Administration will not direct taxpayer dollars from hardworking Americans to organizations that are breaking the law.\u201d",
      "The program promises to cancel federal student loans for government employees and many nonprofit workers after they have made 10 years of payments. It has long been open to government workers, teachers, firefighters and employees of public hospitals. Eligibility rules laid out by Congress focus mostly on nonprofits\u2019 tax status and their field of work.",
      "The benefit has gone to workers at organizations across the political spectrum. Yet in a March action demanding new limits, President Donald Trump said it has \u201cmisdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.\u201d",
      "A central concern of critics is the wide latitude the department is giving itself to determine if an organization's work should be considered to have a \u201csubstantial illegal purpose.\u201d",
      "Employers across state and local government as well as nonprofits can be expelled from the program if a state or federal court rules against them or if they agree to a legal settlement that includes admission of guilt. It appears that performing gender-affirming care in the 27 states that outlaw it, for example, could be grounds for expulsion.",
      "Even without a legal finding, the education secretary will be able to independently determine that an organization should be barred. The secretary would weigh whether the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d leans against the employer.",

      "Among those opposing the proposal were prominent associations in higher education, health care and legal professions. In public comments submitted to the department, many called it an illegal overstep and said it would undermine an incentive that has helped address work shortages in high-demand fields.",
      "The American Bar Association said it could decrease the ranks of public defenders and those in public interest law. Thousands of people will lose access to representation, the association said, \u201csimply because those attorneys\u2019 jobs were deemed politically unfavorable by the Secretary.\u201d",
      "The National Council of Nonprofits said the policy would allow future administrations from any political party to change eligibility rules \u201cbased on their own priorities or ideology.\u201d",

Tim Walberg, R-Mich., chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said the overhaul will prevent taxpayers from covering loan relief for employees at \u201cradical organizations that violate state and federal laws.\u201d \u201cAiding illegal immigration, supporting terrorism, or promoting child abuse through gender transitions is not \u2018public service,'\u201d Walberg said in a statement.",
      "According to the new rules, employers can only be sanctioned for activities that take place on or after July 1, 2026. They would be notified and given a chance to review the evidence and respond to the department's findings. Those barred from the program can reapply for eligibility after 10 years or rejoin sooner if they follow a \u201ccorrective action plan\u201d approved by the secretary.",

      "U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the WRAP until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s very problematic,\u201d Van Hollen told The Associated Press. \u201cThey want to keep the public in the dark.\u201d",
      "The senators' letter cites an AP investigation this month that revealed several examples of ICE using the device on people \u2014 sometimes for hours \u2014 on deportation flights dating to 2020. Van Hollen was joined by U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Alex Padilla of California, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, and six others.",
      "The WRAP is the subject of several federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture. Advocates have expressed concern that ICE is not tracking the WRAP\u2019s use as required by federal law when officers use force, making it difficult to discern exactly how many people are being subjected to the restraints.",
      "\u201cWhen an organization like DHS doesn\u2019t want transparency, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want people to know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Van Hollen said, referring to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE's parent agency.",
      "In addition to the letter, U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., told AP in a statement that she is working on a bill to rein in the agency's use of the WRAP.",
      "\u201cICE\u2019s use of full-body restraints to immobilize detained individuals raises serious concerns about the safety, dignity, and human rights of those under their jurisdiction,\u201d Ramirez said.",
      "DHS has not answered detailed questions from the AP about the use of the WRAP. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin previously said that ICE's practices \u201calign with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.\u201d",
      "The AP found that DHS has paid the manufacturer of the WRAP, Safe Restraints Inc., $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015, during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending.",

      "A former South Carolina sheriff is set to plead guilty to federal charges that he stole from a benevolence fund and took pain medication meant for destruction",
      "A former South Carolina sheriff is expected to plead guilty Thursday to federal charges that he stole from his force's benevolence fund and took pain medication that was supposed to be destroyed as part of a pill take-back program.",
      "Former Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright signed a plea agreement last month with federal prosecutors on charges of conspiring to commit theft concerning programs receiving federal funds and conspiring to commit wire fraud and obtaining controlled substances through misrepresentation. He is scheduled to appear Thursday morning at the federal courthouse in Anderson.",
      "Wright will be at least the 12th sheriff in South Carolina to be convicted or plead guilty to on-duty crimes in the past 15 years for misconduct ranging from extorting drug dealers to having inmates work at their homes to hiring a woman and then pressuring her to have sex.",
      "Sheriffs run the law enforcement organizations in the state's 46 counties. South Carolina law gives the elected officials wide latitude over how their money is spent, what crimes their agencies concentrate on stopping and who gets hired and fired. They also provide little oversight beyond a vote by the people of each county every four years.",
      "Beyond abusing power, there is little in common among the convicted sheriffs. They've been in small rural agencies and big, urban ones. There was a scheme to create false police reports to help clients of a friend's credit repair business. A sheriff took bribes to keep a restaurant owner's employees from being deported. One covered up an illegal arrest. And another punched a woman in the face and stole her cellphone.",
      "In Wright's case, the former sheriff plundered the fund meant to help deputies who face financial difficulties, including once saying he needed cash to send an officer to Washington to honor a deputy killed in the line of duty. Instead the money went in his own pocket, federal prosecutors said.",

      "Most of Wright's crimes happened as he dealt with an addiction to painkillers. In addition to the drugs he took from pill take-back program, Wright also got a blank check from the benevolence fund and used it to pay for oxycodone and hydrocodone pills, writing it out his dealer, according to court records.",
      "Wright also faces more than 60 charges of ethics violations for using his county-issued credit card for personal expenses. In all, there was more than $50,000 in disputed spending, including more than $1,300 he allegedly spent at Apple's app store and almost $1,600 he paid for Sirius/XM radio, according to court records.",
      "Wright agreed to plead guilty in federal court to conspiracy to commit theft concerning programs receiving federal funds, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and obtaining controlled substances through misrepresentation. He is scheduled to appear Thursday morning at the courthouse in Anderson.",
      "The maximum penalty for all three counts combined is nearly 30 years, although Wright will likely receive a much lighter sentence. He also will have to pay at least $440,000 in restitution. A sentencing date has not been set.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Wednesday that the U.S. military carried out another strike on a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing all four people aboard, as the Trump administration pursues its divisive campaign against drug cartels in the waters off South America.",

      "A video posted by Hegseth shows a boat exploding into flames and smoke. It was the 14th strike since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.",
      "The Trump administration also has been building up an unusually large force of warships in the region, carrying Marines and aircraft.

      "But as the number of strikes has grown, a debate in Congress has escalated over the limits of the president\u2019s power. The attacks have occurred without any legal investigation or a traditional declaration of war from Congress, and some lawmakers have raised questions about the lack of hard evidence to justify the killings.",

      "The law, dating to the 1970s, was struck down as unconstitutional by Superior Court judge Josie Garton last year, a victory for the group that brought the challenge, Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky. The state appealed Garton's ruling.",
      "Planned Parenthood has argued there is no medical justification for the restriction and that it unfairly burdens those seeking an abortion by limiting the pool of those qualified to provide care. In 2021, Garton granted the group\u2019s request to allow advanced practice clinicians \u2014 health care workers, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants \u2014 to provide medication abortion pending her decision in the underlying case. They have continued to do so and since the 2024 ruling also have been able to provide procedural abortions, Planned Parenthood says.",
      "Advanced practice clinicians routinely provide care similar in risk and complexity to that of providing abortion services, and in 25 states can provide medication abortion, attorneys for Planned Parenthood said in court documents. Planned Parenthood's advanced practice clinicians seek to provide abortion care in just the first trimester, the attorneys said.",
      "Since Garton's 2021 decision, advanced practice clinicians have been providing \u201cnearly all\u201d medication abortions in Alaska, and Planned Parenthood clinics in the state have been able to offer medication abortion each day they've been open, the attorneys wrote. Before that, doctors hired by Planned Parenthood on a per diem basis \u2014 at the clinics on limited days \u2014 were able to offer medication abortions perhaps once or twice a week at each clinic, they wrote.",

      "A coalition of news organizations including The Associated Press is suing Tennessee\u2019s top prisons official and a warden, alleging state execution protocols unconstitutionally limit the media's access and hamper thorough and accurate reporting.",
      "Currently, reporters witnessing lethal injections do not see the entire process. The coalition argues the protocols violate \u201cthe public and press\u2019s statutory and constitutional rights to witness the entirety of executions conducted by the Tennessee Department of Correction, from the time the condemned enters the execution chamber until after the condemned is declared dead.\u201d",
      "They're seeking a judgment that the protocols are unconstitutional and an injunction to allow the press to see the full execution process.",
      "\u201cThis lack of access has limited the public\u2019s ability to obtain information from independent observers about execution proceedings in Tennessee,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in Davidson County Chancery Court in Nashville, names as defendants Kenneth Nelsen, warden of Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville that houses Tennessee\u2019s execution chamber, and Frank Strada, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Correction.",
      "A department spokesperson said Wednesday that it does not comment on pending litigation. Nelsen's office referred a reporter to the department.",
      "During executions, media members begin seeing what happens once the condemned person is already strapped to a gurney and hooked up to IV lines. They don\u2019t know at which precise moment the injections begin and those administering the injections are in a separate room.",
      "The protocol says that after the syringes of saline and pentobarbital are administered, a team leader signals to the warden and a five-minute waiting period begins. After that period, the blinds are closed, the camera is turned off and then the doctor comes in to determine if the person is dead. If that is the case, the warden announces on the intercom system that the sentence was carried out and witnesses are directed to exit.",
      "The lawsuit says the First Amendment of the U.S. and Tennessee Constitutions guarantee the public's right to witness the entirety of executions. Tennessee law spells out specific categories of witnesses entitled to be present at executions, such as seven members of the news media.",
      "The lawsuit cited the August execution of Byron Black, during which curtains in the witness room were only open for 10 minutes.",
      "The Nashville Banner\u2019s reporting on Black\u2019s death said that according to his attorney, medical personnel had trouble finding veins in his arms, which led to a puddle of blood on his right side. The attorney said it took 10 minutes just for the tubes to be attached.",

      "A pair of court rulings declaring some of Florida\u2019s gun restrictions unconstitutional are creating some confusion in the notoriously firearm friendly state",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A pair of court rulings declaring some of Florida's gun restrictions unconstitutional are creating some confusion in the notoriously firearm-friendly state \u2014 and fueling activists' calls for Republican legislators to take action to update state statutes so they abide by the new legal landscape.",
      "Despite Florida's history of being a gun-supporting climate, Florida's GOP-dominated state Legislature took steps to restrict gun laws in the wake of the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Since the day the measure was signed into law, gun rights advocates have been pushing to unravel it.",
      "Now, activists say recent court rulings are fueling their push to expand gun rights in the state, emboldened by U.S. Supreme Court's updated standards for evaluating gun laws based on the nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation.",
      "\u201cLeaving unconstitutional laws on the books creates nothing but confusion,\u201d said Sean Caranna, executive director of the advocacy group Florida Carry.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "A ruling by a circuit court judge in Broward County, home to Fort Lauderdale, found that Florida's prohibition against people under the age of 21 from carrying a concealed firearm is unconstitutional, at least as it relates to the case in question.",
      "Last week, Judge Frank Ledee tossed out the conviction of 19-year-old Joel Walkes, who was charged with a third-degree felony for carrying a concealed handgun. Florida statutes currently allow people between the age of 18 and 20 to possess a firearm, if they legally receive it as a gift or an inheritance, but they are barred from purchasing guns or carrying them concealed.",
      "Ledee found the state's prohibition is incompatible with the Supreme Court's historical test, and inconsistent with a recent appeals court ruling that found a state law banning the open carrying of firearms is unconstitutional. In his decision, the judge pointed to the Legislature's role in codifying and clarifying the changes.",
      "\u201cDistilling these inconsistencies into a framework of firearm regulations compatible with the guarantee to bear arms pursuant to the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution is best left to the wisdom of legislative debate,\" Ledee wrote.",
      "Florida's First District Court of Appeal issued its ruling last month in a case stemming from the July 4, 2022, arrest of a man who stood at a major intersection in downtown Pensacola carrying a visible, holstered pistol and a copy of the U.S. Constitution.",
      "The decision legalizes open carry, though there are preexisting limitations against carrying in a threatening manner or in certain restricted spaces like government meetings, schools and bars. The ruling has prompted some Florida sheriffs to urge caution among gun owners and seek clarity from lawmakers.",

      "Legalizing open carry has long been a major focus of gun rights activists in the state, who oppose the slate of restrictions that Florida\u2019 lawmakers implemented in the wake of the Parkland school shooting, which killed 17 people and injured 17 others. Among the law's provisions was raising the legal gun-buying age to 21.",
      "Bob Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University, said the recent court decisions put more onus on lawmakers to enact state statutes that line up with recent judicial rulings.",
      "\u201cI would not be surprised if in the next session the Florida Legislature doesn\u2019t just take care of this by amending the statute to say, \u2018clean it up.\u2019 And then that\u2019ll end all these lawsuits and possible lawsuits,\" Jarvis said of the age-related prohibition. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really now what should happen.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Attorneys for Sami Hamdi, a British political commentator being held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in California, are challenging his detention in court, his legal team said Wednesday.",
      "Hamdi, who is Muslim, was detained Sunday by ICE officers at San Francisco International Airport, according to federal officials. His lawyers say the arrest was triggered by his criticism of the Israeli government, while U.S. officials have pointed to comments he made after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, which they claim celebrated the violence.",
      "The detention was the latest in broader efforts by the administration to identify and potentially expel thousands of foreigners in the United States who it says have either fomented or participated in unrest or publicly supported protests against Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza.",
      "Those enforcement actions have been criticized by civil rights groups as violations of constitutional protections for freedom of speech, which apply to anyone in the United States and not just to American citizens.",
      "Lawyers with the the Council on American-Islamic Relations, who are representing Hamdi, on Tuesday filed a writ of habeas corpus demanding that the government justify why he is being held, the council said.",
      "In addition, they asked a judge to issue a temporary restraining order seeking a bond hearing and blocking Hamdi's removal from the U.S. while the case is adjudicated.",
      "\u201cIf the government can cancel a valid visa because it does not like what a person says, then anyone legally visiting, studying, or working in our country is in danger of politically motivated abduction,\" the group said in a statement. \u201cThis must end with Sami Hamdi.\u201d",

How many of you felt the euphoria? Allah Akbar.\u201d Hamdi said later his intent was not to praise the attacks but to suggest that the violence was \u201ca natural consequence of the oppression that is being put on the Palestinians.\u201d",
      "ICE said Sunday that Hamdi entered the U.S. on Oct. 19 on a visitor visa, which was revoked on Oct. 24, and he was placed in immigration proceedings for removal.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Actress June Lockhart (June 25, 1925-Oct 23, 2025) was best known for roles in two popular TV series: as Ruth Martin in \"Lassie,\" and as Maureen Robinson, matriarch of a family that was \"Lost in Space.\"",
      "The daughter of actors Gene and Kathleen Lockhart, June appeared on stage in New York beginning at age 6. After her parents moved to Hollywood, she made her unbilled film debut at age 13 alongside Gene and Kathleen, who played Bob Cratchit and his wife, in 1938's \"A Christmas Carol.\" June's first credit was in the Bette Davis drama \"All This, and Heaven Too.\" \u00a0She appeared in \"Sergeant York,\" \"The White Cliffs of Dover,\" \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" and \"She-Wolf of London,\" and won a Tony Award for the 1947 comedy \"For Love or Money.\" But her starring role in 1945's \"Son of Lassie\" (as the adult version of the character played by Elizabeth Taylor in the original) foreshadowed what would become her most familiar role.",
      "In 1958, Lockhart joined the TV series \"Lassie\" as Ruth Martin (taking over the role played by Cloris Leachman). For six years, in more than 200 episodes, Lockhart dispensed motherly wisdom to young Timmy (Jon Provost), who would engage in less-than-proper behavior or find himself in danger (but never, as the trope suggested, fallen down a well), only to be rescued by his faithful collie.",
      "And she knew who the star of the show was. \"Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it,\" she told The New York Times in 2004.",
      "The show, which aired on CBS, featured scripts that were in some cases written by blacklisted writers. \"When people come up to me and say, 'Well, sure wish we had wonderful American shows like that the way we used to in the 50's,' I say, 'Let me tell you who wrote those scripts Yes, they were good Americans, and they were in jail,'\" she said.",
      "Beginning in 1965, Lockhart starred in the frequently campy science fiction series \"Lost in Space.\" For three seasons, the Robinson Family \u2013 crewmembers aboard the doomed Jupiter II spacecraft \u2013 were marooned, or attacked by monsters and evil aliens (and in one notorious incident, a talking carrot), all while dealing with typical family drama. \"It was really endearing. 'Lost in Space' was like going out in the backyard in the sand and playing space. We did have fun,\" she said at a 2010 public appearance. She was also a NASA spokesperson, and attended space shuttle launches.",
      "In 1968, she joined the cast of \"Petticoat Junction\" for the sitcom's last two seasons. She also appeared on \"General Hospital,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"Ellery Queen,\" \"Quincy, M.E.,\" \"Vega$,\" \"Magnum, P.I.,\" \"Knots Landing,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Full House,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"Beverly Hills, 90210,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" and \"Cold Case.\" She provided the voice of Alpha Control in the 2021 Netflix reboot of \"Lost in Space.\" She also starred in touring productions of \"Steel Magnolias,\" \"Bedroom Farce\" and \"Once More with Feeling.\"",
      "In the 1950s, while appearing as a panelist on the Fred Friendly-produced game show \"Who Said That?,\" Lockhart met White House press correspondents. A self-described \"news junkie,\" she later traveled with them while they covered the 1956 presidential campaigns. When she filled in for the host of a TV talk show, she used her connections to interview President Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty. As thanks, Hagerty gave Lockhart a lifetime press pass. She used it for decades to attend White House briefings whenever she was in Washington."

She was the first recipient of the award, which is now no longer a category. Her award was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 2008.",

      "In his new book, \"The Running Ground: A Father, a Son, and the Simplest of Sports\" (to be published Oct. 28 by Random House), tech journalist and CEO of The Atlantic Nicholas Thompson explores his passion for running, the simplicity of the sport, and how it has changed his sense of self.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Tony Dokoupil's interview with Nicholas Thompson on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" October 26!",
      "\"The Running Ground\" by Nicholas Thompson",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Running is the simplest of sports: right foot, left foot, right foot. There's no ball to focus on, no mat to land on, no one charging toward you with their shoulder down. But the simplicity opens up complexity. As you run, your attention shifts inward. You're just you \u2014 right foot, left foot, and whatever goes on in your mind.",
      "Running strips you down. The less clothing you wear, the faster you go. The lighter your shoes, the faster you go. As you go faster, your head empties too. At a certain point, all you can register is the sensation of each foot striking the pavement. Mind and matter briefly become one.",
      "You may have to worry about wind and rain and heat, but you rarely have to worry about anyone else. You do it by yourself, which gives you control. You don't need to travel to a gym or a field; you just need to open your front door. The sport's simplicity means your successes are your own, and also that there's no one else to blame when you fail. And no sport shows the relentless decline of the aging body more clearly than running. If you can't do what you did a year or a month ago, the evidence is right there on your watch.",
      "Sometimes, I use running as a form of meditation. I put on my shoes and go out. I connect my watch to satellites and then try to disconnect my mind from the swirl inside. Eventually, I'm alone in my head. Sometimes, I'll focus on a musical mantra: \"one-two-three, one-two-three,\" tracking my steps and making sure I keep my left and right feet alternating symmetrically on the downbeat. Other times, I focus on my breath or on the sounds and motion around me, whether the blue jays in the Catskills or the trucks rumbling by on Broadway. Sometimes, as with all meditation, my attention wanders, like a stream flowing haphazardly through my mind, collecting sticks and carrying them until they wash to the side.",
      "When I run a workout, though, everything changes. I'm not trying to open my mind; I'm trying to close it. I shut out the blue jays and the trucks. I have to focus. If I'm with a training partner, I lock my attention on their shoulder if I'm behind or on their breath if I'm ahead. Usually, though, I'm on my own. I look for runners up the road and set imaginary races against them: Can I catch the lady in the purple sweatshirt before the second oak tree? Can I stay an even twenty meters behind the cyclist playing John Coltrane on a boom box? I check my watch and try not to let my pace deviate from the goal. I try to identify the parts of my body that hurt and then I push the pain away from them. I remind myself that I have run this fast before. Self-doubt is a smoldering fire. In a workout, the embers often flash. I don't want to give them any air. Every action we take helps to build our habits. Quit once and it'll be easier to quit the second time too.",
      "I don't listen to music while I run. Every workout is a physical challenge \u2014 I'm trying to strengthen the muscles in my legs and my heart \u2014 but it's also a mental challenge. I'm trying to teach my body how to move quickly and with good coordination through space. Running is a process of learning about your body and developing habits deep inside it. Music can confuse the signals. I want to deepen my understanding of the relationship between my stride, my pace, my breath. I don't want a bassline, or the adrenaline that can flow with it, to get in the way.",
      "When I race in a marathon, my goal early on is to spend as little energy as possible thinking about anything extraneous. I think about posture and form and balance. I try not to think about the people cheering. I try not to think about past fail\u00adures or successes. I try to glance as infrequently as possible at my watch. It takes energy, after all, to turn your head, and it takes energy to think. When people in my pack ask questions, or offer commentary, I respond in grunts. On easy runs with friends in the park, I'm a chatterbox. When I race, I'm a vault.",
      "Over the years, the sport has shifted my imagination and my sense of self. When I travel by train, I find myself looking out the window and noting spots to run by the creeks and forests nearby. When I arrive in a new city, I like to circle it with a run. I've seen more of the world while running than I have while walking. I have recurring dreams of mountains I've run up. But I spend much of the day at a desk, mind-wired to my to-do list. Running is my one connection to na\u00adture and to a younger, adventurous self who only and always wanted to be outside.",

      "Grace",
      "There was a show on tv called \"Let's Make A Deal.\" People would be contestants, hoping host Monty Hall would pick them to compete for prizes. New cars, new kitchens with all the appliances, expensive watches. You had to pick.",
      "",
      "One of two things: color tvs and washer/dryer sets, or what was behind Door No. 3, knowing it could be a wheelbarrow with some grass seed, or a new car.",
      "I've always been attracted to what's behind Door No. 3. That idea of the big unknown you can't see always appealed to me. The seeker inside has chased the unknown all my life.",
      "When you're a dreamer, you can't not take Door No. 3. That mentality fuels you. Seeking inspiration, wanting to find out has risk involved. Some Door No. 3s don't work out. But Grace Potter? She's the epitome of why Door No. 3 is always better than playing it safe.",
      "\"You & Tequila\" showed up in my email in the middle of the night.",
      "I remember listening, thinking, \"Damn\u2026,\"",
      "That idea of a person you can't quit, because they're so addictive is real. You can't resist, only overdo it to the point of poisoning yourself hit me. I called Matraca Berg, asked if there was a demo with a man singing it; she had one. Hearing Tim Krekel sing it hit me even harder.",
      "We cut it really simple. That pull between what you want and knowing you shouldn't made \"You & Tequila\" burn into people.",
      "We were about done with Hemingway's Whiskey. I wanted something to make it shine. Buddy Cannon and I were talking about who might sound good; Clint Higham, my co-manager, even reached out to Irving Azoff about the Eagles, since this sounded like a classic Laurel Canyon song.",
      "Then the woman who sent me the demo asked, \"Why don't you get Grace Potter? She captures that haunted and haunting feeling.\"",
      "What makes Grace Potter, the ultimate Door No. 3, was the mystery. The hippie songwriter/rock girl.",
      "Once she was suggested, as much as it made no sense on paper, I knew she was the person we needed.",
      "I listen to a lot of music at night in the Virgin Islands. No light pollution, you can drift in the sounds. I'd been given Grace's live CD. \"Apologies\" poured out of the speakers.",
      "Motionless on a chaise lounge, when I heard Grace's voice \u2013 so soulful, but beautiful and real \u2013 I was floored. Nobody in my life had heard this voice except my friend. I felt blessed.",
      "She wrote her own songs. She had a band, wasn't overproduced. Really listening, it was how she played that B-3 organ, but especially how she sang those songs.",
      "I looked up at the sky and exhaled. She sounded like coming home.",
      "When we put her on \"You & Tequila,\" all she knew about me was \"She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy\" because the Eagle in Burlington, Vermont had played it to death.",
      "Was it even possible? Grace had finished a European tour, traveled 24 hours with no sleep and was landing in America. We laugh now, but she listened to the demo on the rental car shuttle having cleared customs.",
      "She was tired. She missed her family. And we needed her in Nashville within 48 hours to make the deadline for mastering \u2013 or we'd have to move the record. Her manager wasn't optimistic. My friend insisted, \"Give her the song.\"",
      "",
      "Thirty minutes later, we had a yes. Thirty hours later, Grace Potter landed in Nashville in a flowy leopard print dress, walked into Blackbird Recording Studios and changed both of our lives. Brash, smart and funny, she oozed music. She told wild stories, made some people blush and asked us what we were thinking.",
      "Buddy suggested, \"Get in the booth and put your headphones on. See how it feels to you.\"",
      "Probably warming up, she was humming. Then that \"ooooohOOOOOHohhhh\" she does on the record rolled out.",
      "\"Do some more of that.\"",
      "Two or three takes later, we were done. We'd talked longer than she was in the vocal booth. Even before it was mixed, we knew it was something. That's the thing: you know.",
      "It was my birthday. I asked her and her boyfriend if they'd like to have dinner. We went to Sunset Grille, sat outside on the patio and laughed. We came from musically different places; her country music was Willie, Townes Van Zandt and Lucinda Williams. But we were of the same heart, same small town, family-oriented life.",
      "She was tired, so we didn't hang long. When I got up to leave, she followed me, jumped in the passenger seat of my car, and announced, \"I don't know what the future holds, but we're going to be friends for life.\"",
      "Grace Potter knew things. I've always believed there are things in our lives that were pre-determined; set into motion by some larger power. Grace was absolutely one.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:24:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Nicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic and author of \"The Running Ground,\" talks about how his father inspired him to become a world-class long-distance runner.",
    "story": [
      "One of the first things you realize about Nick Thompson is just how busy he is, as CEO of The Atlantic; as a public speaker; and on top of it all, as a family man. But he is also a world-class long-distance runner.",
      "He ran to the office on the day we talked. \"I did, of course,\" he said.",
      "\"Why do you like it?\" I asked.",
      "\"Every time I go running, I'm opening my mind up, I'm engaging with nature,\" he said. \"I have a chance to think. I like to have my body in motion. It's a break from the rest of life. It's something I've always loved.\"",
      "And if you can imagine, Thompson has actually gotten faster as he's gotten older, shaving 14 minutes off his best marathon time at 44 \u2013 and just this year, posting the fastest 50-mile time in the world for his age group.",
      "If you're wondering how he does it, and why, he explains in \"The Running Ground\" \u2013 part memoir, part call to the runner in all of us.",
      "\"Everybody can run,\" he said. \"Go to Prospect Park, right, and look at the incredible, beautiful variety. Short people, tall people, really skinny people, wide people. Everybody can run. Humans were made to run.\"",
      "Thompson says he started running because his father was a runner. \"There was always energy and chaos and life around him,\" he said. \"He never slowed down, he never stopped.\"",
      "But in a life of great professional success \u2013 teaching and working in both the Ford and Reagan administrations \u2013 Scott Thompson also suffered personal turmoil.",
      "Thompson writes that one of his father's refrains was to tell him that his life is going to crack apart when he turns 40. \"He told me that all the time,\" he said. \"You know, his father, his life had gotten much harder and kind of fallen apart at 40. And then my dad felt that his life had kind of fallen apart at 40.\"",
      "Scott left the family when Nick was just a kid, and then struggled with just about everything. \"He was an alcoholic and he was a sex addict,\" said Thompson. \"But he wasn't a mean drunk, a fall-over drunk. He just drank way too much. And then in his later life, after he came out of the closet \u2013 in his 40s and 50s, 60s, 70s \u2013 he had a terrible problem with sex addiction.\"",
      "For Nick, running became both a way to be like his father, while also rejecting the chaos that followed him. \"In some ways, running is a way of mourning him after he passed away,\" he said. \"I also am well aware that he could not control his emotions. He could not control what he did during the course of a day. I felt like one of the ways I could prevent that from happening to me was to run, that running gave me discipline through the rest of my life.\"",
      "So, Thompson ran. He ran in high school, and briefly in college at Stanford. And after a break, he picked it up again in his late 20s, which is when he got the news: \"I had just run my first really good marathon and felt on top of the world. And it's two weeks later, the next week I go in and see the doctor and he is like, 'I feel something.'\"",
      "It turned out to be thyroid cancer. \"I was diagnosed when I was 30 years old and it was just a shock,\" he said.",
      "Shocking as it was, it was treatable, and it gave Thompson a new goal. He said, \"One of the reasons I kept marathoning in my 30s and in my 40s was because I wanted to feel like the person I had been before I got sick.\"",
      "As he got faster, his career took off, too. He joined Cond\u00e9 Nast, where he would eventually become editor of newyorker.com and editor-in-chief of Wired. Longtime viewers of \"Sunday Morning\" may remember he even reported for this show, in stories on QAnon, the 2020 election, and Wikipedia.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think you'd be where you are professionally without running?\"",
      "\"Definitely not,\" he replied. \"I think running has been a great tool professionally. It is a way for me to add discipline to my days, for me to have time where my mind can just wander, where I can think through things.\"",
      "But for Thompson, now 50, what's really unexpected is what happened next. He is faster today than he was at age 35. \"I like to think of it as the aging process as a moving sidewalk, you know, pushing you backwards, right? Like, every year I get a little bit weaker. But you can do things to kind of move forward faster than the moving sidewalk is going backwards. You can figure out how to train more intelligently. You can get a better understanding of your body. You can eat differently.\"",
      "Which is not to say that's it's easy.",
      "I asked, \"If you're trying to encourage people to run, why do you post from time to time pictures of yourself looking in absolute agony? Like crossing a finish line? I mean, terrible photos. Some of the all-time worst anyone's ever put out in public voluntarily!\"",
      "\"So, that race was really hard,\" he said. \"It was the Lake Waramaug 50-miler, and I wanted to set the American record for my age group. And I was on pace through 45, 46 miles. And then the last few miles, I knew I was gonna be close, and so I was pushing so hard. I was just \u2026 hurting so much everywhere. But I still won the race. I still ran the fastest time in the world this year. It was still like a pretty good result.\"",
      "Running continues to be a family tradition for the Thompsons. Nick runs with his own three sons, and coaches weekly track sessions with his youngest son's soccer team. He said, \"It feels like full circle to have learned the sport from my father when I was about 5 or 6, and now being able to pass it to my children \u2013 James is 11, Zachary's 15, Ellis is 17. It's a great thing. And there's all these other kids!\"",
      "And as it turns out, life hasn't fallen apart like his father warned.",
      "\"You've kind of done it!\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I mean, I keep going because I enjoy it, right?\" Thompson laughed. \"I keep running because, you know, my life didn't fall apart at 40 'cause I didn't lose my discipline at 40, but could still fall apart at 50, which I just turned. And so, I don't wanna let it go. The really interesting transition in my life will be at some point I won't be able to do this, and then I'll have to figure out how else to hold on.\"",

    "summary": "The Oscar-winning director is adding his spin to the mythic tale of a scientist creating a man from body parts. He talks about his lifelong fascination with Mary Shelley's story, and how \"in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
    "story": [
      "Director Guillermo del Toro (\"Pan's Labyrinth,\" \"The Shape of Water\") hovered over a model representing the creature in his latest film, \"Frankenstein.\" \"We made, I think, the most extensive, minute, anatomical putting together of the monster in the history of cinema,\" he said.",
      "He considered every tendon, every suture, every organ, and admits for some that can be a bit much. \"Sorry about breakfast!\" he laughed.",
      "But to bring Victor Frankenstein's monster to life in cinema, the filmmaker first was playing creator himself. Del Toro, who resurrected \"Frankenstein\" for Netflix as writer, producer and director, took \"Sunday Morning\" around a London exhibition detailing his elaborate vision for the gothic classic \u2013 from wardrobe and props, to his extensive notes, which he spent years writing.",
      "There is also, in a glass case, the original text, inscribed from Mary Shelley to Lord Byron. \"This is the one I would steal,\" he joked. \"I would do a full Pink Panther.\"",
      "The groundbreaking novel about a scientist who creates a living, feeling being mixes horror, romance, and humanity. It was penned by Mary Shelley, who finished it when she was just 19, more than 200 years ago.",
      "So, why does her story endure? \"Well, first of all, it was written by a teenager that was full of questions and rage and rebellion,\" del Toro said. \"You know, it's the same questions we have now: What are we? Why am I human? Why am I here?\"",
      "Is it a coincidence that the film comes out around Halloween? \"No! No!\" he said. \"To me, Halloween is all year long.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\" I asked.",
      "\"I live a house that has secret passages. I live in a house that is inhabited full of monsters,\" he said.",
      "\"In your mind?\"",
      "\"No, I built it! When I was forty-something, I invested everything I had into creating the house I wanted when I was 7.\"",
      "\"Well, no wonder you wanted to make 'Frankenstein'!\"",
      "\"I have a room dedicated to 'Frankenstein.' I call it the living room.\"",
      "And what does he do in that room? \"I say hello to all the figures in the morning, I write, I investigate, I design.\"",
      "He started experiencing life through literature, he says, growing up in Guadalajara, Mexico. But for him, \"Frankenstein\" was not just any story he'd read. \"You really wanted to make this film,\" I said.",
      "\"I gave it over 50 years of my life, so yes,\" del Toro said. \"It's in all of my movies. All 13 movies have elements   of the film. 'Pinocchio' is another prodigal father asking for forgiveness of his child. My first movie, 'Cronus,' deals with eternal life. 'Shape of Water,' certainly, the idea of the monster being of the same essence than the main female character, and the female character recognizing herself in it.\"",
      "\"We are all creatures,\" he said. \"I mean, we have a world that tells you you shouldn't be a creature, but in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
      "And in what ways is del Toro weird? \"I was this strange, pale creature that liked to read, and I was a hypochondriac at age seven. I thought I had trichinosis. I thought have cirrhosis. And I studied medical manuals, and I would go to my mom and say, 'I think I have a terminal cancer.' So I was a weird, weird kid.\"",
      "And for del Toro, there is an appeal to monsters: \"Monsters tell you, look, it's okay to be you. It's okay to be imperfect.\"",
      "\"You say someone needs to tell you it's okay to be you. Who was that person for you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Boris Karloff, Godzilla, the Creature from the Black Lagoon! What is beautiful about monsters is they become patron saints of imperfection.\"",
      "Boris Karloff's 1931 portrayal of Mary Shelley's monster is film history. In del Toro's reimagination, Oscar Isaac is Victor Frankenstein, birthing a creature played by Jacob Elordi.",
      "\"Every day there was some new, beautiful, strange thing waiting for me to try and do,\" said Isaac. \"To be invited to do these kinds of things as a performer, it was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing.\"",
      "Asked what he did to become the creature, Elordi replied, \"I don't know if that will really fit into a news bit. I couldn't tell you. It's this elusive thing. Guillermo and I shared a language together immediately. I was, like, fully creatively ready to play something like that.\"",
      "Asked why he picked Isaac and Elordi for the roles, del Toro replied, \"Eyes. I cast the eyes.\"",
      "I asked, \"What do you see in their eyes?\"",
      "\"Oscar had brilliance, madness, seduction and pain. And Jacob was completely open. He had an innocence and an openness and a purity in his eyes that was completely disarming.\"",
      "And did the filmmaker want his monster to be beautiful? \"Oh yeah. 100%, it has to look like something newly minted,\" he said. \"Not like a repair job in an ICU.\"",
      "\"But, there's also a handsomeness, a sexiness to Jacob as the creature,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I was raised Catholic, and a lot of those crucifixions in Mexico have the loin cloth a little too low!\"",
      "\"Were you thinking about that?\"",
      "\"No,\" del Toro said, \"but my grandma certainly was!\"",
      "Del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" is rich with Catholic imagery, and inspired by all the monsters he grew up with \u2013 fuelling his lifelong cinematic mission.",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel any connection to the Frankensteins of the past?\"",
      "\"To the myth,\" he replied. \"I mean, my first crush was Mary Shelley. I truly can tell you this, you are born to sing one or two songs in your lifetime. This is my song.\"",
      "\"So, what do you do now? \"",
      "\"Oh, I don't know,\" del Toro replied. \"Macrame? Pottery?\"",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:10:19 -0400",
    "summary": "He's one of country music's most celebrated singers. But Kenny Chesney's latest work is a book, \"Heart Life Music,\" in which he describes his life's journey, from East Tennessee, to No Shoes Nation and beyond.",
    "story": [
      "Just as the sun was going down in the heart of old Key West, Florida, a self-described pirate rode his rust-ravaged bike to the Blue Heaven restaurant to meet a friend \u2013 a friend we just happened to be in the middle of interviewing. \"She said come in!\" David Wegman laughed, as he joined Kenny Chesney.",
      "But that's the thing about Chesney \u2013 down here, he's not really a country music superstar. He's just another laid-back local. \"We know a lot of the same people,\" Chesney laughed.",
      "He collects characters like seashells \u2013 he met Wegman at Ivan's Stress-Free Bar down in the British Virgin Islands. \"Above the bar was written in shells: 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem,'\" Wegman recalled.",
      "That 2002 song, \"No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems,\" helped make Chesney one of the biggest touring acts around. Almost every summer he turns stadiums into beach parties. Among his many accolades: the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year Award, which he won four years in a row. And just last week, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame \u2013 a career-topping accomplishment that he credits to taking that tropical turn in his career.",
      "\"You know what's crazy?\" he said. \"I had an 18-song Greatest Hits album, and nobody knew who I was. They knew the songs, but I wasn't comfortable in my skin yet. I didn't know who I was supposed to be as an artist yet. I would go do shows and they would go, 'Oh yeah, that's the guy that sings that song.' And then, 'That's the guy that sings that song.' When I started being my true, authentic self, that's when everything changed.\"",
      "He could have taken us to some Tiki bar down in the Keys to keep up his tropical brand. But instead, he wanted to show us the room where Ernest Hemingway worked on \"To Have and Have Not\" and \"Green Hills of Africa.\"",
      "I said, \"The space, it's almost like sacred place.\"",
      "\"Yeah, do you feel it? I feel it,\" Chesney said. \"I spent so much, almost two weeks straight on the bow of my boat in the Virgin Islands reading those books.\"",
      "Which might explain why he came down here to work on his first book, out next month: \"Heart Life Music.\" \"This book forced me to pause,\" he said.",
      "For all of his love of the islands, he writes it was his own mom who first realized that he may have drifted too far from his East Tennessee roots. \"She wanted her 12-year-old boy back in ways, and he was gone. Gone gone gone,\" he said.",
      "\"She had a hard time finding you, kind of had a hard time reaching you?\" I asked.",
      "\"It hit me a little bit, but I was so already so addicted to seeking an adventure and all of it, and all these new things happening in my life that I dismissed it.\"",
      "He kept going, kept touring, kept writing, until a concert in Indianapolis back in 2009, which he describes as hitting a wall, and crying on stage. \"In that moment I was so exhausted and numb to all of it, that it wasn't making me happy,\" he said. \"I wasn't creating the same way.\u00a0 I wasn't connecting to the audience. It just hit me.\u00a0 It took sports to get me out of that funk.\"",
      "He grew up playing baseball and football \u2013 loving every inning, every down. So, when a song called \"The Boys of Fall\" crossed his path, he didn't only record it; he began interviewing coaches and players about sports and life, and turned it into a documentary for ESPN, \"Boys of Fall.\" \"I needed Joe Namath, I needed Bill Parcells,\" he said. \"I sat in Bobby Bowden's living room and he talked to me like a deacon in a Baptist church! I woke up one day, and I went, I'm back.\"",
      "Now he's the one doing pre-game pep talks backstage, like at Sphere in Las Vegas. Many on his team have been with him for decades. There's confidence in familiarity. \"If I had to sit on the bus and think about what I'm getting ready to go do, it would \u2013 yeah, I don't do well with that,\" he said.",
      "He put on the kind of show his fans expect \u2013 a kaleidoscope of sand, sunsets and songs.",
      "When me met him the next morning, he was still buzzing about performing in Sphere. \"The first couple of nights, I caught myself singing a song and I was like, Well, this is so cool! \u00a0And then, I forgot the words to a song that I actually wrote!\"",
      "On stage with him this night was Grace Potter, the singer-songwriter he recruited for a duet, even though country really wasn't her thing. The two are now lifelong friends.",
      "\"There's people who have always seen him as just the iconic, you know, Statue of David of country music,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm gonna go to Florence and stand beside it!\" he laughed.",
      "\"But there's just so much more underneath it that's more interesting than the sculpture itself,\" Potter added.",
      "Indeed, the off-stage Kenny Chesney is a more complicated guy, a more thoughtful guy, even a little shy if you can believe it. That's the East Tennessee part that will always remain even as he's chasing sunsets.",
      "Chesney said, \"It takes a certain amount of ego to be up there on stage and to do what I do, right? But I try really hard to leave that person up there. I can't live that person every day. And I don't want that person in my life every day, but I'm really glad to meet him when I go back up there.\"",

    "summary": "Kim Kardashian revealed she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and appeared to blame stress. Doctors say stress isn't usually a direct cause, but can influence risk factors.",
    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian revealed she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm in a teaser for the new season of her family's reality TV show, \"The Kardashians.\" She appears to blame the diagnosis on stress \u2014 but doctors say that usually isn't a direct cause.",
      "In the clip shared Thursday, Kardashian, 45, is seen going in for an MRI scan and telling her family, \"There was a little aneurysm.\" She then appears to say she was told the cause was \"just stress.\" Footage from the teaser also features a sometimes emotional Kardashian talking about her difficult divorce with ex-husband Kanye West, who now goes by Ye.",
      "While stress itself doesn't create an aneurysm, it can raise blood pressure, which is related to aneurysm formation and growth, said Dr. Brian Snelling, director of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery and director of the stroke program at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida.",
      "\"The real culprits are genetics, elevated blood pressure, smoking and age-related changes in the arteries,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"It is not proven that stress alone causes an aneurysm,\" said Dr. Greg Albers, co-founder of health platform RapidAI and director of the Stanford Stroke Center, but adds stress can over time cause an increase in blood pressure which can make an individual more vulnerable to one.",
      "A brain aneurysm is a \"bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain,\" the\u00a0Mayo Clinic explains.",
      "You can think of it as a weak spot in the artery \u2014 imagine a garden hose that has one spot where the rubber's thin like balloon, instead of thick, said Dr. Adam Arthur, neurosurgeon and a chief medical officer at Medtronic, a medical device company.",
      "\"Over time, with pressure going through that hose, it's caused a little sack,\" he explained.",
      "Brain aneurysms, which tend to be more prevalent in women, aren't uncommon: \"Around 1 in 50 adults have a brain aneurysm,\" Snelling said. But, most people never know they have one.",
      "\"They are often found incidentally on scans done for unrelated reasons. Unless they grow large or rupture, they're usually silent,\" he said.",
      "Most brain aneurysms aren't serious, especially if they're small, as most don't rupture and usually don't cause symptoms or cause health problems, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"Aneurysms themselves aren't dangerous unless they leak or burst, which leads to a life-threatening brain bleed,\" Snelling said.",
      "Hemorrhagic strokes and subarachnoid hemorrhages are two types of brain bleeds related to ruptured brain aneurysms, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The best prevention is controlling blood pressure, avoiding smoking and stimulants, screening at-risk populations and monitoring with imaging, he added.",
      "Alleviating stress can be important in preventing a rupture, Arthur added, noting the development of aneurysms is \"something that can happen to anybody, regardless of risk factors.\"",
      "Arthur said if a patient has risks factors \u2014 for example, two close relatives with aneurysms \u2014 screenings can be done to check for them.",
      "\"If somebody is very worried or has a lot of risk factors, that's something that we can do for them,\" he said, adding he hopes Kardashian's news helps bring awareness.",
      "\"I don't want to scare people unnecessarily, but anything that we can use to put more of a focus on women's health and on how stroke can hurt women or cause disability, I think is something that we can make more positive,\" he said.",

    "summary": "In an exclusive interview with \"CBS Mornings,\" Misty Copeland reflects on her decision to step away from the American Ballet Theatre.",
    "story": [
      "Under the bright lights of the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center, Misty Copeland took her final bow, a moment that marked not just the end of a performance but the close of a chapter that transformed American ballet. The trailblazing dancer, who shattered racial barriers in the art form, retired on Wednesday as a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre after 25 years with the company.",
      "But she told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview that the decision to perform one last time wasn't something she initially wanted.",
      "\"It's been such an interesting kind of lead up to this moment, because I in all honesty I didn't wanna come back to the stage and have this moment,\" she told Gayle King.",
      "When asked why, Copeland explained that by 2019, her last year performing with the American Ballet Theatre\u00a0before taking a 5-year hiatus, she had begun to feel drained after decades of dancing.",
      "\"I really was starting to feel burnt out, kind of losing that passion that I've had my whole career and whole life for dance,\" she said. \"And I always promised myself I wouldn't go onstage if I didn't feel that I was delivering from my heart and, you know, my soul.\"",
      "She said that after taking time away, she viewed her return as an opportunity for closure and gratitude.",
      "\"In taking these five years, and really thinking about what this moment means in terms of just closure and saying thank you, that, I think, is what has gotten me back onstage for the show,\" Copeland said.",
      "The final bow",
      "At Copeland's farewell gala at Lincoln Center, Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who honored her career and impact.",
      "\"Misty Copeland didn't just perform ballet, she changed it,\" Winfrey said. \"She did. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\"",
      "Allen also praised Copeland's influence. \"You are a prophecy come true. A prophecy of goodness, and genius and grace and power,\" she said.",
      "Copeland helped organize the evening's program, which included a scene from \"Romeo and Juliet.\"",
      "\"I really wanted to do this piece because Calvin Royal, he's the second Black male principal dancer in ABT's history,\" Copeland said. \"And we were set to perform the full-length ballet, the first two Black dancers to perform the leads together at ABT right before the pandemic hit. And then that never came to fruition. So I thought, even though it's not the full ballet, to be able to perform just a piece of it.\"",
      "The night ended with a standing ovation. Copeland received bouquets from her husband, Olu Evans, and their 3-year-old son, Jackson, who saw her perform for the first time.",
      "Redefining ballet",
      "Copeland looked back on the moment that made history, becoming the first Black woman promoted to principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre. She said the title carried a deeper meaning beyond personal recognition.",
      "\"I think that and I've gone back and forth over the years in terms of, like, what that really means and the title is what has opened the doors for the next generation,\" she said.",
      "Her 2015 promotion was celebrated around the world, but it also brought new challenges. Copeland said the attention came with intense pressure and unfair expectations. \"There were articles being written, 'If Misty doesn't go onstage and perform Swan Lake perfectly does she deserve to be a principal dancer? Is this because she's Black? Is this why she's getting this opportunity?'\" she recalled.",
      "For Copeland, ballet was never just about perfect lines or technical mastery. \"I know deep down, like, to me the art form and dance is not even, it's not about, these technical feats. It's not about, to me, the aesthetic and, and what's on the outside. To me what's saved my life is the storytelling, and being able to kind of step into this beautiful world and express myself in ways that I couldn't as a child,\" she said.",
      "Her relationship with dance began at 13, an age when most professional ballerinas were already years into their training. Growing up amid uncertainty and instability, she said ballet became a place of safety and self-discovery.",
      "\"I felt beautiful and I felt powerful and I felt strong and I felt like I had a voice. I felt confident and I felt stability for the first time in my life,\" she said. \"Because the way I grew up there was no stability. There was a lot of chaos and movement, and, didn't always have a home and food on the table. And so ballet became, dance allowed me to flourish. It gave me structure. It gave me discipline. It gave me grace. It gave me a purpose.\"",
      "As diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives face growing criticism, Copeland said she believes this is the right time to step away from performing.",
      "\"I think it's the exact right time for me to be stepping off the stage for this,\" she said. \"Because I think that the impact that I can have off the stage is, is going to be, greater than what I've done. It's been 25 years that I've been a Black body on this stage, and I think that there's been a lot of movement and shifts.\"",
      "She said progress in ballet must also happen behind the curtain.",
      "\"It's more than just seeing yourself on the stage. It's what's being implemented behind the scenes,\" she said. \"It's the schools. It's how are we getting teachers in schools who look like the children they're serving? It's getting board members who are making these decisions who represent a greater group of people. There's so much work to be done.\"",
      "Copeland also announced that she will \u00a0be joining ABT's board of trustees.",
      "\"You know, it's not common that you see artists come onto boards and that you see women of color. And so to be able to have a seat at the table \u2014 in a really impactful way \u2014 I think is progress. And that, to me, is \u2014 is so thrilling and so exciting to be able to stay connected to this company that has been everything to me. I mean, it's been my dream since I was 13 years old. And I still to this day can't believe I've been able to live it out the way that I have.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 11:27:22 -0400",
    "summary": "With food-stamp funding set to lapse Saturday, recipients are asking what happens to their benefits \u2014 and when help might resume.",
    "story": [
      "The prolonged U.S.\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0is putting millions of Americans at risk of missing their November food stamp benefits, a vital lifeline for low-income households.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, said in a memo Sunday that no benefits will be issued on Nov. 1, leaving the program's roughly 42 million beneficiaries uncertain about how they'll pay for groceries next month.",
      "SNAP recipients receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. Many of those registered with the program are also asking if they will still be able to use the remaining dollars on their cards once funding is suspended and if they'll receive their November benefits retroactively, should lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.",
      "With just days to go before a potential suspension in SNAP funding, here's what to know.",
      "Will current SNAP benefits roll over to November?",
      "While SNAP benefits will not be disbursed as scheduled in November, program recipients can use existing funds on their EBT cards to make purchases. If someone enrolled in the program hasn't spent all their October EBT dollars, for example, those benefits would roll over into November.",
      "Some states are advising recipients to use their remaining food stamps wisely, given the stalemate over funding the federal government.",
      "\"If you have remaining balances from previous months, we encourage you to plan your shopping carefully and purchase essential food items when needed,\" Hawaii's Department of Human Services said on its website.",
      "Will SNAP recipients get paid retroactively for missed payments?",
      "The USDA hasn't indicated whether SNAP benefits would be paid retroactively once the government shutdown ends.",
      "But social service experts who spoke with CBS News said they expect the USDA to pay the delayed November benefits once federal funding resumes.",
      "\"It is our understanding that SNAP benefits will be issued retroactively when the shutdown ends,\" said Lizbeth Ginsburg, a managing attorney in the welfare law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.",
      "Federal rules\u00a0governing the food-stamp program stipulate that SNAP recipients are entitled to their benefits, and that they should receive them if there's a disruption, said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger.",
      "\"That's why many state agencies have done a very good job of saying, 'Your benefits will be delayed,' versus, 'You are not getting benefits,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Can states step in to fund SNAP?",
      "While SNAP is federally funded and overseen by the USDA, each state is responsible for administering the program to its residents.",
      "Some states are taking action, with Democratic lawmakers\u00a0urging\u00a0Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to tap into an estimated $5 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits next month. On Tuesday, a coalition of officials from 25 states and the District of Columbia\u00a0sued the Trump administration\u00a0over the suspension of benefits, arguing that it is unlawful. The\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0notes that this would mark the first delay in SNAP benefits in the program's history.",
      "In recent days, several states have pledged to step in to ensure SNAP recipients can afford food in November. Their approaches vary, with some states promising to dispatch troops to support food banks, while others are allocating funds for general hunger relief.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry\u00a0signed an emergency declaration on Oct. 24 intended to fund SNAP benefits for people who rely on the program, while Vermont lawmakers on Oct. 29 approved a plan to cover its residents' food stamp benefits through Nov. 15.",
      "Other states say they plan to ramp up support for local food banks by providing on-site personnel and additional funding. California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0said\u00a0last week he would deploy National Guard troops to assist food bank operations and fast-track $80 million to keep the state's food banks stocked.",
      "In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is providing $30 million in state funding to support 16 million meals. Roughly 3 million people in New York are on food stamps.",
      "Other states that have announced actions to help SNAP recipients include\u00a0Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia\u00a0and\u00a0Washington.",
      "Officials in these states are stepping in despite the USDA saying states lack the authority to cover benefits and won't be reimbursed.",
      "\"There is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed,\" the agency said in its memo.",
      "Plata-Nino said that puts states in a difficult position, given their already limited reserves. It also diverts attention and funding from other priorities, she added.",

    "summary": "The Senate voted on Wednesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Canada.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Wednesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Canada, a day after the chamber rebuked the president with another vote to block tariffs on Brazil.",
      "In a 50 to 46 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the measure, which would terminate the national emergency used to impose tariffs on some goods from Canada. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky broke with their party to vote in favor of the resolution, which required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "The move is mostly symbolic, since it is unlikely to be taken up in the GOP-controlled House. Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "For months, trade tensions have flared between the U.S. and Canada. In August, the president raised tariffs on the country to 35%, though a large share of goods remain exempt under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Then, over the weekend, Mr. Trump said he is raising tariffs on Canada by an additional 10%, blasting the U.S.'s northern neighbor over an anti-tariff ad by the government of Ontario that used quotes from former President Ronald Reagan.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"the public health crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more\" to combat \"drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, forced a vote to challenge the move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, effectively bypassing Senate leadership. He has argued that the tariffs on one of the nation's top trading partners aren't justified under the emergency.",
      "\"I don't think you can say that fentanyl is not an emergency vis-a-vis Mexico or China, but it is ridiculous to say that fentanyl is an emergency with respect to Canada,\" Kaine said. \"And it's a pretext that's just being used to pour more and more tariffs onto Canada.\"",
      "The vote came after the Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure. Wednesday's vote also marked the second time lawmakers have weighed in on the Canada tariffs, after the Senate approved a resolution aimed at blocking the levies in April.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-today-fomc-meeting/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:53:53 -0400",
    "summary": "The Fed on Wednesday announced its second interest-rate cut of 2025, reducing borrowing costs in a move to spur U.S. hiring.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the central bank might pause before further lowering borrowing costs.",
      "The Fed cut lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.75% and 4%, down from its prior range of 4% to 4.25%. The Fed reduced rates by the same amount in September, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "In a Wednesday afternoon press conference to discuss the decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said another rate cut at its next meeting, set for Dec. 10, \"isn't a foregone conclusion.\" That may disappoint some borrowers and investors, given that the Fed last month had penciled in an additional rate cut for its final meeting of the year.",
      "\"There were strongly differing views on how to proceed in December\" during the central bank's meeting today, Powell said. Those conflicting views mean \"we haven't made a decision about December. I'm saying something in addition here \u2014 that it's not to be seen as a foregone conclusion. In fact, far from it.\"",
      "He added, \"We've cut 50 more basis points in the last two meetings, and there's a sense from some, 'Let's pause here,' and a sense from others, 'Let's go ahead.'\"",
      "Stocks erased modest gains after Powell's comments, with the S&P 500 slipping 0.2% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipping 0.4%.",
      "The central bank's move to ease monetary policy is aimed at shoring up economic growth by lowering borrowing costs, spurring consumer spending and investment by businesses. Although the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has delayed release of the Labor Department's September jobs report, other indicators point to a continued slowdown in hiring. The ADP National Employment Report, for instance, showed private-sector payrolls shrinking by 32,000 last month.",
      "In its policy\u00a0statement on Wednesday, the Fed said \"downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting last month that risks to the labor market are growing.",
      "While Powell said the Fed is watching layoff announcements from large businesses such as Amazon, he added that the weakness in the job market does not appear to be accelerating. His comments indicate that another back-to-back rate cut this year isn't a certainty, financial experts said.",
      "\"The knee-jerk reaction of the markets to the Fed meeting (and press conference) was to sell stocks and bonds, because Chairman Powell said that an additional rate cut in December wasn't a sure thing,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email. Investors \"were negatively surprised that future cuts might be taken off the table.\"",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the panel that sets the Fed's monetary policy, isn't scheduled to meet on interest rates in November.",
      "Data blackout",
      "The near-total blackout on government economic data during the shutdown may complicate the Fed's decision-making, experts said. Typically, Fed officials are able to draw on a host of official reports, ranging from measures of employment growth to inflation markers, as they seek to determine the best path for policy.",
      "\"While today's rate cut and the general direction of future policy remain relatively clear, guidance on the committee's perspective on economic conditions is more necessary than ever,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"A prolonged government shutdown and ongoing tariff negotiations continue to introduce significant uncertainty into the immediate monetary policy outlook.\"",
      "Powell noted that the lack of official economic data may complicate the Fed's December decision, given that the central bank relies on such information to assess the economy.",
      "\"What do you do when you are driving in the fog? You slow down,\" Powell said.",
      "On Wednesday, 10 of the 12 FOMC members voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, with two members objecting. Fed Governor Stephen Miran dissented, preferring a 0.50 percentage point cut, as he did at the September meeting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffry Schmid also dissented, saying he preferred no rate change.",
      "Inflation battle",
      "While the Fed is now focused on weakness in the labor market, its battle against inflation isn't over. The Fed cranked rates higher after consumer prices soared during the pandemic, with inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Because higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, businesses and consumers typically react by paring spending, which dampens demand throughout the economy and cools inflation. Since mid-2022, inflation has receded to an annual rate of 3% as of September, although that remains higher than the Fed's target of a 2% annual pace.",
      "While the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs are starting to trickle through to consumer prices, the impact has been more muted than economists had predicted earlier this year. Some businesses are eating some of the tariff costs, while others stocked up on imports earlier in the year to get ahead of the import duties.",
      "\"Though inflation is still higher than comfortable, the jobs market is holding on to signs of weakness, and their desire to stimulate the economy further is likely to continue outweighing inflation concerns,\" said Steve Rick, chief economist at financial services company TruStage.",

      "In widely expected job cuts after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount has begun layoffs set to impact about 2,000 employees.",
      "Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs companywide on Wednesday (Paramount Skydance owns CBS News.) The rest of the cuts are expected to be made at a later date. In all, 2,000 job reductions amount to about 10% of Paramount's total workforce.",
      "\"These decisions are never made lightly, especially given their effect on our colleagues who have made meaningful contributions to the company,\" CEO David Ellison wrote Wednesday in a memo to employees.",
      "The prospect of job cuts has hovered over Paramount employees for some time. Ellison on Wednesday reiterated that the company has been working to restructure since the completion of its merger in August, and noted that workforce cuts are \"part of that process.\"",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",

      "Hospitals nationwide are urging the Trump administration to reconsider a steep new fee for hiring highly skilled workers from other countries. Many turn to medical professionals from abroad to fill the gaps, but the new $100,000 price tag for the popular H-1B visa is making that nearly impossible, particularly for midsize hospitals or smaller.",
      "\"We need to stabilize,\" said Jamie White, the chief nursing officer at Frederick Health in Maryland. She also said, \"We have had a continual desire to bring on about 100 nurses for the last three years.\"",
      "Frederick Health, like others nationwide, looked abroad to fill in the gaps, planning to sponsor up to 45 nurses on H-1B visas. Now, those plans are on hold, with a new $100,000 fee to obtain the visa and hire foreign employees.",
      "\"We cannot afford that for even one individual,\" White said.",
      "The Trump administration announced the policy change in September, with President Trump saying it provides an incentive to hire American workers. The administration has since clarified that the fee is for new applicants living abroad, not those already here.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers called the administration's actions a necessary reform.",
      "\"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages,\" Rogers said in a recent statement to CBS News.",
      "Frederick Health and other hospitals are hoping for an exemption for medical workers, given an ongoing national shortage.",
      "\"I know there's a lot of concern with bringing people to the United States, and they might be taking U.S. jobs, but we do have a shortage of clinical team and highly skilled workers,\" White said.",
      "The American Hospital Association wrote the Trump administration a letter in late September asking for exemptions for health care personnel. The letter\u00a0detailed the association's concerns\u00a0and said that\u00a0rural\u00a0and underserved communities could be hit hardest.",
      "\"Given the staffing and financial challenges our hospitals are already facing, the increased petition fees outlined in the September 19 Proclamation would likely prevent many of them from continuing to recruit essential health care staff and could force a reduction in the services they are able to provide,\" said the letter, addressed to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not comment on the letter when contacted by CBS News.",

    "summary": "Amazon and UPS on Tuesday announced tens of thousands of job cuts, the latest signal that the U.S. labor market is downshifting.",
    "story": [
      "For most of 2025, the job market was described by economists as \"no hire, no fire\" \u2014 a stretch of time when job seekers faced slim prospects, but workers could count on job security. But that fragile balance may now be shifting, labor experts warn, as mass layoffs at companies like Amazon and UPS signal a possible turning point for the labor market.",
      "Amazon on Tuesday announced 14,000 job cuts, citing a shift toward artificial intelligence, while UPS on the same day said it has reduced its workforce by 48,000 from a year earlier. Paramount Skydance, the owner of CBS News, on Wednesday also announced it is shedding jobs, part of an ongoing effort to cut costs at the entertainment and media company.",
      "Target on Tuesday also notified a state employment agency in Minnesota, where the retailer is based, that it plans to lay off more than 800 workers in January as part of a broader corporate restructuring,\u00a0CBS News Minnesota reported. The retailer announced last week that it would cut 1,800 corporate positions as the chain trims its global workforce by about 8%.",
      "The mass layoffs come as the Federal Reserve scrutinizes the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing concerns about slower hiring\u00a0in announcing the central bank's first interest-rate cut of 2025. The announcements from Amazon and UPS could signal that the Fed has good reason to be worried, experts said.",
      "\"No question that this is a shift, and it does seem to me it signals that 'no hire, no fire' is a thing of the past,\" John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS News.",
      "\"These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy,\" he added.",
      "Layoffs picking up",
      "Even before Tuesday's job cuts, layoffs had been trending higher, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers across the U.S. cut nearly 950,000 jobs this year through September, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, its most recent data shows.",
      "Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the government shutdown, which means the Fed will make its next interest rate decision tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September.",
      "But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August \u2014 down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows.",
      "On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say.",
      "\"When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-\u00e0-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up,\" said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation.",
      "But, he added, \"These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings.\"",
      "That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of long-term unemployed people, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022.",
      "What's impacting the labor market?",
      "Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to\u00a0trim its human workforce\u00a0as the business becomes more efficient.",
      "\"Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology \u2014 and being on the cutting edge of that technology \u2014 for shifting jobs,\" Challenger said.",
      "About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed.",
      "Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as shipping declines from Amazon, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS.",
      "On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside.",
      "In the meantime, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the job market, according to recent\u00a0CBS News polling. About 52% of Americans describe the labor market as \"bad,\" up seven percentage points from April, the poll found.",
      "\"We are moving more into a time where job security might be more precarious,\" Challenger said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-fomc-interest-rate-meeting-decision-october-29-forecast/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 07:44:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Concerns about a weakening labor market may outweigh worries about rising inflation, tipping the Fed toward another rate cut, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is set to make its next interest rate decision today, even as a near-total blackout of federal economic data continues amid the government shutdown.",
      "The Labor Department, however, on Friday released one key report ahead of its meeting:\u00a0the Consumer Price Index. That report showed that the inflation rate rose at a pace of 3% last month, cooler than expected, as the impact of President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs have so far been more muted than economists have forecast.",
      "Economists say the softer inflation report likely opens the door to a rate cut today.",
      "\"Concerns about tariffs driving prices higher are still not showing up in most categories,\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said Friday in an email. \"Nothing in the inflation print should stop the Fed from cutting rates next week. Yes, prices are higher, but not enough to keep them from helping the economy,\" he added.",
      "There's a 96.7% probability that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Oct. 29,\u00a0according to CME FedWatch, which bases its predictions on 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices.",
      "A quarter-point cut would bring down the benchmark rate to a range of between 3.75% to 4%, down from its current range of between 4% to 4.25%, and mark the Fed's second rate cut this year.",
      "What's the argument for cutting rates?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low. When inflation is soaring \u2014 such as when it hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2014 the Fed ratchets rates higher to make borrowing more expensive, which in turn dissuades consumers and businesses from spending, tempering inflation.",
      "But a weak labor market can be bolstered by lower interest rates, because it's easier for businesses to expand and hire more workers if it's less expensive to borrow money.",
      "When Powell last month announced the Fed's first rate cut of 2025, he signaled the central bank was growing increasingly concerned about a sharp slowdown in the labor market. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" he said in September.",
      "However, the monthly jobs report for September wasn't released earlier this month due to the federal shutdown. In an Oct. 14 speech, Powell acknowledged the data halt, yet added that the central bank has access to \"a wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have remained available.\"",
      "According to those sources of information, \"the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\" Powell noted.",
      "Friday's CPI report \"should keep the Fed focused on the labor market in terms of the near-term policy trajectory. In the absence of the September jobs report, an October cut appears to be a done deal,\" Bank of America economists noted in a Friday research report.",
      "How would a rate cut impact your money?",
      "While a quarter-point rate cut is relatively small, it would come after September's reduction \u2014 and economists are also expecting the Fed to usher in a third cut at its December meeting. Together, that means the benchmark rate by year-end could sit 0.75 percentage points lower than it was in January.",
      "That would help reduce rates for credit cards and loans such as home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs. Those types of credit products are based on the prime rate, or the interest rate that banks charge each other, and which in turn is based on the Fed's benchmark rate.",
      "Mortgage rates, meanwhile, have already dipped ahead of the Fed's rate decision. While mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, they're\u00a0heavily influenced\u00a0by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.19% as of Oct. 23, marking their lowest level in a year, according to Freddie Mac. Homebuyers might not see much more of a break, at least in the near-term, economists said.",
      "\"Mortgage rates have moved down notably in advance of the Fed's meeting, hitting their lowest level in more than a year, but further declines will depend on new developments,\" noted Realtor.com's chief economist Danielle Hale in an email. \"The Fed's decisions are anticipated by the market, which means that the upcoming rate cut and several more over the next few months are already largely priced in.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-trump-tariffs-brazil/",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 19:05:22 -0400",
    "summary": "The Senate passed a measure that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, after Democrats drew support from a handful of Republicans.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted on Tuesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure in a rebuke to the president.",
      "Led by Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, the resolution would terminate the national emergency that the administration is using to impose 50% tariffs on goods from Brazil.",
      "The vote to approve the measure was 52 to 48. Republican Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul joined Democrats to vote in favor. The resolution required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "In July, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil\" that he said constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\" The move came during the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup in 2022.",
      "\"President Trump's tariff regime \u2014 global, Brazilian tariffs, Canadian tariffs, tariff deals announced then paused, tariff deals negotiated, exceptions granted and in some cases not granted \u2014 have created huge chaos in the national economy,\" Kaine said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. \"Tariffs are a tax on American consumers. Tariffs are a tax on American businesses. And they are a tax that is imposed by a single person: Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "Kaine told reporters that the president's emergency order was \"unusual and extreme,\" and accused him of putting it in place due to the \"decision to prosecute Donald Trump's friend.\"",
      "\"If that's an emergency, then anything is an emergency, and any president can make up anything and call it an emergency and then use massive powers to impose regulations or evade regulations,\" Kaine said.",
      "The bill will still need to pass the House and be signed by the president, meaning it is mostly symbolic. House Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "But Kaine said Tuesday that he has learned that \"the president is responsive to things like this.\"",
      "\"When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,\" he said.",
      "One of those Republican yes votes was McConnell, a former Senate majority leader who has clashed with Mr. Trump for years \u2014 including on trade policy. McConnell has long been skeptical of tariffs and supportive of free trade, a stance that was essentially considered doctrine in pre-Trump GOP politics.",
      "\"Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive,\" McConnell said in a statement prior to the vote. \"The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Vice President JD Vance met with Senate Republicans at the Capitol and urged them to reject the resolution.",
      "\"The point that I made to my Republican colleagues, recognizing that there's a diversity of opinions about it, is that the tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first,\" Vance told reporters after the meeting. \"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country. They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas.\"",
      "The president cited a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act in his order imposing the Brazil tariffs. The act gives any senator the authority to force a vote to challenge the move, effectively bypassing Senate leadership.",
      "In April, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve a measure aimed at blocking the Canada tariffs. Those Republicans were Murkowski of Alaska, Collins of Maine and McConnell, along with Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who cosponsored the legislation. Later that month, an effort aimed at blocking Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world fell short, with two senators who had previously backed the tariff measure absent from the vote. The resolutions need a simple majority to pass.",
      "Kaine said he would force additional votes on Canadian tariffs and global tariffs throughout the week as he pushes back on the administration and puts pressure on Senate Republicans.",
      "\"So the votes are about tariffs, and they're about the economic destruction of tariffs, but they are also really about, how much will we let a president get away with?\" Kaine said. \"Do my colleagues have a gag reflex or not, in terms of powers that constitutionally are handed to Congress?\"",

      "\"United is donating meals for air traffic controllers and other federal workers whose pay is delayed. We appreciate the hardworking federal employees who are keeping the air travel system running,\" the airline said in a statement.",
      "United said that it's feeding workers at the airline's hubs across the country, including in Chicago; Denver; Houston; Los Angeles; Newark, N.J.; San Francisco; and Washington, D.C.",
      "Delta Air Lines also confirmed to CBS News that it has \"arranged for a limited number of meals for transportation sector workers,\" while noting that it is operating \"within the strict rules established for employees of federal government agencies.\"",
      "Additionally, JetBlue said it is working with its federal partners, including local aviation officials, \"to offer meals at our airports as a gesture of support.\" The airline said it's working with the Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Federal Aviation Administration to coordinate those efforts.",
      "At a press conference on Tuesday at LaGuardia Airport in New York, U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy highlighted air traffic controllers' financial struggles\u00a0as they go without pay.",
      "\"This is day one,\" he said of controllers missing their first full paychecks. \"Day two gets harder, [and] day three is harder after that, as expenses continue to roll [in].\"",
      "Duffy also noted that controllers are calling in sick in larger numbers than usual, as some seek side gigs with companies like\u00a0Uber or DoorDash\u00a0to make ends meet\u00a0during the shutdown.",
      "Speaking at the same event, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels also emphasized the financial pressure on his members.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\" he said. \"And I'm watching air traffic controllers going to work. I'm getting the stories. They're worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I'm running out of money. And if she doesn't get the medicine she needs, she dies. That's the end.'\"",
      "On average this year, 5% of flight delays were attributed to air traffic controller shortages, Duffy said. The personnel shortages at some airports were responsible for roughly 44% of the\u00a08,700 flight delays\u00a0on Sunday, while accounting for 24% of Monday's delays, according to Duffy.",
      "Controllers were planning to gather outside at least 17 airports nationwide on Tuesday to hand out leaflets urging an end to the shutdown, according to The Associated Press.",
      "\"The pressure is real,\" air traffic controller Joe Segretto, who works at a regional radar facility that directs planes at airports in the New York area, said at the press conference at LaGuardia. \"We have people trying to keep these airplanes safe.

    "summary": "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" said one mother of two about a looming freeze in food aid.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, potentially leaving households scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table.",
      "People enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, told CBS News they're bracing for some tough financial choices. Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mom who lives in Buckfield, Maine, said she's planning to delay paying her electric and credit card bills to make sure her two children have enough to eat.",
      "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" McBlais, who works for a Maine social services agency and who draws about $600 a month in SNAP benefits, said. \"My children won't go hungry.\"",
      "The suspension of food aid comes as Democratic and Republican lawmakers continue to trade blame over the\u00a0government shutdown, which now stands as the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation, and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",
      "\"Everybody needs food \u2014 SNAP recipients are Democratic, Republicans and everything in between,\" McBlais said.",

      "Over the past year, Suzann Hernandez and Camilo Aguirre have put a lot of effort into lowering their energy bill. Beyond simple solutions like turning off lights or closing doors when either the heat or AC was on, the couple insulated their windows and kept the temperature set at a strict 76 degrees, even on the hottest days of summer.",

    "summary": "Most federal workers are entitled to back pay when the shutdown ends, but there are some exceptions.",
    "story": [
      "Some federal workers who are not being paid during the government shutdown have a nagging fear: They might not receive retroactive pay once the impasse is resolved.",
      "Roughly 1.4 million federal employees\u00a0whose wages are being withheld during the government shutdown are\u00a0hunkering down\u00a0and cutting all nonessential spending, as they missed their first full paychecks on Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about retroactive pay for those workers when the shutdown ends.",
      "Do all federal workers get back pay?",
      "Both furloughed workers and so-called \"excepted\" government employees, who must continue to show up to work during the shutdown without compensation, are entitled to back pay under a federal law called the\u00a0Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019.",
      "The law makes clear that both classes of federal employees affected by a lack of funding will eventually be paid in full. They \"shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations, and each excepted employee who is required to perform work during a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for such work, at the employee's standard rate of pay.\"",
      "Legal challenges",
      "However, a draft memo from the White House's Office of Management and Budget suggests that furloughed workers are not guaranteed back pay, an administration official confirmed to CBS News. When asked on Oct. 7 about furloughed workers getting back pay, President Trump said, \"I would say it depends on who we're talking about.\"",
      "Legal experts insist that federal employees are unequivocally protected under the 2019 law. In an Oct. 7 statement, Max Stier, CEO of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said the act \"is very clear in its mandate to give automatic back pay to furloughed workers during a lapse in appropriations.\"",
      "Dan Meyer, a partner at Tully Rinckey in Washington, D.C., said the law appropriates, not authorizes, back pay for workers.",
      "\"If this came to a judge, I think the appropriations language would speak heavily that they were required to pay the federal employees based on that legislation,\" he told CBS News.",
      "The memo also contradicts previous guidance\u00a0published\u00a0in September by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "\"The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,\" the agency's notice read. However, an updated version\u00a0of guidelines strikes that language.",
      "\"Excepted employees will be paid for any earned overtime pay or holiday premium pay when appropriations are enacted,\" the OPM now states in its guidance.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' question about whether or not federal workers will be paid once the shutdown ends.",
      "When would back pay arrive?",
      "The short answer is as soon as the government shutdown ends.",
      "The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act stipulates that federal workers are owed back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "Michael LeRoy, professor of labor and employment relations at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign college of law, told CBS News, \"The law makes clear that they are entitled to back pay, and it preferences automatic payment.\"",
      "Federal workers' last partial paycheck arrived on Oct. 10. Their next pay day was scheduled for Oct. 24. Workers were not paid. Paychecks have yet to be issued, as the second-longest government shutdown in history entered its 27th day Saturday, with no resolution on the horizon.",
      "What about government contractors?",
      "In addition to federal employees, the government contracts with private sector firms who employ millions of workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. They are not similarly guaranteed back pay.",
      "\"Contract workers are simply not covered by the statute,\" LeRoy said.",
      "They may, however, continue to work and receive paychecks if their assigned contracts are fully funded.",
      "What about workers who collect unemployment during the shutdown?",
      "Federal employees may be eligible for unemployment compensation during the shutdown. The Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program provides benefits to federal workers \"who lost their employment through no fault of their own,\" according to a fact sheet.",
      "Benefits are available for 26 weeks, with maximum amounts varying by state law, according to an Office of Personnel Management memo.",
      "When workers are paid retroactively, the funds are applied against any unemployment benefits they received to avoid overpayment, the memo states. Excepted workers are not considered unemployed and therefore are not eligible for unemployment benefits in most states, Tom Spiggle, employment attorney and founder of the Spiggle Law Firm, told CBS News.",

      "\"We're being used and abused as producers,\" Pete added.",
      "For farmers across the U.S., this harvest season brought a new kind of uncertainty. China, once the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, cut off purchases after tariffs escalated, leaving producers with full silos and falling prices.",
      "The Wobeters were hoping stronger cattle prices could make up for those losses.",
      "But while cattle ranchers are earning less, shoppers aren't seeing any savings. Ground beef is up nearly 13% and steak is up 16% over the past year, according to federal data. Economists say the spike is tied to drought, high feed costs and a shrinking U.S. cattle herd \u2014 now at its lowest level in decades.",
      "Bryan Whaley, CEO of the Iowa Cattlemen's Association, said more imports from Argentina won't fix that.",
      "\"You have to look at the total supply chain,\" Whaley said. \"It really only is gonna be about 2.5% of our total beef supply. So it's really not going to make a substantial difference.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 15:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans are paying significantly more for these food staples, price inflation data shows. Will inflation ever relent?",
    "story": [
      "For evidence that the cost of food in the U.S. remains hard to stomach for many households, look no further than the price of bananas, beef and coffee.",
      "Banana prices were up 6.9% in September from a year ago, ground beef has risen 12.9% and roasted coffee has jumped an eye-watering 18.9%, according to the most recent\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0data for September. And now for the bad news.",
      "\"One of the questions that I'm asked a lot is, when are prices coming down? And my answer is simple: never,\" Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News. \"The best that we can hope for is stabilization.\"",
      "So what's behind the surging price of such foods? There are a mix of factors, ranging from the impact of climate change on crop harvests and U.S. tariffs on imports to the simple laws of economics.",
      "Beef",
      "As of September, the average cost of a pound of ground beef was $6.30, according to Federal Reserve\u00a0data\u00a0\u2014 the highest since the Department of Labor started tracking beef prices in the 1980s and 65% higher than in late 2019, just before COVID-19 ravaged the economy.",
      "Over the trailing 12 months through September, the cost of ground beef has climbed 65 cents per pound, or more than 11%, while the cost of a pound of boneless sirloin steak has jumped $2.35, or around 20%, the CBS News Price Tracker shows\u00a0(see below).",
      "The main reason beef has become painfully expensive comes down to economics and climate: As global temperatures rise, shrinking cattle herds are straining the nation's beef supply even as demand remains strong. As with any other product, prices tend to rise when demand outstrips supply.",
      "Simply, \"The problem is that there's less cows,\" Lempert said.",
      "As of July, there were 28.7 million beef cows across the U.S., the lowest number in decades, USDA\u00a0data\u00a0shows. Experts say the decline in the nation's cattle count is mainly due to intensifying droughts in recent decades that have forced farmers to reduce their herds. During a drought from 2011 to 2015, for example, farmers and ranchers were forced to reduce their herd sizes by up to 2% a year, the USDA has\u00a0found.",
      "Other factors lifting beef prices include higher grain costs and labor supply shortages at slaughterhouses, according to Lempert.",
      "According to Derrell Peel, a professor in the department of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, domestic beef production is projected to account for 90% of total consumption in the U.S. in 2025.",
      "As for beef from Brazil, America's largest import source, Peel said tariffs could also curb supplies. The total tariff on Brazilian beef imports now sits at 76.4%,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Farm Bureau Federation.",
      "Coffee",
      "The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee reached a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, labor\u00a0data shows. That's well over double the price from December 2019, or shortly before the pandemic, when a pound of ground coffee cost just over $4.",
      "Several factors are behind this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, are depressing crop yields, Lempert explained. Earlier this month, for example, coffee prices rose after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted the return of\u00a0La Ni\u00f1a, a recurring weather pattern that influences global temperatures. That raised concerns about the possibility of drought in Brazil.",
      "Andrew Hultgren, an assistant professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, said global prices for bananas and coffee will continue to be sensitive to extreme heat or drought conditions, especially because the products are cultivated in a relatively small number of regions around the world.",
      "\"These types of price sensitivities will look like inflation to the average consumer,\" he said.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023 the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, a 10% tariff on Colombia and a 20% tax on Vietnam. In Brazil, that has led producers to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, throttling supplies in the U.S., according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization, an intergovernmental membership organization for the coffee sector, cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",
      "Bananas",
      "Bananas remain cheaper than most fruits, but even this grocery store staple isn't immune from inflation. The average cost of the potassium-rich fruit rose to 67 cents per pound in September \u2014 the highest price on record in the U.S. and up 10 cents, or nearly 18%, since late 2019,\u00a0according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Among consumers, the issue caused an uproar last year after Trader Joe's announced it was upping the price of its bananas for the first time in over two decades, from 19 cents each to 23 cents.",
      "As with coffee beans, supply constraints and tariffs have pushed up banana prices, experts note. Most bananas sold in the U.S. are imported from Central and South America. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, Guatemala supplied 40% of U.S. bananas in 2023, while Ecuador and Costa Rica each accounted for 16%.",
      "Tom Stenzel, executive director of the Banana Importers Association, recently told\u00a0CNBC\u00a0that U.S. tariffs on bananas from Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and Costa Rica remain in effect, with levies as high as 15%.",
      "A pesky fungal disease known as Panama Disease has also reduced U.S. banana supplies, specifically threatening Cavendish bananas, the most popular variety, Lempert noted.",
      "\"The banana that we know and love is getting destroyed by different pests,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 12:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Jim Farley discusses the difficulties of tariffs in imported parts, which have cost Ford a billion dollars \u2013 and may give an advantage to their competitors. He also explains why he drives a Chinese-made electric vehicle.",
    "story": [
      "At Ford's Michigan Assembly outside Detroit, more than 4,500 hourly employees turn out about 100,000 Broncos a year \u2013 a new one every 60 seconds.",
      "For obvious reasons, Ford's been touting its commitment to American manufacturing. It advertises itself as employing the most hourly workers in the country \u2013 and more than 80 percent of its vehicles sold in the U.S. are indeed made in America. That's the highest share of any Detroit automaker.",
      "But Ford imports many parts, and has been hit hard by President Trump's tariffs. Ford CEO Jim Farley says it's not affordable to make all the parts here, and that if Ford only used American-made parts, American-made cars would be too expensive for many Americans to buy.",
      "And there are some components, Farley says, that no one even makes in America: \"There are parts, fasteners, wiring looms from other countries. And we pay our tariffs, sometimes up to 70 percent on those parts.\"",
      "And who is paying for those tariffs? \"Well, the company right now,\" he said. \"And in the end of the day, it's all these workers.\"",
      "Farley has deep roots in Michigan. His grandfather was Ford Motor Company's 389th employee \u2013 one of the first to help build the Model T. \u00a0But Farley himself is not a Ford lifer. Before joining the company in 2007, he spent nearly two decades at Toyota.",
      "And how did that go over in the Farley family when he went to Toyota? \"Not well,\" Jim laughed. \"Because at the time, you know, they were just, all through the '70s, there was just job loss after job loss across southeast Michigan. And my grandfather was thinking about all the people that lost their jobs. And they were like, Why? Why are you doing this?\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you see similarities between the '80s, when the U.S. auto industry was facing the increased competition from Japan, to today where it's China?\"",
      "\"Oh, I think it's exactly the same thing, but it's on steroids,\" Farley replied.",
      "\"A completely different level of risk for our industry\"",
      "Ironically, it's a Biden-era tariff that has so far spared Detroit from that competition. In May of last year, the U.S. imposed a 100% surcharge on Chinese-made electric vehicles, which effectively bans them from the American road. But Chinese EVs are gaining ground in Europe, Latin America, and especially China, the world's largest market.",
      "Farley has called these small, inexpensive, tech-savvy cars an existential threat. \"They have enough capacity in China with existing factories to serve the entire North American market, put us all out of business,\" he said. \"Japan never had that. So, this is a completely different level of risk for our industry.\"",
      "\"Are the Chinese cars being made today something Americans would want to buy?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Farley. \"I drive a Xiaomi SU7. High quality, great digital experience.\"",
      "\"You're driving a Chinese car? Why?\"",
      "\"Because of the competition. And to beat them, you have to know them.\"",
      "Farley's firsthand experience with Chinese EVs is a big reason Ford is pivoting to smaller, more affordable electric vehicles. This past summer, in announcing production of a new midsize electric pickup truck to sell for $30,000, Farley said, \"It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T.\"",
      "That hands-on approach is one holdover from his days at Toyota. Another is his annual road trip to see his products in action. \"I believe in genchi genbutsu. It's a Japanese word that means 'go and see where the work is actually done.' I took a Lightning through California with my son. And it became pretty clear that we had a big problem with our charging network. So, after that trip, I called Elon [Musk]. Out of the blue, never met him or anything. I was like, is there any way you would share your supercharging network with Ford?\"",
      "If you heard his name and noticed the resemblance to the late actor Chris Farley, you weren't wrong: the \"Saturday Night Live\" star was Jim Farley's cousin. \"I think there's, uh, a little bit of kid in all of us Farleys, a little bit of that kind of devilish, little snarky tomfoolery,\" he said. \"On the other hand, I would say I was, you know, kind of on the pretty serious side of the Farley spectrum!\"",
      "Jim Farley will need every bit of that serious side to steer Ford through one of its biggest economic and political tests in decades \u2013 building a future that keeps tens of thousands of American auto workers on the line. \"What I care about is that transformation of Ford,\" he said. \"I'd like to be able to come back here in 20 years, if I'm still alive, and see all the people, that they're still busy, like my grandfather. My grandfather had nothing until he had the Ford job. Our jobs as leaders are about them.\"",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this story  stated that Ford would have a $2 billion tariff bill, amounting to 20%  of the company's global profits. Due to  recent changes to the Trump administration's  tariff program, including an extension to an offset program for  imported parts on domestically-assembled automobiles, Ford now estimates  that tariffs will cost the company $1 billion.",

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has posted a notice on its website saying federal food aid will not go out on Nov. 1, raising the stakes for families nationwide as the government shutdown drags on.",
      "The new notice comes after the Trump administration said it would not tap roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as SNAP, flowing into November. That program helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the\u00a0USDA notice\u00a0says. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.\"",
      "The shutdown, which began on Oct. 1, is now the second-longest on record. While the Republican administration took steps leading up to the shutdown to ensure SNAP benefits were paid this month, the cutoff would expand the impact of the impasse to a wider swath of Americans \u2014 and some of those most in need \u2014 unless a political resolution is found in just a few days.",
      "The administration blames Democrats, who say they will not agree to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate with them on extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say Democrats must first agree to reopen the government before negotiations.",
      "\"There is an urgent need to reopen the government, which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature,\"\u00a0House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have written to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins requesting that she use contingency funds to cover the bulk of next month's benefits.",
      "But a USDA memo that surfaced Friday says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "The memo cited Hurricane Melissa, which has strengthened into a major hurricane, as an example of why it's important to have the money available to mobilize quickly in the event of a disaster.",
      "The prospect of families not receiving food aid has deeply concerned states run by both parties.",
      "Some states have pledged to keep SNAP benefits flowing even if the federal program halts payments, but there are questions about whether U.S. government directives may allow that to happen. The USDA memo also says states would not be reimbursed for temporarily picking up the cost.",
      "Other states are telling SNAP recipients to be ready for the benefits to stop. Arkansas and Oklahoma, for example, are advising recipients to identify food pantries and other groups that help with food.",
      "Gina Plata-Ni\u00f1o, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research and Action Center, told \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday that the situation is a \"man-made disaster that could be easily avoided regardless of what is going on in the shutdown.\"",
      "\"These are individuals who are living paycheck to paycheck \u2014 veterans, older adults, people with disabilities \u2014 who are counting on this fund,\" Plata-Ni\u00f1o said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut accused Republicans and President Trump of not agreeing to negotiate.",
      "\"The reality is, if they sat down to try to negotiate, we could probably come up with something pretty quickly,\" Murphy said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"We could open up the government on Tuesday or Wednesday, and there wouldn't be any crisis in the food stamp program.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 11:09:03 -0400",
    "summary": "Border Patrol agents have been responsible for more Chicago-area arrests than ICE amid \"Midway Blitz,\" an unprecedented shift that has caused some internal tensions, CBS News has learned.",
    "story": [
      "Border Patrol agents have carried out more arrests in the Chicago area than their counterparts at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, illustrating the expanded role they are playing far away from U.S. borders under the Trump administration, internal federal government data obtained by CBS News indicates.",
      "This week, arrests by Customs and Border Protection in the Chicago-area \"Midway Blitz\" operation surpassed those recorded by ICE, the agency that is, on paper, responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws in the interior of the country.",
      "Since Sept. 16, agents at CBP have recorded roughly 1,500 arrests in the Chicago region, compared to over 1,400 arrests carried out by ICE officers, according to the internal Department of Homeland Security figures. In mid-October, ICE's arrest tally in the Chicago operation was higher, totaling around 1,000, compared to roughly 800 arrests recorded by CBP at the time.",
      "A federal law enforcement official said ICE's arrest tally in the Chicago area comes out to be around 1,800 if arrests by the agency made prior to Sept. 16 \u2014 before CBP started conducting operations in the region \u2014 are counted.",
      "The government figures underscore the unprecedented way the second Trump administration has used Border Patrol agents, whose work has been historically limited to intercepting the illicit movement of people and drugs along the borders with Canada and Mexico, as well as some coastal sectors.",
      "As part of its nationwide mass deportation campaign, the Trump administration has dispatched teams of green-uniformed Border Patrol agents across the country, instructing them to arrest suspected unauthorized immigrants in major Democratic-led cities.",
      "That effort has been spearheaded by Gregory Bovino, an outspoken Border Patrol sector chief who has personally led arrest operations, first in Los Angeles and Sacramento over the summer, and most recently in Chicago. He has gained infamy among critics who denounce his agents' tactics as heavy-handed and indiscriminate, as well as support among those who view him as an effective, no-nonsense enforcer of President Trump's aggressive clampdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Over the summer, sweeping \"roving patrols\" by Border Patrol agents in the Los Angeles area targeted day laborers at Home Depot parking lots and worksites like car washes, triggering widespread local backlash, including accusations of racial profiling that federal officials have strongly denied.",
      "Nearly identical scenes have played out in the Chicago area in recent weeks, where the Border Patrol teams led by Bovino have conducted similarly aggressive operations, prompting protests and confrontations with local residents and activists. Videos posted on social media have depicted cases of Border Patrol agents chasing individuals in densely populated areas or being confronted by angry residents. Bovino has joined agents on some of those Chicago-area operations, as well as outside an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, where protesters have gathered for weeks.",
      "On Tuesday, Bovino was summoned before a federal judge in Chicago who has ordered his agents to limit their use of force against protesters and to generally give them two warnings before deploying chemical agents. The judge told Bovino to ensure his agents comply with the order, citing several cases of them deploying tear gas, including one incident she said affected children getting ready for a Halloween parade.",
      "Federal officials have said they've deployed tear gas in volatile situations and to protect agents. In an interview with CBS News earlier this month, Bovino said, \"the use of force that I've seen has been exemplary \u2014 the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission.\"",
      "Border Patrol's actions have caused tensions inside DHS, where some ICE leaders feel their counterparts' operations have become too aggressive and controversial, undermining public support for Mr. Trump's mass deportation pledge, two U.S. officials told CBS News, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters.",
      "Though anyone found to be in the U.S. illegally is eligible to be arrested under the Trump administration, routine ICE operations are typically targeted in nature, informed by previous intelligence gathering and surveillance and aimed at arresting people in the country unlawfully who also have criminal records. ICE officials have privately argued the focus should be on arresting those with criminal records, not undertaking more indiscriminate and visible sweeps in locations like Home Depot parking lots, sources familiar with the internal deliberations told CBS News.",
      "But in a sign that top Trump administration officials think Border Patrol's aggressive style can help boost deportation levels, CBS News reported earlier this week that officials made plans to reassign roughly half of ICE's 25 field office directors and, in many cases, replace them with CBP officials.",
      "DHS, which oversees both ICE and CBP, said in a statement to CBS News Wednesday the department \"is one team and we have one fight, to secure the homeland.\"",
      "\"DHS has arrested more than 3,000 illegal aliens, including rapists, murderers, and gang members, as part of DHS's Operation Midway Blitz,\" the department added.",
      "The vast majority of CBP personnel deployed to Chicago are Border Patrol agents, though some officers from its Office of Field Operations branch are also there. As federal immigration officers, Border Patrol agents, like ICE officers, have the authority to stop people they suspect are in the U.S. illegally anywhere in the country, though they have heightened search and seizure powers near border areas.",
      "Matt Hudak, who started at the Border Patrol in the late 1990s until retiring as deputy chief in 2023, said the way the Trump administration has deployed Border Patrol agents to U.S. cities is \"unique,\" though he emphasized their nationwide immigration authorities.",
      "Hudak said the administration is increasingly turning to Border Patrol for interior immigration enforcement because the agency has roughly 20,000 agents \u2014 significantly more than ICE's team of fewer than 6,000 deportation officers. Border Patrol is also no longer facing a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, where government figures show illegal crossings have plummeted to a 55-year low after soaring to record highs under the Biden administration.",
      "But Hudak said Border Patrol agents can also operate in a \"faster-paced\" and more \"forward-leaning\" way compared to ICE officers, whose approach to arrests is \"methodical\" and slower. That distinction, he said, could give them an edge in an administration heavily invested in increasing the number of immigration arrests and deportations.",
      "\"It's just like a baseball game, right?\" Hudak said. \"If you're not getting the scoring, the game's not going the way you want, you look at another head coach, or you change pitchers during the game to get that different result.\"",

      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sweeping sanctions on members of an alleged Mexico-based human smuggling network that it says trafficked people from four continents using yachts, hotels and cartel connections, a move officials say underscores the Trump administration's intensifying strategy to treat migrant trafficking schemes as a direct threat to national security.",
      "The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) targeted the Bhardwaj Human Smuggling Organization, its alleged ringleader Vikrant Bhardwaj plus three accomplices and 16 affiliated entities on Thursday. The sanctions will freeze any U.S. property or interests tied to the sprawling group and bar U.S. persons from conducting financial transactions with the alleged criminal organization.",
      "According to Treasury officials, the Bhardwaj HSO constructed a \"sophisticated\" smuggling pipeline that tapped its own collection of yachts and marinas, as well as hostels, hotels and other front operations across Mexico, India and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Thousands of migrants from Europe, the Middle East, South America, and Asia \u2014 including some from countries deemed national security risks \u2014 were allegedly flown or sailed into Mexico, then routed north toward the U.S. border over land, a dangerous passage dubbed the \"Tapachula-Cancun-Mexicali corridor.\"",
      "Officials allege the group's services cost migrants thousands of dollars apiece, and the group solicited operational support from individuals employed by the notorious Sinaloa Cartel.",
      "Investigators identified a web of corporate fronts allegedly controlled or used by the group, spanning so-called tourism companies in Mexico to real estate and hospitality firms in India and the UAE, as well as a Mexican supermarket to hide illicit revenue streams.",
      "The Treasury sanctioned three other associates: Jose German Valadez Flores and Jorge Alejandro Mendoza Villegas are accused of facilitating the trafficking ring by bribing officials at airports and ports of entry, while a third, Indu Rani, is identified as Bhardwaj's wife and the lead on logistical operations.",
      "\"Today's action, in collaboration with our law enforcement partners, disrupts this network's ability to smuggle dangerous illegal aliens into the United States,\" Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley said in a statement to CBS News. \"The Trump administration will continue to target and dismantle human smuggling organizations that value profit over human life.\"",
      "In recent years, U.S. authorities have expanded the use of sanctions tools \u2014 originally conceived for targeting terrorism or narcotics networks \u2014 to confront human smuggling and transnational criminal organizations.",
      "In June 2023, Biden-era Treasury officials targeted the Hernandez Salas smuggling network for facilitating thousands of migrants and laundering proceeds. Later that year, OFAC sanctioned the Mexican-based Malas Ma\u00f1as trafficking network, linking human smuggling operations to narcotics trafficking and cartel business.",
      "The Treasury's latest move likens the Bhardwaj HSO to full-blown national security threats, akin to drug cartels or terrorist syndicates.",
      "To bolster enforcement, the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) recently issued an alert urging U.S. banks to look out for bulk cash smuggling and repatriation patterns tied to Mexican-based criminal organizations.",
      "Still, Mexican officials have publicly challenged U.S. evidence prompting sanctions under the Trump administration, even questioning past designations connected to Mexican banks for alleged ties to cartel money laundering.",
      "In June 2025, the U.S. Treasury targeted commercial banks CiBanco and Intercam, and the brokerage firm Vector Casa de Bolsa, accusing them of moving money on behalf of cartels and their fentanyl supply chain. Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, expressed frustration at the time and publicly requested that the U.S. Treasury \"send proof, if they have it, so we can accompany them in the process.\"",
      "This time around, Treasury officials tell CBS News the latest sanctioning effort against the Bhardwaj HSO was coordinated with Mexico's financial intelligence unit \u2013 the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera (UIF) \u2013 as well as agents from Homeland Security Investigations and the Drug Enforcement Administration.",

    "summary": "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" said the head of Maine Family Planning clinics.",
    "story": [
      "In late October, Maine Family Planning announced three rural clinics in northern Maine would close by month's end. These primary care and reproductive health clinics served about 800 patients, many uninsured or on Medicaid.",
      "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" George Hill, the group's president and CEO, told CBS News. \"For thousands of patients, that was their doctor, their lab, and their lifeline.\"",
      "Maine Family Planning's closures are among the first visible signs of what health leaders call the biggest setback to reproductive care in half a century. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Population Affairs, which administers the Title X Family Planning Program, has been effectively shut down. At the same time, Medicaid cuts, the potential lapse of Affordable Care Act subsidies, as well as cuts across programs in the Health Resources and Services Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are eroding the broader safety net.",
      "\"When you cut OPA, HRSA, and Medicaid together, you're removing every backup we have,\" said Clare Coleman, president of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association. \"It's like taking EMTs off the road while closing the emergency rooms.\"",
      "Asked about the cutbacks, HHS press secretary Emily G. Hilliard told CBS News, \"HHS will continue to carry out all of OPA's statutory functions.\"",
      "How the safety net frays",
      "For more than 50 years, Title X has underwritten a national network of over 4,000 clinics providing contraception, pregnancy testing, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, cancer screening, and other primary and preventive care to nearly 3 million low-income or uninsured patients annually. OPA managed roughly $400 million in grants, issued clinical guidance and ensured compliance.",
      "In mid-October, OPA's operations went dark amid federal layoffs that also affected hundreds of CDC staff. \"Under the Biden administration, HHS became a bloated bureaucracy \u2014 expanding its budget by 38 percent and its workforce by 17 percent,\" a spokesperson for the department said at the time, adding, \"HHS continues to eliminate wasteful and duplicative entities, including those inconsistent with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda.\"",
      "According to Jessica Marcella, who led OPA under the Biden administration, the office was previously staffed by 40 to 50 people. Now, she says, only one U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officer remains.",
      "\"The structure to run the nation's family planning program disappeared overnight,\" said Liz Romer, OPA's former chief clinical adviser.",
      "\"This isn't just about government jobs,\" said Coleman. \"It's a patient care crisis. Every safety net program that touches reproductive health is being weakened.\"",
      "A policy linking health, autonomy and opportunity",
      "Created in 1970 under President Richard Nixon and rooted in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, Title X was designed as a cornerstone of preventive public health, not a partisan cause. Nixon called family planning a \"national commitment to give every American the means to plan their families,\" and Congress agreed overwhelmingly across party lines.",
      "Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law at George Washington University, said the program reflected a pivotal shift in how policymakers understood health itself.",
      "\"By the late 1960s, there was a deep appreciation that the ability to time and space pregnancies was absolutely essential to women's and children's health,\" she said. \"Title X represented the idea that reproductive care wasn't a privilege or a moral issue. It was basic health care.\"",
      "UCLA economist Martha Bailey later found that children born after the first federally-funded family-planning programs were 7% less likely to live in poverty, and had household incomes 3% higher, than those born before. Bailey's research, just published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, also showed that when low-income women can access free birth control, unintended pregnancies drop by 16% and abortions drop by 12% within two years.",
      "Those findings underscore what Rosenbaum calls \"one of the great public health achievements of the 20th century \u2014 a program that linked economic opportunity to health and autonomy.\"",
      "That bipartisan foundation and evidence-based mission, Rosenbaum said, make today's unraveling especially striking.",
      "\"What was once common sense, that access to family planning is essential to a functioning health system, has become politically fragile,\" she noted. \"Title X was built for continuity, but it's being undone by neglect.\"",
      "The hidden health risks behind unplanned pregnancies",
      "Family planning is central to maternal and infant health because it gives women the time to optimize medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease before pregnancy, and allows them to safely space out their births.",
      "\"Pregnancy is the ultimate stress test,\" said Dr. Andra James, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who advised the CDC on its contraceptive guidelines. \"It increases the heart's workload by up to 50%. For people with heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension, that stress can be dangerous.\"",
      "Brianna Henderson, a Texas mother, learned this firsthand. Weeks after delivery, she developed peripartum cardiomyopathy, a form of heart failure that can occur during or after pregnancy. She survived. Her sister, who had the same undiagnosed condition, died three months after giving birth to her second child. Those kids are now 12 and 16, and they're growing up without a mom. Their dad and his mother look after the kids now.",
      "\"Contraception has been a life-saving option for me,\" Henderson said.",
      "James and other specialists warn that without CDC-informed guidance on contraceptive safety for complex conditions, clinicians and patients are left without clear, current standards.",
      "What history and the data predict happens next",
      "Title X clinics provide millions of STI tests each year and are often the only cancer screening sites for uninsured women. Cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies will make it even harder for people to afford preventive visits.",
      "\"If these clinics close, we'll see more infections, more unplanned pregnancies, and more maternal deaths, especially among Black, Indigenous, and rural communities,\" said Whitney Rice, an expert on reproductive health at Emory University.",
      "And the geographic gaps are large already. Power to Decide, a nonprofit reproductive rights group, counts more than 19 million women living in \"contraceptive deserts,\" where there's no reasonable access to publicly supported birth control.",
      "\"These are places where the nearest clinic might be 60 or 100 miles away,\" said Power to Decide interim co-CEO Rachel Fey. \"For many families, that distance might as well be impossible.\"",
      "The high price of short-term savings",
      "Each pregnancy averted through Title X saves about $15,000 in public spending on medical and social services, according to an analysis by Power to Decide. The analysis shows that every $1 invested in publicly funded family-planning programs saves roughly $7 in Medicaid costs.",
      "Cutting federal funding for reproductive health services \"isn't saving money. It's wasting it,\" said Brittni Frederiksen, a KFF health economist and former OPA scientist. \"We'll spend far more fixing the problems these cuts create.\"",
      "Supporters of cuts argue federal spending must be reduced and states should set their own priorities.",
      "Strain on the ground",
      "Affirm, Arizona's Title X grantee, oversees a statewide network of clinics that provide family-planning services to more than 33,000 patients each year.",
      "Affirm CEO Br\u00e9 Thomas said the state could lose $6.1 million in Title X funding if federal appropriations expire after March 31, 2026. It's a cut that would reduce access to care across the network. \"That's $6.1 million for Arizona,\" she said. \"That means over 33,000 patients in our state could lose access to services.\"",
      "Thomas noted that two consecutive funding reductions, combined with 11 years of flat federal support and rising healthcare costs, have already strained operations. Without new funding, she warned, clinics may be forced to limit contraceptive options to cheaper methods, reduce preventive care, and risk staff layoffs, especially in rural communities.",
      "\"We're talking about impacts to people's jobs and their ability to access the care they need,\" she said.",
      "Megan Kavanaugh, a scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, underscored those limits.",
      "\"Federally Qualified Health Centers do not have the capacity to absorb the number of patients who will lose care,\" she said, referring to federally funded community-based clinics for underserved populations. \"Some people may find another clinic, but a large share simply won't, and we'll see that reflected in higher rates of unintended pregnancy, untreated infections, and later-stage disease.\"",
      "Hospitals are beginning to absorb the spillover.",
      "\"The safety net is shrinking, and hospitals can't absorb everyone,\" said Dr. Sonya Borrero, a reproductive health expert at the University of Pittsburgh and a former Chief Medical and Scientific Adviser at OPA. \"Wait times will get longer, and preventable problems will rise.\"",
      "Funding frozen, oversight halted",
      "With OPA offline, Title X dollars already awarded can be spent, but no new funds are moving.",
      "\"Most programs can hang on for a few months,\" Romer said. \"By spring, many won't have enough money to stay open.\"",
      "The halt also suspends compliance reviews and technical assistance tied to CDC-aligned guidelines.",
      "Marcella, the former OPA leader, warned of a \"backdoor dismantling.\"",
      "\"If there aren't people to administer the grants, then the administration can later argue the program isn't working and redirect the funds elsewhere,\" she said. \"This is a functional elimination, done quietly.\"",
      "Kavanaugh called the moment \"one more step toward dismantling the public health infrastructure that has supported people's reproductive health for decades.\"",
      "Without staff to move money and guidance, she said, \"that's how a system collapses.\"",
      "What can still be done",
      "According to the National Association of Community Health Centers, Federally Qualified Health Centers can still use HRSA money that was already approved, even during the government shutdown. But no new funding is being released, similar to the freeze on Title X funds. At the same time, HRSA has stopped first-quarter payments for its Title V Maternal and Child Health program, which limits how states can provide preventive care and services for children and young people with special health needs.",
      "Some states \u2014 California, New Mexico, Washington \u2014 are plugging holes with state dollars, and health systems are expanding telehealth, but most jurisdictions cannot replace federal support at scale.",
      "\"Private donors can't replace the federal government,\" Hill said. \"You can't crowdfund your way to a working health system.\"",
      "Congress could restore Title X and rebuild OPA's staffing, but without administrators in place, money can't reach clinics quickly. States have a short window to bridge care by stabilizing Medicaid coverage, shoring up community health centers, and protecting contraceptive access.",
      "\"This isn't a political debate,\" Romer said. \"It's women showing up for care and finding the doors locked.\"",

    "summary": "While flying back to Washington on Air Force One after the meeting, Trump told reporters it was a \"great success\" and said he would head to China in April for new talks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Thursday he will cut U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods after he sat down with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a high-stakes summit in South Korea in the midst of a months-long trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "\"On the scale from zero to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One while flying back to Washington from the South Korean city of Busan. He called his more than 90-minute session with Xi an \"amazing meeting\" and a \"great success.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters \"we have a deal\" on trade, saying he expects to sign an agreement \"pretty soon,\" though he's likely to renegotiate it in future years. \"A lot of things we brought to finalization\" during Thursday's discussions, the president added, calling Xi a \"tremendous leader of a very powerful country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he decided to lower his overall tariff rate on imports of Chinese goods from 57% to 47%, after promises by Xi to curtail shipments of fentanyl ingredients to the U.S. Levies of 47%\u00a0would still leave China with one of the highest tariff rates the U.S. imposes.",
      "He also told reporters China will resume purchasing U.S. soybeans \"immediately\" after a boycott by China left Americans farmers reeling, and he said a conflict over Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports was \"settled.\" Details on those agreements remain sparse.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he would go to China in April for new talks, and Xi will \"be coming here sometime after that, whether it's in Florida, Palm Beach or Washington, D.C.\"",
      "The two leaders met on a South Korean military base at the tail end of an almost weeklong trip through Asia by Mr. Trump.",
      "Prior to the meeting, Mr. Trump said he has a good relationship with Xi \"but he's a very tough negotiator. That's not good.\"",
      "Xi said trade negotiators from both sides have made progress in addressing \"major concerns\" and he believes the U.S. and China should be \"partners and friends.\"",
      "\"Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye-to-eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then,\" Xi said through an interpreter, though he noted that relations have been \"stable on the whole.\"",
      "China is the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner, behind only Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. buying $438.9 billion in Chinese goods last year, while China bought $143.5 billion in goods from the U.S. But Mr. Trump has pushed for higher tariffs on Chinese imports, both due to fentanyl trafficking and alleged unfair trade practices, sparking a trade war.",
      "The two sides briefly levied massive tit-for-tat tariffs on each other in April, before delaying those levies to buy time for negotiations. In August, Mr. Trump signed an executive action delaying the reinstatement of higher tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days, extending the pause until mid-November.",
      "U.S. and Chinese officials have been holding trade talks for months leading up to Thursday's Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump threatened to\u00a0impose an additional 100% tariff rate\u00a0on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 in retaliation for China's increased export controls on rare earth minerals and magnets, which would bring total tariffs on Chinese imports as high as 155%. China has the vast majority of the world's supply of those raw materials, critical for manufacturing in key technology areas like semiconductors and missiles. Those extra 100% tariffs are \"effectively off the table\" for now,\u00a0Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Bessent said he also expects Mr. Trump and Xi to sign a deal Thursday placing TikTok under majority U.S. ownership, although Chinese-owned ByteDance could still have a minority ownership stake of under 20%.",
      "Defense is another point of tension between China and the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump's first secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he should commit to Taiwan's independence.",
      "\"Xi Jinping is expected to press President Trump for clarity about America's stance toward Taiwan at their meeting this week,\" Pompeo wrote on social media. \"America should oblige \u2014 and affirm our unequivocal commitment to Taiwan's sovereignty and independence from Beijing.\"",
      "But on the trip home, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Xi didn't discuss Taiwan.",
      "Separately, moments before the meeting with Xi began, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social\u00a0that he's directed the Pentagon\u00a0to restart nuclear weapons testing. And the president\u00a0said earlier Wednesday\u00a0that he will allow South Korea, a rival of China's, to develop a nuclear-powered submarine.",
      "The last time Mr. Trump and Xi met in person was on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan in 2019, during Mr. Trump's first term in office, although the two leaders have spoken by phone. The last conversation the White House disclosed between the two men was on Sept. 19.",
      "Busan, known as an educational and cultural center along Korea's southeastern coast, is the second most populous city in South Korea behind its capital, Seoul. The Xi meeting is the final agenda item on Mr. Trump's schedule for his five-day Asia tour, concluding a trip primarily intended to strengthen economic ties and cement trade deals in the South Pacific region.",

      "The Justice Department placed two D.C.-based federal prosecutors on leave after they filed court papers calling the Jan. 6 Capitol siege a \"riot\" perpetrated by a \"mob,\" three sources familiar with the matter told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "The papers were submitted Tuesday in the case of Taylor Taranto, who was pardoned by President Trump on Capitol riot charges earlier this year but was later convicted of livestreaming a bomb threat. He was arrested in 2023 while livestreaming himself driving around former President Barack Obama's D.C. neighborhood while armed, according to prosecutors.",
      "The filing \u2014 which asked a judge to sentence Taranto to 27 months in prison at a hearing Thursday \u2014 mentioned Taranto's Jan. 6 charges and briefly described the events of that day, writing that \"thousands of people comprising a mob of rioters attacked the U.S. Capitol.\"",
      "That unsparing description of the Capitol riot was notable, as Mr. Trump has called Jan. 6 a \"day of love\" and referred to the rioters as \"hostages.\"",
      "The filing also said Taranto drove to Obama's neighborhood shortly after Mr. Trump posted the former president's purported address on Truth Social and Taranto shared the post.",
      "Hours after the sentencing memo was submitted, two prosecutors whose names appear on it were placed on leave, CBS News has confirmed. U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and staunch Trump backer, was also listed on the filing.",
      "Then, later Wednesday, a new, shorter sentencing memo appeared in the federal court database with the references to the Jan. 6 riot and Mr. Trump's post about Obama now omitted. Two different federal prosecutors were listed at the bottom of the filing, along with Pirro.",
      "Pirro said in a statement to CBS News: \"While we don't comment on personnel decisions, we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously.\"",
      "\"We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target,\" she said.",
      "Mr. Trump granted clemency to more than 1,500 accused and convicted Capitol rioters shortly after returning to the Oval Office earlier this year. The near-blanket pardons drew outrage from Democratic lawmakers and pushback from some federal judges who accused the president of downplaying the event and perpetuating a \"revisionist myth.\"",
      "Taranto is one of several pardon recipients who have faced prosecution for non-Jan. 6 crimes. Earlier this month, a pardoned rioter was charged with allegedly threatening House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Others have been accused of burglary and \"raising a firearm at police.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump said Wednesday he's allowing South Korea to build a nuclear-powered submarine in Philadelphia.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Wednesday that South Korea can build a nuclear-powered submarine.",
      "\"Our Military Alliance is stronger than ever before and, based on that, I have given them approval to build a Nuclear Powered Submarine, rather than the old fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel powered Submarines that they have now,\" the president wrote on Truth Social during a multiday visit to South Korea.",
      "Mr. Trump added that the submarine will be built in Philadelphia, as the president and lawmakers seek foreign investments as a way to boost the American shipbuilding industry. A South Korean company bought the Philly Shipyard last year.",
      "During a meeting with Mr. Trump earlier Wednesday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said he's looking for U.S. support in getting nuclear fuel for submarines. He argued that shifting away from diesel-electric submarines \u2014 which typically have more limited ranges \u2014 would allow South Korea to help the U.S. Navy patrol the region.",
      "\"We're not aiming for nuclear-armed submarines, but rather, conventionally armed submarines powered by nuclear energy,\" Lee said through a translator, saying his country's existing fleet has \"limited capabilities\" and \"cannot really effectively monitor and counter any undersea activities from other countries.\"",
      "Nuclear-powered submarines are a key part of the U.S.'s naval fleet, and the advanced technology necessary to build them is closely guarded by U.S. officials. The Biden administration inked a deal with Australia to help the country build the submarines.",
      "The move could pose concerns for the U.S. and South Korea's two mutual rivals in the region, North Korea and China. The Chinese navy has nuclear-powered submarines, and North Korea said earlier this year it had developed one. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday local time, for talks that are expected to focus on trade.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the submarine deal as part of a broader trade agreement with South Korea, the United States' sixth-largest trading partner and a key military ally in the region.",
      "He said the country has agreed to \"pay the USA\" $350 billion, invest in U.S. industry, and buy American oil and gas in exchange for lower U.S. tariffs on South Korean imports. Mr. Trump outlined a similar deal over the summer, which called for 15% tariffs on South Korean goods.",

      "\"In 41 states in America, your child care payment is more than your mortgage payment,\" she said.",

      "Nationwide, about 67% of women with children under 5 are in the labor force, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, a number that's declined over the past few years.",
      "The New Mexico program goes beyond covering the cost. It's also expanding who can provide care by recruiting and licensing more registered home providers, including qualified family members, to meet demand.",
      "The program will also set up a $12.7 million low-interest loan fund to pay for construction, expansion and renovation of child care facilities, with another $20 million requested for 2027, the governor said in a statement last month.",
      "Asked what she would say to those who criticize the program as a Democratic handout, Lujan Grisham responded: \"I say it's a Democrat that's got twice the national average in economic output. This is about investing in mothers and fathers, being able to go back to the workforce.\"",
      "For Mierley and Herzog, it's a chance to think beyond their next paycheck.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 19:04:02 -0400",
    "summary": "The move, if it occurs, would be in response to China's escalating hostilities near disputed waters as Trump is poised to meet with Xi, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As the highly anticipated meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping was set to take place in South Korea Thursday, the U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command quietly issued an order this week to stage a \"show of force\" against recent Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, CBS News has learned.",
      "It's unclear when this operation would occur, if at all, as military operations can easily be canceled at the last minute, but the execute order from Indo-Pacific Command, the Defense Department's oldest and largest combatant unit overseeing operations across half the globe, directed American forces to carry out a precision strike demonstration in response to China's escalating hostilities near disputed waters. Two other sources confirmed that the operation had been prepared as an option, but they said the plan was unlikely to be executed.",
      "If launched, it's unclear what the HIMARS would target but the operation is intended to signal Washington's intent to push back against Beijing's expanding presence in the region and defend what U.S. officials describe as Philippine sovereignty and long-standing fishing rights.",
      "Contacted by CBS News, no reply has been returned from U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.",
      "The High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, delivers its greatest impact against fixed targets that can be located and struck with precision, such as ammunition depots or clusters of troops. Built by defense contractor Lockheed Martin, the system saw extensive use in the post-9/11 Iraq and Afghanistan wars and is prized by Ukraine in its fight against Russia.",
      "Scarborough Shoal, known in the Philippines as Bajo de Masinloc, sits within Manila's exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea, but Beijing has controlled access to the reef since a tense 2012 standoff between the two nations who both claim ownership of the shoal.",
      "China's presence there has grown steadily as its coast guard and maritime flotilla of ships regularly shadow or harass Philippine vessels and small fishing boats. In Sept. 2024, a\u00a0\"60 Minutes\"\u00a0crew witnessed China's naval aggressiveness while onboard a Philippine Coast Guard ship that was rammed by a Chinese coast guard vessel. The Philippine ship was on a mission to resupply ships and stations in the South China Sea at the time but was forced to abandon its first stop as Chinese vessels surrounded it.",
      "Recent high-resolution satellite photos released earlier this month shows what appears to be a floating barrier at the mouth of Scarborough reef. Retired U.S. Air Force Col. Ray Powell, a maritime analyst and director of SeaLight, a Stanford University-affiliated analysis group, posted the photographs captured by Satellogic on X and said China was responsible for installing the barrier.",
      "Both China and the Philippines have installed and later dismantled temporary barriers around the Scarborough Shoal before. One U.S. official said ideally, the operation by Indo-Pacific Command should occur ahead of the U.S.-China trade negotiations or before China establishes a more permanent barrier at the Scarborough reef.",
      "In August, a Chinese Coast Guard ship and a Chinese Navy vessel collided near the reef while pursuing a Philippine Coast Guard cutter. Weeks later, Beijing announced plans to create a \"nature reserve\" in the area \u2014 a move that was condemned by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and viewed by officials in Manila as another step toward solidifying Chinese control.",
      "\"Beijing claiming Scarborough Reef as a nature preserve is yet another coercive attempt to advance sweeping territorial and maritime claims in the South China Sea at the expense of its neighbors, including by preventing Filipino fishermen from accessing these traditional fishing grounds,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"China's actions at Scarborough Reef continue to undermine regional stability.\"",
      "Speaking before fellow leaders of the Association of South East Asian Nations and Mr. Trump on Sunday in Kuala Lumpur, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., echoed Rubio's comments from September and condemned China, without directly naming it, for encroaching on Philippine sovereignty in its push for a \"nature reserve\" in Scarborough Shoal.",
      "\"The attempt of some actors to establish the so-called 'nature reserve' status over Bajo de Masinloc or Scarborough Shoal, which is a long-standing and integral part of the Philippines over which it has sovereignty and jurisdiction, clearly violates not only Philippine sovereignty, but also the traditional fishing rights of our people,\" said Marcos, who added that China is violating international law. He cited the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2016 Award on the South China Sea arbitration which rejected China's claims of historic rights over the territory.",

      "Asked whether he meant sending other branches of the military into U.S. cities, Mr. Trump said Wednesday, \"You know if I want to enact a certain act, I'm allowed to do it routinely,\" an apparent reference to the Insurrection Act, which allows the military to act in a law enforcement capacity to suppress a rebellion or quell domestic violence. The authority that has not been invoked by a U.S. president in more than 30 years.",
      "\"And I'd be allowed to do whatever I want,\" Mr. Trump added. \"But we haven't chosen to do that because we're very well \u2014 we're doing very well without it. But I'd be allowed to do that, you understand that, and the courts wouldn't get involved, nobody would get involved, and I could send the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, I can send anybody I wanted. But I haven't done that because we're doing so well without it.\"",
      "The president touted the National Guard deployments in Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, as the administration insists their presence is driving down crime.

      "The last time a president invoked the Insurrection Act was in 1992, when GOP Gov. Pete Wilson of California asked President George H.W. Bush for help in quelling the Los Angeles riots, after a jury acquitted four White police officers who were accused of assaulting and beating Rodney King, a Black motorist. The incident was caught on video.",
      "\"He would have to invoke the provision allowing use of the military to assist in enforcing federal law unless a governor requested the help,\" Corn said of Mr. Trump.",
      "In D.C., Mr. Trump deployed the D.C. National Guard troops under a section of federal law known as Title 32, meaning they're not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act. Members of the D.C. Guard also deployed in Title 32 status in 2020, in response to protests over the murder of George Floyd, when the D.C. government requested additional manpower. They also deployed in Title 32 status in response to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, after some delay.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Wednesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Canada, a day after the chamber rebuked the president with another vote to block tariffs on Brazil.",
      "In a 50 to 46 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the measure, which would terminate the national emergency used to impose tariffs on some goods from Canada. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky broke with their party to vote in favor of the resolution, which required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "The move is mostly symbolic, since it is unlikely to be taken up in the GOP-controlled House. Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "For months, trade tensions have flared between the U.S. and Canada. In August, the president raised tariffs on the country to 35%, though a large share of goods remain exempt under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Then, over the weekend, Mr. Trump said he is raising tariffs on Canada by an additional 10%, blasting the U.S.'s northern neighbor over an anti-tariff ad by the government of Ontario that used quotes from former President Ronald Reagan.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"the public health crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more\" to combat \"drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, forced a vote to challenge the move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, effectively bypassing Senate leadership. He has argued that the tariffs on one of the nation's top trading partners aren't justified under the emergency.",
      "\"I don't think you can say that fentanyl is not an emergency vis-a-vis Mexico or China, but it is ridiculous to say that fentanyl is an emergency with respect to Canada,\" Kaine said. \"And it's a pretext that's just being used to pour more and more tariffs onto Canada.\"",
      "The vote came after the Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure. Wednesday's vote also marked the second time lawmakers have weighed in on the Canada tariffs, after the Senate approved a resolution aimed at blocking the levies in April.",

      "In September 2018, Taylor wrote an anonymous opinion piece in the New York Times that said there was a \"quiet resistance\" to President Trump within his own administration, made up of people \"working diligently\" to block what he called the president's \"worst inclinations.\" He disclosed two years later that he had written the op-ed.",
      "The announcement of the new site is intended to capitalize on momentum from the October \"No Kings\" rallies earlier this month, which attracted participants across the country.",
      "The site launched Wednesday with a video of actor Robert DeNiro, a staunch Trump critic, urging protesters and critics to join forces.",
      "\"You can't just sit on your ass and wait for the insanity and cruelty to pass. No,\" DeNiro says in the video. \"You gotta stand up and fight.\"",

Democrats could end the shutdown today but Myles (sic) is too blinded by his TDS rage to accept the truth.\" (\"TDS\" is often used by Mr. Trump and his supporters as an initialism for \"Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" a phrase describing some of his critics)",
      "In April, Mr. Trump signed an executive memo targeting Taylor, accusing him of manufacturing stories to sell a book, and ordered DHS, the Justice Department and other government agencies to investigate him and revoke his security clearances, as well as for those who worked closely with him. Mr. Trump also ordered an investigation into the alleged dissemination of classified documents while Taylor worked for the government. Taylor denies he leaked any such material.",
      "Defiance.org is described in its mission statement as a \"nationwide 'mutual aid' pact to defend those under attack.\" It aims to support nonprofit partners, and says it will join \"peaceful protests and legal defense efforts.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News supporters of the effort include Stephanie Grisham, a press secretary from the first Trump administration, and former aide Olivia Troye, both of whom have become vocal critics of the president.",
      "Dozens of former elected leaders and Trump critics, including former Republican congressmen Reid Ribble, Denver Riggleman and Joe Walsh, are also supporting the new portal.",
      "Taylor said the mutual aid feature of the portal is intended to help those targeted by the administration. He said a future effort could include rallying legal, political and community leaders to support Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is under investigation by the Justice Department, if he is charged. Taylor said the Defiance.org hub would be used to galvanize and organize legal help, courthouse supporters and public statements in support of Schiff or against the Trump administration.",
      "Riggleman told CBS News the group would seek to \"protect Americans against political overreach and targeted retaliation.\"",
      "The White House has harshly criticized Taylor in the past, including in this statement in April.",

      "Instead, those are the words greeting visitors to the websites of several companies working on building the White House ballroom.",
      "Some of these firms appear to be trying to lower their profiles (in some cases, literally, on social media) amid the sometimes vitriolic online reaction to the East Wing demolition and construction of the 90,000-square-foot, privately financed ballroom. None of the firms have been accused of any legal wrongdoing.",
      "EAI Rolloff, a Maryland-based hauling company, has advised visitors to its homepage that the site is \"Undergoing Routine Maintenance.\" There are no links or contact information listed.",
      "It's not clear when the site was taken offline or why, but an archived version from earlier this year gives customers options to learn about the company's services, contact the firm or read about its history.",
      "\"We are honest, ethical, responsive, professional and diligent,\" the company's archived \"core values\" page said.",
      "Late last week, a red and charcoal gray truck bearing the EAI logo and phone number delivered discarded rebar from the White House to a scrap yard just outside Washington. The company did not respond to emails and a phone call seeking comment.",

      "ACECO's website is also unavailable. \"This Site Is Under Construction,\" it says in bold block lettering. As recently as August, according to the Internet Archive, ACECO's site showed off the firm's work at the University of Maryland and heralded its clients, which included Clark Construction, the construction contractor hired to build the White House ballroom.",

      "One Yelp poster wrote, \"How do you sleep at night when all of America hates you?\"",
      "Representatives for ACECO \u2014 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "When President Trump announced the project this summer, he named McCrery Architects as the lead design firm. As recently as April, McCrery's site was robust, displaying the firm's prior design projects, its approach to architecture and staff biographies, according to an archived version of the page maintained by the Internet Archive.",
      "Now, McCrery's website is limited to a single page with a rotating photo, generic email address and phone number. Renderings of the White House ballroom are included in the photo carousel.",
      "When CBS News called the number listed on the firm's website, the phone rang several times before a recorded message said the voicemail was full. A McCrery spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Not all companies have shunned attention brought on by their association with the ballroom.",
      "Websites for Clark Construction and AECOM, the lead engineering firm, appear to be intact. Both are large companies \u2014 Clark has a national footprint and AECOM is a multinational company valued at $17 billion and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "The smaller businesses that have pulled down their websites are headquartered in the Washington, D.C., area.",

The judge rejected a request by the three defendants to toss out their charges altogether.",
      "Essayli \u2014 a former California Republican state lawmaker \u2014 was named interim U.S. attorney in April, a role that's typically limited to just 120 days.

      "Seabright ruled that this maneuver was unlawful because only the first assistant U.S. attorney who is already in place when the office becomes vacant is eligible to become acting chief.",
      "\"Simply stated: Essayli unlawfully assumed the role of Acting United States Attorney for the Central District of California. He has been unlawfully serving in that capacity since his resignation from the interim role on July 29, 2025,\" Seabright wrote. \"Essayli may not perform the functions and duties of the United States Attorney as Acting United States Attorney.

      "In several states, the Trump administration has sought to keep federal prosecutors in temporary roles for months. Critics argue the administration is trying to sidestep the Senate, which is responsible for confirming permanent U.S. attorneys, and the federal judiciary, which can opt to extend the terms of interim U.S. attorneys in some cases.",

      "The firings come as Mr. Trump seeks to put his stamp on D.C., with plans to replace the White House's East Wing with a 90,000-square-foot ballroom and build a gigantic triumphal arch across the river from D.C. He also signed an executive order in August titled \"Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again,\" which called for classical architecture modeled on ancient Greece and Rome to be the default style for D.C.-area buildings moving forward.",
      "The Commission of Fine Arts is one of several boards that reviews, provides comments on and approves construction in the capital, along with the National Capital Planning Commission. Mr. Trump picked three new members of the latter commission in July, including Chair William Scharf, a White House aide.",
      "It's not clear whether the White House intends to submit its ballroom plans to the Commission of Fine Arts, which has overseen some prior White House projects. A White House official told CBS News last week that the plans will be submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission.",
      "Mr. Trump's construction kick has drawn a polarizing response. The sudden decision to demolish the East Wing last week \u2014 despite Mr. Trump's earlier claim that the ballroom project would not touch the existing building \u2014 has faced criticism, and some historic preservation groups have urged the Trump administration to go through the normal approval process for the ballroom project.",
      "\"This project represents one of the most substantial alterations to the White House in modern history,\" Democratic Reps. Jared Huffman, Robert Garcia and Yassamin Ansari said in a letter to the president. \"The decisions were made in complete secrecy and undertaken without public disclosure or proper consultation.\"",
      "The White House, meanwhile, has called the pushback \"manufactured outrage\" and argued that prior presidents have also made changes to the complex. The administration has also cast the ballroom as a necessary addition to a building that's lacking in large event spaces.",
      "At a dinner earlier this month to thank private donors to the $300 million ballroom project, Mr. Trump marveled at how easily he was able to kick off construction.",
      "\"They said, 'Sir, you can start tonight,\" the president \u2014 no stranger to real estate development \u2014 told attendees. \"'You have zero zoning conditions. You're the president.'\"",

And Trump ally Steve Bannon said in an interview released last week that \"there's a plan\" for Mr. Trump to win a third term.",

      "\"We're going to be, I hope, making a deal. I think we're going to have a deal. I think it will be a good deal for both,\" the president said. \"The world is watching, and I think we'll have something that's very exciting for everybody.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a speech to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, the last major scheduled stop of a nearly weeklong swing through Asia. Much of his trip has focused on cementing trade agreements and boosting economic ties with U.S. partners in the region.",
      "Trump says U.S. and South Korea deal \"pretty much finalized\"",
      "The president has signed trade and tariff deals with Japan, Malaysia and several other countries during his trip, and after scheduled talks with South Korean officials on Wednesday, he told reporters before a formal state dinner hosted by South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung: \"We reached a deal. We had a great session. It's an honor.\"",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had told reporters ahead of Mr. Trump's visit that he didn't expect a U.S.-South Korea trade agreement to be completely nailed down during the president's trip, but he said he thought it was close.",
      "Mr. Trump, speaking later to the leaders gathered for the dinner, indicated there were still some details to nail down, saying the U.S. and South Korea had \"pretty much finalized a trade deal,\" and adding that the negotiating teams \"came to a conclusion on a lot of very important items.\"",
      "The two countries\u00a0announced\u00a0a framework deal over the summer similar to the one signed earlier in the week with Japan, with 15% tariffs on South Korean goods and investments pledged in the U.S.",
      "An end to the U.S.-China trade war?",
      "But a direct meeting with China's Xi in South Korea on Thursday is the most hotly anticipated part of his trip. The foreign ministry in Beijing confirmed on Wednesday that a sit-down was planned, saying Xi would meet with Mr. Trump in Busan, \"to exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest.\"",
      "Officials in Beijing have not yet voiced the same optimism publicly over a looming deal to end the trade war, and the meeting could be tense, as China and the U.S. have clashed for months, imposing reciprocal tariffs and restrictions on the import and export of key items.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to press Xi to loosen a set of tough export restrictions on rare earth elements from China, which are essential for everything from computer chips to aerospace. He had threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting from Saturday unless Beijing backs off.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday\u00a0that the additional\u00a0100% tariffs\u00a0\u2014 which would boost the total U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports to 140% \u2014 were \"effectively off the table\" after a two-day meeting with a Chinese negotiator.",
      "The trade war has led China to halt purchases of U.S. soybeans, causing pain for American farmers, though Bessent said Sunday that he\u00a0expects Beijing to end its soybean boycott.",
      "Mr. Trump also\u00a0needs Chinese approval\u00a0for a deal to transfer TikTok's U.S. operations from Beijing-based parent company ByteDance.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0predicted\u00a0earlier this week that the two leaders will reach an agreement by the end of his trip, saying he has \"a lot of respect for President Xi\" and, \"I think we're going to come away with a deal.\"",
      "Nicholas Burns, a Biden-era U.S. ambassador to China, told CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes that Wednesday's meeting is \"very important,\" calling the trade war a \"test of wills\" between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "\"China is the most important competitor, adversary of the United States worldwide now. It will be in the future,\" Burns said. \"So the stakes are high, because we have lots of issues where we are competing with China.\"",
      "Trump addresses U.S. partners in Asia",
      "The president also used his speech at the APEC event to tout the other trade deals he's inked in Asia. He highlighted his plans to partner with other countries on key industries including shipbuilding, semiconductors and critical minerals, and framed the trade negotiations as an extension of the U.S. defense alliances in the region, telling audience members that \"economic security is national security.\"",
      "APEC is a regional economic group with 21 member countries around the Pacific Rim, including China, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam. Promoting free trade is a major component of the forum, despite Mr. Trump's push for higher tariffs on many member countries, a strategy that the president argues is necessary to rebalance trade.",
      "Critics warn his strategy could lead to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth.",
      "The president is looking to cinch a trade agreement with South Korea, the United States' sixth-largest trading partner. Over the summer, Mr. Trump announced a framework deal that involves the U.S. charging 15% tariffs on South Korean goods, while South Korea invests billions in U.S. industry and opens its market to American cars. Bessent told reporters the South Korea deal is unlikely to be resolved this week, but it's close.",
      "During his APEC remarks, Mr. Trump called South Korea \"a cherished American friend and a close ally.\" He said he's looking to work with the country on investments in U.S. shipbuilding.",
      "Before leaving his previous stop in Japan, Mr. Trump signed a trade deal\u00a0on Tuesday with new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, cementing 15% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by the president. Japan also pledged $550 billion in investments in U.S. industry.",
      "The president announced trade framework agreements with Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand earlier in the trip.",
      "He's also expected to meet at some point with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, as the microchip giant\u00a0partners\u00a0with the Department of Energy to build an artificial intelligence supercomputer and presses for\u00a0more access\u00a0to China's market.",
      "No meeting planned with Kim Jong Un",
      "Mr. Trump said repeatedly that he would be open to meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his trip, though no such meeting has been planned.",
      "The president said Wednesday that the timing couldn't be worked out for a sit-down with Kim. North Korea's government has made no comment on Mr. Trump's suggestions of another face-to-face meeting between the leaders.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, he became the\u00a0first sitting president to visit North Korea, a trip that happened after\u00a0he put an invitation to Kim\u00a0on social media.",
      "Gyeongju, where Mr. Trump was for the APEC summit, is in southeast South Korea, on the opposite side of the country as the capital Seoul, and far from the border with North Korea. The two Koreas have remained technically at war since 1953, when the Korean War was halted by an armistice rather than a full treaty.",

    "summary": "Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek and Capt. Dylan Blaha say they'll defy federal orders regarding Trump's immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.",
    "story": [
      "Chicago \u2014 Two Illinois National Guard members told CBS News they would refuse to obey federal orders to deploy in Chicago as part of President Trump's controversial immigration enforcement mission \u2014 a rare act of open defiance from within the military ranks.",
      "\"It's disheartening to be forced to go against your community members and your neighbors,\" said Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek, a Latina guardswoman and state legislative candidate from Illinois's 13th District. \"It feels illegal. This is not what we signed up to do.\"",
      "Both Palecek and Capt. Dylan Blaha, who is running for Congress in the same district, described growing unease among Guard members after the White House federalized 500 troops \u2013 including members of the Illinois and Texas National Guard \u2013 to secure federal immigration facilities and personnel in the Chicago area.",
      "\"I signed up to defend the American people and protect the Constitution,\" Blaha said. \"When we have somebody in power who's actively dismantling our rights \u2014 free speech, due process, freedom of the press \u2014 it's really hard to be a soldier right now.\"",
      "Refusing a lawful federal order while serving in the National Guard can sometimes result in court-martial, imprisonment, or a felony-level discharge, depending on who issued the order, whether the soldier is under state or federal control and the nature of the disobedience. When contacted by CBS News, the Defense Department declined comment.",
      "Palecek says members of military are \"being used as pawns\"",
      "Asked if she would refuse a direct order to deploy to Chicago, Palecek didn't hesitate. \"Absolutely. I would definitely say no,\" she said. \"I'm not going to go against my community members, my family and my culture. I believe this is the time to be on the right side of history.\"",
      "\"Look at 1930s, 1940s Germany,\" Blaha said. \"There is a point where if you didn't stand up to the Gestapo, are you just actively one of them now?\"",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday delayed the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago indefinitely, until a final ruling is issued or the Supreme Court rules on the matter.",
      "The two guardsmen accused the Trump administration of weaponizing the military against civilians under the guise of public safety. \"They're definitely being used as pawns,\" Palecek said.",
      "Blaha agreed, saying most Guard units \"train to fight and win our nation's wars,\" and they do not assist law enforcement or Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \"We're not trained to assist ICE and help them just be violent in our communities,\" he said, calling it \"shameful.\"",
      "The pair noted that Guard members currently mobilized in Illinois are on 29-day orders \u2014 too short to qualify for full benefits. \"They're not even getting paid right now because of the government shutdown,\" Blaha added. \"Most don't want to be there. They're scared, too.\"",
      "Lt. Col. Brad Leighton, a spokesperson for the Illinois National Guard later clarified that \"the approximately 300 Illinois Army National Guard Soldiers who were federalized in Illinois are on initial 60-day orders,\" allowing those service members to be eligible for health coverage as well as additional allowances to offset the cost of meals and housing.",
      "Fears for immigrant service members",
      "Roughly 200 green card holders serve in the Illinois National Guard \u2013 with 160 legal permanent residents in the state's Army National Guard and 30 in the state's Air National Guard.",
      "\"They're in sheer panic,\" Palecek said. \"They're choosing between standing up for their community or losing everything \u2014 their legal status, their path to citizenship.\"",
      "U.S. federal law generally prohibits undocumented immigrants from enlisting in the U.S. Armed Forces, including the Army National Guard and Air National Guard. But for green card holders, military service can help expedite U.S. citizenship under longstanding federal programs.",
      "Programs like Parole in Place exist to protect family members of service members from deportation and help them adjust status, but participants say applications have been slowed or outright denied in recent months, leaving families in legal limbo.",
      "\"I applied for parole in place,\" Palecek told CBS News. \"And [my application] has not been able to go through.\"",
      "\"Everyone says, 'Why don't they do it the right way?'\" Palecek continued, offering a sentiment often voiced by those condemning illegal immigration. \"But they are doing it the right way,\" Palecek said.",
      "Retribution in their ranks",
      "Both Blaha and Palecek said they've faced retaliation for speaking publicly. Blaha disclosed that his security clearance was suspended by the Defense Department after posting a viral video urging soldiers to disobey unlawful orders. \"They twisted my words,\" he said. \"I have about 30 days in order to provide them with a written response.\"",
      "Retribution, Palecek added, is \"real.\" She's received death threats since denouncing the deployments and launching her political campaign. \"It weighs on you mentally after a while,\" she said.",
      "Still, both say silence is not an option. \"We were trained to stand up for what we believe in and stand up for the American people,\" Blaha said.",
      "\"Today it's Chicago. Tomorrow it could be somewhere else.\"",
      "Palecek, who once served in active duty, said the current mission has made her ashamed of her uniform. \"I've been truly proud of what I've been able to do in the military,\" she said. \"And right now I hate saying I'm in the military. It's embarrassing.\"",
      "Both see a dangerous precedent in deploying federal troops to U.S. cities. \"It's a slow normalization of using the military in American cities,\" Blaha said. \"If he declares martial law enough times, people will start to think it's OK.\"",
      "A majority of Americans oppose Mr. Trump's deployment of the National Guard to U.S. cities as part of his crime crackdown, according to a September CBS News poll. But still, roughly 42% of Americans polled expressed support for sending members of the National Guard to cities nationwide.",
      "A CBS News analysis of FBI and Chicago Police Department data from 2024 found Chicago's violent crime is down double-digit percentage points so far in 2025 compared to 2024. Among American cities with populations of 100,000 or more, Chicago ranks 80th overall for violent crime per capita.",
      "When asked to describe what America looks like with a federalized National Guard presence nationwide, Blaha replied: \"Unsafe.\" Palecek offered: \"Disgusting.\"",
      "\"They're coming after communities that have built this country,\" Palecek added. \"To be used against my culture, my community, my neighbors \u2014 that's vile and disgusting to me.\"",
      "The two soldiers say they're speaking out to warn the rest of the country. \"Today it's Chicago. Tomorrow it could be somewhere else,\" Blaha said. \"We need to combat the misinformation and stand up to Donald Trump. Crime is down. This is not about safety \u2014 it's about control.\"",

      "Melissa made landfall over eastern Cuba early Wednesday, near the city of Chivirico, as an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 3 storm, the hurricane center said. On Tuesday, it\u00a0pummeled Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph.",
      "On Wednesday night, Melissa's core was about 105 miles east-northeast of the central Bahamas and about 800 miles southwest of Bermuda, according to the hurricane center. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, making it a Category 2 storm, and was moving northeast at about 21 mph.",
      "It was expected to continue moving over the southeast or central Bahamas Wednesday night and pass near Bermuda late Thursday, the hurricane center said.",
      "Officials across the parts of the Caribbean already hit by Melissa were assessing the storm's impacts. At least 23 people have died in Haiti and 13 are missing, the country's Civil Protection Agency said in a statement. At least four deaths were reported in Jamaica, and one in the Dominican Republic.",
      "Jamaica rushes to assess the damage",
      "In Jamaica, more than 25,000 people were packed into shelters Wednesday and more streamed in throughout the day after the storm ripped roofs off their homes and left them temporarily homeless. Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaica's education minister, said 77% of the island was without power.",

      "Melissa weakened somewhat after landfall, with the hurricane center saying in its latest update Tuesday night that winds were at 130 mph, a Category 4 speed. The storm was restrengthening as it approached eastern Cuba, the NHC said, and was expected to make landfall there as an extremely dangerous major hurricane early Wednesday morning.",
      "The storm initially came ashore Tuesday near New Hope, on the southwestern coast of Jamaica, and was traveling northeast at 9 mph, the center said. Landslides, fallen trees and numerous power outages were already being reported earlier Tuesday as the hurricane made its approach, with officials cautioning that the damage assessment will be slow.",

    "story": [
      "After two years of trying to get pregnant, Maggie Quinn and Ricardo Escobar faced a financial obstacle they hadn't expected: the cost of in vitro fertilization in the United States.",
      "\"It was astronomical, and you don't know how many rounds you're going to need,\" Quinn said.",
      "With limited insurance coverage, the Florida couple started researching what's known as \"fertility tourism,\" where patients travel abroad for more affordable fertility care.",
      "Ricardo, who is originally from Colombia, found a clinic in the country's capital of Bogota offering a dramatic price difference\u2014a package of four IVF rounds in Colombia for $11,000 compared to around $60,000 for four rounds in the U.S. Medication costs were also less than half of those in the U.S.",
      "\"It's a no-brainer, especially because I'm from there,\" Escobar said. \"We found that the clinic had an excellent rating and really good results.\"",
      "At the clinic, called Inser, the couple met with Dr. Juan Luis Giraldo, who treats patients from around the world. He said nearly half of his clients come from outside Colombia, and about 15% are from the United States.",
      "\"From the U.S., they mainly come for two things,\" Giraldo said. \"The first is cost, and the second is personalized treatment. It's really common that patients there feel they don't have a close relationship with their doctor.\"",
      "The couple made several trips to Colombia, where their first IVF round produced four viable embryos. After multiple embryo transfers, Quinn became pregnant and gave birth to their son, Lorenzo, in 2023. They returned the following year for another round and are now expecting again.",
      "Quinn estimates they saved between $15,000 and $20,000 per round. Her flexible work schedule made the travel possible, and some bloodwork and ultrasounds were completed in Florida.",
      "Dr. Sangita Jindal, with the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, advises Americans pursuing fertility treatment abroad to carefully review local laws.",
      "\"I would want to know that there is a flexible legal framework that would allow me to bring my embryos back to the U.S. for transfer to my uterus,\" Jindal said. \"Some countries may have prohibitive laws around that.\"",
      "The global fertility-tourism market has grown by more than $50 million in the past year and is projected to reach $800 million by 2030.",
      "For Quinn and Escobar, who became pregnant again after two rounds of IVF, the journey has been more emotional.",

      "The fish, named Arnie after Australia's recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in early 2022 in Mullaroo Creek, about a 13-hour drive west of Sydney, said Arthur Rylah Institute researcher Zeb Tonkin.",
      "Four years old and weighing in at 3.7 pounds at the time, it \"took off\" when floods hit the area in the spring of that year, Tonkin said, traveling an initial 470 miles upstream in fewer than two months.",
      "The scaly river dweller, an apex water predator, was able to cover longer distances because barriers had been removed along the Murray River to let flood waters pass through.",
      "\"It basically provided free passage for fish,\" said Tonkin.",
      "Arnie then turned around at some point in the past 12 months, swimming another 60 miles downstream toward home.",
      "Researchers only discovered the extent of the fish's travels when sharing data with colleagues a couple of weeks ago.",
      "\"We've been working on these species for decades ... and we haven't come across that sort of scale of movement beforehand,\" Tonkin said. \"Probably the best we have seen a Murray cod do is around 160 kilometers (100 miles).\"",
      "Understanding Murray cod allows researchers to adapt water flows to protect their environment, said Tonkin, whose institute is part of the state of Victoria's department of energy, environment and climate action.",
      "The fish \u2014 not related to ocean cod species \u2014 can live more than 48 years, grow to about 6 feet and weigh more than 180 pounds, according to the government's survey of Australian fish stocks.",
      "\"If we see this species breeding, growing well, migrating well, it's a pretty good indication that the ecosystem in general is pretty healthy,\" Tonkin said.",
      "The decade-long fish tagging project works closely with the Mallee Catchment Management Authority. It is funded by the state-financed Living Murray program, managed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.",
      "According to the Australian Museum, the Murray cod has a concave snout with a large mouth and small eyes. It preys on fish, mollusks, turtles and some small terrestrial animals, including birds, mammals and snakes.",
      "Murray cod are listed as \"vulnerable\" under Australia's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The species' populations have declined dramatically, according to the Australian Museum, initially because of commercial fishing.",
      "\"More recently, overfishing, river degradation and human modification of the environment have caused major population declines,\" the museum says. \"Murray Cod are now relatively uncommon in most areas.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have long debated whether dinosaurs were in decline before an\u00a0asteroid smacked the Earth 66 million years ago, causing mass extinction.",
      "New research suggests dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike, but it's only one piece of the global picture, independent experts say.",
      "\"Dinosaurs were quite diverse and now we know there were quite distinct communities\" roaming around before being abruptly wiped out, said Daniel Peppe, a study co-author and paleontologist at Baylor University.",
      "The latest evidence comes from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "Scientists now say those fossils and the surrounding rocks date from around 400,000 years before the asteroid struck, which is considered a short interval in geologic time. The age was determined by analyzing small particles of volcanic glass within sandstone and by studying the direction of magnetic minerals within the mudstone of the rock formation.",
      "The results show \"the animals deposited here must have been living close to the end of the Cretaceous,\" the last dinosaur era, said Peppe.",
      "The findings were published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Differences between the dinosaur species found in New Mexico and those found at a site in Montana that were previously dated to the same time frame \"run counter to the idea that dinosaurs were in decline,\" Peppe said.",
      "The fossils previously found at the New Mexico site include Tyrannosaurus rex and a Triceratops-like horned herbivore.",
      "The biggest dinosaur examined in the study was the plant-eating Alamosaurus, which could weigh more than 30 tons and measure about 100 feet long.",
      "\"Nothing illustrates how dinosaurs were thriving up to the very end more than the fact that Alamosaurus, one of the biggest dinosaurs ever - in fact, one of the very biggest animals to ever live on land in the entire history of the Earth - was there to witness the asteroid,\" University of Edinburgh paleontologist and study co-author Steve Brusatte told the Reuters news agency.",
      "\"So not only were sauropods still around when the asteroid hit, they were still thriving, still sublime, still colossal, still glorious,\" Brusatte told Reuters. \"I can imagine the scene: one minute, a jet plane-sized dinosaur was shaking the ground as it walked, the next minute the whole Earth was shaking with the energy unleashed by the asteroid.\"",
      "A research team in 2019 found that the steroid strike ignited a chaotic day of fires, earthquakes, and tsunamis, which led to a prolonged period of global cooling.",
      "Scientists who weren't involved in the study cautioned that evidence found at a single location might not point to a broader trend.",
      "\"This new evidence about these very late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is very exciting,\" said University of Bristol paleontologist Mike Benton, who was not involved in the study. But he added, \"This is just one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur faunas at the time all over North America or all over the world.\"",
      "Although scientists have found dinosaur fossils on every continent, accurately dating them can be a challenge, said paleontologist and study co-author Andrew Flynn of New Mexico State University. Easily datable material, such as carbon, doesn't survive in fossils, so scientists must look for surrounding rocks with precise characteristics that can be used to determine ages.",
      "Further research might help complete the picture of what range of dinosaur species was alive globally on the eve of the asteroid crash, said Flynn.",

      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/reproductive-health-trump-administration-hhs-cuts/",
    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:38:19 -0400",
    "summary": "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" said the head of Maine Family Planning clinics.",
    "story": [
      "In late October, Maine Family Planning announced three rural clinics in northern Maine would close by month's end. These primary care and reproductive health clinics served about 800 patients, many uninsured or on Medicaid.",
      "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" George Hill, the group's president and CEO, told CBS News. \"For thousands of patients, that was their doctor, their lab, and their lifeline.\"",
      "Maine Family Planning's closures are among the first visible signs of what health leaders call the biggest setback to reproductive care in half a century. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Population Affairs, which administers the Title X Family Planning Program, has been effectively shut down. At the same time, Medicaid cuts, the potential lapse of Affordable Care Act subsidies, as well as cuts across programs in the Health Resources and Services Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are eroding the broader safety net.",
      "\"When you cut OPA, HRSA, and Medicaid together, you're removing every backup we have,\" said Clare Coleman, president of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association. \"It's like taking EMTs off the road while closing the emergency rooms.\"",
      "Asked about the cutbacks, HHS press secretary Emily G. Hilliard told CBS News, \"HHS will continue to carry out all of OPA's statutory functions.\"",
      "How the safety net frays",
      "For more than 50 years, Title X has underwritten a national network of over 4,000 clinics providing contraception, pregnancy testing, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, cancer screening, and other primary and preventive care to nearly 3 million low-income or uninsured patients annually. OPA managed roughly $400 million in grants, issued clinical guidance and ensured compliance.",
      "In mid-October, OPA's operations went dark amid federal layoffs that also affected hundreds of CDC staff. \"Under the Biden administration, HHS became a bloated bureaucracy \u2014 expanding its budget by 38 percent and its workforce by 17 percent,\" a spokesperson for the department said at the time, adding, \"HHS continues to eliminate wasteful and duplicative entities, including those inconsistent with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda.\"",
      "According to Jessica Marcella, who led OPA under the Biden administration, the office was previously staffed by 40 to 50 people. Now, she says, only one U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officer remains.",
      "\"The structure to run the nation's family planning program disappeared overnight,\" said Liz Romer, OPA's former chief clinical adviser.",
      "\"This isn't just about government jobs,\" said Coleman. \"It's a patient care crisis. Every safety net program that touches reproductive health is being weakened.\"",
      "A policy linking health, autonomy and opportunity",
      "Created in 1970 under President Richard Nixon and rooted in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, Title X was designed as a cornerstone of preventive public health, not a partisan cause. Nixon called family planning a \"national commitment to give every American the means to plan their families,\" and Congress agreed overwhelmingly across party lines.",
      "Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law at George Washington University, said the program reflected a pivotal shift in how policymakers understood health itself.",
      "\"By the late 1960s, there was a deep appreciation that the ability to time and space pregnancies was absolutely essential to women's and children's health,\" she said. \"Title X represented the idea that reproductive care wasn't a privilege or a moral issue. It was basic health care.\"",
      "UCLA economist Martha Bailey later found that children born after the first federally-funded family-planning programs were 7% less likely to live in poverty, and had household incomes 3% higher, than those born before. Bailey's research, just published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, also showed that when low-income women can access free birth control, unintended pregnancies drop by 16% and abortions drop by 12% within two years.",
      "Those findings underscore what Rosenbaum calls \"one of the great public health achievements of the 20th century \u2014 a program that linked economic opportunity to health and autonomy.\"",
      "That bipartisan foundation and evidence-based mission, Rosenbaum said, make today's unraveling especially striking.",
      "\"What was once common sense, that access to family planning is essential to a functioning health system, has become politically fragile,\" she noted. \"Title X was built for continuity, but it's being undone by neglect.\"",
      "The hidden health risks behind unplanned pregnancies",
      "Family planning is central to maternal and infant health because it gives women the time to optimize medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease before pregnancy, and allows them to safely space out their births.",
      "\"Pregnancy is the ultimate stress test,\" said Dr. Andra James, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who advised the CDC on its contraceptive guidelines. \"It increases the heart's workload by up to 50%. For people with heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension, that stress can be dangerous.\"",
      "Brianna Henderson, a Texas mother, learned this firsthand. Weeks after delivery, she developed peripartum cardiomyopathy, a form of heart failure that can occur during or after pregnancy. She survived. Her sister, who had the same undiagnosed condition, died three months after giving birth to her second child. Those kids are now 12 and 16, and they're growing up without a mom. Their dad and his mother look after the kids now.",
      "\"Contraception has been a life-saving option for me,\" Henderson said.",
      "James and other specialists warn that without CDC-informed guidance on contraceptive safety for complex conditions, clinicians and patients are left without clear, current standards.",
      "What history and the data predict happens next",
      "Title X clinics provide millions of STI tests each year and are often the only cancer screening sites for uninsured women. Cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies will make it even harder for people to afford preventive visits.",
      "\"If these clinics close, we'll see more infections, more unplanned pregnancies, and more maternal deaths, especially among Black, Indigenous, and rural communities,\" said Whitney Rice, an expert on reproductive health at Emory University.",
      "And the geographic gaps are large already. Power to Decide, a nonprofit reproductive rights group, counts more than 19 million women living in \"contraceptive deserts,\" where there's no reasonable access to publicly supported birth control.",
      "\"These are places where the nearest clinic might be 60 or 100 miles away,\" said Power to Decide interim co-CEO Rachel Fey. \"For many families, that distance might as well be impossible.\"",
      "The high price of short-term savings",
      "Each pregnancy averted through Title X saves about $15,000 in public spending on medical and social services, according to an analysis by Power to Decide. The analysis shows that every $1 invested in publicly funded family-planning programs saves roughly $7 in Medicaid costs.",
      "Cutting federal funding for reproductive health services \"isn't saving money. It's wasting it,\" said Brittni Frederiksen, a KFF health economist and former OPA scientist. \"We'll spend far more fixing the problems these cuts create.\"",
      "Supporters of cuts argue federal spending must be reduced and states should set their own priorities.",
      "Strain on the ground",
      "Affirm, Arizona's Title X grantee, oversees a statewide network of clinics that provide family-planning services to more than 33,000 patients each year.",
      "Affirm CEO Br\u00e9 Thomas said the state could lose $6.1 million in Title X funding if federal appropriations expire after March 31, 2026. It's a cut that would reduce access to care across the network. \"That's $6.1 million for Arizona,\" she said. \"That means over 33,000 patients in our state could lose access to services.\"",
      "Thomas noted that two consecutive funding reductions, combined with 11 years of flat federal support and rising healthcare costs, have already strained operations. Without new funding, she warned, clinics may be forced to limit contraceptive options to cheaper methods, reduce preventive care, and risk staff layoffs, especially in rural communities.",
      "\"We're talking about impacts to people's jobs and their ability to access the care they need,\" she said.",
      "Megan Kavanaugh, a scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, underscored those limits.",
      "\"Federally Qualified Health Centers do not have the capacity to absorb the number of patients who will lose care,\" she said, referring to federally funded community-based clinics for underserved populations. \"Some people may find another clinic, but a large share simply won't, and we'll see that reflected in higher rates of unintended pregnancy, untreated infections, and later-stage disease.\"",
      "Hospitals are beginning to absorb the spillover.",
      "\"The safety net is shrinking, and hospitals can't absorb everyone,\" said Dr. Sonya Borrero, a reproductive health expert at the University of Pittsburgh and a former Chief Medical and Scientific Adviser at OPA. \"Wait times will get longer, and preventable problems will rise.\"",
      "Funding frozen, oversight halted",
      "With OPA offline, Title X dollars already awarded can be spent, but no new funds are moving.",
      "\"Most programs can hang on for a few months,\" Romer said. \"By spring, many won't have enough money to stay open.\"",
      "The halt also suspends compliance reviews and technical assistance tied to CDC-aligned guidelines.",
      "Marcella, the former OPA leader, warned of a \"backdoor dismantling.\"",
      "\"If there aren't people to administer the grants, then the administration can later argue the program isn't working and redirect the funds elsewhere,\" she said. \"This is a functional elimination, done quietly.\"",
      "Kavanaugh called the moment \"one more step toward dismantling the public health infrastructure that has supported people's reproductive health for decades.\"",
      "Without staff to move money and guidance, she said, \"that's how a system collapses.\"",
      "What can still be done",
      "According to the National Association of Community Health Centers, Federally Qualified Health Centers can still use HRSA money that was already approved, even during the government shutdown. But no new funding is being released, similar to the freeze on Title X funds. At the same time, HRSA has stopped first-quarter payments for its Title V Maternal and Child Health program, which limits how states can provide preventive care and services for children and young people with special health needs.",
      "Some states \u2014 California, New Mexico, Washington \u2014 are plugging holes with state dollars, and health systems are expanding telehealth, but most jurisdictions cannot replace federal support at scale.",
      "\"Private donors can't replace the federal government,\" Hill said. \"You can't crowdfund your way to a working health system.\"",
      "Congress could restore Title X and rebuild OPA's staffing, but without administrators in place, money can't reach clinics quickly. States have a short window to bridge care by stabilizing Medicaid coverage, shoring up community health centers, and protecting contraceptive access.",
      "\"This isn't a political debate,\" Romer said. \"It's women showing up for care and finding the doors locked.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Thursday he will cut U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods after he sat down with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a high-stakes summit in South Korea in the midst of a months-long trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "\"On the scale from zero to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One while flying back to Washington from the South Korean city of Busan. He called his more than 90-minute session with Xi an \"amazing meeting\" and a \"great success.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters \"we have a deal\" on trade, saying he expects to sign an agreement \"pretty soon,\" though he's likely to renegotiate it in future years. \"A lot of things we brought to finalization\" during Thursday's discussions, the president added, calling Xi a \"tremendous leader of a very powerful country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he decided to lower his overall tariff rate on imports of Chinese goods from 57% to 47%, after promises by Xi to curtail shipments of fentanyl ingredients to the U.S. Levies of 47%\u00a0would still leave China with one of the highest tariff rates the U.S. imposes.",
      "He also told reporters China will resume purchasing U.S. soybeans \"immediately\" after a boycott by China left Americans farmers reeling, and he said a conflict over Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports was \"settled.\" Details on those agreements remain sparse.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he would go to China in April for new talks, and Xi will \"be coming here sometime after that, whether it's in Florida, Palm Beach or Washington, D.C.\"",
      "The two leaders met on a South Korean military base at the tail end of an almost weeklong trip through Asia by Mr. Trump.",
      "Prior to the meeting, Mr. Trump said he has a good relationship with Xi \"but he's a very tough negotiator. That's not good.\"",
      "Xi said trade negotiators from both sides have made progress in addressing \"major concerns\" and he believes the U.S. and China should be \"partners and friends.\"",
      "\"Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye-to-eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then,\" Xi said through an interpreter, though he noted that relations have been \"stable on the whole.\"",
      "China is the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner, behind only Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. buying $438.9 billion in Chinese goods last year, while China bought $143.5 billion in goods from the U.S. But Mr. Trump has pushed for higher tariffs on Chinese imports, both due to fentanyl trafficking and alleged unfair trade practices, sparking a trade war.",
      "The two sides briefly levied massive tit-for-tat tariffs on each other in April, before delaying those levies to buy time for negotiations. In August, Mr. Trump signed an executive action delaying the reinstatement of higher tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days, extending the pause until mid-November.",
      "U.S. and Chinese officials have been holding trade talks for months leading up to Thursday's Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump threatened to\u00a0impose an additional 100% tariff rate\u00a0on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 in retaliation for China's increased export controls on rare earth minerals and magnets, which would bring total tariffs on Chinese imports as high as 155%. China has the vast majority of the world's supply of those raw materials, critical for manufacturing in key technology areas like semiconductors and missiles. Those extra 100% tariffs are \"effectively off the table\" for now,\u00a0Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Bessent said he also expects Mr. Trump and Xi to sign a deal Thursday placing TikTok under majority U.S. ownership, although Chinese-owned ByteDance could still have a minority ownership stake of under 20%.",
      "Defense is another point of tension between China and the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump's first secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he should commit to Taiwan's independence.",
      "\"Xi Jinping is expected to press President Trump for clarity about America's stance toward Taiwan at their meeting this week,\" Pompeo wrote on social media. \"America should oblige \u2014 and affirm our unequivocal commitment to Taiwan's sovereignty and independence from Beijing.\"",
      "But on the trip home, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Xi didn't discuss Taiwan.",
      "Separately, moments before the meeting with Xi began, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social\u00a0that he's directed the Pentagon\u00a0to restart nuclear weapons testing. And the president\u00a0said earlier Wednesday\u00a0that he will allow South Korea, a rival of China's, to develop a nuclear-powered submarine.",
      "The last time Mr. Trump and Xi met in person was on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan in 2019, during Mr. Trump's first term in office, although the two leaders have spoken by phone. The last conversation the White House disclosed between the two men was on Sept. 19.",
      "Busan, known as an educational and cultural center along Korea's southeastern coast, is the second most populous city in South Korea behind its capital, Seoul. The Xi meeting is the final agenda item on Mr. Trump's schedule for his five-day Asia tour, concluding a trip primarily intended to strengthen economic ties and cement trade deals in the South Pacific region.",

    "summary": "A jury found former Sangamon County deputy Sean Grayson guilty of second degree murder for the fatal police shooting of Sonya Massey, but her family said the verdict is a miscarriage of justice.",
    "story": [
      "A jury found former Sangamon County deputy Sean Grayson guilty of second-degree murder for the fatal police shooting of Sonya Massey.",
      "Grayson was charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the 2024 deadly police shooting, and the jury was given the option of convicting him of second-degree murder. They found him not guilty on all three counts of first-degree murder.",
      "The jury alerted the judge that they had reached a verdict around 2 p.m.\u00a0 It was read at 2:28 p.m.",
      "Grayson was stoic as the verdict was read. Afterward, he stood from the table, put his hands to be handcuffed, and was led out of the courtroom through the back door. His sentencing date has been set for Jan. 29 in Sangamon County court.",
      "One of Grayson's family members was seen crying in the courtroom when the verdict was read.",
      "Massey's family, by contrast, was quiet and appeared deflated or upset as the second-degree conviction was handed down. They spoke after court adjourned, and called the conviction a miscarriage of justice.",
      "\"I am fueled by rage right now,\" said Sontae Massey. \"You get an officer who says, 'I'm going to shoot you in the face' and you only get second-degree murder. The justice system did what it's supposed to do; it's not meant for us.\"",
      "Massey's father, James Wilburn, couldn't fathom the idea that his daughter was the aggressor as Grayson's attorneys stated during the trial.",
      "\"Who could've imagined in their wildest dreams that my daughter was the aggressor here,\" Wilburn said. \"Unless we can't believe our lying eyes, he said what he was going to do, and he did it. He did it.\"",
      "CBS News Chicago legal expert Irv Miller said the jury's verdict was not particularly surprising, considering the evidence presented at trial and the fact that the judge gave the option for second degree murder in the first place.",
      "Miller explained that by finding Grayson guilty of second-degree murder, the jury determined that as a police officer he had an unreasonable belief that he was acting in self-defense when he opened fire on Massey. In this case, Miller said, whether or not Grayson's belief he was acting in self-defense was reasonable was pivotal; if a jury had found it was a reasonable belief, he would have been found not guilty. Since the jury found his belief was not reasonable, they found him guilty of second degree murder.",
      "Miller said he expects whatever sentence is handed down, Grayson will be expected to serve at least 50% of it. While probation is an option, Miller said he wouldn't expect that sentence in this case.",
      "Attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci, who represent the Massey family in their civil lawsuit, issued a statement after the verdict, saying in part, \"While we believe Grayson's actions deserved a first-degree conviction, today's verdict is still a measure of justice for Sonya Massey. Accountability has begun, and we now hope the court will impose a meaningful sentence that reflects the severity of these crimes and the life that was lost. We will continue to fight for Sonya's family and for reforms that protect everyone from unlawful use of force.\"",
      "Crump and Romanucci also thanked the Sangamon County State's Attorneys Office and State's Attorney John C. Milhiser for their work on the case.",
      "The jury deliberated\u00a0for more than 11 hours over the course of two days before they reached their verdict. They asked several questions and to see Grayson's previous employment and training history. They also re-watched the body camera footage after closing arguments on Tuesday.",
      "Massey, a 36-year-old unarmed Black woman, called police for help in July 2024 for a possible prowler outside her home.",
      "Inside the home, Grayson said Massey began acting erratically and rebuked him \"in the name of Jesus\" while walking towards a pot of water on her stove. Body cam video from Grayson's partner captured the shooting; Grayson's body camera was not activated for most the call, only turning on shortly after he pulled his weapon.",
      "Massey died of a gunshot wound. Grayson faces three first-degree murder charges.",
      "Dawson Farley, his former partner on that night, testified during the trial that he was not afraid of Massey during the call, but instead feared Grayson. Farley told the jury that, while he was confused after Massey said \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" he never perceived that as a threat. He added he only unholstered his gun because Grayson did.",
      "Grayson took the stand in his own defense. He testified that finding broken windows on her car, her 911 call for help and waiting four minutes for her to answer the phone made him concerned someone else was inside. He also said he believed she may have been \"under the influence of something\" and said she appeared \"scatterbrained.\"",

      "\"There would be nights where I was just driving around the city and I might make eye contact with a transgender person as I'm in the car. It's just like a lightning strike. I thought I was over it, moving past it, and I was getting dumped back in these flashes,\" Wallace said.",
      "Jurors were shown gruesome pictures of bloody crime scenes. Wallace said he never saw the victim's face until after the trial.",
      "\"The first thing I saw was her face and the eyes and the hair and it struck me. This woman that was full of life was so savagely murdered,\" Wallace said.",
      "Across the country, 11 million people report for jury duty each year. Less than half a million will serve on violent criminal cases, including murder. But counseling and mental health services offered to jurors after those verdicts are rare.",
      "Philadelphia Jury Commissioner Patrick Martin wants to change that. He set out to create a program to help jurors handle trauma.",
      "\"I'm pulling regular people off the street \u2014 a deli worker, a plumber, a librarian. They don't know what they're really getting into when they come down for jury service,\" Martin said.",
      "He added, \"The jurors are mine. They're my responsibility. Not just when they get the summons in the mail, but when they go home.\"",
      "Martin partnered with psychologist Michele Pole at West Chester University to come up with a plan. Grad students, who are trained by Pole, offer at least three free support sessions to jurors. They use a technique called psychological first aid.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-today-fomc-meeting/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:53:53 -0400",
    "summary": "The Fed on Wednesday announced its second interest-rate cut of 2025, reducing borrowing costs in a move to spur U.S. hiring.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the central bank might pause before further lowering borrowing costs.",
      "The Fed cut lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.75% and 4%, down from its prior range of 4% to 4.25%. The Fed reduced rates by the same amount in September, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "In a Wednesday afternoon press conference to discuss the decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said another rate cut at its next meeting, set for Dec. 10, \"isn't a foregone conclusion.\" That may disappoint some borrowers and investors, given that the Fed last month had penciled in an additional rate cut for its final meeting of the year.",
      "\"There were strongly differing views on how to proceed in December\" during the central bank's meeting today, Powell said. Those conflicting views mean \"we haven't made a decision about December. I'm saying something in addition here \u2014 that it's not to be seen as a foregone conclusion. In fact, far from it.\"",
      "He added, \"We've cut 50 more basis points in the last two meetings, and there's a sense from some, 'Let's pause here,' and a sense from others, 'Let's go ahead.'\"",
      "Stocks erased modest gains after Powell's comments, with the S&P 500 slipping 0.2% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipping 0.4%.",
      "The central bank's move to ease monetary policy is aimed at shoring up economic growth by lowering borrowing costs, spurring consumer spending and investment by businesses. Although the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has delayed release of the Labor Department's September jobs report, other indicators point to a continued slowdown in hiring. The ADP National Employment Report, for instance, showed private-sector payrolls shrinking by 32,000 last month.",
      "In its policy\u00a0statement on Wednesday, the Fed said \"downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting last month that risks to the labor market are growing.",
      "While Powell said the Fed is watching layoff announcements from large businesses such as Amazon, he added that the weakness in the job market does not appear to be accelerating. His comments indicate that another back-to-back rate cut this year isn't a certainty, financial experts said.",
      "\"The knee-jerk reaction of the markets to the Fed meeting (and press conference) was to sell stocks and bonds, because Chairman Powell said that an additional rate cut in December wasn't a sure thing,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email. Investors \"were negatively surprised that future cuts might be taken off the table.\"",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the panel that sets the Fed's monetary policy, isn't scheduled to meet on interest rates in November.",
      "Data blackout",
      "The near-total blackout on government economic data during the shutdown may complicate the Fed's decision-making, experts said. Typically, Fed officials are able to draw on a host of official reports, ranging from measures of employment growth to inflation markers, as they seek to determine the best path for policy.",
      "\"While today's rate cut and the general direction of future policy remain relatively clear, guidance on the committee's perspective on economic conditions is more necessary than ever,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"A prolonged government shutdown and ongoing tariff negotiations continue to introduce significant uncertainty into the immediate monetary policy outlook.\"",
      "Powell noted that the lack of official economic data may complicate the Fed's December decision, given that the central bank relies on such information to assess the economy.",
      "\"What do you do when you are driving in the fog? You slow down,\" Powell said.",
      "On Wednesday, 10 of the 12 FOMC members voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, with two members objecting. Fed Governor Stephen Miran dissented, preferring a 0.50 percentage point cut, as he did at the September meeting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffry Schmid also dissented, saying he preferred no rate change.",
      "Inflation battle",
      "While the Fed is now focused on weakness in the labor market, its battle against inflation isn't over. The Fed cranked rates higher after consumer prices soared during the pandemic, with inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Because higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, businesses and consumers typically react by paring spending, which dampens demand throughout the economy and cools inflation. Since mid-2022, inflation has receded to an annual rate of 3% as of September, although that remains higher than the Fed's target of a 2% annual pace.",
      "While the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs are starting to trickle through to consumer prices, the impact has been more muted than economists had predicted earlier this year. Some businesses are eating some of the tariff costs, while others stocked up on imports earlier in the year to get ahead of the import duties.",
      "\"Though inflation is still higher than comfortable, the jobs market is holding on to signs of weakness, and their desire to stimulate the economy further is likely to continue outweighing inflation concerns,\" said Steve Rick, chief economist at financial services company TruStage.",

      "Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs companywide on Wednesday (Paramount Skydance owns CBS News.) The rest of the cuts are expected to be made at a later date. In all, 2,000 job reductions amount to about 10% of Paramount's total workforce.",
      "\"These decisions are never made lightly, especially given their effect on our colleagues who have made meaningful contributions to the company,\" CEO David Ellison wrote Wednesday in a memo to employees.",
      "The prospect of job cuts has hovered over Paramount employees for some time. Ellison on Wednesday reiterated that the company has been working to restructure since the completion of its merger in August, and noted that workforce cuts are \"part of that process.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 14:05:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

Its pervasiveness is what stuck out to the team selecting the word of the year, Steve Johnson, director of lexicography for the Dictionary Media Group at IXL Learning, told CBS News.",
      "\"Something that you would have thought would have gone away, it just kept on growing larger and larger, snowballing into kind of like a cultural phenomenon,\" Johnson said.",

      "For most of 2025, the job market was described by economists as \"no hire, no fire\" \u2014 a stretch of time when job seekers faced slim prospects, but workers could count on job security. But that fragile balance may now be shifting, labor experts warn, as mass layoffs at companies like Amazon and UPS signal a possible turning point for the labor market.",
      "Amazon on Tuesday announced 14,000 job cuts, citing a shift toward artificial intelligence, while UPS on the same day said it has reduced its workforce by 48,000 from a year earlier. Paramount Skydance, the owner of CBS News, on Wednesday also announced it is shedding jobs, part of an ongoing effort to cut costs at the entertainment and media company.",
      "Target on Tuesday also notified a state employment agency in Minnesota, where the retailer is based, that it plans to lay off more than 800 workers in January as part of a broader corporate restructuring,\u00a0CBS News Minnesota reported. The retailer announced last week that it would cut 1,800 corporate positions as the chain trims its global workforce by about 8%.",
      "The mass layoffs come as the Federal Reserve scrutinizes the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing concerns about slower hiring\u00a0in announcing the central bank's first interest-rate cut of 2025. The announcements from Amazon and UPS could signal that the Fed has good reason to be worried, experts said.",

      "Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the government shutdown, which means the Fed will make its next interest rate decision tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September.",
      "But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August \u2014 down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows.",
      "On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say.",
      "\"When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-\u00e0-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up,\" said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation.",
      "But, he added, \"These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings.\"",
      "That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of long-term unemployed people, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022.",
      "What's impacting the labor market?",
      "Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to\u00a0trim its human workforce\u00a0as the business becomes more efficient.",
      "\"Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology \u2014 and being on the cutting edge of that technology \u2014 for shifting jobs,\" Challenger said.",
      "About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed.",
      "Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as shipping declines from Amazon, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS.",
      "On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside.",
      "In the meantime, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the job market, according to recent\u00a0CBS News polling. About 52% of Americans describe the labor market as \"bad,\" up seven percentage points from April, the poll found.",
      "\"We are moving more into a time where job security might be more precarious,\" Challenger said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/grand-egyptian-museum-opening/",
    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 12:20:46 -0400",
    "summary": "The Grand Egyptian Museum has taken 30 years to become a reality, but it is finally set to open its doors, with an equally grand opening ceremony.",
    "story": [
      "Cairo - Egypt's government will host dozens of foreign leaders and dignitaries on Saturday as it holds an official opening ceremony for the Grand Egyptian Museum, a $1 billion project decades in the making that was plagued by multiple delays and a ballooning of the budget.",
      "The GEM is one of the largest museums in the world, and the largest dedicated to a single civilization: ancient Egypt. Its subject matter spans some 7,000 years, from prehistory to the end of the Greek and Roman eras around 400 A.D.",
      "The initial cost for the more than 5-million-square-foot, triangular-themed structure about a mile from the iconic pyramids of Giza was estimated at $500 million, but the final price tag was more than double that. Costing over $1 billion, the project was funded through Egyptian resources and international cooperation.",
      "In front of the main entrance stands the imposing 53-foot-high Hanging Obelisk, the only such structure in the world. The obelisk itself is about 3,500 years old, but it sits suspended overhead on a modern structure with a glass floor, so visitors can peer up and view its ancient inscriptions from an angle never before possible.",
      "Beyond is the Grand Staircase, with 108 steps bringing people up the equivalent of six floors to the main galleries, with colossal statues on view the whole way up.",
      "The GEM has 12 primary exhibition halls, covering about 194,000 square feet.",
      "The number of artifacts on display has nearly doubled initial expectations thanks to Egypt's wealth of antiquities, with officials saying about 100,000 items will be housed in the halls.",
      "To put that in perspective, if a visitor were to spend one minute looking at each artifact on display in the museum, it would take almost 70 sleepless days to view the entire collection.",
      "The museum's triangular architecture radiates outward from its entrance toward the three main pyramids of Giza, aligning perfectly with their positions. Its walls and sloping ceilings follow the same lines, rising toward the pyramids' highest points, but not exceeding the height of the ancient structures, out of respect for their builders.",
      "The museum's interior offers stunning panoramic views of the pyramids. The concept may sound simple, but it required a significant reshaping of the local topography, including the excavation and removal of some 79 million cubic feet of sand, which took workers seven months.",
      "King Ramses II was there first",
      "In the entrance courtyard of the GEM, stands a massive, 3,200-year-old statue of King Ramses II. The statue was moved in 2006 from a busy square in central Cairo to a site near the Great Pyramids, where it stood awaiting the new landmark museum's construction.",
      "The 83-ton statue's journey took 10 hours, processing slowly through the streets of Egypt under heavy security as people watched on TV.",
      "Later Ramses was moved to a new permanent home, about 400 yards away, and the museum was built around it.",
      "King Tut's complete collection",
      "The GEM's main attraction, it could be argued, is the complete collection of the famous King Tutankhamun, the golden boy.",
      "All 5,398 items from the tomb of the 13th pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of ancient Egypt, who ruled from around 1333 to 1323 B.C., will be displayed together in one place for the first time since they were discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.",
      "The new showroom is six times the size of the one that previously housed much of the Tut collection, at the old Egyptian Museum in central Cairo.",
      "King Khufu's Boats",
      "The GEM also boasts the King Khufu's Boats Museum, showing the 4,500-year-old the boats that were designed to be used in the journey to the afterlife.",
      "The two royal boats were discovered in 1954 near the Pyramid of Khufu. It took experts more than 10 years to reassemble the first boat. It is now fully reconstructed and was moved to the museum in 2021. Visitors of the museum can also view the conservation work underway on the second one.",
      "Scholars believe they were either used in Khufu's funeral procession or they were intended for his journey with the sun god Re in the afterlife.",
      "The long road to the Grand Egyptian Museum",
      "The idea for a grand museum on this site in Egypt dates back more than 32 years. The government first allocated 117 acres for the project at the location in 1992.",
      "At the very beginning of 2002, Egypt launched a massive international architectural competition to find a winning design for the museum. A total of 2,227 architects from 103 countries applied to submit designs, and by August of that year, 1,550 from 83 countries had submitted conceptual drawings.",
      "A couple months later officials had whittled the options down to only 20 designs to put forward for a second stage. In July 2003, the prize - and the massive contract - was awarded to the Irish architectural firm Heneghan Peng.",
      "The plan was originally for the museum to open in 2010, but a series of events including financial crises, political uprisings, the COVID-19 pandemic and regional wars delayed the curtain raising.",
      "A government spokesperson said the opening ceremony would draw an unprecedented number of world leaders, with as many as 40 heads of state, including royalty, expected to attend, along with a large number of other senior officials from around the world, though no names have been confirmed.",
      "Egyptian officials hope the new museum will boost the country's tourism industry, and with it, the still-struggling economy. They have predicted that the GEM will attract some 5 million visitors per year.",

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa\u00a0brought heavy rains and gusty winds to the Bahamas early Thursday after hitting eastern Cuba and Jamaica, and was beginning to eye Bermuda, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.",
      "A hurricane warning was in effect for Bermuda.",
      "Melissa was\u00a0one of the strongest hurricanes\u00a0ever recorded in the Atlantic basin when it reached Jamaica on Tuesday afternoon as a Category 5 storm.",
      "Melissa's forecast and path",
      "The storm's wind speeds dropped after its landfalls in Jamaica and Cuba to 105 mph early Thursday, making it a Category 2 hurricane, the center said.",
      "Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States.",
      "In its latest update Thursday morning, the hurricane center said Melissa's core was about 515 miles southwest of Bermuda.",
      "Melissa was hurrying north-northeast at 24 mph. Hurricane force winds extended out up to 75 miles from Melissa's center and tropical storm-force winds extended out up to 220 miles, the NHC said.",
      "On the forecast track, the center of Melissa \"is expected to pass to the northwest of Bermuda later today and tonight,\" the center said. \"Little change in strength is expected today, and a weakening trend is likely to begin on Friday.\"",
      "Forecasters said tropical storm conditions would begin in Bermuda later in the day on Thursday, followed by hurricane conditions as Melissa gets closer to the island at night.",
      "The storm made landfall in Cuba early Wednesday as a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph. Before that, it slammed Jamaica's southwestern coast Tuesday afternoon as a Category 5, packing maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, the hurricane center said. Hurricanes reach Category 5 \u2014 the top of\u00a0the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale\u00a0\u2014 when their winds hit 157 mph.",
      "Melissa moved extremely slowly over Jamaica, which made its destruction worse.",
      "The strongest previous hurricane to pound Jamaica was Gilbert in 1988, which killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.",
      "The crew of a U.S. Air Force 403rd Wing \"Hurricane Hunters\" flight ran into severe turbulence as it approached Melissa's eyewall on Monday and had to return to their base in Florida, but they did capture stunning images of the center of the storm. Another flight on Tuesday to gather data on the hurricane also had to turn back after hitting strong turbulence.",
      "Rainfall forecasts",
      "Another inch of rain is possible on the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos, the NHC said, bringing the highest total to 10 inches in all for the southeast Bahamas and up to 4 inches across the Turks and Caicos, and any residual flooding should be waning.",
      "Climate change has been fueling the storm",
      "Above-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures, made worse by climate change, helped Melissa rapidly intensify into a major hurricane, according to climate scientists.",
      "\"That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now \u2014 around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal,\" Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading in the U.K., told The Associated Press. \"And it's not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm.\"",
      "Stronger winds, heavier rainfall and higher sea level rise will make storm surge more intense.",
      "Preliminary data from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists monitoring the effects of climate change, suggests that climate change has increased Melissa's wind speed by 10 mph.",
      "\"Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification,\" Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, told the AP.",

      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sweeping sanctions on members of an alleged Mexico-based human smuggling network that it says trafficked people from four continents using yachts, hotels and cartel connections, a move officials say underscores the Trump administration's intensifying strategy to treat migrant trafficking schemes as a direct threat to national security.",
      "The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) targeted the Bhardwaj Human Smuggling Organization, its alleged ringleader Vikrant Bhardwaj plus three accomplices and 16 affiliated entities on Thursday. The sanctions will freeze any U.S. property or interests tied to the sprawling group and bar U.S. persons from conducting financial transactions with the alleged criminal organization.",
      "According to Treasury officials, the Bhardwaj HSO constructed a \"sophisticated\" smuggling pipeline that tapped its own collection of yachts and marinas, as well as hostels, hotels and other front operations across Mexico, India and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Thousands of migrants from Europe, the Middle East, South America, and Asia \u2014 including some from countries deemed national security risks \u2014 were allegedly flown or sailed into Mexico, then routed north toward the U.S. border over land, a dangerous passage dubbed the \"Tapachula-Cancun-Mexicali corridor.\"",
      "Officials allege the group's services cost migrants thousands of dollars apiece, and the group solicited operational support from individuals employed by the notorious Sinaloa Cartel.",
      "Investigators identified a web of corporate fronts allegedly controlled or used by the group, spanning so-called tourism companies in Mexico to real estate and hospitality firms in India and the UAE, as well as a Mexican supermarket to hide illicit revenue streams.",
      "The Treasury sanctioned three other associates: Jose German Valadez Flores and Jorge Alejandro Mendoza Villegas are accused of facilitating the trafficking ring by bribing officials at airports and ports of entry, while a third, Indu Rani, is identified as Bhardwaj's wife and the lead on logistical operations.",
      "\"Today's action, in collaboration with our law enforcement partners, disrupts this network's ability to smuggle dangerous illegal aliens into the United States,\" Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley said in a statement to CBS News. \"The Trump administration will continue to target and dismantle human smuggling organizations that value profit over human life.\"",
      "In recent years, U.S. authorities have expanded the use of sanctions tools \u2014 originally conceived for targeting terrorism or narcotics networks \u2014 to confront human smuggling and transnational criminal organizations.",
      "In June 2023, Biden-era Treasury officials targeted the Hernandez Salas smuggling network for facilitating thousands of migrants and laundering proceeds. Later that year, OFAC sanctioned the Mexican-based Malas Ma\u00f1as trafficking network, linking human smuggling operations to narcotics trafficking and cartel business.",
      "The Treasury's latest move likens the Bhardwaj HSO to full-blown national security threats, akin to drug cartels or terrorist syndicates.",
      "To bolster enforcement, the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) recently issued an alert urging U.S. banks to look out for bulk cash smuggling and repatriation patterns tied to Mexican-based criminal organizations.",
      "Still, Mexican officials have publicly challenged U.S. evidence prompting sanctions under the Trump administration, even questioning past designations connected to Mexican banks for alleged ties to cartel money laundering.",
      "In June 2025, the U.S. Treasury targeted commercial banks CiBanco and Intercam, and the brokerage firm Vector Casa de Bolsa, accusing them of moving money on behalf of cartels and their fentanyl supply chain. Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, expressed frustration at the time and publicly requested that the U.S. Treasury \"send proof, if they have it, so we can accompany them in the process.\"",
      "This time around, Treasury officials tell CBS News the latest sanctioning effort against the Bhardwaj HSO was coordinated with Mexico's financial intelligence unit \u2013 the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera (UIF) \u2013 as well as agents from Homeland Security Investigations and the Drug Enforcement Administration.",

      "Communities across the Caribbean are reeling in the wake of Hurricane Melissa, which ripped through Jamaica, Cuba and Hispaniola, the island comprising Haiti and the Dominican Republic, this week.",

      "Side-by-side aerial photographs show the southwestern Jamaican fishing village of White House and the nearby town of Black River before and after Melissa slammed into the island. Each pair captures a once vibrant-looking town reduced to dirt and rubble.",
      "Melissa struck Jamaica on Tuesday \u2014 its first landfall of multiple \u2014 as an extremely powerful Category 5 hurricane. It was the strongest storm to hit Jamaica in the island's record-keeping history, in addition to one of the strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. That was due to its winds and pressure, which are two primary markers of intensity.",
      "The hurricane's maximum winds had reached a formidable 185 mph when it collided with the southwestern coast of Jamaica. Although their speed dipped somewhat in the hours after landfall, Melissa's winds remained well above the 157-mph threshold that the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale sets to determine the minimum criteria for a Category 5 storm.",
      "At least four people died in Jamaica as a result of the storm, said Desmond McKenzie, a minister of local government, in a statement released Wednesday. McKenzie said police found their bodies washed up by flood waters and determined that all four were \"by all indications, direct victims of the Hurricane.\"",
      "More than 25,000 people were still crowded in shelters on the island on Wednesday, after the storm temporarily displaced some residents and left others homeless. Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaica's education minister, said 77% of the island was without power the morning after the storm, while Richard Thompson, acting director-general of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management told the Nationwide News Network radio station that officials were facing challenges as they attempted to perform damage assessments, because of \"a total communication blackout\" in certain areas.",
      "Outside of Jamaica, authorities have confirmed at least 23 deaths in Haiti and at least one death in the Dominican Republic as a result of the hurricane. The storm was moving away from the Bahamas on Thursday morning and headed toward Bermuda, according to the National Hurricane Center.",

    "story": [
      "An 80-year-old cruise passenger has been found dead on a Great Barrier Reef island, a day after she was accidentally abandoned there by the ship's crew.",
      "The passenger's daughter Katherine Rees on Thursday accused the cruise company Coral Expeditions of a \"failure of care and common sense\" that left her mother Suzanne Rees to die alone.",
      "Suzanne Rees, a Sydney resident, was on the second day of a cruise circumnavigating Australia when she disembarked the Coral Adventurer last Saturday at Lizard Island. She planned to hike with other passengers to a mountain lookout.",
      "The ship left the resort island around five hours before reporting her missing late on Saturday, officials said.",
      "\"We are shocked and saddened that the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island after an organized excursion without my Mum,\" Katherine Rees, who also lives in Sydney, said in a statement.",
      "\"From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense. We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and Mum felt ill on the hill climb. She was asked to head down, unescorted. Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count. At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, Mum died, alone,\" the daughter added.",
      "Rob Siganto, who was moored near Lizard Island over the weekend, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. that close to midnight, a search helicopter arrived at the island.",
      "\"We heard the conversation on the radio. They were looking for someone and the last known location was halfway up the hill,\" Siganto told the ABC.",
      "The helicopter crew spotted Suzanne Rees' body the next day about 55 yards off the hiking trail to the lookout, The Australian newspaper reported.",
      "She appeared to have fallen from a cliff or slope, the newspaper said.",
      "Katherine Rees said she hoped a coroner's inquiry would \"find out what the company should have done that might have saved Mum's life.\"",
      "Police said in a statement a coroner would investigate the \"non-suspicious death.\" The coroner's court also confirmed the death had been referred for investigation.",
      "\"Deeply sorry that this has occurred\"",
      "Coral Expeditions chief executive Mark Fifield said his company was fully cooperating with official investigations into the death. He said it would be inappropriate to comment while those investigations were underway.",
      "\"We have expressed our heartfelt condolences to the Rees family and remain deeply sorry that this has occurred,\" Fifield said in a statement. \"We continue to provide our full support to the Rees family through this difficult time.\"",
      "The Coral Adventurer accommodates up to 120 guests and some rooms feature private balconies, according to the company's website.",
      "The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, a safety regulator, is investigating why Rees may not have been accounted for when passengers were boarding at Lizard Island.",
      "The authority also said it would meet the ship's crew when it is due to dock in Darwin later this week, BBC News reported.",
      "The tragedy is also being investigated by a workplace safety watchdog.",
      "Rees was first noticed missing when she didn't appear in the ship's dining room for dinner, the newspaper said.",
      "The cruise ship returned to Lizard Island early Sunday morning.",
      "Incidents like this are rare, and cruise ships have systems to record which passengers are embarking or disembarking, Harriet Mallinson, cruise editor of travel website Sailawaze, told the BBC.",
      "\"Sneaking ashore or [back] onboard just isn't an option,\" she said.",
      "Australia's safety standards for its Great Barrier Reef tourism industry came under intense scrutiny after American couple Tom and Eileen Lonergan were abandoned at sea during a group scuba dive in 1998. The tour boat crew didn't realize they were missing until two days later. The Lonergans' bodies were never found.",

    "summary": "Five more people have been arrested in the investigation into the theft of crown jewels from the Louvre Museum\u200b, but the treasures remain missing, authorities say.",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 Five more people have been arrested in the investigation into the theft of crown jewels from the Louvre Museum, but the treasures remain missing, the Paris prosecutor announced Thursday.",
      "The five were detained late Wednesday night in Paris and the Paris region, Prosecutor Laure Beccuau told RTL radio.",
      "One is suspected of being part of the four-person team that robbed the Louvre's Apollo Gallery in broad daylight Oct. 19, the prosecutor said.",
      "She said the DNA-linked suspect was \"one of the objectives of the investigators \u2014 we had him in our sights.\" Others taken into custody, she said, \"may be able to inform us about how the events unfolded,\" but she did not release their identities or other details.",
      "Two earlier suspects, men aged 34 and 39 from Aubervilliers, north of Paris, were charged Wednesday with theft and criminal conspiracy after nearly 96 hours in custody. Beccuau said both gave \"minimalist\" statements and \"partially admitted\" their involvement.",
      "For now, Beccuau said, there is no evidence of insider help among Louvre staff, though investigators are not ruling out a wider network beyond the four seen on security footage.",
      "The latest arrests still did not help uncover the stolen jewelry, Beccuau said.",
      "It took thieves less than eight minutes to steal the jewels valued at 88 million euros, or $102 million, shocking the world. The robbers forced open a window, cut into cases with power tools and fled with eight pieces of the French crown jewels, including a diamond-and-emerald necklace that Napoleon Bonaparte gave to Empress Marie Louise as a wedding gift.",
      "But master jeweler and Parisian gem appraiser  Stephen Portier told CBS News the thieves will struggle to sell the gems.",
      "\"The whole world knows about this robbery. Dealers will have pictures of every single piece up in their offices,\" he said. \"So if they think they're being offered diamonds from the Louvre ... they will ask some hard questions. And contact the police.\"",

    "story": [
      "A massive police raid on a drug gang embedded in low-income neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro that left at least 119 people dead drew protests for excessive force Wednesday and calls for Rio's governor to resign.",
      "Families of the dead decried what they described as executions by police, while the state government hailed a successful operation against a powerful criminal group that has taken over large swaths of the city.",
      "Dozens of favelas residents gathered in front of the state's government headquarters shouting \"assassins!\" and waving Brazilian flags stained with red paint, a day after Rio's deadliest raid and hours after families and residents laid dozens of dead bodies on a street in one of the targeted communities to show the magnitude of the operation.",
      "BBC News verified several videos showing dozens of bodies laid out in a row in a market area of Rio, in its northern Penha district.",
      "Questions quickly arose about the death count and the state of the bodies, with reports of disfigurement and knife wounds. Brazil's Supreme Court, prosecutors and lawmakers asked Rio state Gov. Claudio Castro to provide detailed information about the operation.",
      "\"This was a massacre,\" said Barbara Barbosa, a domestic worker from the Penha complex of favelas, one of the two huge communities targeted in the police operation. She said her son was killed in a prior operation in Penha.",
      "\"Do we have a death sentence? Stop killing us,\" said activist Rute Sales, 56. Many residents came from Penha in Rio's poor, northern zone to the imposing Guanabara Palace on motorbikes.",
      "The toll of 115 suspects and four policemen killed was an increase over what authorities originally said were 60 suspects dead in Tuesday's raid by about 2,500 police and soldiers in the favelas of Penha and Complexo de Alemao.",
      "Felipe Curi, Rio state police secretary, told a news conference that bodies of additional suspects were found in a wooded area where he said they had worn camouflage while battling with security forces. He said local residents had removed clothing and equipment from the bodies, in what would be investigated as evidence tampering.",
      "\"These individuals were in the woods, equipped with camouflage clothing, vests and weapons. Now many of them appeared wearing underwear or shorts, with no equipment, as if they had come through a portal and changed clothes,\" Curi said.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, in the neighborhood of Penha, residents had surrounded many of the bodies \u2014 collected in trucks and displayed in a main square \u2014 and shouted \"massacre\" and \"justice\" before forensic authorities arrived to retrieve the remains.",
      "\"They can take them to jail, why kill them like this? Lots of them were alive and calling for help,\" resident Elisangela Silva Santos, 50, said during the gathering in Penha. \"Yes they're traffickers, but they're human.\"",
      "\"They slit my son's throat\"",
      "A day after the police operation paralyzed the city, residents of the Complexo da Penha favela recovered dozens of bodies from a forest on its outskirts, including one that was decapitated, AFP journalists witnessed.",
      "\"They slit my son's throat, cut his neck, and hung the head from a tree like a trophy,\" said Raquel Tomas, the mother of the 19-year-old who was found decapitated.",
      "\"They executed my son without giving him a chance to defend himself. He was murdered,\" she told AFP, her voice shaking.",
      "\"Everyone deserves a second chance. During an operation, police should do their job, arrest suspects, but not execute them,\" Tomas added.",
      "Lawyer Albino Pereira Neto, who represents three families that lost relatives, told AFP some of the bodies bore \"burn marks\" and that a number of those killed had been tied up.",
      "Some were \"murdered in cold blood,\" he said.",
      "\"We saw executed people\"",
      "The state government said some 90 rifles and more than a ton of drugs were seized.",
      "Police and soldiers had launched the raid in helicopters, armored vehicles and on foot, targeting the Red Command gang. They drew gunfire and other retaliation from gang members, sparking scenes of chaos across the city on Tuesday. Schools in the affected areas shuttered, a local university canceled classes and roads were blocked with buses used as barricades.",
      "Rafael Soares, a journalist covering crime in Rio,\u00a0told BBC News Brasil\u00a0that the Red Command had been on the offensive in Rio in recent years, reclaiming territory it had lost to its rivals, First Capital Command.",
      "Many shops remained closed Wednesday morning in Penha, where local activist Raull Santiago said he was part of a team that found about 15 bodies before dawn.",
      "\"We saw executed people: shot in the back, shots to the head, stab wounds, people tied up. This level of brutality, the hatred that is spread \u2014 there's no other way to describe it except as a massacre,\" Santiago said.",
      "Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered Castro to provide information about the police operation and scheduled a hearing with the state governor and the heads of the military and civil police next Monday in Rio.",
      "The Senate's commission for human rights said it was asking for clarifications from the Rio state government. Meanwhile, Rio prosecutors requested that Castro provide detailed information about the operation and proof that there was no less harmful means of achieving its objectives.",
      "And the federal public prosecutor's office asked the Forensic Medical Institute to ensure that autopsy reports contain full descriptions and photographic and radiographic documentation of all injuries.",
      "Castro said on Tuesday that Rio was at war against \"narco-terrorism,\" a term that echoed the Trump administration in its campaign against drug smuggling in Latin America.",
      "On Wednesday, Castro called the operation a \"success,\" apart from the deaths of the four police officers.",
      "Rio's state government said that the suspects who had been killed had resisted police.",
      "Rio has been the scene of lethal police raids for decades. In March 2005, some 29 people were killed in Rio's Baixada Fluminense region, while in May 2021, 28 were killed in the Jacarezinho favela.",
      "But the scale and lethality of Tuesday's operation are unprecedented. Non-governmental organizations and the U.N. human rights body quickly raised concerns over the high number of reported fatalities and called for investigations.",
      "\"We fully understand the challenges of having to deal with violent and well-organized groups such as Red Command,\" said U.N. Human Rights Spokesperson Marta Hurtado said.",
      "But Brazil must \"break this cycle of extreme brutality and ensure that law enforcement operations comply with international standards regarding the use of force,\" she said, adding that the body was calling for full-fledged policing reform.",
      "Late on Wednesday, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said on X that he had instructed the justice minister and director-general of Federal Police to meet Castro for a meeting in Rio.",
      "Brazil cannot accept that organized crime \"continues to destroy families, oppress residents, and spread drugs and violence across cities,\" he said.",
      "The operation's stated objectives were capturing leaders and limiting the territorial expansion of the Red Command gang, which has increased its control over favelas in recent years.",
      "Gang members allegedly targeted police with at least one drone. Rio de Janeiro's state government shared a video on X of what appeared to show a drone firing a projectile from the sky.",
      "\"Drones dropping bombs is now a trend used by heavily armed criminal groups,\" Carlos Solar from the Royal United Services Institute told BBC News.",
      "Rio \"alone in this war\"",
      "Castro, from the conservative opposition Liberal Party, said Tuesday that Rio was \"alone in this war.\" He said the federal government should be providing more support to combat crime \u2014- in a swipe at the administration of Lula's leftist administration.",
      "His comments were challenged by the Justice Ministry, which said it had responded to requests from Rio's state government to deploy national forces in the state, renewing their presence 11 times.",
      "Gleisi Hoffmann, the Lula administration's liaison with the parliament, agreed that more coordinated action was needed but pointed to a recent crackdown on money laundering as an example of the federal government's action on organized crime.",
      "Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski said it was clearly an extremely bloody and violent operation.",
      "\"We should reflect on whether this kind of action is compatible with the Democratic Rule of Law that governs us all,\" he told journalists on Wednesday.",
      "Criminal gangs have expanded their presence across Brazil in recent years, including in the Amazon rainforest.",
      "Roberto Uch\u00f4a, from the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety think-tank, said that criminal gangs have strengthened despite these kinds of operations, suggesting that they are inefficient.",
      "\"Killing more than 100 people like this won't help decrease the Red Command's expansion. The dead will soon be replaced,\" Uch\u00f4a said.",

      "He also told reporters China will resume purchasing U.S. soybeans \"immediately\" after a boycott by China left Americans farmers reeling, and he said a conflict over Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports was \"settled.\" Details on those agreements remain sparse.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he would go to China in April for new talks, and Xi will \"be coming here sometime after that, whether it's in Florida, Palm Beach or Washington, D.C.\"",
      "The two leaders met on a South Korean military base at the tail end of an almost weeklong trip through Asia by Mr. Trump.",
      "Prior to the meeting, Mr. Trump said he has a good relationship with Xi \"but he's a very tough negotiator. That's not good.\"",
      "Xi said trade negotiators from both sides have made progress in addressing \"major concerns\" and he believes the U.S. and China should be \"partners and friends.\"",
      "\"Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye-to-eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then,\" Xi said through an interpreter, though he noted that relations have been \"stable on the whole.\"",
      "China is the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner, behind only Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. buying $438.9 billion in Chinese goods last year, while China bought $143.5 billion in goods from the U.S. But Mr. Trump has pushed for higher tariffs on Chinese imports, both due to fentanyl trafficking and alleged unfair trade practices, sparking a trade war.",
      "The two sides briefly levied massive tit-for-tat tariffs on each other in April, before delaying those levies to buy time for negotiations. In August, Mr. Trump signed an executive action delaying the reinstatement of higher tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days, extending the pause until mid-November.",
      "U.S. and Chinese officials have been holding trade talks for months leading up to Thursday's Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump threatened to\u00a0impose an additional 100% tariff rate\u00a0on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 in retaliation for China's increased export controls on rare earth minerals and magnets, which would bring total tariffs on Chinese imports as high as 155%. China has the vast majority of the world's supply of those raw materials, critical for manufacturing in key technology areas like semiconductors and missiles. Those extra 100% tariffs are \"effectively off the table\" for now,\u00a0Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Bessent said he also expects Mr. Trump and Xi to sign a deal Thursday placing TikTok under majority U.S. ownership, although Chinese-owned ByteDance could still have a minority ownership stake of under 20%.",
      "Defense is another point of tension between China and the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump's first secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he should commit to Taiwan's independence.",
      "\"Xi Jinping is expected to press President Trump for clarity about America's stance toward Taiwan at their meeting this week,\" Pompeo wrote on social media. \"America should oblige \u2014 and affirm our unequivocal commitment to Taiwan's sovereignty and independence from Beijing.\"",
      "But on the trip home, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Xi didn't discuss Taiwan.",
      "Separately, moments before the meeting with Xi began, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social\u00a0that he's directed the Pentagon\u00a0to restart nuclear weapons testing. And the president\u00a0said earlier Wednesday\u00a0that he will allow South Korea, a rival of China's, to develop a nuclear-powered submarine.",
      "The last time Mr. Trump and Xi met in person was on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan in 2019, during Mr. Trump's first term in office, although the two leaders have spoken by phone. The last conversation the White House disclosed between the two men was on Sept. 19.",
      "Busan, known as an educational and cultural center along Korea's southeastern coast, is the second most populous city in South Korea behind its capital, Seoul. The Xi meeting is the final agenda item on Mr. Trump's schedule for his five-day Asia tour, concluding a trip primarily intended to strengthen economic ties and cement trade deals in the South Pacific region.",

      "Hurricane Melissa has left dozens dead and widespread destruction across Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba, as it continues to threaten the Bahamas and Bermuda.",
      "The storm was bringing damaging winds, flooding rains and dangerous storm surge to the Bahamas on Wednesday night, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said, and residents should remain sheltered.",
      "Melissa made landfall over eastern Cuba early Wednesday, near the city of Chivirico, as an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 3 storm, the hurricane center said. On Tuesday, it\u00a0pummeled Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph.",
      "On Wednesday night, Melissa's core was about 105 miles east-northeast of the central Bahamas and about 800 miles southwest of Bermuda, according to the hurricane center. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, making it a Category 2 storm, and was moving northeast at about 21 mph.",
      "It was expected to continue moving over the southeast or central Bahamas Wednesday night and pass near Bermuda late Thursday, the hurricane center said.",
      "Officials across the parts of the Caribbean already hit by Melissa were assessing the storm's impacts. At least 23 people have died in Haiti and 13 are missing, the country's Civil Protection Agency said in a statement. At least four deaths were reported in Jamaica, and one in the Dominican Republic.",
      "Jamaica rushes to assess the damage",
      "In Jamaica, more than 25,000 people were packed into shelters Wednesday and more streamed in throughout the day after the storm ripped roofs off their homes and left them temporarily homeless. Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaica's education minister, said 77% of the island was without power.",
      "Outages complicated assessing the damage because of \"a total communication blackout\" in areas, Richard Thompson, acting director-general of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, told the Nationwide News Network radio station.",
      "Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a statement that teams are working to rescue people and bring relief where it's needed the most.",
      "\"Recovery will take time, but the government is fully mobilized,\" he said. \"Relief supplies are being prepared, and we are doing everything possible to restore normalcy quickly.\"",
      "Officials in Black River, Jamaica, a coastal town of approximately 5,000 people in the southwestern part of the island, pleaded for aid at a news conference Wednesday.",
      "\"Catastrophic is a mild term based on what we are observing,\" Mayor Richard Solomon said.",
      "Solomon said the local rescue infrastructure had been demolished by the storm. The hospital, police units and emergency services were inundated by floods and unable to conduct emergency operations. The storm also destroyed the facility where relief supplies were being stored.",
      "In southwest Jamaica, David Muschette, 84, sat among the rubble of his roofless house. He said he lost everything as he pointed to his wet clothes and furniture strewn across the grass while part of his roof partially blocked the road.",
      "\"I need help,\" he begged.",
      "The government said it hopes to reopen Jamaica's airports as early as Thursday to ensure quick distribution of emergency relief supplies.",
      "The United States is sending rescue and response teams to assist in recovery efforts in the Caribbean, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said\u00a0in a social media post. He said government officials were coordinating with leadership in Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas.",
      "\"Our prayers are with the people of the Caribbean,\" he wrote.",
      "St. Elizabeth Police Superintendent Coleridge Minto told Nationwide News Network on Wednesday that authorities have found at least four bodies in southwest Jamaica. One death was reported in the west when a tree fell on a baby, state minister Abka Fitz-Henley told Nationwide News Network.",
      "Before landfall, Melissa had already been blamed for three deaths in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic.",
      "Cuba rides out the storm",
      "People in the eastern Cuban province of Santiago de Cuba began clearing debris around the collapsed walls of their homes on Wednesday after Melissa made landfall in the region hours earlier.",
      "\"Life is what matters,\" Alexis Ramos, a 54-year-old fisherman, said as he surveyed his destroyed home and shielded himself from the intermittent rain with a yellow raincoat. \"Repairing this costs money, a lot of money.\"",
      "Local media showed images of the Juan Bruno Zayas Clinical Hospital with severe damage: glass scattered across the floor, waiting rooms in ruins and masonry walls crumpled on the ground.",
      "\"It has been a very complex early morning,\" President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel wrote on X. \"As soon as conditions allow, we will begin the recovery. We are ready.\"",
      "The hurricane could worsen Cuba's severe economic crisis, which has already led to prolonged power blackouts along with fuel and food shortages.",
      "Cuba's National Institute of Hydraulic Resources reported accumulated rainfall of 15 inches in Charco Redondo and 14 inches in Las Villas Reservoir.",
      "Moving toward the Bahamas",
      "Melissa began affecting the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday, Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, said. Authorities in the Bahamas were evacuating dozens of people from the archipelago's southeast corner ahead of Melissa's arrival.",
      "\"The storm is growing in size,\" Brennan said, noting that tropical storm-force winds now extend almost 200 miles from the center.",
      "Melissa's center is forecast to move through the southeastern Bahamas later Wednesday, generating up to 7 feet of storm surge in the area. By late Thursday, Melissa is expected to pass just west of Bermuda.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military carried out another strike on an alleged \"narco-trafficking vessel\" in the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday, killing four people, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said \u2014 marking at least the 15th boat to be hit in the Trump administration's two-month-long campaign of strikes that have killed more than 60 people.",
      "Hegseth posted a video of a boat strike on X. He said the strike was conducted in international waters, and alleged that the boat was operated by an unnamed designated terrorist organization. He said no U.S. forces were harmed.",
      "The military began striking alleged drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean Sea early last month, and expanded the operations to the Eastern Pacific in recent weeks. In some, but not all, cases, the Trump administration has said the boats were linked to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "The administration has vowed to continue carrying out the strikes, arguing the U.S. is in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels and gangs in Latin America, many of which the U.S. has designated as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "\"The Western Hemisphere is no longer a safe haven for narco-terrorists bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans,\" Hegseth wrote Wednesday on X. \"The Department of War will continue to hunt them down and eliminate them wherever they operate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the possibility of strikes on land-based targets, saying last week, \"The land is going to be next.\"",
      "The campaign has drawn pushback from some lawmakers\u00a0who want more evidence that the targets were actually smuggling drugs and warn that it could draw the U.S. into a conflict in the region. Congress has not authorized the strikes, though the Trump administration argues it doesn't need permission from the legislature.",
      "Venezuela and Colombia have also expressed outrage over the strikes, which are part of a broader military buildup in the Caribbean, with several U.S. ships and thousands of troops deploying to the region.",
      "The administration has heaped pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of partnering with drug traffickers \u2014 a charge he denies.

      "Footage on social media showed fire and smoke rising from the two favelas as gunfire rang out.

      "Suspected gang members blocked roads in northern and southeastern Rio in response to the raid, local media reported. At least 70 buses were commandeered to be used in the blockades, causing significant damage, the city's bus organization Rio Onibus said.",

      "\"What's different about today's operation is the magnitude of the victims. These are war numbers,\" he said.",

      "\"It's not enough to go in, exchange gunfire, and leave. There's a lack of strategy in Rio de Janeiro's public security policy,\" Sapori said. \"Some lower-ranking members of these factions are killed, but those individuals are quickly replaced by others.\"",

    "summary": "For decades, Bill Gates has warned of climate disaster \u2014 but his tone meaningfully shifted as he cautioned against taking a \"doomsday view\" on the planet's future.",
    "story": [
      "For decades, Bill Gates has warned of climate disaster \u2014 but his tone meaningfully shifted Tuesday as the billionaire Microsoft co-founder cautioned against taking a \"doomsday view\" on the planet's future.",
      "In a memo posted online, Gates wrote that while climate change is still a major problem that needs to be solved, \"People will be able to live and thrive on Earth for the foreseeable future.\" Gates, who has invested billions developing green technologies to cut greenhouse gases, says doomsday climate scenarios over-emphasize cutting emissions while \"diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world.\"",
      "The lengthy memo essentially argued that we should continue to innovate and back climate breakthroughs but not at the expense of funding for global health or development \u2014 \"programs that help people stay resilient in the face of climate change.\" He argued for putting \"human welfare at the center of our climate strategies,\" including improving health and agriculture in the world's poorest countries.",
      "In years past, Gates, the author of \"How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,\" struck a more alarmist tone.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in 2021, he warned: \"If we don't reduce emissions, then the death toll would be even worse near the equator, and the unrest would be global in nature.\" He added, \"You've got to start work now to avoid those terrible consequences much later.\"",
      "Gates described climate change as the most formidable challenge humanity has ever faced. He told Anderson Cooper in a \"60 Minutes\" interview that same year that climate change is \"way greater than the pandemic. And it needs a level of cooperation that would be unprecedented.\"",
      "Gates has personally invested over $2 billion in green technology and launched Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a firm formed with other billionaires to fund research and technology aimed at finding solutions to reduce carbon emissions.",
      "Gates' memo drew a mixed response. Some agreed that climate change isn't the greatest threat to humanity, while others slammed the memo for understating the consequences of climate change.",
      "Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, climate scientist and professor at Texas Tech University, says the problem of climate change cannot be separated from the other major threats that humanity faces because it contributes to them, including in the developing world.",
      "\"Just give me a list of people's top 10 things to worry about, and I can tell you how climate change is making every single one of those top 10 things worse,\" she said.",
      "Dr. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, called the memo a \"breathtaking misread\" that lacks an understanding of what it would mean for the world to experience 2 or 3 degrees Celsius of warming.",
      "\"I think it grossly misrepresents the magnitude of the consequences we're going to see, ironically, for the same people the memo claims to be looking out for \u2014 the global poor.\"",
      "Timothy Gallaudet, a retired Rear Admiral who oversaw weather forecasting for the U.S. Navy, questions some climate assessments, including doomsday scenarios.",
      "\"Ultimately, there's real impacts, but so much is reported erroneously,\" he said. \"There's so much misinformation in the climate space now, it's a real shame.\"",
      "Gallaudet believes moving away from \"climate doomsday alarmism\" and focusing on adaptation and technological improvements to forecasting is beneficial, more realistic, and practical.",
      "Ted Nordhaus is founder and executive director of global research center Breakthrough Institute (not to be confused with Gates' Breakthrough Energy). He said that climate change is a problem, but it doesn't pose the existential threat that some have cautioned.",
      "In a column for The Free Press (which, like CBS News, is owned by Paramount Skydance), Nordhaus wrote that climate tipping points like the melting of ice sheets and the deforestation of the Amazon \"don't add up to catastrophic outcomes for humanity.\"",
      "Per Nordhaus, scientific evidence doesn't suggest climate change is the greatest threat facing humanity, and it shouldn't take top consideration when the world has already proven it can adapt to a warming atmosphere.",
      "\"We've always adapted, that's why we have humans living across huge variances in climatic zones,\" he told CBS News. \"I think the point of Gates' letter is we're actually making a fair amount of progress here to reduce emissions and continuing to be more resilient.\"",
      "With the global climate summit known as COP30 coming up next month in Brazil, Gates urged world leaders, business and activists to chart a new path forward.",
      "\"This is a chance to refocus on the metric that should count even more than emissions and temperature change: improving lives,\" he wrote.",

      "The Israeli military said it had \"begun the renewed enforcement of the ceasefire\" in Gaza after carrying out airstrikes that it said hit \"dozens of terror targets and terrorists\" in the Palestinian territory. The flare-up of violence on Tuesday sparked fears that the U.S.-brokered peace deal between Israel and Hamas could crumble.",
      "At least 104 Palestinians were killed in Israel's strikes, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Wednesday that it would \"continue to uphold the ceasefire agreement and will respond firmly to any violation of it.\"",
      "An Israeli military source said Tuesday that IDF forces had been operating in Rafah, southern Gaza, to dismantle tunnels when enemy fire was directed at a structure and an engineering vehicle, killing Master Sgt. (Res.) Yona Efraim Feldbaum.",
      "Shortly after, anti-tank missiles were fired at a separate armored vehicle and troops in the area, the Israeli military source said.",
      "Hamas denied any involvement in the shooting.",
      "Later Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had ordered Israel's military to conduct \"powerful strikes\" in Gaza in response to ceasefire violations by Hamas.",
      "In response, Hamas said it would delay the return of the remains of another hostage that had been expected to take place on Tuesday.",
      "President Trump, who is on a trip to Asia, said Israel was justified in carrying out the strikes against Hamas, telling reporters on Wednesday: \"As I understand it, they [Hamas] took out an Israeli soldier, so the Israelis hit back and they should hit back. When that happens, they should hit back.\"",
      "\"Nothing is going to jeopardize\" the ceasefire, Mr. Trump added. \"You have to understand Hamas is a very small part of peace in the Middle East, and they have to behave.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Hamas accused the Israeli military of committing \"a large-scale massacre\" overnight, \"despite the agreement to halt the war.\"",
      "Israel's strikes \"reflect a clear lack of respect by the occupation government toward the mediators and guarantor states, which have failed to stop the occupation from continuing its genocidal war on the Gaza Strip,\" Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said in a statement.",

      "Neville was killed in action a year later. Harley was wounded twice but survived the war, dying in Adelaide in 1934 of a cancer his family says was caused by him being gassed by the Germans in the trenches.",
      "Neville requested the bottle's finder deliver his letter to his mother Robertina Neville at Wilkawatt, now a virtual ghost town in South Australia. Harley, whose mother was dead by 1916, was happy for the finder to keep his note.",

      "Neville wrote that he and his comrades were, \"Somewhere at Sea.\" Harley wrote that they were, \"Somewhere in the Bight,\" referring to the Great Australian Bight. That's an enormous open bay that begins east of Adelaide and extends to Esperance on the western edge.",

      "Deb Brown suspects the bottle didn't travel far. It likely spent more than a century ashore buried in the sand dunes. Extensive erosion of the dunes caused by huge swells along Wharton Beach in recent months probably dislodged it.",
      "The paper was wet, but the writing remained legible. Because of that, Deb Brown was able to notify both soldiers' relatives of the find.",
      "The bottle \"is in pristine condition. It doesn't have any growth of any barnacles on it. I believe that if it had been at sea or if it had been exposed for that long, the paper would've disintegrated from the sun. We wouldn't have been able to read it,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Wednesday in South Korea that he hoped to emerge from a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping with a U.S.-China trade deal in hand.",
      "\"We're going to be, I hope, making a deal. I think we're going to have a deal. I think it will be a good deal for both,\" the president said. \"The world is watching, and I think we'll have something that's very exciting for everybody.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a speech to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, the last major scheduled stop of a nearly weeklong swing through Asia. Much of his trip has focused on cementing trade agreements and boosting economic ties with U.S. partners in the region.",
      "Trump says U.S. and South Korea deal \"pretty much finalized\"",
      "The president has signed trade and tariff deals with Japan, Malaysia and several other countries during his trip, and after scheduled talks with South Korean officials on Wednesday, he told reporters before a formal state dinner hosted by South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung: \"We reached a deal. We had a great session. It's an honor.\"",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had told reporters ahead of Mr. Trump's visit that he didn't expect a U.S.-South Korea trade agreement to be completely nailed down during the president's trip, but he said he thought it was close.",
      "Mr. Trump, speaking later to the leaders gathered for the dinner, indicated there were still some details to nail down, saying the U.S. and South Korea had \"pretty much finalized a trade deal,\" and adding that the negotiating teams \"came to a conclusion on a lot of very important items.\"",
      "The two countries\u00a0announced\u00a0a framework deal over the summer similar to the one signed earlier in the week with Japan, with 15% tariffs on South Korean goods and investments pledged in the U.S.",
      "An end to the U.S.-China trade war?",
      "But a direct meeting with China's Xi in South Korea on Thursday is the most hotly anticipated part of his trip. The foreign ministry in Beijing confirmed on Wednesday that a sit-down was planned, saying Xi would meet with Mr. Trump in Busan, \"to exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest.\"",
      "Officials in Beijing have not yet voiced the same optimism publicly over a looming deal to end the trade war, and the meeting could be tense, as China and the U.S. have clashed for months, imposing reciprocal tariffs and restrictions on the import and export of key items.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to press Xi to loosen a set of tough export restrictions on rare earth elements from China, which are essential for everything from computer chips to aerospace. He had threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting from Saturday unless Beijing backs off.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday\u00a0that the additional\u00a0100% tariffs\u00a0\u2014 which would boost the total U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports to 140% \u2014 were \"effectively off the table\" after a two-day meeting with a Chinese negotiator.",

      "Nicholas Burns, a Biden-era U.S. ambassador to China, told CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes that Wednesday's meeting is \"very important,\" calling the trade war a \"test of wills\" between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "\"China is the most important competitor, adversary of the United States worldwide now. It will be in the future,\" Burns said. \"So the stakes are high, because we have lots of issues where we are competing with China.\"",
      "Trump addresses U.S. partners in Asia",
      "The president also used his speech at the APEC event to tout the other trade deals he's inked in Asia. He highlighted his plans to partner with other countries on key industries including shipbuilding, semiconductors and critical minerals, and framed the trade negotiations as an extension of the U.S. defense alliances in the region, telling audience members that \"economic security is national security.\"",
      "APEC is a regional economic group with 21 member countries around the Pacific Rim, including China, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam. Promoting free trade is a major component of the forum, despite Mr. Trump's push for higher tariffs on many member countries, a strategy that the president argues is necessary to rebalance trade.",
      "Critics warn his strategy could lead to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth.",
      "The president is looking to cinch a trade agreement with South Korea, the United States' sixth-largest trading partner. Over the summer, Mr. Trump announced a framework deal that involves the U.S. charging 15% tariffs on South Korean goods, while South Korea invests billions in U.S. industry and opens its market to American cars. Bessent told reporters the South Korea deal is unlikely to be resolved this week, but it's close.",
      "During his APEC remarks, Mr. Trump called South Korea \"a cherished American friend and a close ally.\" He said he's looking to work with the country on investments in U.S. shipbuilding.",
      "Before leaving his previous stop in Japan, Mr. Trump signed a trade deal\u00a0on Tuesday with new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, cementing 15% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by the president. Japan also pledged $550 billion in investments in U.S. industry.",
      "The president announced trade framework agreements with Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand earlier in the trip.",
      "He's also expected to meet at some point with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, as the microchip giant\u00a0partners\u00a0with the Department of Energy to build an artificial intelligence supercomputer and presses for\u00a0more access\u00a0to China's market.",
      "No meeting planned with Kim Jong Un",
      "Mr. Trump said repeatedly that he would be open to meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his trip, though no such meeting has been planned.",
      "The president said Wednesday that the timing couldn't be worked out for a sit-down with Kim. North Korea's government has made no comment on Mr. Trump's suggestions of another face-to-face meeting between the leaders.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, he became the\u00a0first sitting president to visit North Korea, a trip that happened after\u00a0he put an invitation to Kim\u00a0on social media.",
      "Gyeongju, where Mr. Trump was for the APEC summit, is in southeast South Korea, on the opposite side of the country as the capital Seoul, and far from the border with North Korea. The two Koreas have remained technically at war since 1953, when the Korean War was halted by an armistice rather than a full treaty.",
      "Mr. Trump said Wednesday that he would still see what could be done to get the Korean conflict \"straightened out.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 23:21:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The order from Netanyahu follows heightened tensions after Hamas returned a set of remains that Israel said belonged to a hostage recovered earlier in the war.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday he has ordered the army to immediately carry out \"powerful strikes\" in Gaza, and Hamas responded by saying it would delay handing over the body of a hostage, putting new pressure on the tenuous U.S.-brokered ceasefire.",
      "Associated Press reporters and witnesses heard tank fire and saw explosions in various parts of Gaza, including in Gaza City and Deir al-Balah.",
      "The order from Netanyahu follows heightened tensions, as Israel reported Hamas firing on its forces in southern Gaza and after Hamas returned a set of remains that Israel said belonged to a hostage recovered earlier in the war.",
      "\"This constitutes a clear violation of the\u00a0[Gaza peace] agreement\" by Hamas, Netanyahu's office said, adding that the prime minister would meet with the heads of Israel's defense establishment, \"during which Israel's steps in response to the violations will be discussed.\"",
      "In a sign of the fragility of the ceasefire, Israeli troops were shot at in the southern city of Rafah on Tuesday and returned fire, according to an Israeli military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because there hasn't been an official announcement yet.",
      "Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to South Korea, President Trump addressed the clashes, saying \"nothing's going to jeopardize\" the ceasefire.",
      "Mr. Trump said Hamas is a \"very small part of peace in the Middle East\" and that \"if they're not good, they're going to be terminated. Their lives will be terminated. and they understand that.\"",
      "\"Nobody knows what happened to the Israeli soldier, but they say it was sniper fire, and [the Israeli response] was retribution for that, and I think they have a right to do that,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "There are still 13 bodies of hostages in Gaza. Hamas said Tuesday it had recovered the body of a hostage, but after Netanyahu announced the plans to strike Gaza, Hamas said in a statement it would delay the handover.",
      "An Associated Press videographer in Khan Younis witnessed what appeared to be a white body bag being carried out from a tunnel by several men, including some masked militants, and then transported into an ambulance. It was not immediately clear what was in the bag.",
      "The slow return of hostages' bodies is posing a challenge to implementing the next stages of the ceasefire, which will address even knottier issues, such as the disarmament of Hamas, the deployment of an international security force in Gaza and deciding who will govern the territory.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces accused Hamas Tuesday of \"attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies, while in fact holding deceased hostages whose remains it refuses to release as required by the agreement.\"",
      "The IDF said its drones had recorded Hamas operatives \"removing body remains from a structure that had been prepared in advance and burying them nearby\" on Monday, and then staging \"a false display of discovering a deceased hostage's body.\"",
      "Hamas has said it is struggling to locate the bodies amid the vast destruction in Gaza, while Israel has accused the militant group of purposely delaying their return. Over the weekend, Egypt deployed a team of experts and heavy equipment to help search for the bodies of the remaining hostages. That work continued Tuesday in Khan Younis and Nuseirat.",
      "Israeli hostage negotiator and peace campaigner Gershon Baskin told CBS News earlier this month that it was \"very likely that there might be Israeli bodies underneath the rubble\" in Gaza, where the Hamas-run government estimates that at least 90% of the\u00a0buildings have been damaged or destroyed.",
      "This is the second time since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10 that remains turned over by Hamas have been problematic. Israel said one of the bodies Hamas released in the first week of the ceasefire belonged to an unidentified Palestinian.",
      "During a previous ceasefire in February 2025, Hamas said it handed over the bodies of three hostages, Shiri Bibas and her two sons, but testing showed that one of the bodies returned was identified as a Palestinian woman. Shiri Bibas' body was returned a day later.",
      "The remains returned overnight have been identified as belonging to Ofir Tzarfati, Netanyahu's office said.",
      "Tzarfati was kidnapped from the Nova music festival in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel that started the war. In all, the militants killed some 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages.",
      "Tzarfati was killed in captivity and his body was retrieved by Israeli troops in November 2023. In March 2024, his family received additional remains for burial.",
      "Tzarfati's family said in a statement that this is the third time \"we have been forced to open Ofir's grave and rebury our son.\"",
      "In exchange for 15 dead hostages returned from Gaza since the ceasefire began, Israel has handed back to Gaza 195 Palestinian bodies. The last 20 living hostages were returned to Israel at the start of the ceasefire, and in exchange, Israel freed roughly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Israeli authorities said they had killed three Palestinian militants during an operation in the northern part of the occupied West Bank, the latest action in Israel's stepped-up military activity in the territory since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack.",
      "Israeli police said the three men were shot as they came out of a cave near Jenin, a town in the northern West Bank known as a militant stronghold. The Israeli military said in a statement that the militants \"took part in terror activity in Jenin,\" but gave no further details.",
      "Two militants were shot and killed in the initial volley of gunfire. The third, who was wounded, was killed shortly after, according to the Israeli military.",
      "An earlier statement said the Israeli military carried out an airstrike shortly afterward to destroy the cave. The army confirmed an airstrike in the area but gave no further details.",
      "Hamas condemned the Jenin strike and later identified two of the three men as militants with Hamas' Qassam Brigades. The third man was referred to as a \"comrade,\" but no additional details about him were given.",
      "Israel says its operations have cracked down on militants in the West Bank. But Palestinians and human rights groups say scores of uninvolved civilians have also been among the dead, while tens of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes.",
      "Over 68,500 Palestinians have died in the two-year war in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll.",

      "An expedition to try to locate Amelia Earhart's plane on a remote island in the Pacific has been delayed until next year, Purdue University said Monday.",
      "A team of researchers was planning to travel to Nikumaroro Island in early November to determine whether something known as the Taraia Object \u2014 a visual anomaly seen in satellite and other imagery \u2014 is Earhart's aircraft. They are now awaiting additional clearances from local authorities as they work through the permit approvals, and cannot go later this year due to the start of cyclone season, according to a news release.",
      "\"We've overcome other challenges to this project over the past four years, and we will get past this one, too,\" Richard Pettigrew, executive director of the Archaeological Legacy Institute, said in the release. \"Because of the compelling evidence we have in front of us, we have to go to Nikumaroro and get a close look at the Taraia Object. Rest assured that we will do just that, so stay tuned! We will have a revised project schedule worked out soon.\"",
      "The underwater object has been visible in photos dating back to 1938, the year after Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan\u00a0disappeared\u00a0while Earhart \u2014 flying a Lockheed 10-E Electra \u2014 tried to become the first female aviator to circle the world.",
      "Researchers previously said there is \"very strong\" evidence that the object, which is in a lagoon on Nikumaroro, a small island in Kiribati about halfway between Australia and Hawaii, is the iconic aviator's plane. Some, however, have expressed skepticism. \"We've looked there in that spot, and there's nothing there,\" Ric Gillespie, executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, told NBC News in July.",
      "A team of researchers from Purdue and the Archaeological Legacy Institute plan to take photos and videos of the site, then use magnetometers and sonar devices to scan the area. The item will then be dredged and lifted from the water so researchers can attempt to identify it.",
      "Expedition member Steve Schultz, who is Purdue University's senior vice president and general counsel, said \"maritime expeditions require thorough preparation and numerous clearances.\"",
      "\"We have gained valuable insights throughout this process and are very confident and resolved to continue this quest with a planned 2026 departure,\" he said.",

      "Participants who added backward walking to their routines several times a week for six weeks reported significant improvements in knee function and pain reduction compared to those who stuck with standard forward walking.",
      "Researchers found that walking backward changes how muscles around the knee work. Because the stride is shorter and the landing is softer, it reduces compressive forces on the joints, meaning less wear and tear over time.",

That extra mental effort strengthens the connection between your brain and muscles, helping improve balance and reaction time.",

      "Health start-up 'SpotitEarly' is using dogs to help sniff out the four most common types of cancer, helping people detect the disease early.",
      "Like all beagles, Iceman has an incredible sense of smell. \u00a0His nose is so powerful, it's used to sniff out cancer. \u00a0Using the beagles' remarkable sense of smell, health startup 'Spotitearly' has created a test for people to get pre-screened for cancer as a way to increase chances of early detection. \u00a0\"Only 14% of the newly diagnosed cancers in the U.S. are done so through the routine screening. So not a lot of people are actually getting those tests on time,\" says CEO Shlomi Madar.",
      "The test is simple, according to Madar, \"All we ask from the patient is to wear a mask for a few minutes, breathe into it, put it in a capsule and send it back to the lab.\" Once the sample is back at the lab, the beagles get to work looking for the four most common types of cancer - breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung. \u00a0In 'Spotitearly's' initial clinical trials, they report, the dogs detected cancer with 94% accuracy. \"We pride ourselves as being able to detect cancer as early as stage one,\" he says, \"If you detect cancer early enough, you can actually increase survival rate up to 99%.\"",
      "The pups are picked for the job because their sense of smell is 100,000 times more sensitive than ours, allowing them to detect the equivalent of half a teaspoon of sugar in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. In the lab, their puppy power is coupled with artificial intelligence to detect cancer in the breath sample. \"We monitor the dogs' behavior and physiological signals. So, we look at things like their heart rate, their acceleration,\" Madar explains, \u00a0\"And all that plethora of information is being fed into a machine learning algorithm. So, it actually gets better with time.\"",
      "Each beagle must be trained as a sniffer dog already to even be considered. \u00a0Then they go through a rigorous training process - specifically aimed at identifying specific types of cancer. \"We use a lot of redundancy. So, every sample is being sniffed not by one dog, but the entire pack, and more than once,\" Madar notes.",
      "Results are provided by a healthcare professional within days, who will recommend next steps with a positive test. \u00a0Madar notes this screening isn't meant to replace going to a doctor. \u00a0And, while it is still in clinical studies in the United States, you can pre-order a test kit, expected to be commercially available next year.\u00a0Madar says 'Spotitearly' can detect even more types of cancer as long as they train new packs to sniff them out. \u00a0He adds that any dogs who don't pass training are donated to special needs families."

      "Sens. Eric Schmitt of Missouri, Pete Ricketts of Nebraska and Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania unveiled three new bills aimed at addressing the growing spread of nitazenes through law enforcement, technology and foreign policy measures. The push represents one of the most aggressive congressional efforts yet to get ahead of what experts warn could be a deadly new chapter in America\u2019s opioid epidemic.",
      "Schmitt\u2019s Detection Equipment and Technology Evaluation to Counter the Threat of Nitazenes Act of 2025, or DETECT Nitazenes Act, directs the Department of Homeland Security to work with the Drug Enforcement Administration to develop and deploy new technology capable of detecting trace amounts of nitazenes. The bill also updates the Homeland Security Act to explicitly include nitazenes in federal efforts to identify and disrupt illicit substances.",
      "Ricketts and Schmitt joined McCormick and Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) in introducing the Nitazene Control Act, which would permanently classify nitazenes as Schedule I controlled substances under federal law \u2014 the same category as heroin, fentanyl and LSD.",

      "And in a third measure, Ricketts, Schmitt and McCormick rolled out the Nitazene Sanctions Act, which targets the Chinese supply chain behind the synthetic opioids. The bill would expand sanctions on persons and entities in Communist China that support the manufacturing of nitazenes and require the State and Justice Departments to develop a coordinated strategy to cut off the flow of precursor chemicals into the United States.",
      "\"Nitazenes could become the next fentanyl crisis if not stopped,\" Ricketts said. \"It\u2019s already killed thousands of Europeans, and it\u2019s quickly making its way to our shores. The Nitazene Sanctions Act will unleash sweeping sanctions against those in Communist China who are helping to poison and kill Americans.\"",
      "Schmitt echoed that warning. \"Nitazenes are powerful synthetic opioids which overwhelmingly originate from Communist China. The Nitazene Sanctions Act will combat this deadly drug by unleashing devastating sanctions against any entity in Communist China that is manufacturing this deadly drug to poison and kill American citizens,\" he said.",
      "DEA MAKES MASS ARRESTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FENTANYL AND METH BUST TIED TO SINALOA CARTEL",

These illicit drugs are extremely potent and difficult to detect.\"",
      "Nitazenes belong to a class of synthetic opioids known as benzimidazole-opioids. First developed in the 1950s as experimental painkillers, they were never approved for medical use due to their extreme potency and risk of overdose. The most common forms are estimated to be five to nine times stronger than fentanyl, and some variants can be up to 40 times more potent, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

The DEA\u2019s Houston office has also warned of a spike in fatal poisonings involving nitazenes in Houston, Austin and San Antonio.",

      "While fentanyl remains the leading driver of America\u2019s overdose epidemic, lawmakers and health officials are increasingly concerned that nitazenes could represent a new and even deadlier frontier in the synthetic-opioid crisis \u2014 one that the GOP senators say must be confronted before it spirals out of control."

      "Vice President JD Vance spoke at length during a large Turning Point USA gathering at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) in honor of Charlie Kirk, during which he shared the slain conservative activist's impact on his faith and told students that \"a properly rooted Christian moral order\" is key to the future of the country.",
      "After the audience heard from Kirk's widow, Erika, Vance took the stage and spoke for a brief time before taking questions from the audience on a range of issues from immigration to National Guard deployments and the Second Amendment. But several of the questions revolved around Vance's faith and the impact it has had on how he governs as vice president. Some asked about his views on religious liberty while another questioned how he was raising his family in a dual-religion household where his wife is Hindu.",
      "\"I make no apologies for thinking that Christian values are an important foundation of this country,\" Vance said when responding to a question about the separation of church and state. \"Anybody who's telling you their view is neutral likely has an agenda to sell you.

      "\"There's nothing wrong, of course, with focusing on people who are disenfranchised, for example. That's the focus of liberalism. But if you completely separate it from any religious duty or any civic virtue, then that can actually become, for example, an inducement to lawlessness,\" Vance said while responding to a questioner. \"You can't just have compassion for the criminal. You also have to have justice too. Which is why I think that a properly rooted Christian moral order is such an important part of the future of our country.\"",

      "\"Anybody who tells you it's required by the Constitution is lying to you,\" Vance argued. \"What happened, is, the Supreme Court interpreted \u2018Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\u2019 to effectively throw the church out of every public place at the federal, state and local level. I think it was a terrible mistake, and we're still paying for the consequences of it today.\"",

Yeah, I honestly, I do wish that.\u2019 Because I believe in the Christian gospel and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way. But if she doesn't, then God says everybody has free will, and so that doesn't cause a problem for me.\"",

      "\"But the reason why I try to be the best husband I can be, the best father I can be, the reason why I care so much about all the issues that we're going to talk about, is because I believe I've been placed in this position for a brief period of time to do the most amount of good for God and for the country that I love so much.

If proven true at trial, and we intend to do exactly that, this entire affair is a travesty of justice, a waste of taxpayer money to defend, and everything that is wrong with the Loudoun County School Board and its misplaced priorities.\"",
      "Earlier this year, LCPS, located in Northern Virginia, launched a Title IX sexual harassment investigation into two high-school-aged boys after they were videotaped by a biological female who identified as transgender inside the boys' locker room. The video caught them outwardly complaining to each other about the fact that there was a biological girl who identified as a boy using their facilities.",
      "Before taking the case to federal court, the boys and their parents sought to appeal LCPS' Title IX sexual harassment finding to keep the boys from being suspended or marked as sexual harassers on their permanent record. However, their appeal was ultimately denied by the district, leading the families to pursue action in federal court.",
      "On Wednesday, the families turned up the heat with fresh allegations not laid out in their original complaint, including that the district conspired with a local political action committee, Loudoun for All, for the purpose of retaliating against the boys and their families.",

The press releases and other materials, such as a timeline of the case's events, were listed on the political action committee's website, Facebook page, Reddit account and Bluesky account, and allegedly also contained privileged, confidential information pertaining to the case cited in a subsequent local media report titled, \"Locker Room Lawsuit Against LCPS Involves Misinformation, Loudoun4All Says.\"",

It adds that the district allegedly deleted other video the female student took of boys using or coming out of the bathroom.",
      "The amended complaint notes that despite inconsistencies in the female student's story at times, they were credited with \"superior credibility\" by Title IX investigators in the district. Furthermore, it claims that a threat assessment of the male students found no threat and the district had previously concluded that a situation similar to the one at hand resulted in the district finding no cause for a sexual harassment under federal law.",

      "Shortly after LCPS denied the boys' Title IX appeal, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights found LCPS violated Title IX by discriminating against the boys on the basis of sex. Specifically, the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights determined LCPS \"failed to meaningfully investigate complaints of sexual harassment by two male students concerning the presence of a member of the opposite sex in male-only intimate spaces yet thoroughly investigated the female student\u2019s sexual harassment complaint about the boys.\"",

      "The Trump administration indicated LCPS would lose federal funding if they did not rescind its suspensions and sexual harassment findings against the two boys, review its initial findings and investigate the Title IX complaint the boys filed against the female student for videotaping them in the locker room, which the boys' attorneys say was ignored by the district.",

Instead, Loudoun appears to have conspired with an outside political organization to continue its attacks against these boys and their parents.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also included LCPS among a list of five Northern Virginia school districts in violation of Title IX due to their locker room and bathroom policies. As a result of that determination, the districts' federal funding will now be \"done by reimbursement only\" and the Trump administration commenced proceedings to potentially terminate their funding altogether, the Education Department indicated over the summer."

      "Kodiak's VERA Score of 98 matched the highest rating among all fleets evaluated. Fleets with Nauto's safety technology average a score of 78, while those without the technology average only 63.",
      "The Kodiak Driver achieved perfect scores of 100 in inattentive driving, high-risk driving and traffic violations. Its lowest score, 95, came in aggressive driving. The VERA Score combines over 20 vision-based AI variables into one clear safety rating.",
      "Nauto found that every 10-point increase in VERA Score cuts collision risk by about 21%. A near-perfect score like Kodiak's represents a strong improvement over typical human performance on the road.",
      "The strong results didn't come as a surprise to Kodiak's leadership. Don Burnette, founder and CEO of Kodiak, told CyberGuy: \"Achieving the top safety score among more than 1,000 commercial fleets in Nauto's Visually Enhanced Risk Assessment (VERA Score\u00ae) proprietary safety benchmark is a testament to the Kodiak's focus on safety. Safety is at the foundation of everything Kodiak builds. Our core value is \u2018safety first and always.\u2019 We believe independent safety evaluations like Nauto's help to validate what we already know: the Kodiak Driver is already among the safest drivers on American highways.

      "Nauto equipped the trucks with advanced monitoring and hazard detection systems. These tools track both the driving environment and vehicle behavior in real time. Removing human factors such as distraction, fatigue and delayed reaction directly improves safety.",
      "Burnette said in a company statement that the system \"is never drowsy, never drunk, and always paying attention.\" That constant awareness allows the Kodiak Driver to operate defensively and predictably, two traits linked to safe driving.",

      "Businesses could see big gains. AI-powered safety tools help cut liability, lower costs and keep fleets running smoothly. The technology doesn't need rest breaks or reminders to stay focused, which makes every mile more efficient.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/how-tiny-retinal-implant-helping-people-regain-sight",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 13:00:21 -0400",
    "summary": "Revolutionary retinal implant restores central vision in 80% of patients with advanced macular degeneration, offering hope where treatments once only slowed blindness.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A new study in\u00a0The New England Journal of Medicine revealed that the PRIMA brain computer interface (BCI) retinal implant helped people with advanced age-related macular degeneration regain some central vision. The device uses a tiny 2 millimeter by 2 millimeter photovoltaic implant that is only 30 micrometers thick, and thinner than a strand of hair. It sits beneath the retina and works with a special pair of smart glasses. The glasses capture images and send them as near-infrared light to the implant. The implant converts that light into small electrical signals that stimulate the optic nerve. This process mimics how healthy retinal cells normally send visual information to the brain.",
      "The study followed 38 participants, 32 of whom completed one year of follow-up. Twenty-six patients experienced measurable improvement in vision, which equals about 80% of the group. Many participants could read letters, numbers and even full pages of text again. Although the restored vision is black and white and slightly blurry, the results are remarkable for people who once believed they would never see clearly again.",

      "Why this matters for AMD treatment",
      "Age-related macular degeneration, often called AMD, is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in older adults. Until now, available treatments could only slow down vision loss. None of them could restore what had already been lost.",
      "The PRIMA implant works with smart glasses to bring central vision back to life. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "The PRIMA implant takes a different approach. It directly replaces the missing function of the retina by turning light into electrical signals. Patients can still use their natural peripheral vision while the implant restores some central vision. This combination creates a more complete visual experience.",
      "The trial showed that the surgery is generally safe. Most side effects occurred within the first two months and resolved soon after. Importantly, the implant did not reduce the patients' remaining natural peripheral vision. Researchers call this a major step toward restoring sight rather than only slowing its decline.",
      "The PRIMA implant was developed by Science Corporation, a brain-computer interface company founded by Max Hodak, who previously cofounded Neuralink. Science Corporation acquired the PRIMA technology from the French firm Pixium Vision, continuing its development toward clinical use.",
      "EYE DROPS MAY REPLACE READING GLASSES FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH AGE-RELATED VISION LOSS",
      "The tiny chip sits under the retina and turns light into visual signals. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you or someone you love lives with late-stage AMD, this breakthrough may offer real hope. For the first time, there is a device that can restore some sight instead of only preserving what remains. You may want to talk with your ophthalmologist about upcoming trials or future approval of the PRIMA system in your area. The company behind the technology has already applied for European approval, and a process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is underway.",
      "Regaining even partial central vision can make a big difference. Reading text, recognizing faces or simply moving independently becomes possible again. This progress also shows how fast medical innovation is moving. Patients who were once told that nothing could help may soon have a chance to see again.",
      "It is also a reminder to stay informed. Treatments that were once experimental are becoming available sooner than expected. Discussing new technologies with your doctor helps you understand timing, eligibility and what kind of results you can realistically expect.",
      "This breakthrough offers new hope for people living with advanced macular degeneration. (PeopleImages/Getty Images)",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here:\u00a0CyberGuy.com.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The PRIMA retinal implant represents a shift in how scientists and doctors think about blindness caused by AMD. For decades, the focus was on slowing down the disease. Now, researchers are proving that restoration is possible. While this generation of the implant provides limited black and white vision, it gives real, functional sight to people who had none. That alone changes lives. More work remains to improve image clarity, color perception and comfort. Still, this is only the beginning.

    "story": [
      "With one trick, you won't have to worry about forgetting passwords on your iPhone again.",
      "Keeping your computer secure is more important than ever. Cyberattacks target computers, accounts and sensitive data daily. Traditional passwords have long been the cornerstone of security, but they come with real challenges. Many of us reuse passwords across sites, and even strong passwords can be compromised in data breaches.",
      "Passkeys offer a safer and more convenient way to authenticate. However, they're still relatively new, and many of us are still trying to figure out how they work. For example, Peter recently reached out asking, \"How do I get a passkey from a PC desktop that doesn't have a camera or fingerprint device?\"",
      "That's a great question, Peter, and you're not alone in wondering about this. The good news is that passkeys are designed to work on virtually any device, whether or not it has biometric hardware like a fingerprint reader or camera. Let's explore what passkeys are, why they're worth using and how to set them up on both Windows and Mac, regardless of your hardware setup.",

      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Passkeys make signing in faster and safer by replacing traditional passwords with encrypted keys. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys use cryptography to prove who you are. When you create a passkey, your device makes two keys, one public and one private. The public key goes to the website, and your private key stays on your device. During login, your device confirms your identity with the private key. The website never sees or stores it.",
      "This process blocks phishing and password theft. It also makes sign-in faster. You don't need to remember or type long passwords anymore.",
      "While passkeys simplify authentication, they don't eliminate the need for a secure password manager. Password managers can safely store and sync your passkeys, just as they do with passwords, allowing you to access your credentials across devices and browsers \u2014 even if those devices don't natively sync passkeys, such as between Windows and Apple systems. Using a password manager alongside passkeys creates a bridge between platforms and provides an additional layer of security and convenience.",
      "Can you use passkeys without biometrics?",
      "Yes, you can. A PC or Mac without a camera or fingerprint reader can still use passkeys. On Windows, you unlock them with your Windows Hello PIN. On Apple devices, you can use Touch ID, Face ID or your passcode. The key is having an updated operating system and browser that support passkeys.",
      "If you manage multiple accounts or devices, a password manager that supports passkeys can act as your central vault. This lets you use passkeys even on systems that don't directly support syncing through iCloud or Google Password Manager. It's an easy way to ensure you always have access to your credentials, no matter what kind of device you use.",
      "Why you still need passwords",
      "Not every website supports passkeys yet. Some services still rely on passwords. Keep strong, unique passwords for those accounts. Passwords also serve as backup if you lose a device or can't use your passkey. Over time, more sites will support password-free logins.",
      "This is where password managers continue to play an important role. They bridge the gap between old and new authentication methods, allowing you to store both traditional passwords and passkeys in one secure place. Until the web is fully passkey-ready, combining the two provides both convenience and resilience, giving you a seamless experience across multiple devices and services.",
      "Passkeys also prevent phishing because your private key never leaves your device during sign-in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Passkey support by platform",
      "Works on\u00a0Windows 10 and 11.Windows 11 version 22H2 (KB5030310+) includes passkey management.Unlock with\u00a0Windows Hello PIN, face, or fingerprint.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Passkeys are a major upgrade over traditional passwords, but we're not living in an all-passkey world just yet. Many sites still rely on passwords, and you'll need backups if something happens to your device. Supplementing passkeys with a password manager is the best move right now; it lets you store, sync and protect both passkeys and passwords under one roof. The good news is that setting up passkeys takes just a few minutes, and once they're enabled, logging in becomes faster and more secure.",

      "Mad Max Mode returns in Tesla's latest FSD update",
      "Tesla recently launched its FSD v14.1.2 update. The update follows last year's major FSD v14 release, which introduced \"Sloth Mode\" for slower, more cautious driving. The latest update moves to the opposite end of the spectrum with Mad Max mode.",
      "According to Tesla's release notes, this profile allows higher speeds and more frequent lane changes than Hurry mode. The update has sparked mixed reactions. Some Tesla fans praise it for making driving feel more natural. Critics argue that it invites risky behavior at a time when regulators like the NHTSA and California DMV are already investigating Tesla's advanced driver-assist systems.",
      "TESLA'S SELF-DRIVING CARS UNDER FIRE AGAIN",
      "A new Mad Max speed profile is now included in Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving interface. (Tesla)",
      "History of Tesla's Mad Max mode since 2018",
      "The Mad Max setting isn't new. Tesla first introduced it in 2018 for the original Autopilot system. At the time, Elon Musk described it as ideal for handling aggressive city traffic. The name, borrowed from the post-apocalyptic movie series, immediately drew attention for its bold tone.",
      "Now, the feature is back in Tesla's latest FSD version. Within hours of release, drivers reported seeing cars equipped with Mad Max mode rolling stop signs and driving over the speed limit. These early reports highlight how the mode may behave more assertively than before.",
      "Why Tesla brought back its Mad Max mode",
      "Bringing back Mad Max mode may serve several purposes for Tesla. It helps demonstrate the company's continuous development of FSD software while appealing to drivers who prefer faster, more decisive movement in traffic. It also acts as a signal that Tesla is still chasing the goal of Level 4 autonomy, even though its system remains classified as Level 2, requiring constant driver supervision.",
      "Tesla owners can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles.\u00a0 (Chesnot/Getty Images)",
      "For Tesla, this feature shows confidence in its progress. For observers, it raises concerns about timing. With multiple investigations and lawsuits in progress, many expected Tesla to focus on safety rather than on more aggressive driving profiles.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you own a Tesla with Full Self-Driving (Supervised), you can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles. This mode provides a more assertive driving experience that includes quicker acceleration, more lane changes, and less hesitation.",
      "However, remember that Tesla's Full Self-Driving system still requires active driver attention. You must keep your hands on the wheel and remain ready to take control at any moment. While the name suggests thrill and speed, safety and awareness should remain your top priority.",
      "Tesla\u2019s speed-profile menu includes the toggle options of Chill, Standard, Hurry, and Mad Max profiles to customize how aggressively their car responds in traffic.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Mike Blake)",
      "If you share the road with Teslas, it's smart to stay alert. Vehicles using Mad Max mode may accelerate or change lanes more quickly than expected. Giving Teslas a little extra space can help reduce surprises and keep everyone safer on the road.",

Even if a scammer gets your password through a fake American Express email, they cannot access your account without your verification code. Most banks and credit card companies offer this free feature in their security settings. Enable it today and make your login stronger.",
      "Data removal services help clean up your personal information from data broker websites that collect and sell your details to advertisers, marketers and even scammers. Reducing your digital footprint limits the amount of information that phishing attackers can use to make fake emails look convincing. In the case of fake American Express messages, less personal data online means fewer details criminals can use to target you directly.",

      "How the fake nude images were created and shared",
      "When she was 14, the plaintiff posted a few photos of herself on social media. A male classmate used an AI tool called ClothOff to remove her clothing in one of those pictures. The altered photo kept her face, making it look real.",
      "The fake image quickly spread through group chats and social media. Now 17, she is suing AI/Robotics Venture Strategy 3 Ltd., the company that operates ClothOff. A Yale Law School professor, several students and a trial attorney filed the case on her behalf.",

      "Experts believe this case could reshape how courts view AI liability. Judges must decide whether AI developers are responsible when people misuse their tools. They also need to consider whether the software itself can be an instrument of harm.",
      "The lawsuit highlights another question: How can victims prove damage when no physical act occurred, but the harm feels real? The outcome may define how future deepfake victims seek justice.",
      "Is ClothOff still available?",
      "Reports indicate that ClothOff may no longer be accessible in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, where it was blocked after public backlash. However, users in other regions, including the U.S., still appear able to reach the company's web platform, which continues to advertise tools that \"remove clothes from photos.\"",

      "Phishing scams target every kind of institution, whether it's a hospital, a big tech firm or even a fast-food chain. Educational institutions aren't an exception, especially in 2025, when attackers are actively directing their efforts toward them. Universities across the U.S. are facing a new type of cybercrime where attackers are targeting staff to hijack salary payments. Researchers have discovered that since March 2025, a hacking group known as Storm-2657 has been running \"pirate payroll\" attacks, using phishing tactics to gain access to payroll accounts. Let's talk more about this attack and how you can stay safe.",

      "SCAMMERS NOW IMPERSONATE COWORKERS, STEAL EMAIL THREADS IN CONVINCING PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "How does the university payroll scam work",
      "According to Microsoft Threat Intelligence, Storm-2657 primarily targets Workday, a widely used human resources platform, though other payroll and HR software could be at risk as well. The attackers begin with highly convincing phishing emails, carefully crafted to appeal to individual staff members. Some messages warn of a sudden campus illness outbreak, creating a sense of urgency, while others claim that a faculty member is under investigation, prompting recipients to check documents immediately. In some cases, emails impersonate the university president or HR department, sharing \"important\" updates about compensation and benefits.",
      "Phishing scams are evolving fast, and now universities have become prime targets for payroll theft. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "These emails contain links designed to capture login credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes in real time using adversary-in-the-middle techniques. Once a staff member enters their information, the attackers can access the account as if they were the legitimate user. After gaining control, the hackers set up inbox rules to delete Workday notifications, so the victims do not see alerts about changes. This stealthy approach allows the attackers to modify payroll profiles, adjust salary payment settings and redirect funds to accounts they control, all without raising immediate suspicion.",
      "COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH HITS 870,000 PEOPLE",
      "Hackers are exploiting universities at scale",
      "The hackers don't stop at a single account. Once they control one mailbox, they use it to spread the attack further. Microsoft reports that from just 11 compromised accounts at three universities, Storm-2657 sent phishing emails to nearly 6,000 email addresses at 25 institutions. By using trusted internal accounts, their emails appear more legitimate, increasing the likelihood that recipients will fall for the scam.",
      "To maintain access over time, the attackers sometimes enroll their own phone numbers as MFA devices, either through Workday profiles or through Duo MFA. This gives them persistent access, allowing them to approve further malicious actions without needing to phish again. Combined with inbox rules that hide notifications, this strategy lets them operate undetected for longer periods.",
      "Microsoft emphasizes that these attacks don't exploit a flaw in Workday itself. Instead, they rely on social engineering, the absence of strong phishing-resistant MFA and careful manipulation of internal systems. In essence, the threat comes from human behavior and insufficient protection, not software bugs.",

      "Protecting yourself from payroll and phishing scams isn't complicated. By taking a few careful steps, you can make it much harder for attackers to gain access to your accounts or personal information.",
      "The more information scammers can find about you, the easier it is to craft convincing phishing messages. Services that remove or monitor personal data online can reduce exposure, making it harder for attackers to trick you with targeted emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

Don't click links or download attachments unless you are 100% sure they are legitimate. Even small mistakes can give attackers access to your accounts.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If an email mentions salary changes or requires action, call or email the HR office or the person directly, using contact information you already know. Phishing emails are designed to create panic and rush decisions, so taking a moment to verify can stop attackers in their tracks.",
      "Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts. Scammers often try to use credentials stolen from other breaches. A password manager can help you generate strong passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember dozens of different combinations.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "The Storm-2657 attacks show that cybercriminals are targeting trust, not software. Universities are appealing because payroll systems handle money directly, and staff can be manipulated through well-crafted phishing.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "More than 1 million patients have been affected by a data breach involving SimonMed Imaging, one of the country's largest outpatient radiology and medical imaging providers. The breach came to light after a cyberattack compromised sensitive patient data, with reports indicating that ransomware operators may have been behind the incident. What makes this case particularly concerning is the scale of the attack and the type of information stolen, which could easily be misused for financial or identity fraud.",

      "What happened at SimonMed Imaging",
      "In January 2025, SimonMed Imaging was alerted by one of its vendors about a potential security incident. The following day, the company noticed suspicious activity on its own network. The company says in response, it reset passwords, enforced two-factor authentication and tightened endpoint security while cutting off third-party vendor access.",
      "Unfortunately, the attackers had already gained access. Between Jan. 21 and Feb. 5, 2025, cybercriminals exfiltrated sensitive data belonging to around 1.2 million individuals. The Medusa ransomware group later claimed responsibility, alleging they had stolen more than 200 GB of data, including patient IDs, financial records and medical scans.",
      "DISCORD CONFIRMS VENDOR BREACH EXPOSED USER IDS IN RANSOM PLOT",
      "SimonMed Imaging discovered suspicious network activity in January 2025, prompting an immediate security response and system lockdown. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The attackers reportedly demanded 1 million dollars to delete the stolen files, or 10,000 dollars per day to delay publishing. SimonMed was later removed from the Medusa leak site, which could suggest a ransom payment, although the company has not confirmed this. In the aftermath, SimonMed brought in cybersecurity experts to investigate and has offered complimentary credit monitoring services to affected individuals.",

      "Hackers linked to the Medusa ransomware group stole data from 1.2 million patients, including IDs, financial details and medical scans. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What data got exposed in the SimonMed breach",
      "While SimonMed's official filing described the exposed data as names and other data elements, the ransomware group's claims suggest a much broader leak. According to the attackers, the stolen dataset included identity documents, payment details, medical reports, account balances and raw imaging scans (via BleepingComputer).",
      "Such information is extremely valuable on dark web marketplaces. Identity details and medical records are often sold in bulk to fraud operators who use them to commit financial scams, insurance fraud, or obtain prescription drugs. Medical breaches are harder to recover from because you cannot reset or replace a medical history or a government ID scan the same way you can change a password.",
      "We reached out to SimonMed for comment, but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "DELIVERY GIANT'S DATA BREACH EXPOSES 40,000 PERSONAL RECORDS",
      "After the breach, SimonMed hired cybersecurity experts, tightened defenses and offered free credit monitoring to affected individuals.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to stay protected",
      "Even though the company is offering free credit monitoring, leaked data often circulates long after an incident is closed publicly. That is why it is important to take additional precautions on your end to reduce the long-term impact of this breach and future-proof your personal security.",
      "People-search sites collect personal records and make them publicly accessible. Data removal services handle outreach and removals on your behalf, which reduces your exposed footprint online. With less information easily available, it becomes harder for attackers to assemble a complete identity profile for scams.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "If you have ever interacted with SimonMed or any related platform, change your passwords immediately. Avoid reusing old passwords across different accounts. A password manager helps generate strong credentials and stores them securely so you do not have to remember them manually. This reduces the risk of one breach affecting multiple accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Enabling 2FA adds an important layer of verification to your accounts. Even if someone gets hold of your password, they will not be able to log in without the code delivered to your phone or app. It is one of the simplest and most effective security upgrades you can make.",
      "Modern malware includes remote access tools and silent monitoring modules that can stay hidden before launching an attack. Strong antivirus software can detect unusual behavior, protect against ransomware and alert you in real time if something attempts to access your data without permission. This is no longer just about traditional virus protection but active threat monitoring.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware and potentially access your private information is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Regularly review your bank statements, insurance records and medical billing activity. Cybercriminals often test stolen information with small, easily overlooked transactions before moving to larger fraud attempts. Catching and reporting these early can prevent a much bigger loss.",
      "Because breaches involving medical providers often expose sensitive identifiers, an identity protection service can be useful. These services scan dark web listings, alert you when your information appears in leaked databases and assist with recovery if fraud occurs. Some plans include legal support and help with credit restoration.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "After a major breach, attackers often launch phishing campaigns that reference the affected company to appear legitimate. Be skeptical of emails or texts mentioning SimonMed or credit monitoring, especially if they request payment or personal verification. Staying aware of current scams and keeping your software updated adds a strong layer of defense.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The SimonMed Imaging breach is another reminder that cyberattacks on healthcare providers are becoming more frequent and far more invasive. Once data is taken, it can circulate indefinitely across criminal networks. Taking protective steps early, including monitoring your identity and reducing your exposed data online, can help you stay ahead of potential misuse.",

      "\"Keeping a defendant completely off camera for too long in a high-profile case like this only fans the flames of conspiracy,\" Rice said. \"Conspiracies are born out of a lack of information, allowing the public to draw their own conclusions, no matter how far-fetched or unfounded.\""

A California preacher was accused of holding knives to children\u2019s chests while forcing them to perform sex acts on each other. In Louisiana, a youth leader confessed to drugging and assaulting three boys during a sleepover. A couple in New Mexico say their pastor used his spiritual authority to drive them apart, then coerced the wife into sex.",
      "Of the alleged abusers, 123 were ministers, and nearly half of those were youth pastors. Others were church employees, youth group leaders or Sunday school teachers. Dozens were accused of luring boys through the Royal Rangers, a Pentecostal version of the Boy Scouts.",
      "In about 30 instances, church leaders placed alleged abusers into positions of authority after they had been accused, freeing them to strike again. Convicted sex offenders led youth groups. Accused ministers were reinstated or quietly moved to new congregations. As a result, according to lawsuits and police records, dozens more children were abused.",
      "In nearly 40 other cases, leaders allegedly covered up or dismissed reports of misconduct \u2014 often by failing to alert police or pressuring victims to stay quiet. Melody Meza recalled a leader in her congregation praying for lying, demonic spirits to leave her after she reported abuse by a church elder.",
      "\u201cThey made me feel like something was wrong with me and not the person abusing me,\u201d said Meza, one of nearly 20 people suing an Assemblies of God church in California accused of concealing decades of abuse.",
      "Others said preachers twisted scripture to silence them. \u201cTouch not the Lord\u2019s anointed,\u201d pastors warned, citing a verse from Psalms that some interpret as a command to never question spiritual leaders.",
      "Courtney Blackburn said she wishes her church\u2019s former leaders had looked to another passage, one in which Jesus commanded followers to protect children. When she reported misconduct by her youth pastor in Arkansas, she said, they left him in place. He went on to sexually assault two children, criminal records show."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for surgeon general, Dr. Casey Means, may face tough questions Thursday as senators decide whether to support her confirmation.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate confirmation hearing for President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for surgeon general, Dr. Casey Means, has been postponed after she went into labor, a spokesperson for the Senate committee set to consider her nomination said.",
      "Means was supposed to appear virtually before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on Thursday morning for lawmakers to consider her nomination for the top health role.",
      "If she assumes the role, Means would become the county\u2019s leading public health spokesperson, with the authority to issue health warnings and advisories.",
      "\u201cWe are very happy for Dr. Means and her family,\u201d the Department of Health and Human Services said in a post to X. \u201cThis is one of the few times in life it\u2019s easy to ask to move a Senate hearing!\u201d",
      "The committee's chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also congratulated Means and her husband on X.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no greater reward than being a parent,\u201d he said. \u201cI anticipate rescheduling her hearing when she is ready.\u201d",
      "Means' nomination has stirred controversy: A close ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., she has voiced skepticism of traditional medicine and promoted wellness products. She also doesn\u2019t hold an active medical license.",
      "Trump nominated her in May after he withdrew his previous choice, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, a former Fox News medical contributor.",
      "Trump said he selected Means on Kennedy\u2019s recommendation. She was a campaign adviser during Kennedy\u2019s presidential bid and an architect of his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda.",
      "In her 2024 book, \u201cGood Energy,\u201d Means describes having quit her medical residency program after she became disillusioned with the medical system\u2019s focus on managing disease rather than curing patients. She got her M.D. at Stanford University and completed nearly all of her five-year surgical residency at Oregon Health and Science University before she dropped out.",
      "\u201cI walked out of the hospital and embarked on a journey to understand the real reasons why people get sick,\u201d she wrote in her book.",
      "Means\u2019 medical license lapsed in January 2024 \u2014 a subject that was expected to come up at the hearing before it was postponed.",
      "Former Surgeon General Jerome Adams, who served during Trump\u2019s first administration, has argued that completing a residency and holding a valid medical license are implicit legal requirements for the role, since surgeons general oversee the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps \u2014 a federal public health branch that requires its own officers to have medical licenses.",
      "Means did not respond to a request for comment ahead of Thursday's anticipated hearing.",
      "Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement that Means\u2019 \u201ccredentials, research background, and experience in public life give her the right insights to be the surgeon general who helps make sure America never again becomes the sickest nation on Earth.\u201d",
      "Means\u2019 past comments about childhood vaccinations have also garnered attention. In May, she wrote in her newsletter that the \u201ctotal burden\u201d of the current vaccine schedule is \u201ccausing health declines in vulnerable children,\u201d and she linked to a Substack post that suggested vaccines cause autism \u2014 a claim that scientific evidence has repeatedly debunked.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, is a doctor and proponent of vaccines. During Kennedy\u2019s confirmation process, Cassidy acknowledged his hesitations but wound up providing critical support for Kennedy.",
      "Means also told conservative commentator Tucker Carlson last year that birth control pills are \u201cprescribed like candy.\u201d In her newsletter, she wrote that hormonal birth control has \u201chorrifying health risks.\u201d (Decades of research have shown it\u2019s safe for most people, and serious complications are rare, though some studies have identified a slightly elevated risk of breast cancer in women who have taken birth control pills.)",
      "Those stances, taken together, have generated concern among some public health experts that Means could use her potential pulpit to spread misleading information.",
      "\u201cCasey Means has built her career attacking contraception, vaccines, and women\u2019s autonomy \u2014 all while profiting from misinformation and wellness fads,\u201d Dr. Dara Kass, former regional director at HHS in the Biden administration, said in a statement. \u201cThe Senate should reject this dangerous, unqualified nominee.\u201d",
      "However, Means has gained popularity in wellness circles because of her messages about outsized corporate influence in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Her book argues that people can \u201cimprove and extend their lives\u201d using \u201csimple principles doctors aren\u2019t taught in medical school\u201d \u2014 namely, eating healthier, getting more sleep and physical activity and understanding one\u2019s underlying disease risk.",
      "Many public health experts agree that renewed attention on healthy diets and lifestyles is warranted, though some question the particular solutions Means has supported through her work.",
      "Means co-founded a company called Levels, which helps people monitor their blood glucose, and has also sold dietary supplements, teas and other wellness products on social media. An investigation by The Associated Press found that Means sometimes failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit from the sales.",
      "Means signed an ethics agreement in September stating that she would resign from her advisory position at Levels and stop promoting her book, producing her newsletter and putting up monetized social media posts.",
      "Dr. Richard Carmona, who was surgeon general from 2002 to 2006 under President George W. Bush, said he worries about a nominee who didn\u2019t complete her medical training and has never held a leadership role in medicine.",
      "\u201cAs a surgeon general, I want to make sure it\u2019s somebody that has the appropriate training, experience, integrity, knowledge to deal with the complexity of this United States and our interface with the rest of the world. There\u2019s no box that she checks that really is germane to the issues we\u2019re dealing with today,\u201d he said.",
      "Marion Nestle, professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, said Means should be judged by her actions in office, not based on the fact that she didn\u2019t finish residency. If Means is confirmed, Nestle said, she could use her platform to promote healthy diets.",
      "\u201cShe could take up ultraprocessed foods. That would be terrific,\u201d Nestle said.",
      "But Nestle cautioned that promoting supplements wouldn\u2019t be backed by scientific research.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in favor of wellness. I\u2019m not in favor of wellness products, because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much evidence that they work,\u201d she said."

Suddenly, they hear voices coming from towards the house.",

      "During the Oct. 27 episode of the NBC singing competition series, Team Reba contestant Aubrey Nicole decided to sing a song in the Knockouts round that honored her father and hit close to home for her coach.",
      "\u201cI realized that I could talk about something that really means a lot to me, which is supporting people through hard times, especially with cancer,\u201d Nicole explained to McEntire and Mega Mentor Joe Walsh before revealing she was singing \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Love You Through It\u201d by Martina McBride.",
      "Nicole then shared that her dad was diagnosed with cancer before she moved away to college. She said she was 700 miles away at school and could only love him through the tough times as he battled the disease. She said he is now in remission.",

      "\u201cI do know this song,\u201d she said as fellow coach Snoop Dogg handed her some tissues. \u201cMartina\u2019s a good friend of mine.\u201d",
      "McEntire continued, \u201cI lost my oldest son because he did not win with cancer. So that was a real reminder that life goes on and we sing songs about it so we can remember the ones that are around us that we love so much. And that we lean on in times like this.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Aniyah Saint-Surin was amped to secure pit tickets the day of Billie Eilish\u2019s first Miami show on Oct. 9. The 18-year-old says she walked into the concert at the Kaseya Center saying to herself, \u201cThis will be my time.\u201d",
      "Her prediction was right. Hours later, the high school senior would go viral for her fast-acting bravery and earn a name within Eilish\u2019s fandom: The \u201cred bandana girl.\u201d",
      "At the concert, Eilish stepped down from the stage and walked through the crowd, greeting fans with smiles and high-fives. Then came a shocking moment: Eilish\u2019s outstretched arm was yanked by concertgoer. He pulled her into the crowd on the other side of the barricade.",
      "The concertgoer has not been identified. The Miami police Department said in a police department that the individual was \u201cejected\u201d from the venue, NBC News reported. There are no criminal charges pending, police said.",
      "Saint-Surin witnessed the altercation happen. \u201cI just see her get swallowed below,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cShe\u2019s supposed to be walking past me, not down.\u201d",
      "Saint-Surin was immediately disturbed by what had happened. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this just happened,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t fathom somebody just doing that in front of me right.\u201d",
      "Saint-Surin tried to help Eilish up, then noticed the person who had grabbed her was also standing nearby. Saint-Surin decided to confront him.",
      "\u201cOh, so you want to touch people?\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cNow, it\u2019s me and you. Now you get a piece of my mind.\u201d",
      "Saint-Surin later spoke to Miami Police Department and showed her a video she had of the incident, which she posted Oct. 14 on her social media accounts.",
      "But she wasn\u2019t the only person who had captured the moment. Videos of Saint-Surin confronting the man started to circulate on social media, giving her the nickname \"red bandana girl.\"",
      "Fans found her TikTok account and jumped her following from 60 to about 700,000. Singer-songwriter FINNEAS, who is also Billie\u2019s older brother, posted on his Instagram story on Oct. 10, \u201cRed bandana girl from last night\u2019s show rules.\u201d",
      "Saint-Surin realized she\u2019d gone viral at her high school\u2019s pep rally. Her \u201cmind started to crumble\u201d thinking of her followers. But the attention excited her, too. \u201cI\u2019m like yes, FINNEAS sees that I don\u2019t play about your sister,\u201d she says.",
      "Stubhub ended up inviting Saint-Surin to Eilish\u2019s Oct. 10 show, where she says she made eye contact with Eilish from the other side of the barricade. On Night 3, which she also attended, she says Eilish smiled at her. At the concerts, Saint-Surin got recognition of her own from fans who had seen the viral video.",
      "Saint-Surin is also grateful for the merch Eilish\u2019s team sent her as a \u201ctoken of appreciation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen she wrote me a note,\u201d she says. \u201cSo sweet.\u201d",
      "Looking back, Saint-Surin reflects on concert etiquette, especially at at time when behavior like concertgoers throwing things at performers is a trend. She hopes the moment encourages people to \u201cenforce more respect (toward) an artist when they\u2019re performing.\u201d",
      "As for what made her the type of person who would intervene when she sees \"disrespect,\" in her words?",
      "\u201cMama definitely raised me right, yes,\u201d she says."

      "Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau were spotted holding hands in Paris on the singer\u2019s birthday.",
      "Perry and Trudeau\u2019s night out was captured in part through videos shared across social media and photos published by Backgrid. The brief clips showed the singer and former Canadian prime minister exiting a building holding hands on Oct. 25, which marked Perry\u2019s 41st birthday.",
      "Perry wore a long red dress for the occasion, styling her hair in a slicked-back bun to show off her statement earrings, while Trudeau wore a simple black suit.",
      "Later in the video, Trudeau helped Perry into the back of a car, while photographers at the scene wished the singer, who is in the middle of her \u201cLifetimes Tour\u201d in Europe, a happy birthday.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to representatives for Perry and Trudeau for comment.",
      "Perry was previously in a relationship with Orlando Bloom for nearly a decade, though the couple announced their split back in July.",
      "The pair began dating in 2016 but split one year later. They rekindled their romance in 2018 and got engaged in 2019 on Valentine\u2019s Day. They later welcomed daughter Daisy in August 2020.",
      "At the time their split went public, reps for Bloom and Perry shared a joint statement about their separation, revealing the couple had \u201cbeen shifting their relationship over the past many months to focus on co-parenting.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey will continue to be seen together as a family, as their shared priority is \u2014 and always will be \u2014 raising their daughter with love, stability and mutual respect,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Trudeau, who served as prime minister of Canada from 2015 to January 2025, was previously married to Sophie Gr\u00e9goire for 18 years before he announced in August 2023 that they had separated. The former couple are parents to three children: sons Xavier and Hadrien and daughter Ella-Grace.",
      "In the weeks after news of Perry and Bloom\u2019s split broke, Trudeau was seen at one of Perry\u2019s concerts over the summer in Montreal, singing along in the crowd. The rumored couple were also spotted together at the beginning of August.",
      "While Perry hasn't said much about the breakup publicly, Bloom addressed the couple\u2019s split during a September appearance on TODAY.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m great, man. I\u2019m so grateful. We have the most beautiful daughter,\u201d Bloom told TODAY's Craig Melvin. \u201cYou know, when you leave everything on the field, like I did in this movie, I feel grateful for all of it. And we\u2019re great. We\u2019re going to be great. It\u2019s nothing but love.\u201d"

      "GYEONGJU, South Korea \u2014 President Donald Trump said Thursday after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he was lowering tariffs in exchange for a crackdown on fentanyl and that he would visit China in April.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way back to Washington, Trump said he would reduce his fentanyl tariff on China to 10% from 20%, effective immediately, after Xi agreed to intensify China\u2019s efforts to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid.",
      "He said his meeting with Xi was \u201camazing,\u201d rating it a \u201c12\u201d on a scale of one to 10, and said that with few major obstacles remaining, a sweeping trade deal would soon be ready.",
      "Trump said he would visit China in April, and that Xi would visit the United States \u201csome time after that,\u201d either at Mar-a-Lago or in Washington.",
      "Xi told Trump that the U.S. and China should maintain \u201ccommunication at all levels\u201d to avoid a \u201cvicious cycle of retaliation.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrade should remain the ballast and propeller of China-U.S. relations, not a stumbling block or source of conflict,\u201d Xi said according to a readout released by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "The meeting in South Korea between the two leaders, their first since Trump returned to the White House, lasted about an hour and 40 minutes and was the climax of Trump\u2019s three-country Asia tour.",
      "Some issues were not addressed at all, Trump said, including the status of Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, some White House aides had worried that Trump might shift long-standing U.S. policy on the island in exchange for concessions from China, NBC News reported earlier this week.",
      "Before the meeting, Trump called Xi a longtime friend and \u201ctough negotiator.\u201d His Chinese counterpart acknowledged \u201cfrictions\u201d between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, saying that \u201cgiven our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye.\u201d",
      "Other tariffs remain, a White House official said.",
      "Earlier in the week, Bessent said a TikTok deal may be finalized during the meeting between Trump and Xi. Trump didn't mention a deal on the popular Chinese-owned app, whose U.S. operations are required to be sold to a U.S. owner under a law that was passed last year based on national security concerns. But Bessent told Fox Business Network after the meeting that China had approved a deal during talks in Kuala Lumpur, and that other finalizations for the deal would occur over the next weeks and months.",
      "After the meeting, the spokesperson for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that the country agreed \u201cto work with the US to properly resolve issues related to TikTok,\u201d according to a translation.",
      "Both Trump and Xi wanted the optics and tactical aspect of this meeting to go well, a person familiar with the planning said beforehand.",
      "Still, Trump is continuing a long-standing practice of meeting with allies before Beijing, which former Assistant Secretary of State Dave Stilwell said indicates that the U.S. is not going to trade its alliance commitments for a deal with China.",
      "During Trump\u2019s five-day trip to Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, he signed agreements with all three countries as well as Thailand and Cambodia; made new foreign investment announcements; and proclaimed that tariff leverage can drive warring parties to stand down.",
      "Reflecting on his approach, Trump said going against the grain can sometimes deliver results.",
      "\u201cOftentimes you\u2019ll go the opposite way of almost everybody, and you\u2019ll be the one that\u2019s right, and the others will be the one that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said in Gyeongju, South Korea, offering a peek into his thinking. \u201cThat\u2019s where you have your greatest successes.\u201d",
      "Miles Yu, a former State Department adviser on China, said the U.S. and Beijing are \u201csizing each other out\u201d with trade now a key battleground issue. Washington is pushing for concrete steps on fentanyl, market access and more, he said, while China \u201cstonewalls and foot-drags\u201d and offers only broad \u201cframeworks.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the root cause of the five rounds of futile negotiations so far with China without a breakthrough,\u201d Yu said, adding that the administration is trying to shift China\u2019s approach by rallying its neighbors, a strategy that he said \u201cmay or may not work.\u201d",
      "After talks with Chinese counterparts in Malaysia last weekend, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said negotiators had shaped a framework for Trump and Xi to consider that spanned tariffs, trade, fentanyl, rare earths and \u201csubstantial\u201d purchases of U.S. agricultural products.",
      "He credited Trump\u2019s threat of an additional 100% tariff with creating leverage and said he believed that the framework would avoid that outcome and open space for tackling other issues.",
      "Xi said Thursday that the framework agreed in Malaysia had \u201cprovided the necessary conditions for our meeting today.\u201d",
      "Dan Caldwell, a former senior adviser to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said Trump deserved credit for pursuing a pragmatic China policy that maintained what he said was strategic ambiguity while taking steps to restore important military capabilities to deter Chinese aggression.",
      "\u201cA lot of folks wanted to assume that he was going to be reflexively hawkish on China,\u201d Caldwell said of Trump. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been the case.\u201d",
      "But Caldwell cautioned against expecting a breakthrough in Busan. \u201cI don\u2019t think the overall push hinges on one meeting,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cIdeally, these go well, but the whole thing does not hinge on just one set of talks.\u201d",
      "In other words, the goal was to make enough progress to get to the next date between the two leaders.",
      "Analysts in the region, too, saw limited room for a sweeping agreement this week.",
      "\u201cSome sort of consensus and agreements are very possible,\u201d said Zeng Jinghan, a professor of international relations at the City University of Hong Kong, given that both sides want \u201ca little bit of de-escalation.\u201d",
      "But Trump and Xi were unlikely to reach a comprehensive deal that settles the long-term structural differences between their countries, he said.",
      "The hope instead is for \u201cless aggressive\u201d rhetoric, Zeng said, with both Beijing and Washington likely to come back and declare the meeting a success."

      "Inside each ampule is the substance at the heart of the geopolitical strife between the United States and China: fentanyl, the deadly opioid at the center of a deal outlined by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping on Thursday.",
      "NBC News got exclusive access to the headquarters of Yichang Humanwell Pharmaceutical, the largest producer of the drug in China, and indeed Asia, at its sprawling complex in the central city of Yichang.",
      "Humanwell says that it only supplies fentanyl for use in hospitals and that it does not export any medication to the United States, Mexico or Canada. In 51 years of operating, \u201cwe have never had a single incident of a drug going missing \u2014 not a single dose has ever been lost,\u201d its president, Du Wentao, said in an interview inside his factory, which is surrounded by high fences wrapped in concertina wire and electric sensors.",
      "Humanwell is one of only five companies in China licensed to produce fentanyl for use in hospitals, and it makes around 100 million doses of fentanyl variants each year.",
      "After a strict registration process to get past the main gate, all visitors and staff alike \u2014 including the CEO \u2014 are required to wear blue hospital caps, shoe covers and lab coats to ensure they do not contaminate the workspace.",

      "Two staffers in protective gear supervised the process, with an alarm pinging every 10 minutes to remind them to spray their gloved hands with disinfectant. The vials are then inspected using flashes of light, stamped, boxed up and shipped out via a warehouse.",
      "Trump pressed Xi for a crackdown on fentanyl at a meeting in South Korea on Thursday, the last stop of his three-country Asian tour. The president said he would reduce his fentanyl tariff on China to 10% from 20%, effective immediately, after Xi agreed to intensify China\u2019s efforts to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid.",
      "American officials say the Chinese government hasn\u2019t done enough to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for fentanyl, which are then processed into the highly addictive opioid in Mexican labs and smuggled across the border to the United States. Though deaths appear to be declining in the U.S., fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have killed hundreds of thousands of Americans in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "China has previously defended its anti-fentanyl efforts and says unrelenting American demand for the drug is to blame for the crisis.",
      "But a State Department report to Congress last month accused the ruling Chinese Communist Party of continuing to \u201csubsidize and otherwise incentivize China-based companies to export synthetic drug precursors, including through tax rebates, monetary grants and awards, and official site visits.\u201d It accused companies controlled by the Communist Party of being \u201ccomplicit in this illicit trade.\u201d",
      "Under pressure from Trump, China made fentanyl a controlled substance in 2019, banning its use outside of medical prescriptions. That slowed the influx of Chinese fentanyl into the U.S., but the \u201cprolific export of chemical precursors and other illicit narcotics remains,\u201d the State Department report said.",
      "Chinese officials rejected that narrative. \u201cChina expresses sympathy for the American people suffering from the fentanyl crisis,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday.",
      "But he added that \u201cChina is the country most resolute in drug control, with the most comprehensive policies and the best track record. It is also one of the countries with the largest number of controlled substances and the strictest regulations in the world.\u201d",
      "Du, the president of Humanwell Healthcare, which produces 100 million doses annually of fentanyl-based products, says that the meticulously clean, automated and controlled operation observed by NBC News was no facade.",
      "\u201cThe management of fentanyl drugs in China is among the strictest in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is absolutely no possibility that any dose from our company has flowed to the United States. I can state this with full confidence and certainty \u2014 there is no issue whatsoever.\u201d",
      "He derided the \"many statements in the U.S. claiming that the fentanyl crisis originates from China,\" saying that is impossible \"given how strict our controls are.\"",
      "As well as the visit to Humanwell, NBC News gained exclusive access to the National Narcotics Intelligence Center in Beijing, which had been sanctioned by Washington in 2020 but saw those measures lifted three years later during the Biden administration as the two countries agreed to resume cooperation on fentanyl.",
      "There, Chinese security officials said the two sides are again exchanging information on how smugglers alter their tactics.",
      "Fentanyl precursors are \"indeed one of our main concerns because drug synthesis techniques and methods are constantly evolving,\" lab director Hua Zhendong told NBC News.",
      "\"We have not found such processing plants domestically,\" he said, so \"most of the relevant information comes from technical exchanges with U.S. counterparts.\"",
      "Hua said the latest precursor chemicals identified by the U.S. \u201care added to our monitoring list so we can strengthen our attention to these substances.\"",
      "He said that banning all fentanyl products outside medical use in 2019 had \"effectively curbed illegal production and trafficking.\"",
      "U.S. officials say that's not the case. As Washington and Beijing seek common ground on the issue, experts say halting the illicit flow of fentanyl components is easier said than done.",
      "\u201cI think there is an assumption here that if the Chinese really wanted to shut off these precursors, they could do it,\u201d said Michael Swaine, a senior research fellow in the East Asia Program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington-based think tank, speaking ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "The problem, he said, is that there is no \u201cset number\u201d of precursors to fentanyl.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a clear list of specific items that you would be able to easily interdict,\u201d Swaine said. \u201cAnd a lot of them, of course, are very dual-use items.\u201d",
      "So while there might be a \u201csymbolic effort\u201d to deal with the fentanyl issue after the Trump-Xi meeting, he said, \u201cI don't think that this is going to go completely away.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall in both Jamaica and Cuba in the last two days, followed what has unfortunately become a familiar pattern for major storms in a warming world.",
      "The most catastrophic storms \u2014 those with the most intense winds and soaking rains \u2014 were once rare, but they are becoming more likely because of climate change. And similarities are emerging among these powerful hurricanes\u2019 behavior and timing, too.",
      "Before Melissa hit Jamaica as a Category 5 monster, it churned over especially warm waters \u2014 as did other hurricanes over the past decade. This allowed it to strengthen at blistering pace, becoming the most powerful of this year\u2019s Atlantic season and tying the record for strongest landfall ever in the Atlantic.",
      "Then the storm slowed to a crawl, giving it more time to dump rain on Jamaica, another hallmark of hurricanes on a warming planet. Melissa\u2019s timing, too, was notable: It formed late in the season \u2014 hurricane activity has typically been thought to peak in early September \u2014 as ocean heat lingered into the fall.",
      "Taken together, this behavior makes Melissa a kind of poster child for the new normal of hurricanes, experts said.",
      "\u201cThese storms aren\u2019t the same storms as a couple decades ago,\u201d said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at the nonprofit research group Climate Central.",
      "It\u2019s a shift with life-or-death consequences \u2014 one that forecasters and officials in storm-prone areas are now watching closely.",
      "Intensifying in a hurry",
      "One of Melissa\u2019s most eye-opening characteristics is how remarkably fast it intensified. In just 18 hours, it exploded from a tropical storm into a Category 4 Sunday, before reaching Category 5 strength early Monday.",
      "Climate change is increasing the risk of this \u201crapid intensification\u201d pattern, which the National Hurricane Center defines as an increase in sustained wind speeds of at least 35 mph over 24 hours.",
      "In Melissa\u2019s case, Winkley said, unusually warm sea-surface temperatures in the Caribbean and high levels of moisture in the atmosphere caused an \u201cextreme rapid intensification.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten really good at forecasting and understanding when hurricanes are going to make a big boost in intensity, but with Melissa, it even exceeded the best forecast that we can make for it in terms of wind speed,\u201d he said.",
      "Winkley added that the storm passed over Caribbean waters that were 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than usual \u2014 conditions that climate change made up to 700 times more likely.",
      "Two-and-a-half degrees Fahrenheit may not sound like a lot when it comes to a giant hurricane, but small temperature differences can really make a big impact,\u201d Winkley said.",
      "Many other recent storms have undergone rapid intensification. Last year, Hurricane Milton\u2019s wind speed increased by 90 mph in roughly 25 hours, and in 2022 Hurricane Ian went through two rounds of rapid intensification before making landfall in Florida. The list goes on: Hurricanes Idalia in 2023, Ida in 2021 and Harvey in 2017 all underwent rapid intensification, too.",
      "Fewer hurricanes, higher impact",
      "In the past 35 years, the number of hurricanes and tropical cyclones that form annually has been decreasing.",
      "\u201cWe find that the number of hurricanes globally, including typhoons, has gone down significantly since 1990,\u201d said Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist who studies hurricanes at Colorado State University.",
      "But that overall decrease is largely due to a drop in cyclone activity in the Pacific, Klotzbach said; Atlantic hurricane activity has risen, primarily as a result of a decades-long trend toward La Ni\u00f1a, a seasonal circulation pattern that tends to weaken the high-altitude winds that discourage hurricane formation.",
      "\u201cLa Ni\u00f1a is good for the Atlantic if you like hurricanes,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "When hurricanes do develop, they\u2019re more likely to turn into major storms as the seas warm.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase of those reaching Category 4 and 5,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "Melissa was the third Category 5 hurricane this year \u2014 the first time in two decades that more than two storms of such power have formed in the same season.",
      "Zachary Handlos, an atmospheric scientist at Georgia Tech University, said that although warmer seas in the future will be more conducive to hurricanes, a warmer atmosphere will force changes to the high-altitude winds that can prevent or destroy hurricanes. These winds could strengthen in some locations and weaken in others, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a very straightforward answer.\u201d",
      "How these trends will play out remains an active area of research and scientific dispute.",
      "A longer hurricane season",
      "It\u2019s not lost on experts that the strongest hurricane of the season hit just days before Halloween.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pretty late into the season at this point. Things should be starting to wind down,\u201d said Derrick Herndon, a researcher in the Tropical Cyclone Research Group at the University of Wisconsin.",
      "The Caribbean has always been a hotspot for powerful, late-season hurricanes, but they\u2019re becoming even more likely, Klotzbach said \u2014 he recently submitted research showing the trend for peer review. At the same time, hurricane data in the era of satellite observations (from 1971 to 2022) suggests that hurricane season is beginning earlier in the year, too.",
      "The fall hurricane pattern has been fueled by the long-term trend toward the La Ni\u00f1a pattern, Klotzbach added, which itself is likely the result of a combination of climate change and natural variability.",
      "La Ni\u00f1a weakens high-altitude winds at a time when Caribbean waters are still hot, setting the stage for storms in late October and early November, he said: \u201cIt loads the dice toward these robust hurricanes.\u201d",
      "Hurricane Melissa was exacerbated by warmer-than-usual waters off Jamaica\u2019s southern coast.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get a really intense hurricane in the Atlantic, it\u2019s going to probably be in this part of the world,\u201d Herndon said.",
      "In the past, such a storm would typically have churned up cold water from below the surface and stifled its own growth, according to Andy Hazelton, a hurricane modeler and associate scientist with the University of Miami\u2019s Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies. But this year, ocean heat is elevated both at the surface and as deep as 200 feet below, he said, so Melissa simply churned up more heat and energy.",
      "Storms are stalling",
      "Just before or after landfall, hurricanes are now more likely to stall and dump immense amounts of rain, according to a study published last year. Other research suggests their forward speed has gotten slower overall, though this remains a topic of debate.",
      "Hurricane Melissa followed the pattern, stalling off the coast of Jamaica as it continued to build intensity. On Tuesday morning, the day of its first landfall, the storm was moving at just around 2 mph. Forecasters expected up to 30 inches of rainfall in parts of Jamaica, which is more than a third of its annual average.",
      "Scientists have not reached a consensus about why some storms are moving more slowly, but some have theorized that it\u2019s because climate change has weakened atmospheric circulation patterns.",
      "Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was a dramatic example of the consequences of such stalling: When it parked over Houston, the storm dropped about 5 feet of rain in some locations. The pattern is particularly problematic because a warmer atmosphere can absorb and deliver more rainfall.",
      "\u201cFor every 1 degree Fahrenheit of warming, the atmosphere can hold onto 4% more moisture,\u201d Winkley said. \u201cWarmer oceans not only boost the intensity of hurricanes, but it allows for more evaporation, so it\u2019s putting more of that rain-making moisture into the atmosphere for these hurricanes to absorb and then unleash.\""

    "story": [
      "Extending the length of your daily walks can benefit your heart, new research suggests.",
      "In a study conducted among healthy adults, people who accumulated most of their daily steps in bouts of 15 minutes or longer had significantly lower risks of heart disease and death nearly a decade later than those who got in several shorter walks throughout the day. The study was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.",
      "What\u2019s more, adults who had been less active in the past and went on longer walks showed the greatest health gains.",
      "An international team of scientists looked at the daily movements of 33,560 adults aged 62 on average and living in the U.K., using information collected from 2013 through 2015 in a medical research database called the UK Biobank. For three to seven days, participants wore an accelerometer on their wrist that recorded their physical activity.",
      "Researchers divided the people into four groups, based on how they logged most of their steps each day: in bouts shorter than five minutes, five to less than 10 minutes, 10 to less than 15 minutes and 15 minutes or longer. The largest group \u2014 42.9% of participants \u2014 fell into the under-five-minute category.",
      "After about 9\u00bd years of follow up, the researchers found that people who had walked in spurts of 15 minutes or longer had the lowest likelihood of dying during the study period, while people who took walks shorter than five minutes had the highest risk.",
      "People who walked in longer bouts also had lower risks of heart disease during the follow-up period, with risk increasing as walk duration shortened.",
      "Co-lead study author Borja del Pozo Cruz, a professor and researcher in the department of sports sciences at Universidad Europea de Madrid, calls the four walk durations \u201cdoses.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear dose response,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cThe longer the bout, the better it is for the different health outcomes that we analyzed.\u201d",
      "The decision to study people\u2019s health via step accumulation patterns, as opposed to total number of steps or intensity of physical activity, was intentional, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to translate; everyone understands steps,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cEveryone can essentially measure steps with their smartwatches or smartphones or pedometers or whatever. We thought focusing on steps would be much more impactful because their translation is immediate.\u201d",
      "Forget \u2018exercise snacks\u2019 and 10,000 steps a day",
      "The notion that adults should strive for 10,000 steps a day is more a marketing ploy to sell fitness trackers than a scientific guideline, according to Steven Riechman, a professor in the department of kinesiology and sport management at Texas A&M University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "Riechman said that the body goes through a number of adaptations as it shifts from rest mode to exercise mode \u2014 changes that take a bit of time. That could explain why people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes didn\u2019t see as strong health gains, he said.",
      "\u201cYou need to get all the systems engaged and fully operational, and that\u2019s where the health benefits come from,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThe one I particularly thought of, [which] the article did not mention, is that the increase in body temperature is probably not going to occur in less than five minutes of walking.\u201d",
      "Despite mixed research on the health benefits of 10,000 steps a day, the study considered people who achieved an average daily step count under 8,000 to be \u201csuboptimally active.\u201d All study participants logged fewer than 8,000 steps a day, and those who logged fewer than 5,000 were deemed sedentary. The median activity of all participants was 5,165 steps a day.",
      "The link between longer walking bouts and lower risks of early death and heart disease was more notable among sedentary participants, researchers found. Within this group, people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes had a 5.13% risk of death during the study period, compared to a 0.86% risk for people who walked in bouts exceeding 15 minutes. Their risk of developing heart disease during the decade-long study period was 15.39% and 6.89%, respectively.",
      "\u201cYou have big returns from zero to something,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThen you keep getting benefits, but they\u2019re just lower and lower. By the time you get to 10,000 [steps], you\u2019re not accumulating too many more benefits.\u201d",
      "The study is at odds with previous research that touts the merits of \u201cexercise snacks,\u201d or spurts of physical activity lasting less than five minutes. For instance, a study published earlier this month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that exercise snacks improved the fitness levels of physically inactive adults. However, that study defined short spurts as structured, moderate-to-vigorous activity. The short spurts in del Pozo Cruz\u2019s study, on the other hand, included the unstructured, low-intensity steps one might accumulate throughout the course of the day.",
      "\u201cEvery step counts,\u201d according to the American Heart Association, a mantra Riechman supports. Some physical activity is always better than none.",
      "\u201cGetting out and getting some of the steps, for sure, there\u2019s definitely a benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, you\u2019re just not optimizing the benefits.\u201d",
      "\u2018Never too late\u2019 to start walking",
      "The study had several limitations, including that 97% of participants were white.",
      "Another research constraint is that participants\u2019 walking patterns represent a snapshot in time, and people\u2019s exercise habits may fluctuate over the years. Even so, the study\u2019s large sample size likely stabilized such variation, said Carmen Swain, director of the health and exercise science program at the Ohio State University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.",
      "One of the study\u2019s biggest strengths, she said, is participants\u2019 average age: 62. It\u2019s a time of life when people may assume they\u2019re past the point of lowering their risk of heart disease and early death.",
      "\u201cYou can start [walking] at any age; it\u2019s not too late,\u201d Swain said. \u201cThe physiological adaptations that occur for a 20-year-old are also going to happen for a 60-year-old.\u201d",
      "Yes, a 60-year-old may already bear underlying signs of heart disease, she said, which is why it\u2019s even more important for older adults to maintain a walking regimen.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s often a challenge for this population to start because they haven\u2019t done it for so long,\u201d said Swain, who lectures her students on the power of walking. \u201cThere has to be motivation.\u201d",
      "With heart disease being the No. 1 killer of men and women in the U.S., Swain hopes the heart-health benefits of walking will be motivation enough.",
      "\u201cWalking is so democratic. You can just do it wherever you want, whenever you want, however you want,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good form of exercise.\u201d",

      "Russia says it has successfully tested an experimental weapon that sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie: a nuclear-powered cruise missile with unlimited range, whose low-flying, terrain-hugging and loitering capabilities could evade American missile defenses and drop atomic bombs anywhere on Earth.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday that the Burevestnik \u2014 meaning \u201cstorm petrel\u201d (a type of sea bird) \u2014 was \u201cindeed a unique weapon that no other country possesses.\u201d",
      "The development has drawn concern internationally, with President Donald Trump saying Monday it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d to be conducting such tests when Russia should be focusing on peace talks with Ukraine.",
      "But many Western experts have questioned the value of the missile, which is code-named \u201cSkyfall\u201d by NATO. Some say it doesn\u2019t do anything Russia can\u2019t do already \u2014 while others ridicule it as a waste of money. There are also safety concerns that the mini-reactor that powers the missile could spark a radiation catastrophe.",
      "\u201cThe main reason that no one else has tried to build something like this is that it doesn\u2019t really have any use,\u201d Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told NBC News.",
      "The weapon is instead \u201clargely political,\u201d according to Podvig, who is based in Geneva and runs the Russian Nuclear Forces Project. \u201cIt was important for the Kremlin, I think, that this is unique and something no one else has done before.\u201d",
      "Trump pointed out Monday that there are other ways to deliver a nuclear warhead.",
      "\u201cWe have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores,\u201d he told reporters aboard Air Force One. So a missile \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to go 8,000 miles,\u201d he added.",
      "\"We test missiles all the time,\" he said. \"They're not playing games with us, and we're not playing games with them either.\"",
      "The Kremlin said it saw no reason why the test would \u201cstrain relations between Moscow and Washington,\u201d already complicated by the shelved Putin-Trump summit.",
      "The test was announced Sunday by Putin and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Russia\u2019s chief of the general staff, who appeared together in a video wearing camouflage fatigues.",
      "Gerasimov told the president the missile had flown for 15 hours and covered 8,700 miles during a test last Tuesday \u2014 a record but not the limit of its range, he said.",
      "Gerasimov spoke of its \u201cassured accuracy against highly protected targets at any range\u201d and said it had \u201ca high capability to evade missile-defense and air-defense systems.\u201d",
      "This was the first time the missile had conducted \u201ca many-hour flight,\u201d Gerasimov added. But the Burevestnik is far from new, having been announced by Putin in March 2018.",
      "It uses a reactor \u2014 essentially a \u201cminiature nuclear power plant\u201d \u2014 to heat air to temperatures of almost 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which powers a ramjet engine that could keep it flying for days, according to a 2019 report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an American nonprofit group.",
      "The U.S. and Soviet Union both looked into developing the technology during the Cold War but abandoned it because of the concerns highlighted by experts today.",
      "Those fears were realized in 2019. An offshore explosion in the Russian Arctic killed five scientists and spiked radiation in a nearby city. Experts and later the U.S. government said it was likely a failed Burevestnik test.",
      "Norway said Monday that last week's test was carried out from an archipelago in the Barents Sea. \u201cWe can confirm that Russia has conducted a new test launch of the long-range cruise missile Skyfall (Burevestnik) on Novaya Zemlya,\u201d Vice Adm. Nils Andreas Stensoenes, head of Norway\u2019s Intelligence Service, told Reuters in an emailed statement.",
      "The missile is a so-called second strike weapon, designed to be part of Russia\u2019s response to a nuclear attack. But any such assault on Moscow\u2019s military sites would likely target the Burevestnik\u2019s launch pads, too, Podvig and others believe. It would also likely be detected during its long flight, he said.",
      "He and others read this week's announcement as more of a political response to Trump\u2019s plans for a \u201cGolden Dome\u201d missile defense system in the U.S.",

      "Israel had previously accused Hamas of a similar attack in Rafah that saw two soldiers killed earlier this month, with the militant group also denying involvement at the time.",

      "But Tuesday Hamas was accused by Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement after returning body parts that were identified to belong to Ofir Tzarfati, whose remains were already returned to Israel about two years ago in a military operation.",

      "In a statement Wednesday, the ICRC addressed the incident, saying its teams \u201cwere not aware that a deceased person had been placed there prior to their arrival, as seen in the footage\u201d and that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for a \u201cfake recovery\u201d to be staged.

      "In a statement, Hamas denied having any connection to the incident in Rafah, calling Israel\u2019s strikes on Gaza \u201ca flagrant violation\u201d of the ceasefire deal. The group called on mediators to step in and pressure Israel to curb its attacks.",
      "At least nine people have been killed and two others have been injured in Gaza as a result of Israeli airstrikes Tuesday night, Basal said. Four people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a home in Gaza City, and five were killed when a civilian vehicle was targeted in Khan Younis, he said. The casualties from the vehicle include two children.",

      "Under the truce that was finalized on Oct. 10, Hamas is expected to return all Israeli hostage remains as soon as possible.",
      "In a statement earlier Tuesday, Hamas' military wing, Al Qassam Brigades, said it had found the body of a hostage during a search in southern Gaza but will postpone returning it to Israel because of \"violations.\" The return was originally scheduled for Tuesday.",
      "Before Netanyahu's announcement, Hamas official Suhail al-Hindi told Al Jazeera that the group has faced difficulties recovering hostages' bodies and has asked Israel to approve the entry of heavy equipment, as well as permission for search teams to enter \"red zones\" to get the work done, which Israel allegedly refused. Al-Hindi also restated Hamas' commitment to the ceasefire agreement and accused Israel of falsely accusing the group of violating it.",
      "Netanyahu's instructions come just weeks after Israel and Hamas agreed to the ceasefire. The deal led to the exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners and detainees and prompted high hopes that fighting would end.",
      "The conflict in Gaza had raged largely uninterrupted since Oct. 7, 2023, after Hamas-led attacks killed 1,200 people in Israel and led to nearly 250 being taken hostage. Since then, Israeli forces have killed nearly 70,000 people in Gaza, according to local health officials, and devastated the enclave, leaving a vast majority of the population with inadequate access to food, shelter and medical care. Famine was declared in parts of Gaza in August.",
      "In the weeks after the ceasefire deal, the Israeli military has struck Hamas \u201cto eliminate the threat\u201d posed by militants and \u201cdismantle tunnel shafts and military structures used for terrorist activity.\u201d",
      "Hamas, meanwhile, has reasserted its control over parts of the enclave that Israel has withdrawn from \u2014 deploying armed police officers, clashing with rival clans, directly firing on and killing Israeli troops and carrying out at least one public execution."

      "Believed to have become pharaoh when he was 8 or 9 years old, in around 1334 B.C., Tutankhamun ruled until his death 10 years later, and is believed to have suffered from numerous illnesses and disabilities, including circulatory problems, malaria, bone disease and a club foot.",
      "His tomb was discovered in November 1922 in the Valley of the Kings by the British archaeologist Howard Carter, undisturbed by grave robbers and almost completely intact, nearly 400 miles south of Egypt\u2019s most famous archeological treasures in Giza.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Some of President Donald Trump\u2019s aides have advised him against shifting the U.S. position on independence for Taiwan to favor China, according to four people with knowledge of the discussions, ahead of his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week.",
      "The aides have privately expressed concern that Trump, who is pushing to reach a sweeping trade deal with China, may choose to ignore their advice, the people with knowledge of the discussions said. They said they worry that Trump could walk away from long-standing U.S. policy on Taiwan or more subtly shift the U.S. position by framing it with new language.",
      "\u201cEveryone is holding their breath,\u201d one of the people with knowledge of the discussions said.",
      "Follow live updates here.",
      "Administration officials have told Trump to expect Xi to seek a public declaration from him that the United States \u201copposes\u201d Taiwan\u2019s independence, the people with knowledge of the discussions said. Xi has for months pushed for a shift in the U.S. position on Taiwan from the current one, which is that the United States does \u201cnot support\u201d its independence, to saying the United States \u201copposes\u201d it.",
      "While many Americans might see that as a different way of saying the same thing, were Trump to say the United States opposes Taiwan\u2019s independence or even that independence is not a good idea at this time, it would send shock waves across Asia and be seen as a huge gift to Xi.",
      "Openly expressing opposition to Taiwan\u2019s independence would be seen as moving the United States from a neutral position on the issue to clearly standing on the side of China. For decades, U.S. administrations have adopted a policy of strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan, known as the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, and presidents have taken the public position of not supporting its independence.",
      "A White House official told NBC News: \u201cPresident Trump has repeatedly affirmed that his Taiwan policy has not changed. President Trump leads on all foreign policy \u2014 he always puts forward deals that put the American people first.\u201d",
      "Asked what the Trump administration\u2019s policy on Taiwan\u2019s independence was, a senior State Department official said, \u201cThe policy on Taiwan hasn\u2019t changed one bit.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s as consistent as it\u2019s been for decades,\u201d the official said Monday.",
      "China sees democratic and self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that must be reunited with the mainland by military force if necessary. Taipei rejects Beijing\u2019s claims of sovereignty and seeks to maintain its de facto independence even if it is not formally recognized by most countries.",
      "\u201cThe Taiwan question is at the core of China\u2019s core interests, and the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations,\u201d Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said by email when he was asked for comment.",
      "\u201cThere is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory. This is a consensus of the international community and a political commitment made by the U.S. to China,\u201d Liu said.",
      "Taiwanese officials are also uneasy about the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting and have expressed their own concerns to State Department officials that Trump could abandon Taiwan to secure a win from the meeting, one of the people familiar with the discussions said.",
      "Asked by reporters about Taiwan\u2019s apprehension, Secretary of State Marco Rubio brushed the concerns aside.",
      "\u201cWhat people are worried about is we\u2019re going to get some trade deal where we\u2019re going to get favorable treatment on trade in exchange for walking away from Taiwan,\u201d Rubio said Saturday en route to Asia for this week\u2019s meetings. \u201cNo one is contemplating that.\u201d",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry took to social media soon after, expressing its appreciation to Rubio for \u201creaffirming no one is contemplating walking away from Taiwan.\u201d",

      "Canada is on track to lose its measles elimination status as an outbreak that began a year ago continues to spread.",
      "The United States could follow in the coming months.",
      "The Canadian outbreak began in October 2024 in New Brunswick, a province on the country\u2019s eastern seaboard. As of Tuesday, more than 5,000 cases had been reported. Two babies have died.",
      "Canada eliminated measles in 1998. The U.S. followed two years later, in 2000.",
      "There are multiple criteria for losing an official measles elimination status, including the declines in vaccination rates observed in both countries.",
      "But the most significant factor is having ongoing measles transmission for a full year.",
      "\u201cTo really say that a country has lost the status, it takes 12 months of continuous transmission with the same genotype and the same strain of the virus,\u201d said Daniel Salas, an immunization expert with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).",
      "Canada hit that mark this week.",
      "PAHO, which is part of the World Health Organization, is the group charged with determining whether a country in North, South or Central America has eliminated measles. It is set to convene next week in Mexico City to analyze measles data through the end of October.",
      "If a country loses its measles elimination status, \u201ca corrective action plan will be requested to guide efforts to regain elimination,\u201d according to a PAHO spokesman.",
      "It\u2019s highly unlikely that the U.S. will lose its elimination status during the upcoming meeting, Salas said, because the ongoing outbreak began in January.",
      "In the U.S., at least 1,618 measles cases have been logged so far this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak that threatens the U.S. elimination status began in West Texas in late January. More than 800 people in Texas and New Mexico have been infected, and the outbreak has spread to other states. Three people died, including two young girls.",
      "It will take time to analyze whether ongoing spread in Arizona, Utah and South Carolina is linked to the West Texas outbreak.",
      "The elimination of measles in the U.S. and Canada \u201cwas a huge achievement,\u201d Salas said. \u201cWhen we say that we sustain the elimination as a region, we are also acknowledging each country for their efforts.\u201d",
      "The possibility of elimination status in Canada is \u201ca wake-up call that we need to do better in vaccinating our general public so we don\u2019t have outbreaks like this,\u201d Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Toronto, said in an interview this week with CTV Television Network in Toronto.",
      "The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is extraordinarily effective, according to the CDC. Two doses, usually given around ages 1 and 5, are 97% effective at preventing infection."

      "One of the men was arrested on Saturday evening while \u201cpreparing to leave the country\u201d from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement.",
      "She said investigators are still working \u201cto recover the stolen jewels and to locate all of the perpetrators,\u201d adding: \u201cIt is too early to provide any further detail. I will release additional information at the end of this period of police custody.\u201d",
      "AFP reports that two men were taken into custody on suspicion of organized theft and criminal conspiracy.",
      "French Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez congratulated investigators on Sunday.",
      "\u201cWith the same determination !! Let\u2019s keep on !!,\u201d he posted on X.",
      "A huge police operation has been underway to locate the four thieves who were captured on camera making off with eight pieces from the museum in a daylight robbery early last Sunday.",
      "The robbers arrived with a furniture-lift truck, sliced through a window of the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, threatened guards and smashed through two display cases, speeding off on scooters before police could respond.",
      "The stolen crown jewels have an estimated value of 88 million euros ($102 million), not counting their cultural and historical value to the French people.",
      "Beccuau, whose office is leading the probe, condemned leaks appearing in French media, saying that \u201chasty disclosure of this information by individuals who had knowledge of it, without any consideration for the investigation\u201d could hinder progress.",
      "Investigators have raised fears that the thieves would be likely to melt down and break up the artifacts to sell them off.",
      "\u201cThe wrongdoers who took these gems won\u2019t earn 88 million euros if they had the very bad idea of disassembling these jewels,\u201d Beccuau said in an interview with broadcaster RTL. \u201cWe can perhaps hope that they\u2019ll think about this and won\u2019t destroy these jewels without rhyme or reason.\u201d",
      "The Louvre theft has struck at the heart of France\u2019s national pride, wounding a country that sees its cultural heritage as a matter of identity and raising uncomfortable questions about how the world\u2019s most visited museum was breached so easily.",
      "The thieves parked a monte-meubles \u2014 a truck mounted with a basket lift \u2014 and used it to access a second-floor balcony, seemingly without drawing the attention of police or security. The incident is being seen in some quarters as a national humiliation.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron called it \u201can attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our history.\u201d He vowed to \u201crecover the works and the perpetrators will be brought to justice,\u201d adding that \u201ceverything is being done, everywhere, to achieve this.\u201d"

    "summary": "President Donald Trump arrived in Southeast Asia on Sunday for his first visit to the continent since returning to office, a three-nation tour through Malaysia, Japan and South Korea that is expected to culminate in a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, as tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies tick higher.",
    "story": [
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 President Donald Trump arrived in Malaysia on Sunday in his first stop on a three-country Asia tour that is expected to culminate in a highly anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, as tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies tick higher.",
      "\u201cThe first message is Trump the peacemaker. The second is Trump the moneymaker,\u201d said Victor Cha of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cAnd then, of course, with the meeting with China, I think what everybody\u2019s expecting is that there\u2019s probably not going to be a big trade deal, but there will be an effort to de-escalate or put a pause on the situation.\u201d",
      "Trade is expected to dominate the week. Aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump said he would subsidize U.S. farmers if he did not reach a deal with China, and that he planned to discuss the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war with Xi, saying he\u2019d like to see China \u201chelp us out.\u201d",
      "The president also suggested he was angling for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, even as the White House has said that no meeting is planned.",
      "\u201cYou know, they don\u2019t have a lot of telephone service,\u201d Trump said, before urging reporters to \u201cput out the word.\u201d",
      "In Kuala Lumpur, Trump is scheduled to meet with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim before attending a working dinner with leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Malaysia, this year\u2019s ASEAN chair, has set \u201cinclusivity and sustainability\u201d as the summit theme.",
      "During his first term, Trump attended the annual ASEAN summit only once.",
      "The White House said Trump will also join a signing ceremony for a peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand, whose deadly border conflict he has claimed credit for helping to resolve.",
      "Sandwiched between the summit in Kuala Lumpur and South Korea\u2019s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, Trump will pay an official visit to Japan, his fourth, for talks with the new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, and an audience with Japanese Emperor Naruhito.",
      "Trump will also meet with business executives and visit American troops while in Japan, which hosts more U.S. service members than any other country in the world.",
      "Takaichi is a conservative protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom Trump forged a close personal relationship during his first term.",
      "On Friday, she pledged to raise defense spending to 2% of GDP by March, two years ahead of schedule. The new target is likely to draw praise from Trump, who has pressed for allies to spend more.",
      "Trump is concluding his trip in South Korea, where he is slated on Wednesday to address business leaders at the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, hold a bilateral meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and attend a leaders dinner.",
      "While in South Korea, Trump is also set to meet with Xi, the White House said, though China has not yet confirmed the session.",
      "Topping the agenda at every stop is trade, with negotiators still ironing out the details of pacts with South Korea and Japan and taking steps toward agreements with China and Malaysia. U.S. and Chinese delegations were meeting in Malaysia over the weekend to find a way forward after Trump threatened new tariffs of 100% on Chinese goods and other trade limits starting Nov. 1 in response to China\u2019s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals and related technologies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the U.S. president coming to Asia to meet the multilateral schedule; it\u2019s the U.S. president coming to Asia and then bending the multilateral schedule around his schedule,\u201d Cha said, noting that Trump is skipping the U.S.-ASEAN leaders meeting, the East Asia Summit and formal APEC sessions.",
      "Even so, Cha said, regional leaders are eager to engage.",
      "\u201cEverybody still wants to cut a deal with the U.S. president,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all want tariff relief, and they will try to make a deal to achieve that.\u201d",
      "During the meeting with Xi, Trump said he plans to raise the issue of fentanyl, accusing China of failing to curb the flow of precursor chemicals, and a senior administration official said China\u2019s purchases of Russian oil will also be on the table. Trump said he also expects to discuss Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us,\u201d Trump said Friday, adding that he expects \u201ca good meeting\u201d even as he has intermittently threatened to call it off over trade frictions, including China\u2019s halt to purchases of U.S. soybeans.",
      "Both leaders want the optics and tactical aspect of this meeting to go well, a person familiar with the meeting planning said.",
      "But analysts urged caution about what a leader-level encounter can deliver.",
      "\u201cDuring Trump\u2019s first term, high-level exchanges with China did not prevent him from later taking a harder line,\u201d said Sun Chenghao, a fellow at Tsinghua University\u2019s Center for International Security and Strategy. \u201cSo the symbolic value of summit diplomacy should not be overstated.\u201d",
      "Earlier this week, a senior administration official pushed back on speculation that Trump could reprise his 2019 encounter with North Korea\u2019s Kim, when he made a surprise visit to the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas in an effort to revive nuclear talks that had collapsed. Trump said before leaving Washington on Friday that he \u201cwould like\u201d to meet with Kim, but was unsure whether it would happen on this trip.",
      "Kim says he will negotiate only if the U.S. recognizes North Korea as a nuclear power, and he has only further strengthened his weapons programs since Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "\u201cI think they are sort of a nuclear power,\u201d Trump said as he began his journey to Asia on Friday, perhaps paving the way for a possible meeting. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of nuclear weapons, I\u2019ll say that.\u201d"
