    "story": [
      "Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine\u201d would seem to bear all the hallmarks of something grittier, darker and more disturbing than it is",
      "Benny Safdie\u2019s \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d isn\u2019t what you think it is, especially if you think it\u2019s a movie about a British guy who thinks his typewriter is the tops.",
      "\u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d would seem to bear all the hallmarks of something grittier, darker and more disturbing than it is. It\u2019s the solo directorial debut of the younger Safdie, whose films with his brother, Josh, have rarely not sprinted headlong into unsettling tumult. Add that sensibility to a true-life tale of a mixed martial arts fighter in the late \u201990s, and it\u2019s only natural to spend much of \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bracing for tragedy, for some ear-splitting descent into macho calamity.",
      "Yet \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d starring Dwayne Johnson as MMA pioneer Mark Kerr, is something simpler and less curious. A lack of probing was never anything you could accuse a Safdie brothers\u2019 movie of; these are the filmmakers who plunged a camera into the body cavity of a jewelry-store owner in \u201cUncut Gems.\u201d But, despite its grainy, VHS aesthetics, \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is a surprisingly conventional and oddly untroubled movie, albeit one that gives Johnson an indie-film platform for one of his finest performances.",
      "As Mark, Johnson has drained away much of his big-screen charisma. The part \u2014 brawny, often shirtless, frequently raging in the ring \u2014 is immediately so close to Johnson\u2019s own professional wrestling background that early scenes look almost documentary-like. But gone is the megawatt grin and the dashing eyebrow lift. Johnson\u2019s normally polished bald head is here covered with a closely cropped dark head of hair.",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening, Mark rhapsodizes about his feeling of domination. An opponent\u2019s fear, he says, you can \u201csmell in their scent.\u201d At this point, Mark has known only victory in thumping triumphs that leave him feeling like a god. Losing, he confesses, is unfathomable.",
      "The laws of moviedom decree, of course, that Mark will soon lose, and his well-earned sense of invincibility will shatter. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bounces between Mark\u2019s home and Japan, where the Pride Fighting Championship takes place. That\u2019s where Mark, a much-celebrated champion, is taken down by an illegal but nevertheless humbling move. After the fact, the match is ruled a tie, but the stink of defeat never dissipates.",
      "The real battle, in any case, is at home. Mark\u2019s dependence on opioids for the punishing extremes he endures is becoming desperate. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is based on John Hyams\u2019s 2002 documentary of the same name, and part of the nature of that film was the curiosity of Mark\u2019s extreme violence in the ring and his otherwise sweet passivity. In Safdie\u2019s film, Mark is asked in the doctor\u2019s waiting room if fighters hate each other during a bout. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he replies.",
      "But while we don\u2019t doubt Mark\u2019s sincerity \u2014 he\u2019s as earnest as he is muscle-bound \u2014 Johnson also exudes an inner turmoil, and a struggle to keep his rage at bay while nursing mounting wounds to his ego. His body is so stiff, it\u2019s like he could snap at any moment.",

      "That\u2019s the case for Mark, most of all, around his wife, Dawn Staples (Emily Blunt), a former Playboy model who's shown as alternatively supportive and insensitive to Mark\u2019s situation. They feud often, sometimes immediately before a match, sometimes over how to make his shakes. When he tries to give up opioids, he takes her late-night drinking as a provocation. \u201cTreat me like a man,\u201d he tells her.",
      "It\u2019s an awkward, perhaps judgmental characterization that would be all the more glaring if it weren\u2019t for Blunt\u2019s tact as a performer. But it throws \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d off course, especially when the movie seems to want to lean more on its other central relationship: that of Mark and his friend, trainer and sometimes competitor Mark Coleman (played by former Bellator champion Ryan Bader).",
      "In his films with his brother, Safdie has long brought real-life figures into their movie worlds, blurring fictional boundaries. Bader gives \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d a dose of documentary in his presence, but I\u2019d argue that Johnson\u2019s proximity to this world gives the movie its most compelling real-life echoes.",
      "I happen to think Johnson is also very good in full movie-star mode, especially when he has the chance to wryly undercut his big-screen presence in comedies like \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\u201d or \u201cThe Tooth Fairy.\u201d But it\u2019s also captivating to see him so thoroughly settled into a character like he is in \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d while totally shorn of his charisma.",
      "Yet the potency of that performance is let down by a movie that fails to really grapple with the violent world around Mark, resorting instead for a blander appreciation of these MMA combatants. What does resonate, though, is the portrait of a human colossus who learns to accept defeat \u2014 a mountain of a man who looks like he could, without barely trying, rip someone\u2019s head off at any moment. Instead he takes a deep breath, and doesn\u2019t.",

      "NEW YORK -- In 1983, six thieves muscled their way into a warehouse near Heathrow Airport, expecting to find a large sum of foreign currency. They got much more than they bargained for \u2014 26 million pounds worth of gold bars.",
      "What happened in the days and years next is the subject of PBS\u2019 \u201cMasterpiece\u201d enthralling series \u201cThe Gold,\u201d which traces the ripple effects of Britain's biggest robbery, going from a local search to infiltrating an international money laundering cartel. It starts airing Sunday.",
      "\u201cFrom the minute the show starts, the pressure's on,\u201d says showrunner Neil Forsyth. \u201cThere\u2019s a clock ticking, there\u2019s a net tightening and all these things. So it\u2019s lovely to write characters under that continual pressure.\u201d",
      "The so-called Brinks-Mat heist rocked Britain, leading to changes in banking laws, policing and shining a light on official corruption. Much of the gold was never located. It was melted down and sold back into the financial system, with the proceeds laundered into real estate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s literally in the bricks and mortar and the architecture that surrounds people everywhere,\u201d says Emun Elliott, who plays one of the detectives. \u201cThere might be a piece of that stolen gold in your wedding ring. It is everywhere.\u201d",
      "To tell the sprawling story of \u201cThe Gold,\u201d Forsyth streamlined timelines, combined real-life figures and adjusted events to fit the drama. Viewers are told the series was \u201cinspired by real events.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a strict factual drama,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t find that a very attractive route to go down creatively because I like having the space to create and that\u2019s extremely important if you\u2019re going to create something that\u2019s truly entertaining, truly gripping.\u201d",
      "One real person who is portrayed in the series is Brian Boyce, the principled and determined lead investigator, played by \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d star Hugh Bonneville.",
      "Boyce \u201cwas known to be a safe pair of hands,\u201d says Bonneville, who met the retired officer to prepare for the role. Boyce knew some officers in the department were corrupt and picked a lean, insular team to track down the gold and money.",
      "\u201cHe absolutely was adamant that not on his watch would police corruption thrive,\u201d Bonneville says. \u201cHe\u2019s a real man of integrity and I think that comes through. You\u2019ve got him against all odds trying to steer a level course and get this job done.\u201d",
      "Forsyth says the series' first episode attracted some 10 million viewers in the U.K. \u2014 or 1 in 5 of the adult population. He says he was in a restaurant with his wife once when the nearby table spent the whole meal discussing it, which was \u201csomewhat unnerving.\u201d",
      "Forsyth was only 5 and living in Scotland at the time of what he calls the \u201ciconic heist.\u201d Despite its impact on British society, no one had pieced it all together in a dramatization or an all-encompassing documentary until now.",

      "There's no doubt, just to continue that thought for a moment, that Daniel Day-Lewis is one of our greatest living actors \u2014 perhaps truly the best of them all. And so the first and most important thing to say about \u201cAnemone,\u201d a bleak, somber, absorbing but also sometimes frustratingly opaque collaboration with his director son Ronan, is that it's brought Day-Lewis back. He told us eight years ago that he was done with acting, and we hoped he was exaggerating. At least for now, it seems he was.",
      "As for the phone book: Well, there\u2019s a moment here where you might wish that was indeed the content you were hearing. In one of two remarkable monologues that punctuate a movie otherwise spare with words, Day-Lewis, playing a bitter and lonely recluse, lets loose an anecdote so shockingly scatological and epically disgusting \u2014 the script is co-written by father and son, by the way \u2014 that it\u2019s hard to erase from one\u2019s mind (still trying, here). Somehow, he makes it more fascinating than revolting \u2014 but it\u2019s a Herculean task, something Day-Lewis the actor is obviously no stranger to.",
      "The film's title refers to a flower that we briefly see growing in the lush woodlands where we find Day-Lewis\u2019 character, Ray, eking out the sparest of existences. The father-son writers take their time explaining why exactly Ray has consigned himself to this solitary life, but we get a key hint in the first frames of the film \u2014 violent kids\u2019 drawings, with stick figures carrying long guns, and severed limbs.",
      "We soon learn that both Ray and brother Jem (Sean Bean) were British soldiers, veterans of the early days of the Northern Ireland troubles. They're also victims of a violent childhood in care homes.",

Jem has found it in strict religious practice, and home life with Nessa, Ray's former partner, and Brian, their son.",
      "It is teenager Brian\u2019s deepening troubles that have spurred Jem to seek out his brother in the lush but forbidding woods, where Ray leads an ascetic life devoted to the most basic human survival.

But the brothers connect, slowly, in mundane activities like brushing their teeth, swimming in the ocean, or dancing wildly together.",
      "The words do come tumbling when Ray relates his tale of how he wrought revenge upon a priest who repeatedly molested him as a child. This bracing monologue \u2014 in which he describes defecating on the man in sickening detail \u2014 is only a precursor to an extraordinary speech later in the film that is vintage Day-Lewis, a searing account of the life-altering moment he killed a young boy. \u201cI don\u2019t need your absolution,\u201d he snarls to his brother, when the latter tries to veer him away from the guilt and shame that have crippled him for 20 years.",

      "It\u2019s been eight years since Daniel Day-Lewis announced his retirement from acting and said he wanted to \u201cexplore the world in a different way.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- It\u2019s been eight years since Daniel Day-Lewis announced his retirement from acting and said he wanted to \u201cexplore the world in a different way.\u201d",
      "But the big-screen absence of the actor many would peg as the greatest one alive ends with \u201cAnemone,\u201d a new film directed by his son, Ronan Day-Lewis. The two of them wrote it together. What began as something small, with no real ambition, grew until a full feature film and Day-Lewis\u2019 long-awaited return to movies.",
      "\u201cIt saddened me that I had perhaps ruled myself out of that when I decided to work on something else for a while,\u201d Day-Lewis said in an interview alongside his son. \u201cAs we progressed through it, and it seemed less and less possible to contain it, like two fellas in a shed, it began to alarm me slightly. I understood that this was going to involve the full paraphernalia of a film production, and that wasn\u2019t something I was eager to get back into.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we just kept moving forward to see what would happen,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd this is what happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnemone,\u201d which recently premiered at the New York Film Festival and which Focus Features releases Friday in theaters, finds Day-Lewis, now 68, not even slightly less intense or magnetic a performer. It\u2019s a father-son story, though not an autobiographical one. Day-Lewis stars as Ray Stoker, a solitary hermit living in a remote cabin. His brother, Jem (Sean Bean), arrives and tries to convince him to return to his teenage son.",
      "Since 2017\u2019s \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d Day-Lewis has, among other things, studied violin making in Boston. But he has also come to think of his declaration of retirement as a mistake, or not quite what he intended. At least, it wasn\u2019t enough to stand in the way of him making a movie with his son.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s been imagined on my behalf by numerous commentators, people that don\u2019t know me, that somehow the way I work has left me so debilitated I can barely open my eyes in the morning. This then requires a period of five or six years recovery!\u201d Day-Lewis says. \u201cThat was never the case. The work itself was always nourishing to me.\u201d",
      "Yet after making \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s London-set portrait of a perfectionist couturier, Day-Lewis was uncertain that he would ever regenerate the appetite to tackle another role.",
      "\u201cI definitely was brought low after I finished shooting \u201cPhantom Thread\u201d more than for any other reason because I anticipated being back in the public arena again,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd this is where I find myself now. And it\u2019s something I never found a solution to from the day I started doing this work until now. The public aspect of my life I\u2019ve always been baffled by.\u201d",
      "The most meaningful gesture Day-Lewis is offering his son might not be making a movie with him, but returning to the spotlight for it. At the New York Film Festival, Day-Lewis has been a happy, humble presence, calling himself a fool for his professed retirement and dutifully accepting a glare of attention that he\u2019s largely avoided for the last decade.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a stark reminder for me of: Oh, yeah, that\u2019s what it\u2019s like,\u201d he said, chuckling.",
      "But Day-Lewis greeted a reporter warmly, urging him to pull a chair \u2014 a Churchill, noted Day-Lewis, a craftsman and furniture maker \u2014 and spoke candidly and thoughtfully about the mystique that has often surrounded his work, an aura he disdains.",

      "\u201cI knew to survive in this world that that would probably be the way I\u2019d do it, by creating other worlds and escaping into them and living through them for a period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that remains the same. It never changed. I love that work, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t do it as an act of self-flagellation.\u201d",
      "Day-Lewis\u2019 Method-acting immersion in a character has long been the stuff of legend. Jim Sheridan, who directed him in three films, including \u201cMy Left Foot,\u201d once remarked, \u201cDaniel hates acting.\u201d But the idea that Day-Lewis somehow makes himself into a martyr for his art has long chafed with him.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s weighed heavily over the years, this sort of misconception which has now become so ludicrous about Method acting, which is a very bad name in the business now,\u201d says Day-Lewis. \u201cWe all find a different way of approaching the same problems. And when we\u2019re on the set, it makes no goddamn difference what system you train under, Meisner or Method or Stanislavski or whatever it might be. You\u2019re just there trying to live in those moments, to burn yourself up trying to find that truth as well as you can.\u201d",
      "Day-Lewis has sensed some of the same all-consuming imagination in Ronan, a 27-year-old painter making his directorial debut. He\u2019s one of two sons Day-Lewis has with his wife, filmmaker Rebecca Miller. (He also has an older son, Gabriel-Kane Day-Lewis, from his past relationship with Isabelle Adjani.) From a young age, Day-Lewis saw how invested his son was in creating imagery. Ronan, meanwhile, grew up marveling from a distance at his father\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cIt always held a huge amount of mystery to me what he was doing,\u201d says Ronan, who has vivid memories of being on set for films like \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d and \u201cThe Ballad of Jack and Rose.\u201d \u201cTo be inside this realm that I had always been watching curiously from the outside was so intriguing. But there were aspects of his process that still remained a mystery to me, which I think helped, actually.\u201d",
      "For Day-Lewis, building the character of Ray was a step-by-step process that included everything in his woodland world, right down to the expired tin cans of sardines that line his shelves. (\u201cThere were never enough sardines for me,\u201d he says, smiling.) \u201cAnemone\u201d unfolds in fits and starts, with several glorious, improvised monologues surrounded with strikingly lush imagery by Ronan. Day-Lewis so relishes pushing the boundaries of such a fictional world that, once in it, he tends to not want to let go.",
      "\u201cYou hope to create a world, an illusion. And when somebody says to you, \u2018That was the last shot. Go home now,\u2019 that was so bewildering to me because I\u2019m still invested in that world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not I have trouble letting go of it. The trouble I have is that I want to still splash around in that illusion.\u201d",
      "Still, it seems Day-Lewis has in \u201cAnemone\u201d avoided the kind of post-film feeling that followed \u201cPhantom Thread.\u201d The actor hasn\u2019t yet announced a forthcoming project, but he acknowledges feeling the capacity for more. While he doesn\u2019t say he missed acting during the last eight years, he appears to have come to some self-acceptance of its fundamental, irrevocable place in his life.",
      "\u201cIt has been my primary form of self-expression for my entire life, since I was a child,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd therefore, I don\u2019t know if I experience it as a sense of missing if I\u2019m not doing it. But the need to express myself in that way, even at a subterranean level, that is still there.\u201d",
      "But just as it\u2019s time to go, Day-Lewis offers \u201can appendix\u201d to his answer. If \u201cAnemone\u201d has left him still hungry for more, that fact is owed partly to the nature of its making. Not just that it was done with Ronan, but that they made it, themselves. It\u2019s Day-Lewis\u2019 first screenwriting credit.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s a completely new experience for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI never really dared attempt to write before, so it\u2019s a new thing. You can begin with absolutely nothing and the hunger can grow out of that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Filmmaker Raoul Peck examines the prophetic messages of George Orwell in \u201cOrwell: 2+2=5.\u201d",
      "Filmmaker Raoul Peck uses George Orwell\u2019s writings to weave together a biographical portrait of the author and a dispiriting picture of power and truth in the modern world in \u201cOrwell: 2+2=5.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s hardly the first to connect the dots between Orwell\u2019s prophetic writings and the current state of things \u2014 remember, sales for \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d soared in the months following Donald Trump\u2019s first election when phrases like \u201calternative facts\u201d were being used with no irony. Knowing that, Peck draws heavily on what has come before. The film is packed with clips from film adaptations of \u201c1984,\u201d including Michael Anderson\u2019s black and white version from 1956, and Michael Radford\u2019s, released in 1984, documentaries, like Robert Kane Pappas\u2019s 2003 warning \u201cOrwell Rolls in His Grave,\u201d and news footage from World War II through Gaza. In sum, it makes a persuasive point that things are only getting worse.",
      "\u201cOrwell: 2+2=5\u201d is loosely structured around Orwell\u2019s time on the Isle of Jura, in Scotland, where he wrote what would be his last novel, \u201c1984,\u201d while his health was deteriorating from tuberculosis. He went to Jura in 1946 and was dead by 1950. But this is no Wikipedia page or college lecture. There are no talking heads and no one explaining, \u201cWar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\u201d",
      "Instead, it\u2019s a loose assembly of biography, reflection and key moments of political awakening, with actor Damian Lewis narrating Orwell\u2019s words with a poetic gravitas, interspersed with a collage of images, words and archival footage. Anything from David Lean\u2019s \u201cOliver Twist\u201d and Sydney Pollack \u201cOut of Africa\u201d to Lauren Greenfield\u2019s \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d is on the table, and nothing is there carelessly. Alexei Aigui\u2019s powerful score adds a melancholy weight to sequences showing wartime destruction past and present along with the political phrases used to describe them: A \u201cstrategic bombing\u201d in Berlin in 1945, \u201cpeacekeeping operations\u201d in Mariupol in 2022, \u201cclearance operation\u201d in Myanmar in 2017.",
      "There\u2019s a purposefully disorienting effect to the film\u2019s editing, blending past, present, fiction and reality in such a way that it all begins to blur together. By the time we\u2019re hearing Lewis utter Orwell\u2019s famous phrase \u201cthe very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world\u201d while AI images pollute the screen, it\u2019s easy to forget that the quote is seven decades old. It won\u2019t prepare you for any kind of historical report on Orwell, totalitarianism or doublespeak, but its impact is undeniable.",
      "Orwell understood that every writer is a product of their own time. Born Eric Arthur Blair in Motihari, Bihar, then an outpost of the British Empire, Peck focuses in on a photograph of him as a baby with his Indian nursemaid. Describing himself as \u201clower upper middle class,\u201d Orwell attended Eton and served with the British Imperial Police in Burma (now Myanmar) and observed how power manifested in colonial outposts, how class unattainable in England was suddenly accessible to any white man simply because they were white. He considered himself both a snob and a revolutionary, which only intensified as he picked up more life experiences through the Spanish Civil War, his time at the BBC and simply observing ordinary people around him. It\u2019s actually quite extraordinary just how much information Peck, who has delved into the lives of James Baldwin, Karl Marx, Patrice Lumumba and Ernest Cole, is able to convey in just under two hours.",

      "Police video obtained by The Associated Press shows country music star Morgan Wallen denied throwing a chair off a Nashville bar roof before and after his 2024 arrest",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Country music star Morgan Wallen denied to police that he threw a chair off a Nashville honky-tonk bar roof before and after he was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment in 2024, police video obtained by The Associated Press shows.",
      "Roughly two weeks after his April 2024 arrest, Wallen commented on social media: \u201cI'm not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility\u201d and said he \u201cmade amends\u201d with Nashville law enforcement and others. Then in December, he pleaded guilty to two counts.",
      "The Metro Nashville Police Department released the footage of Wallen\u2019s arrest, captured by several officers' body and cruiser cameras, in response to a public records request from the AP. A previously released arrest affidavit did not get into the details of what Wallen told officers.",
      "A police car camera shows two officers, who were standing outside, react to something apparently falling from above on a late Sunday night. And one officer\u2019s body camera video begins with a shot of a broken chair in the road near his parked police cruiser, close to Chief\u2019s on Broadway, in the city's entertainment district.",
      "Then, as Wallen and his bodyguard team come down to the main entrance on Broadway, one of the men with Wallen is shouting, \u201cHe didn\u2019t see anything. You don\u2019t have witnesses, you are accusing!\u201d",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t throw nothing, he didn\u2019t throw nothing,\u201d the bodyguard continues, and accuses two bar workers of \u201cbeing aggressive.\u201d",
      "When an officer asks Wallen what happened, the musician replies, \u201cI don't know.\u201d",
      "He later tells another officer, \u201cWe\u2019ve not tried to cause no problems, man. I don\u2019t know what they are \u2014 I don\u2019t know why.\u201d",
      "That officer said police were figuring out what happened after a chair came flying off the roof and landed by his patrol car. Wallen replied, \u201cAs you should.\u201d",
      "At one point, Wallen is on his cellphone, then points it at the officer and says, \u201cEric Church is on the phone.\u201d Church, another country star, co-owns Chief's. During the call, Wallen had used an expletive to describe the officers he said were \u201ctrying to take me to jail outside of your (expletive) bar.\u201d",
      "Church, who can't be heard on the police recording, recommended to the officer that Wallen wait in a private space instead of standing on the public sidewalk, said a representative for Church.",
      "The officer responds: \u201cIt\u2019s not really something we can do. Law enforcement have to enforce the laws. Figure out what happened. We\u2019ve got a supervisor coming to the scene. Gotta treat it like we would with anybody else.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Wallen did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Back in the bar, police were in an office watching security footage from the roof, body camera footage shows. The security video was not clear from the officers' body cameras and a police spokesperson said there was no security camera footage from the bar in the case files.",
      "The officers return outside and a sergeant, who says he watched security video of Wallen throwing a chair off the roof, handcuffs him.",

In 2021, after a video surfaced of him using a racial slur, he was disqualified or limited from several award shows and received no Grammy nominations for his massively popular \u201cDangerous: The Double Album.\u201d",
      "Wallen was talkative in the cruiser, the footage shows, saying, \u201cI ain't done nothing wrong,\u201d and pressing the officer for his favorite country musicians.",

      "\u201cTR is one of the best dudes in the world. He would definitely not be getting arrested,\u201d Wallen adds.",
      "Wallen pleaded guilty in December 2024 to two misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment. He was sentenced to spend seven days in a DUI education center and be under supervised probation for two years.",
      "When the judge asked how he would plead, he said, \u201cConditionally guilty.\u201d His attorney has said the charges will be eligible for dismissal and expungement after he completes probation.",

      "Bad Bunny captivated audiences with his residency in Puerto Rico, inspiring patriotism and drawing half a million people to the island this summer",
      "NEW YORK -- Crowds wore maga flowers and \u201cpavas\u201d \u2014 straw hats traditionally worn by j\u00edbaros, Puerto Rican rural farmers. They drank Medalla beer and danced salsa.",
      "Over the course of a 31-date residency at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, Bad Bunny worked a miracle, inspiring patriotism in the hearts of a proud Boricua people, and in those traveling to Puerto Rico for the first time. He performed on two stages, one showcasing the island's natural beauty with its flamboyan and plantain trees, and another, a casita (\u201clittle house\u201d), for the pari de marquesina, a house party.",
      "If all the world's a stage \u2014 might as well make it home.",
      "In February, it can be expected that the artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio will bring the same spirit to the 2026 Super Bowl. And he'll do so in Spanish \u2014 a landmark moment for Latino culture.",
      "Bad Bunny's \u201cNo Me Quiero Ir De Aqu\u00ed\u201d residency (in English, \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Leave Here\u201d) bypassed a traditional U.S. tour, bringing approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generating an estimated $733 million for Puerto Rico. Across three hours, attendees were guided through a musical history \u2014 reggaet\u00f3n hits from Bad Bunny's singular discography as well as the folkloric styles of his latest album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos.\u201d (\u201cI Should Have Taken More Photos.\")",
      "There was a political history, too: like in the affecting song \u201cLo Que Pas\u00f3 a Hawaii,\u201d (\u201cWhat Happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for Puerto Rico's autonomy. Or 2022's \u201cEl Apag\u00f3n\u201d (\u201cThe Blackout\u201d), in reference to Hurricane Maria, its aftermath and the continued anger and frustration over persistent, chronic power outages.",
      "Of course, a Super Bowl halftime show traditionally runs 12 to 15 minutes. It's not a lot of time to bring Puerto Rico, or its complicated colonial history, to the NFL's mainstream \u2014 but it is enough for a taste.",
      "It's worth mentioning Benito has done so before: making a surprise appearance at the Super Bowl in 2020, during Shakira and Jennifer Lopez's performance. He sang in Spanish alongside two artists whose bilingual hits helped usher in a crossover era for Latin music in the \u201800s. He\u2019s a direct inheritor of their successes, and he's been able to kick the door down further \u2014 helping to establish an industry where Latino superstars need not record their music in English to have a career.",
      "Bad Bunny is simultaneously an interesting and an obvious choice for the NFL: One of the most popular artists on the planet who understands that going global means embracing the local, performing during the most-watched television program of the year.",
      "In a recent interview with i-D Magazine, Bad Bunny mentioned that one of the reasons his residency bypassed the continental U.S. were concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos.",
      "\u201cThere was the issue of \u2014 like, (expletive) ICE could be outside (my concert). And it\u2019s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,\u201d he told the publication, referencing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico since large-scale arrests began in late January, surprising many in the U.S. territory that has long welcomed migrants.) It resonated with Latinos and the Spanish speaking community, who have grown increasingly weary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation.",
      "Bad Bunny has long been critical of Trump and backed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \u201cI will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader,\u201d he said in a video last year.",
      "For some Trump supporters, Bad Bunny's booking at the 2026 Super Bowl is a divisive political pick. Conservative commentator Benny Johnson described Bad Bunny as an \u201canti-ICE activist\" on Instagram.",

      "At the very least, Bad Bunny, who performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, is set to make history, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.",
      "The question is \u2014 what messages will Bad Bunny deliver in a culture where identity is politicized? And what does it mean that his performance arrives in the midst of one of the largest immigration crackdowns in U.S. history, where Latinos are especially vulnerable?",
      "In February, Kendrick Lamar's 2025 Super Bowl halftime performance made art of his short set, offering a meta commentary on race and America. \u201cThe revolution \u2019bout to be televised,\u201d he announced early in the performance.",
      "It featured actor Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam, whose character critiqued the rapper and his dancers dressed in red, white and blue for being \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d reminding them to \u201cplay the game.\u201d There was the sense that Lamar was breaking the fourth wall, reminding viewers of the NFL's political associations following Colin Kaepernick\u2019s kneeling protests and the Black Lives Matter movement.",
      "That Lamar was able to weave American themes into his history-making performance as the first solo hip-hop artist to ever headline the coveted slot will no doubt benefit Bad Bunny. At the very least, he may learn from the rapper's layered and conceptual narratives, that messages on the NFL stage do not need to be explicit to be effective.",
      "At every date of his residency, Bad Bunny invited celebrities \u2014 among them LeBron James, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2014 to join in his party. He also performed with many musicians, including Puerto Rico heavyweights Jowell y Randy, Arc\u00e1ngel and notably Marc Anthony. The pair duetted \u201cPreciosa,\u201d which is viewed as one of Puerto Rico\u2019s unofficial anthems.",
      "Written by Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn in 1937, \u201cPreciosa\u201d references Puerto Rico\u2019s hybrid identity \u2014 a mix of Spanish, African and the indigenous Taino cultures \u2014 and threats made to the island in its long colonial history. (\u201cNo importa el tirano te trate con negra maldad,\u201d goes the chorus. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that the tyrant treats you with black hatred.\u201d) It also arrived shortly after the 1937 Ponce massacre, in which a peaceful march organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party ended in a police shooting where 19 died and 200 were injured.",
      "It's common for Super Bowl halftime performances to bring surprise guests into their sets \u2014 and no doubt Bad Bunny will do the same \u2014 but who he chooses will wait to be seen. If he pulls from the book of Lamar, any collaboration may have veiled political weight \u2014 informed by his residency, but softened for the NFL crowd.",

      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors urged a New York federal judge Tuesday to send Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs to prison for over 11 years following his conviction on prostitution-related charges, citing one of his accusers who said she lives in fear of the music mogul's release from detention.",
      "\u201cHis crimes of conviction are serious and have warranted sentences over ten years in multiple cases for defendants who, like Sean Combs, engaged in violence and put others in fear,\u201d they wrote in a presentence submission requesting at least 11 years and three months in prison.",
      "They filed their sentencing recommendation shortly after midnight, including letters from some of his accusers describing how his violence and demands had impacted their lives.",
      "They called Combs \u201cunrepentant\u201d and said Combs had conceded his acts of violence and abuse throughout his trial but \u201cincredibly, ... he now argues that his victims should shoulder the blame.\u201d",
      "Combs, 55, has remained jailed since his July conviction on charges related to arranging male sex workers to travel to hotels or residences where he directed them to have sex with his girlfriends.",
      "The elaborate dayslong, drug-fueled sexual events were often filmed by Combs. Defense attorneys have asked that he be sentenced to no more than 14 months in prison. Sentencing is set for Friday.",
      "In July, Combs was convicted of two charges for violating the Mann Act, which outlaws interstate commerce related to prostitution, for arranging the paid sexual encounters between his girlfriends and male sex workers. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.",
      "The same jury acquitted the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that could have resulted in a life sentence.",
      "Last week, the defense submitted its presentence arguments, saying Combs has suffered enough during his nearly 13 months behind bars that he should be freed soon.",
      "They wrote that he became a changed man in a Brooklyn federal lockup, where he has been under constant suicide watch and learned to react calmly to threats rather than violently, even when a fellow inmate confronted him with a shiv.",
      "They said Combs has realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in.",
      "Prosecutors said Combs was now trying to cast himself as a victim.",
      "\u201cHe is not the victim,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe Court should focus on the very real effects that the defendant\u2019s conduct had on the lives of the actual victims, his victims.\u201d",

She testified that an enraged Combs once put her in a chokehold and punched her in the face.",

I testified that from age nineteen, Sean Combs used violence, threats, substances, and control over my career to trap me in over a decade of abuse.\u201d",

      "\u201cMy worries that Sean Combs or his associates will come after me and my family is my reality. I have in fact moved my family out of the New York area and am keeping as private and quiet as I possibly can because I am so scared that if he walks free, his first actions will be swift retribution towards me and others who spoke up about his abuse at trial,\u201d Cassie said.",

      "After Combs was convicted, Judge Arun Subramanian immediately refused a defense request to grant him bail.",

    "story": [
      "New rules that limit the access of journalists in the Pentagon and appear to condition entry into the building on agreement to restrictions have led to a standoff between the press and the Trump administration's defense department",
      "Journalists who cover the Pentagon and the Trump admnistration are in a standoff about new rules that limit the access of the media to most areas within the Pentagon and appear to condition overall entry to the building on an agreement to restrictions in reporting.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's team characterizes the changes as an effort to protect national security and the safety of those who work at the Pentagon, while many in the press see it as an effort to exert control and avoid embarrassing stories.",
      "Journalists who want to hold on to badges that permit access to the Pentagon were told on Sept. 19 they must sign a letter acknowledging the new rules by this Tuesday or the badge \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d The new policy says that Defense Department information \u201cmust be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if unclassified.\u201d Classified material faces even tighter restrictions.",
      "That level of control immediately alarmed journalists and their advocates.",
      "\u201cAsking independent journalists to submit to these kinds of restrictions is at stark odds with the constitutional protections of a free press in a democracy, and a continued attempt to throttle the public's right to understand what their government is doing,\u201d said Charles Stadtlander, spokesman for The New York Times.",
      "In a subsequent letter to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Hegseth aide Sean Parnell suggested that journalists misunderstood some of the new rules. He said, for example, that the restriction against releasing unclassified information is the policy that Pentagon officials must follow \u2014 not something the journalists must abide by.",
      "\u201cIt should come as no surprise that the mainstream media is once again misrepresenting the Pentagon's press procedures,\u201d Parnell said in a post on X. \u201cLet's be absolutely clear: Journalists are not required to clear their stories with us. That claim is a lie.\u201d",
      "However, the new policy says that journalists who encourage Pentagon officials to break the rules \u2014 in other words, ask sources for information \u2014 could be subject to losing their building access.",
      "While it appeared that Parnell sought to soften some of the hard edges of his policy in response to questions raised by the reporters' committee, there's still enough confusion to merit a meeting to clear things up, said Grayson Clary, a lawyer for RCFP. There's some wariness among news organizations about what they would be agreeing to if they sign the letter, and it's not clear how many people \u2014 if any \u2014 have done so.",
      "The new rules continue a tense relationship between the press and the Hegseth team, which had already evicted some news outlets from their regular workspaces in favor of friendlier outlets and limited the ability of reporters to roam around the Pentagon. Hegseth and Parnell seldom hold press briefings.",
      "Parnell did not respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt's control, just 100% control,\u201d said Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine. Goldberg, who is not stationed at the Pentagon, wrote the most embarrassing story of Hegseth's tenure so far when he was inadvertently included in a Signal group chat where Hegseth and other national officials discussed an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen. The brouhaha became widely known as \u201cSignalgate.\u201d",
      "Pentagon leadership was also reportedly unhappy over a story that said Elon Musk was to get a briefing on military strategy for China, leading President Donald Trump to stop it, and other stories about initial assessments of damage in the military strike against Iran.",
      "No American reporter accredited to the Pentagon that he knows is interested in subverting national security or putting anyone in the military in harm's way, Goldberg said.",
      "In his own case, Goldberg did not report on what he learned until after the attack was over. He said he contacted officials in the group chat to ask if there was anything he learned that was harmful to the country in any way. He did not include in his story the name of a CIA official mentioned in the messages who was technically still undercover, he said.",
      "\u201cThe only people in Signalgate who were putting American troops in harm's way were the national leadership of the United States by discussing on a commercial messaging app the launch times of strikes on a hostile country,\u201d he said.",

With the exception of a few areas, reporters are not permitted under the new rules to walk through the Pentagon without an official escort.",
      "Priest said the corridors of the Pentagon were like areas around Congress where reporters buttonhole politicians. Priest recalled staking out military officials waiting for them to come out of a bathroom.",
      "\u201cThey know the goal of the media is to get around the official gobbledygook and get out the truth,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThey may not help you. But some of them want to help Americans know what is going on.\u201d",
      "Experienced national security reporters know there are many ways to get information, including through other channels of government and people in the private sector. \u201cThe Pentagon is always very well versed in the advantages of controlling the story, so they always try to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reporters know that. They've known that for decades.\u201d",
      "Reporters who don\u2019t follow the new rules won\u2019t necessarily be expelled immediately, Parnell told the reporter\u2019s committee. But access will be determined by Hegseth\u2019s team.",
      "While reporters already stationed in the Pentagon were given until Sept. 30 to sign, they were allowed to request an additional five days for legal review.",
      "Although the Times, Washington Post and Atlantic all put out statements against the Pentagon's plan, none of the publications would say what they have recommended that their reporters do \u2014 perhaps an indication that they consider negotiations potentially fruitful.",
      "President Donald Trump hasn't hesitated to fight the media when he thinks he's been wronged, launching lawsuits against CBS News, ABC News, The Wall Street Journal and the Times. Yet he's also frequently accessible to the press, more so than many of his predecessors, and there has been some uncertainty in the White House about the Pentagon's policy.",
      "When a reporter asked, \u201cshould the Pentagon be in charge of deciding what reporters can report on?\u201d the president replied, \u201cNo, I don't think so. Listen, nothing stops reporters. You know that.\u201d",
      "Goldberg noted that it's more than just an issue for reporters. \u201cThe American people have a right to know what the world's most powerful military does in their name and with their money,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seems fairly obvious to me.\u201d",

      "Bad Bunny has been chosen to headline the Super Bowl halftime show, marking a significant moment for Latin identity on a major stage",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The selection of Bad Bunny to headline the Super Bowl halftime show is about more than music.",
      "The move signals a cultural spotlight for Latin identity at America\u2019s most-watched television event. It also raises fresh questions about how much space there will be for his trademark symbolism and social commentary \u2014 including his past criticism of President Donald Trump \u2014 given the NFL's history of keeping performances tightly managed.",
      "Here are some things to know about the selection.",
      "The halftime show is a collaboration between the NFL, Roc Nation and Apple Music.",
      "Roc Nation, Jay-Z\u2019s entertainment company, has curated performers since 2019 and returns alongside veteran producer Jesse Collins. Apple Music distributes the performance, while the NFL ultimately controls the stage, broadcast and branding.",
      "Artists don\u2019t get a paycheck for performing. However, their payoff is global exposure. That imbalance gives the league leverage, though history shows that high-powered stars sometimes defy the league\u2019s guardrails.",
      "The NFL has a track record of pushing back when artists get political. However, some performers don't always comply.",
      "\u2022 In 2020, the league asked Jennifer Lopez to cut a segment featuring children in cages, a critique of U.S. immigration policies. She refused.",

      "\u2022 Rapper M.I.A. flashed a middle finger during Madonna\u2019s set, earning a hefty fine in 2012. She and the NFL ultimately reached a settlement ending their multimillion dollar dispute a couple years later.",
      "While Bad Bunny is a known hitmaker, he\u2019s also an artist who ties his music to Puerto Rican identity, colonial politics and immigrant struggles. His Super Bowl announcement included a pointed dedication: \u201cThis is for my people, my culture, and our history.\u201d",
      "That alone sets the stage for a performance that could carry layered meanings far beyond spectacle.",
      "In his career, Bad Bunny has become one of the world\u2019s most streamed artists with albums such as \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti,\u201d an all-Spanish-language record.",
      "The 31-year-old artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has won three Grammys and 12 Latin Grammys. He has become a global ambassador for Latin music, starred in films such as \u201cBullet Train,\u201d \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d and \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d and collaborated with top fashion houses. He enters November's Latin Grammys as the leading nominee with 12, dethroning producer and songwriter \u00c9dgar Barrera.",
      "Bad Bunny has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. In the final weeks of the 2024 campaign, he backed former Vice President Kamala Harris after a comedian at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally mocked Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",

      "Trump has a long history of inserting politics into sports. He\u2019s pushed for the late Pete Rose\u2019s Hall of Fame induction, threatened to block Washington\u2019s new stadium deal if the team didn\u2019t restore its old name, and frequently used sporting events as political platforms.",

      "And just last month, Trump inserted himself into the backlash over Cracker Barrel\u2019s new logo, posting on Truth Social that the company should stick with its old design. When the chain reversed course, he celebrated the decision as a personal victory.",
      "For Bad Bunny, the halftime show is the ultimate stage to showcase his music, heritage and global influence. For the NFL and Apple Music, it\u2019s a balancing act: deliver a spectacle that celebrates diversity without igniting controversy that scares off advertisers.",
      "If Bad Bunny leans strictly into spectacle, the moment could be historic for Latin music. If he threads in political symbolism, it could become one of the most dissected halftime performances in Super Bowl history.",

      "\u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s widely acclaimed American epic of rebellion and resistance, opened with $22.4 million in ticket sales from North American theaters over the weekend",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s widely acclaimed American epic of rebellion and resistance, opened with $22.4 million in ticket sales from North American theaters over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Anderson\u2019s ultracontemporary opus signifies a major gamble by Warner Bros. With \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d the studio is making a $130 million-plus bet that audiences would come out for 170-minute-long powerhouse drama from one of cinema\u2019s most celebrated auteurs the way they usually only turn up for a franchise or superhero movie.",
      "Anderson, many critics said, delivered the movie of year. \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor and Sean Penn, has been hailed as a film brimming with many of the political conflicts of today. Oscar prognosticators have pegged it this year\u2019s best-picture front-runner. Aided by DiCaprio\u2019s drawing power, the film added $26.1 million overseas.",
      "But good reviews, star power and a marquee filmmaker are nowadays often insufficient to make a hit. For a movie that cost at least $130 million to make, plus many millions more to market, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will have a long road to reach profitability. For most releases with such a high budget, a $22.4 million start would be a disappointment.",
      "Executives for Warner Bros. declined to be interviewed about the opening.",
      "Yet \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d like movies from earlier movie eras, will hope its time in theaters is more about the long run than opening weekend. Warners is hoping word-of-mouth, awards conversation and a rolling awareness that \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is a major movie event, will keep ticket sales strong in the weeks, or even months, to come.",
      "Some signs suggest that\u2019s possible. Audiences gave \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore. That\u2019s far better than CinemaScores for previous Anderson wide releases, including 1997\u2019s \u201cBoogie Nights\u201d (\u201cC\u201d), 1999\u2019s \u201cMagnolia\u201d (\u201cC-\u201d) and 2002\u2019s \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d (\u201cD+).",
      "\u201cThe long-term playability is going to be key for this,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cAnd given the outpouring of support by critics and audiences, alike, that's where it's going to make back its budget.\u201d",
      "Yet as highly regarded as Anderson is, his films have rarely made a big impact at the box office. His biggest hit was 2007\u2019s \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d which collected $76.4 million worldwide.",
      "For Warner Bros., \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d marked its ninth movie this year to open No. 1, more than any other studio. That success \u2014 with $4 billion in global sales \u2014 has included some refreshingly original films that haven\u2019t always made their most obvious way into theaters.",
      "Warners released Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners\u201d in April, and it went on to gross $366.7 million worldwide. \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d chose to opt out of the usual fall festival platforms for prestige films, and first screened while most critics were in Venice or Toronto. Yet \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will likely be favorites for many of the same prizes in the coming awards season.",
      "Anderson\u2019s film, loosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cVineland,\u201d stars DiCaprio as a former revolutionary living off the grid with his teenage daughter (Chase Infiniti). Shot in VistaVision, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d played in several large-screen formats, including 70mm, IMAX, 70mm and, on four screens, in VistaVision.",
      "Second place went \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie.\u201d The Universal Pictures release, produced by DreamWorks Animation, grossed $13.5 million in 3,500 theaters. It\u2019s a good start for the G-rated film, based on the long-running series. \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie,\u201d which cost $32 million to make, also earned an \u201cA+\u201d CinemaScore from audiences.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Federal officials have approved another generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, a regulatory formality that quickly triggered pushback from anti-abortion groups and politicians aligned with the Trump administration.",
      "Drugmaker Evita Solutions announced on its website that the Food and Drug Administration signed off on its low-cost form of the pill, which is approved to end pregnancies through 10 weeks.",

      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri also criticized the move in a post on X, stating: \u201cI have lost confidence in the leadership at FDA.\u201d",
      "The criticism comes as Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s top health officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., face growing pressure from abortion opponents to reevaluate mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago and has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.",
      "In a letter to Republican attorneys general last month, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary pledged to conduct a full review of the drug\u2019s safety.",
      "The FDA approved the original version of mifepristone in 2000 and gradually eased access over time. That included approving the first generic pill, from drugmaker GenBioPro, in 2019.",
      "In 2021, the FDA under Democratic President Joe Biden permitted online prescribing and mail-order delivery of the drug, greatly expanding access. Abortion opponents have been fighting the change ever since.",
      "Approval of generic drugs is typically a rote process at the FDA, with multiple copycat versions usually approved after the patent on the original drug expires. In most cases, generic drugmakers only need to show that they're drug matches the ingredients and formula developed by the original drugmaker.",

      "The idea of meditating can be intimidating to beginners",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea of meditating can be intimidating. Beginners may imagine sitting uncomfortably in silence while breathing deeply and scrubbing all thoughts from their minds. The prospect of trying those techniques at work may feel embarrassing.",
      "But there are ways to bring short, inconspicuous sessions into the workday if you want to see if meditation can help you deal with challenging customers or reduce anxiety while preparing for a presentation. And experienced practitioners say there's no right or wrong way to do it.",
      "\u201c Meditation is quite easy, as a matter of fact. I think there\u2019s a stigma around it, that you have to be in complete silence, and you have to have some room setup, or do some chanting, or some serious breathing,\u201d said Michelle Beyer, a wellness coach who owns the Brooklyn women\u2019s gym Alana Life & Fitness. \u201cThere\u2019s one-minute meditations you can do to make yourself feel great. Nobody will even know you\u2019re doing them.\"",
      "While there are different meditation techniques, many traditions encourage focusing on breathing to help calm the mind. When thoughts pop up, imagine letting them go. Practitioners say meditating before or at work helps them maintain focus, sit still and reduce stress.",
      "\u201cThere is a calm that I am definitely missing when I have forgotten to do it for a few days,\u201d said Brianna Healy, who meditates for 10 minutes daily before starting her job as assistant director of strategic initiatives and data solutions at Naropa University, a college in Boulder, Colorado, that is inspired by Buddhist principles. \u201cI can always tell the difference in my demeanor.\"",
      "If you feel pressed for time, try fitting meditation sessions into breaks. You can set a timer and focus on breathing while sitting at a desk, in a restroom, inside a vehicle or outside, Beyer said.",
      "Here are some easy mini-meditations to try out on the job.",
      "Commuters can consider getting to work a little early and taking a pause in their cars or a quiet location to decompress from getting out the door and to your destination, said Kathryn Remati, a meditation teacher and author of \u201cBefriend Yourself.\u201d If you only have a minute or two, that's still enough time to try Remati's instructions for a quick reset.",
      "Close your eyes and take a long, slow, deep breath to fill your tummy and lungs with air, she said. Hold the breath for a second, and then slowly breathe out like you're blowing out a candle. \"You\u2019ll immediately feel a shift and you\u2019ll feel like a human again,\u201d Remati said.",
      "While repeating that process, consider setting a positive intention, or goal, for the day. Instead of focusing on a to-do list, think about how you want behave towards others, she said. Some intention examples are, \u201cToday I\u2019m going to be productive, but I\u2019m also going to a good listener\u201d or \u201cI want to have a positive attitude,\u201d she said.",
      "Visualization is another technique that experienced meditators use. Picture yourself succeeding at the challenges you\u2019ll encounter that day. If there\u2019s an upcoming deadline, envision yourself finishing the task 10 minutes early. Jumping for joy. Get specific like a movie director and imagine the colors in the room or the feeling of wind on your face, Remati said.",
      "Throughout the day, \u201cyou can bring up that image anytime you need it to refocus,\u201d she said.",
      "You can also use visualization to reframe your perspective on colleagues or clients. A technique Remati recommends putting into practice before meetings may seem quirky: Envision a white light over the meeting room's doorway that showers the people entering with brightness. Remati says it may help you imagine them in a better light. \u201cYou can even put some sort of pink bubble around people,\" she added.",
      "Another short meditation that can be done almost anywhere involves breathing deeply and mentally scanning your body for sensations, a technique popularized in the U.S. by mindfulness practitioner Jon Kabat-Zinn. Depending on your location and comfort level, you can keep your eyes open or closed.",

      "\u201cYou\u2019re intentionally scanning your body,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about, how do your feet feel in your shoes? How do your ankles feel? Knees, hips, ribs, shoulders, neck, head, and by the time you know it, you checked in with every part of your body.\"",
      "Another discreet meditation technique is breathing deeply and joining your pointer finger to your thumb to form a circle. You can do this if you feel your stress level rising. \u201cSay to yourself, whenever I put my finger and thumb together, I will be able to be peaceful and open-minded,\u201d Remati said.",
      "If you're in a meeting and start to feel resentful or left out, you can do it under the table, and no one will know, she added. Remati does this herself if she notices she's becoming judgmental or short-tempered. \u201cYou just do the finger and thumb, take a nice deep breath, get grounded, and then get back into the meeting and feeling positive,\u201d she said.",
      "One of Beyer's favorite techniques is best done when there aren't a lot of people nearby. Truck drivers can do it in traffic. You inhale, and then when you're breathing out, you hum with your lips closed, she said.",
      "\u201cIt's going to immediately take down stress levels in the body and even in the mind,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cWhen you inhale and you focus on humming, then your brain is focused on that, not the \u2018what ifs' or the worries that like to take over when we feel stressed.\u201d",
      "If you feel self-conscious about humming in a quiet office, you can step outside or head to a noisier place.",
      "The shoulder and jaw release technique also may help relax the bodies of train passengers or drivers or stuck in traffic, Beyer said. To start, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Repeat that, and then on the third exhale, roll your shoulders back. Inhale a fourth time and then on the next exhale relax your tongue and jaw, Beyer said. Finally, inhale again, bring your attention to your hands and just let them hang heavy, she said. Then breathe in and out a sixth time.",
      "Another technique Remati encourages is saying mantras or affirmations, which are positive statements or slogans you repeat to yourself. You can write them down and say them in your head or out loud while breathing deeply, before a meeting or at any point throughout the day.",
      "Some phrases you might say: \u201cI am calm.\" Deep breath. \u201cI am confident.\u201d Deep breath. \"I am ready for success,\u201d Remati suggested. \u201cI speak my truth. I am patient. I am here for the highest good of all.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats kept their promise to reject any Republican spending bill that didn\u2019t extend or restore health care benefits, choosing instead to force a government shutdown. Now they have to figure out how to get out of it.",
      "Just hours after the shutdown began, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said that if the Republicans work with them, \u201cthe shutdown could go away very quickly.\u201d",
      "But that won\u2019t be easy. Republican leaders \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump \u2014 have said that they won\u2019t negotiate or be \u201cheld hostage \u201d by Democrats demanding concessions to reopen the government. The bill Democrats voted against was a simple extension of funding for 45 days, legislation they say should be noncontroversial.",
      "While that uncompromising Republican position may not last long \u2014 there were some early, informal talks on the Senate floor Wednesday \u2014 reaching a deal would be difficult. It\u2019s deeply uncertain, for now, if the two sides could find common ground on health care policy or sow enough trust for the Democrats to change their position.",
      "At the same time, an extended shutdown could be increasingly painful for Democrats. The Trump administration has threatened to lay off thousands of workers and target Democratic-leaning states. On Wednesday, the White House announced it was putting a hold on subway and tunnel projects in Schumer\u2019s home state of New York.",
      "\u201cThis Democrat shutdown is actually delaying progress on the issues that Democrats claim to be interested in,\u201d Thune, who represents South Dakota, said on the Senate floor Wednesday.",

      "Republicans, who hold the majority, need eight Democrats to win the 60 votes needed for passage in the 53-47 Senate. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was the only Republican to vote with Democrats against the measure.",
      "Thune is holding repeated votes on the measure, which failed 55-45 on Tuesday night and again Wednesday morning. He said he hopes that five Democrats will eventually feel the pressure and support the bill \u201cwhen they realize that this is playing a losing hand.\u201d",
      "Republicans are eyeing several moderate Democrats who appeared to be wavering before casting \u201cno\u201d votes on Tuesday night, including Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Gary Peters of Michigan. Both voted to keep the government open in March, along with Schumer, while many of their colleagues voted for a shutdown.",
      "But Shaheen and Peters each voted no on Tuesday after extensive negotiations with colleagues in both parties on the floor. Shaheen said afterward that \u201cI have been in intensive conversations with colleagues from both sides of the aisle on how to find a path forward and I\u2019m eager to work with my Republican colleagues to find common ground.\u201d",

The American people don\u2019t want us to fund the destruction of their health care and the destruction of our democracy.\u201d",
      "The divisions in the caucus pose a dilemma for Schumer, who was blasted by base voters and activists in March when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. Many Democrats in the House and Senate have suggested that shutting down the government is their only leverage to fight Trump and push back on his policies, including health care and spending cuts.",
      "\u201cStanding up to (Trump) on this is sending a message to him on those other issues as well,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.",

      "October is the ideal month to get protected, experts say, because flu cases typically begin climbing in November.",
      "\u201cThe best time is today. If you haven\u2019t already had it, get it. I got mine yesterday,\u201d said Dr. Laura Riley, of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.",

      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "Just about everyone age 6 months and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and major medical societies. Despite lots of recent misinformation and confusion about vaccines, the flu recommendations haven\u2019t changed.",

      "Tens of thousands of Americans die from the flu every winter. But during last year\u2019s harsh season, the CDC counted 280 children who died of flu-related complications. Nearly half had no prior health problems and about 90% hadn't been fully vaccinated.",
      "Another concern from last season: The CDC counted more than 100 children who developed a rare flu complication \u2014 brain inflammation that can lead to seizures, hallucinations, or even death. Very few were vaccinated.",

      "When the tax credits expire at the end of 2025, enrollees across the income spectrum will see costs spike. Annual out-of-pocket premiums are estimated to increase by 114% \u2014 an average of $1,016 \u2014 next year, according to the KFF analysis.",

      "The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an \u201cenvironmental ethic\u201d in his first speech.",

      "The Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases in the last five years that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people\u2019s federal food benefits",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A single mother who relied on federal food assistance lost her benefits in 2020 after Kentucky investigators concluded she\u2019d committed fraud.",
      "The state alleged she had made multiple same-day purchases, tried to overdraw her account a few times, entered a few invalid PINs and sometimes made \u201cwhole-dollar\u201d purchases that are unlikely during typical grocery runs.",
      "The woman from Salyersville in Appalachian Kentucky had an explanation: She worked at the store. She would sometimes buy lunch there and then get groceries after work. Her child would also occasionally use her card.",
      "An administrative hearing officer kicked her off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) regardless, based solely on the allegedly suspicious shopping pattern. She sued \u2014 and won.",
      "\u201cIt is draconian to take away SNAP benefits from a single mother without clear and convincing evidence that intentional trafficking was occurring during a time when food scarcity is so prevalent,\u201d Franklin County Judge Thomas Wingate said in his 2023 decision.",
      "Over the last five years, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people\u2019s food benefits.",
      "Judges, lawyers and legal experts said in interviews and in court documents that such evidence proves little. Kentucky Public Radio reviewed dozens of administrative hearing decisions and court documents from the last five years in which the cabinet relied on shopping patterns to prove a person had \u201ctrafficked,\u201d or sold, their benefits.",
      "Kentucky is so aggressive in disqualifying people from SNAP benefits that the state is second in the nation for per-capita administrative disqualifications, behind Florida, according to the most recent federal data from 2023.",
      "In the last decade, disqualifications in Kentucky rose from fewer than 100 in 2015 to over 1,800 in 2023. And more than 300 others have been accused of selling or misusing their benefits since January 2024, according to records obtained by Kentucky Public Radio.",
      "Another Franklin County judge in 2023 ordered the cabinet to stop disqualifying individuals based solely on transactional data, but since the decision, at least three lawsuits allege the health agency continues to bring such cases.",
      "Transactional data alone cannot prove intent to commit fraud nor show the actual result of any individual transaction, University of Kentucky law professor Cory Dodds said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that folks didn\u2019t do it, didn\u2019t commit the fraud, but I don\u2019t think the cabinet in a lot of these cases has met their burden of proof, either.\u201d",
      "Kentuckians receive notice of their alleged suspicious activity through mailed letters, in which they\u2019re asked to voluntarily waive their right to a hearing and automatically accept the punishment. On first offense, that\u2019s generally a one-year SNAP ban. They\u2019re also required to repay the full amount the state says they misused.",
      "Often, these cases involve a relatively small amount of money. Records show that more than 900 people have been kicked off for \u201ctrafficking\u201d or misuse for less than $1,000 since 2022. The lowest amount alleged was 14 cents.",
      "The state has leaned heavily on administrative hearing waivers since 2015, and by 2023, almost a quarter of all disqualifications were via waiver. Some lawsuits allege individuals did not fully understand the consequences of the waivers and were encouraged to sign by officials.",
      "Kentucky Public Radio reviewed more than two dozen cases since 2020 in which the cabinet accused an individual of trafficking using only spending patterns, despite the participants\u2019 denial or lack of response \u2014 and with no other evidence or interviews presented, according to administrative hearing decisions.",
      "Kendra Steele, a spokesperson for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, declined to schedule an interview with cabinet officials after multiple requests. Steele said in an email that \u201cwe have never\u201d brought trafficking cases based solely on transactional data and acknowledged it would not be sufficient to prove intent.",
      "In response to a different question, Steele wrote the investigation into fraud allegations consists of looking into income, living situations \u201cand patterns of spending that are indicative of trafficking.\u201d She did not indicate how any of those factors could be used to prove intentional misuse or selling of SNAP benefits, or how it differs from relying on transactional data \u2014 which is inherently a pattern of spending. Steele said in another email that they also interview vendors and SNAP recipients.",
      "Roughly 4 in 25 Kentuckians suffer from food insecurity, similar to the national rate of about 14%, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The USDA will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d The decision comes in the wake of federal funding cuts for food and nutrition safety net programs nationwide.",
      "In the last fiscal year, 1 in 8 Kentuckians benefitted from SNAP, formerly called food stamps. Food insecurity in Kentucky\u2019s rural areas is even more stark, and legal representation harder to come by.",
      "\u201cThe people who benefit from these programs are some of the folks that we need to be helping the most in this country,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cIt\u2019s our fellow Kentuckians who are going hungry as a result of baseless allegations of waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d",

But administrative hearing decisions reviewed by KPR from 2020 through 2023 included evidence the cabinet relied on; hearing officers would frequently say a person had trafficked their benefits based on shopping patterns the state deemed suspicious.",
      "National legal experts who specialize in SNAP access say an overreliance on transactional data isn\u2019t unique to Kentucky. Transactional data was initially meant as a tool to identify potential fraud cases \u2014 not as a means to prove it, Georgetown law professor David Super said.",
      "He\u2019s studied SNAP disqualifications for decades, and has seen many cases where he believes transactional data is misconstrued as direct evidence of wrongdoing, instead of requiring a state to build cases with witnesses, affidavits, video evidence and plea deals.",
      "In one redacted 2023 state administrative hearing decision, a hearing officer decided a woman in the eastern Kentucky city of McKee had trafficked her benefits because she had made eight back-to-back transactions in a year. The decision also said she\u2019d checked her balance several times, made a few insufficient fund attempts and had incorrectly entered her PIN number a few times.",
      "She lost her SNAP benefits for a year. In an appeal, the woman told the state she has two kids and had recently discovered she was pregnant.",
      "\u201cEveryone forgets to get something and has to go back in the store and get it,\u201d she wrote, defending her back-to-back purchases.",
      "She received another hearing, but the outcome didn\u2019t change.",
      "Cabinet officials acknowledged in cross examinations during a 2023 case that back-to-back transactions and whole-dollar purchases aren\u2019t forbidden under SNAP rules, nor are recipients told that the cabinet considers them suspicious.",
      "But all of these things are used as evidence \u2014 sometimes the sole evidence \u2014 that a person misused their benefits.",
      "Kristie Goff, an AppalRed legal aid lawyer in Prestonsburg in southeast Kentucky, used to see many of these cases, though they\u2019ve declined in the last year.",
      "\u201cThere have been very few instances in cases I have handled, where a client was not able to give me a perfectly reasonable explanation for those transactions, and none of it was trafficking,\u201d Goff said. \u201cThere are no receipts, there\u2019s no video footage to show that someone\u2019s doing anything wrong. It\u2019s just a number written on a paper.\u201d",
      "While saying purchasing history is insufficient to prove trafficking, Kentucky judges have stopped short of demanding that the state change how it trains employees or conducts its SNAP investigations.",
      "In response to an open records request, the cabinet provided KPR with documents used to train investigators on intentional program violations. They appear to almost exclusively discuss transactional data, including investigating back-to-back payments, large transactions and whole-dollar purchases.",
      "In 2020, Michigan appellate judges decided transactional data alone is never sufficient to prove that a business \u2014 or person \u2014 fraudulently used SNAP benefits.",
      "Dodds believes that should be the standard for all states, including Kentucky.",
      "He is in the early stages of systematically reviewing thousands of SNAP benefit trafficking hearing decisions between 2020 and 2023. Data from about 700 decisions in 2020 alone already shows that many Kentuckians have been denied benefits before the state presents what he considers real evidence of guilt.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a handful of cases that I would say there was real evidence that they had done something wrong,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cThere was one where a woman was on the phone with the hearing officer while she was actively trying to sell her benefits. ... But cases with non-transactional data are exceedingly rare.\"",

      "A Seattle-area nonprofit group called Community Loaves donates home-baked bread and cookies to food banks in four states",
      "On a recent Saturday near Seattle, Cheryl Ewaldsen pulled three golden loaves of wheat bread out of her kitchen oven.",
      "The fragrant, oat-topped bread was destined not for her table, but for a local food bank, to be distributed to families increasingly struggling with hunger and the high cost of groceries.",
      "\u201cI just get really excited about it knowing that it\u2019s going to someone and they\u2019re going to make, like, 10 sandwiches,\u201d said Ewaldsen, 75, a retired university human resources director.",
      "Ewaldsen is a volunteer with Community Loaves, a Seattle-area nonprofit that started pairing home bakers with food pantries during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and hasn\u2019t stopped.",
      "Since 2020, the organization headed by Katherine Kehrli, the former dean of a culinary school, has donated more than 200,000 loaves of fresh bread and some 220,000 energy cookies to food banks. They come from a network of nearly 900 bakers in four states \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California and Idaho \u2014 and represent one of the largest such efforts in the country.",
      "Now, amid rising grocery prices and federal cuts to food aid for low-income people, demand for the group's donations of nutritious baked goods is greater than ever, Kehrli said.",
      "\u201cMost of our food banks do not get any kind of whole-grain sandwich bread donation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we ask what we could do better, they just say, \u2018Bring us more.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ewaldsen\u2019s bread goes to the nearby Edmonds Food Bank, where the client list has swelled from 350 households to nearly 1,000 in the past three years, according to program manager Lester Almanza.",
      "Nationwide, more than 50 million people a year receive charitable food assistance, according to Feeding America, a hunger relief organization.",
      "Anti-hunger experts say they expect the need to rise as recent federal legislation sharply cutting food aid to poor people takes effect. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the tax and spending cuts bill Republicans muscled through Congress in July means 3 million people would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.",
      "Gauging the impact, however, could soon be more difficult after the U.S. Agriculture Department recently said it would halt an annual report on hunger in America, saying it was redundant, costly and politicized \u201csubjective liberal fodder.\u201d After 30 years, the 2024 report, to be released on Oct. 22, will be the last, the agency said.",
      "\u201cEnding data collection will not end hunger, it will only make it a hidden crisis that is easier to ignore and more difficult to address,\u201d Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said in a statement.",
      "Almanza said federal funding for his food bank has dropped at least 10% this year, meaning that every donation helps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that a lot of people rely on,\u201d he said.",
      "That includes people like Chris Redfearn, 42, and his wife, Melanie Rodriguez-Redfearn, 43, who turned to a food bank in Everett, Washington, last spring after moving to the area to find work. They had to stretch their savings until she began a new position this month teaching history at a local college. Chris Redfearn, who has worked for decades in business, is still looking.",
      "\u201cThe food pantry assists with anywhere from $40 to $80 worth of savings weekly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to keep ourselves afloat.\u201d",
      "Finding homemade bread from Community Loaves at a food pantry was a surprise, the couple said. Often, surplus bread sent by grocery stores includes highly processed white breads or sweets donated near their expiration or sell-by dates.",

      "\u201cThey make it really wholesome and fibrous,\u201d Chris Redfearn said. \u201cIt mimics most of the health-conscious breads that are out there.\u201d",
      "The notion of donating home-baked bread came to Kehrli, 61, during the pandemic, when she was displaced from her job at the busy Seattle Culinary Academy.",
      "\u201cI love to bake and just an idea sparked: Would it be possible for us to help from our home and get important valuable nutrition to our food banks?\u201d she recalled.",
      "Many food pantries don\u2019t accept or distribute donations of homemade baked goods. Feeding America warns individual bakers against the practice, saying \u201csince food banks can\u2019t confirm how your baked goods were made or their ingredients, they can\u2019t be donated.\"",
      "But health department rules vary by state, Kehrli learned. In Washington and the other three states where Community Loaves now operates, bread is one of the few foods allowed to be donated from a home kitchen through a program like theirs.",
      "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to donate custard pies. We wouldn\u2019t be able to donate lasagna,\u201d Kehrli said. \u201cBut bread is deemed safe. Anything that is fully baked and does not require refrigeration.\u201d",
      "Still, Community Loaves bakers must follow approved recipes for the bread and two types of energy cookies. They obtain flour from common sources, and bake and deliver on a shared schedule twice a month.",
      "The bakers buy their own supplies, donating the cost of the ingredients as well as their time. Most make a few loaves per baking session before delivering them to local \u201chubs,\u201d where other volunteers collect the bread and transport it to the food banks.",
      "Bakers range from former professionals to beginners. A robust website with recipes and how-to videos backstops every step, Kehrli said.",
      "Baking the bread is satisfying on several levels, said Ewaldsen, who has donated nearly 800 loaves in less than two years. Part of it is addressing the physical need for food, but part is also addressing the spiritual hunger for connection with neighbors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the opportunity for me to bake something and to share something with others in the community, where they don\u2019t necessarily need to know who I am, but they know that there\u2019s a community that loves and cares for them,\u201d she said.",
      "While such sentiments are sincere and admirable, anti-hunger experts stress that individual donations can't take the place of adequately funded government services for struggling Americans.",
      "\u201cIt's beautiful that our communities act this way,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino of the Food Research & Action Center. \u201cBut it is a loaf of bread. That is going to feed one person \u2014 and there are millions in line.\"",

      "As mental health chatbots driven by artificial intelligence proliferate, a small number of states are trying to regulate them",
      "In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI \u201ctherapy\u201d as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice.",
      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.",
      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

      "Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people.",

      "Many AI apps are optimized for engagement and are built to support everything users say, rather than challenging peoples\u2019 thoughts the way therapists do. Many walk the line of companionship and therapy, blurring intimacy boundaries therapists ethically would not.",
      "Therabot\u2019s team sought to avoid those issues.",
      "The app is still in testing and not widely available. But Jacobson worries about what strict bans will mean for developers taking a careful approach. He noted Illinois had no clear pathway to provide evidence that an app is safe and effective.",
      "\u201cThey want to protect folks, but the traditional system right now is really failing folks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, trying to stick with the status quo is really not the thing to do.\u201d",

She studies the weekly inventory from Good Shepherd, Maine\u2019s only food bank, for good deals on butter and cheese.",
      "Every Monday morning, she shops at three different stores, keeping lists of prices in her head and remembering what particular clients want. On a recent trip to Sam\u2019s Club, she was searching for affordable eggs.",

      "The eggs were destined for Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard, the food pantry in Winterport, Maine, that Allen has helped run for the past 17 years. Every Wednesday, she and a tightknit group of volunteers provide 25 to 30 families with heaping bags of food.",
      "Maine has long been one of the most food insecure states in New England. Directors of food pantries say the task of making sure people are fed is getting harder because of diminishing food supplies, increasing demand and an overwhelming reliance on volunteers, many of whom are retirees with ages up into their 80s.",
      "About one in seven people in rural Waldo County, where Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard is, were food insecure in 2023, a rate that was similar to the state and national average, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying on Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration cut more than $1 billion from two U.S. Department of Agriculture programs \u2014 the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides free food to food banks nationwide, and the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which provides funds to state, territorial and tribal governments to purchase food from local farmers for distribution to hunger relief organizations.",
      "\u201cI can watch the availability of federal food going down every month,\u201d Allen said.",
      "Charitable food networks are also bracing for $186 billion in cuts for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the federal low-income nutrition program better known as food stamps. In turn, Feeding America predicts that food pantries will see more demand.",
      "Complicating matters is the infrastructure through which the U.S. distributes most food to those who need help. In Maine, the nearly 600 hunger relief agencies that get free and low-cost food from Good Shepherd Food Bank rely on volunteers. This includes 250 food pantries as well as soup kitchens, senior centers, shelters, schools and youth programs.",

      "In more than 17 years of service, Ritchie said, \u201cI\u2019ve only missed twice.\u201d He drives 20 miles (32 kilometers) each way to dole out groceries and fill bags with \u201csurprises\u201d \u2013 donated items like Girl Scout cookies.",

      "The new minimum effective tax would apply to people who earn over 600,000 reais (approximately $113,000) a year, ramping up from zero to 10% for those who earn over 1,200,000 reais (some $226,000) annually.",

Nothing felt nostalgic; it read as a contemporary reroute through familiar landmarks.",
      "The choice, strategically, was canny. In a season of debuts, a brand this loud risks either pastiche or retreat. Freitas managed neither. He reopened the playbook and ran classic Mugler moves \u2014 shoulder/waist control, latex sheen, dramatic feathers, theater \u2014 with an insider\u2019s discipline.",

The accused men were \u201cassociated with the police\u201d in Vietnam and had met with officers at the police training college near Wellington, Luxon said when the episode emerged last December.",
      "The woman, Ali Cook, told The Associated Press that she and the other server were attacked in a private karaoke room by two men who pulled them into their laps, pinned them against a wall and groped them. She said she was forced to drink alcohol and believed she was also drugged.",
      "Cook, a U.S. national who was then 19, said she sustained an injury in the assault. The women reported the attack to the authorities the next day.",
      "The Associated Press does not usually identify people who say they were subjected to sexual abuse, but Cook said she preferred to have her name used.",

    "story": [
      "Syria is due to hold parliamentary elections for the first time since its autocratic former president, Bashar Assad, was unseated in December",
      "BEIRUT -- BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Syria is set to hold parliamentary elections on Sunday for the first time since the fall of the country\u2019s longtime autocratic leader, Bashar Assad, who was unseated in a rebel offensive in December.",
      "Under the 50-year rule of the Assad dynasty, Syria held regular elections in which all Syrian citizens could vote. But in practice, the Assad-led Baath Party always dominated the parliament, and the votes were widely regarded as sham elections.",
      "Outside election analysts said the only truly competitive part of the process came before election day \u2014 with the internal primary system in the Baath Party, when party members jockeyed for positions on the list.",
      "The elections to be held on Sunday, however, will not be a fully democratic process either. Rather, most of the People\u2019s Assembly seats will be voted on by electoral colleges in each district, while one third of the seats will be directly appointed by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa.",
      "Despite not being a popular vote, the election results will likely be taken as a barometer of how serious the interim authorities are about inclusivity, particularly of women and minorities.",
      "Here\u2019s a breakdown of how the elections will work and what to watch.",
      "The People\u2019s Assembly has 210 seats, of which two-thirds will be elected on Sunday and one-third appointed. The elected seats are voted upon by electoral colleges in districts throughout the country, with the number of seats for each district distributed by population.",
      "In theory, a total of 7,000 electoral college members in 60 districts \u2014 chosen from a pool of applicants in each district by committees appointed for the purpose - should vote for 140 seats.",
      "However, the elections in Sweida province and in areas of the northeast controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have been indefinitely postponed due to tensions between the local authorities in those areas and the central government in Damascus, meaning that those seats will remain empty.",
      "In practice, therefore, around 6,000 electoral college members will vote in 50 districts for about 120 seats.",
      "The largest district is the one containing the city of Aleppo, where 700 electoral college members will vote to fill 14 seats, followed by the city of Damascus, with 500 members voting for 10 seats.",
      "All candidates come from the membership of the electoral colleges.",
      "Following Assad\u2019s ouster, the interim authorities dissolved all existing political parties, most of which were closely affiliated with the Assad government, and have not yet set up a system for new parties to register, so all candidates are running as individuals.",
      "The interim authorities have said that it would be impossible to create an accurate voter registry and conduct a popular vote at this stage, given that millions of Syrians were internally or externally displaced by the country's nearly 14-year civil war and many have lost personal documents.",
      "This parliament will have a 30-month term, during which the government is supposed to prepare the ground for a popular vote in the next elections.",
      "The lack of a popular vote has drawn criticism of being undemocratic, but some analysts say the government's reasons are legitimate.",

      "Haid Haid, a senior research fellow at the Arab Reform Initiative and the Chatham House think tank said that the more concerning issue was the lack of clear criteria under which electors were selected.",
      "\u201cEspecially when it comes to choosing the subcommittees and the electoral colleges, there is no oversight, and the whole process is sort of potentially vulnerable to manipulation,\u201d he said.",
      "There have been widespread objections after electoral authorities \u201cremoved names from the initial lists that were published, and they did not provide detailed information as to why those names were removed,\u201d he said.",
      "There is no set quota for representation of women and religious or ethnic minorities in the parliament.",
      "Women were required to make up 20% of electoral college members, but that did not guarantee that they would make up a comparable percentage of candidates or of those elected.",
      "State-run news agency SANA, citing the head of the national elections committee, Mohammed Taha al-Ahmad, reported that women made up 14% of the 1,578 candidates who made it to the final lists. In some districts, women make up 30 or 40% of all candidates, while in others, there are no female candidates.",
      "Meanwhile, the exclusion of the Druze-majority Sweida province and Kurdish-controlled areas in the northeast as well as the lack of set quotas for minorities has raised questions about representation of communities that are not part of the Sunni Arab national majority.",
      "The issue is particularly sensitive after outbreaks of sectarian violence in recent months in which hundreds of civilians from the Alawite and Druze minorities were killed, many of them by government-affiliated fighters.",

      "Officials have also pointed to the one-third of parliament directly appointed by al-Sharaa as a mechanism to \u201censure improvement in the inclusivity of the legislative body,\u201d Haid said. The idea is that if few women or minorities are elected by the electoral colleges, the president would include a higher percentage in his picks.",
      "The lack of representation of Sweida and the northeast remains problematic, Haid said \u2014 even if al-Sharaa appoints legislators from those areas.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is that regardless of how many people will be appointed from those areas, the dispute between the de facto authorities and Damascus over their participation in the political process will remain a major issue,\u201d he said.",

      "Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg is set to abdicate the throne on Friday after 25 years, passing the role to his eldest son, Guillaume",
      "LUXEMBOURG -- A monarchy at the heart of Europe is preparing for a generational change. Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg will abdicate the throne on Friday after 25 years as head of state in favor of his eldest son, Guillaume. Henri has filled the largely ceremonial role of grand duke alongside his Cuban-born wife, Grand Duchess Maria Teresa, as the government steered the country through troubles like the 2008 financial crisis, the greatest shock to Luxembourg\u2019s economy since the 1970s.",
      "The tall and reserved 70-year-old Henri was educated in France, Switzerland and at the United Kingdom's military academy Sandhurst. His 43-year-old son followed a similar path \u2014 going to school in London, Switzerland, France and Sandhurst before working in Belgian, German and Spanish firms. He is married to Belgian-born Countess St\u00e9phanie de Lannoy; they have two sons, aged 5 and 2.",
      "After his father abdicates in a ceremony at the Grand Ducal Palace, built of yellow stone and decorated with spires and ironwork, Guillaume will be crowned and then swear an oath to Luxembourg's constitution before the 60 elected members of the Chamber of Deputies, the duchy's parliament. After taking over from his father, Guillaume will tour the small nation, about the size of Rhode Island, and end with a Sunday mass with Archbishop Jean-Claude Hollerich at the Catholic Notre-Dame de Luxembourg cathedral.",
      "One of the European Union's smallest nations and its richest per capita, Luxembourg is a financial powerhouse that hosts important EU institutions like the European Court of Justice and the European Investment Bank. The grand duchy is home to many of the banks in the eurozone, reinsurance companies, and managers of hedge funds and money markets.",
      "Its economy is strong, with virtually no unemployment. Cleaved from what is now France, Belgium and Germany in the 17th and 19th centuries, the small nation is a parliamentary democracy with the grand duke as head of state, akin to King Charles in the United Kingdom or King Philippe in Belgium. Roughly 700,000 citizens speak a mix of Luxembourgish, a Germanic language, and French and German in public life. Also widely spoken are English and Portuguese. Many people fled to Luxembourg from Portugal during the dictatorship of Ant\u00f3nio Salazar in the 1960s.",
      "Guillaume will be Luxembourg\u2019s seventh grand duke since 1890, when the modern monarchy was established. Complex royal politics, as well as the loss of significant territories over the centuries, has meant Luxembourg is not a kingdom. It is the world's last remaining grand duchy.",
      "Henri laid out the challenges ahead for Guillaume and Luxembourg in his last Christmas speech.",
      "\u201cClimate change is probably the greatest challenge of the future, but geopolitical tensions, wars and economic upheaval also require a need for reflection,\u201d he said. Luxembourg is \u201ca crossroads of cultures\u201d with strong traditions of democracy, freedom and human rights, he said while defending multilateralism as it comes under increased threat across the world.",
      "The grand duke \"stands above party politics,\" Henri said. He added, \u201dThis does not mean, however, that he cannot take a stand on the fundamental interests of the country and its citizens.\u201d",
      "Christoph Br\u00fcll, a historian and professor at the University of Luxembourg, said the grand duke's position is central for protocol, like accrediting ambassadors, \"but it\u2019s not the grand duke who gives the big orientations in political life, that\u2019s the government.\u201d",

      "VALHALLA, New York -- Pepsi has a new challenge: keeping products like Gatorade and Cheetos vivid and colorful without the artificial dyes that U.S. consumers are increasingly rejecting.",
      "PepsiCo, which also makes Doritos, Cap'n Crunch cereal, Funyuns and Mountain Dew, announced in April that it would accelerate a planned shift to using natural colors in its foods and beverages. Around 40% of its U.S. products now contain synthetic dyes, according to the company.",
      "But just as it took decades for artificial colors to seep into PepsiCo\u2019s products, removing them is likely to be a multi-year process. The company said it\u2019s still finding new ingredients, testing consumers\u2019 responses and waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve natural alternatives. PepsiCo hasn\u2019t committed to meeting the Trump administration\u2019s goal of phasing out petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of 2026.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to launch a product that the consumer\u2019s not going to enjoy,\u201d said Chris Coleman, PepsiCo\u2019s senior director for food research and development in North America. \u201cWe need to make sure the product is right.\u201d",
      "Coleman said it can take two or three years to shift a product from an artificial color to a natural one. PepsiCo has to identify a natural ingredient that will have a stable shelf life and not change a product\u2019s flavor. Then it must ensure the availability of a safe and adequate supply. The company tests prototypes with trained experts and panels of consumers, then makes sure the new formula won\u2019t snag its manufacturing process. It also has to design new packaging.",
      "Tostitos and Lay\u2019s will be the first PepsiCo brands to make the shift, with naturally dyed tortilla and potato chips expected on store shelves later this year and naturally dyed dips due to be on sale early next year. Most of the chips, dips and salsas in the two lines already are naturally colored, but there were some exceptions.",
      "The reddish-brown tint of Tostitos Salsa Verde, for example, came from four synthetic colors: Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 40 and Blue 1. Coleman said the company is switching to carob powder, which gives the chips a similar color, but needed to tweak the recipe to ensure the addition of the cocoa alternative wouldn\u2019t affect the taste.",
      "In its Frito-Lay food labs and test kitchens in Plano, Texas, PepsiCo is experimenting with ingredients like paprika and turmeric to mimic the bright reds and oranges in products like Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos, Coleman said.",
      "The company is looking at purple sweet potatoes and various types of carrots to color drinks like Mountain Dew and Cherry 7Up, according to Damien Browne, the vice president of research and development for PepsiCo\u2019s beverage division based in Valhalla, New York.",
      "Getting the hue right is critical, since many consumers know products like Gatorade by their color and not necessarily their name, Browne said.",
      "\u201cWe eat with our eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at a plate of food, it\u2019s generally the different kinds of colors that will tell you what you would like or not.\u201d",
      "When the Pepsi-Cola Company was founded in 1902, the absence of artificial dyes was a point of pride. The company marketed Pepsi as \u201cThe Original Pure Food Drink\u201d to differentiate the cola from rivals that used lead, arsenic and other toxins as food colorants before the U.S. banned them in 1906.",
      "But synthetic dyes eventually won over food companies. They were vibrant, consistent and cheaper than natural colors. They are also rigorously tested by the FDA.",
      "Still, PepsiCo said it started seeing a small segment of shoppers asking for products without artificial colors or flavors more than two decades ago. In 2002, it launched its Simply line of chips, which offer natural versions of products like Doritos. A dye-free organic Gatorade came out in 2016.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking for those little signals that will become humongous in the future,\u201d Amanda Grzeda, PepsiCo\u2019s senior director of global sensory and consumer experience, said of the company's close attention to consumer preferences.",
      "Grzeda said the whisper PepsiCo detected in the early 2000s has become a roar, fueled by social media and growing consumer interest in ingredients. More than half of the consumers PepsiCo spoke to for a recent internal study said they were trying to reduce their consumption of artificial dyes, Grzeda said.",

      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it's expediting approval of natural additives after calling on companies to halt their use of synthetic dyes. In May, the FDA approved three new natural color additives, including a blue color derived from algae. In July, the agency approved gardenia blue, which is derived from a flowering evergreen.",
      "The FDA banned one petroleum-based dye, Red 3, in January because it was shown to cause cancer in lab rats. And in September, the agency proposed a ban on Orange B, a synthetic color that hasn't been used in decades.",
      "Six synthetic dyes remain FDA-approved and widely used, despite mixed studies that show they may cause neurobehavioral problems in some children. Red 40, for example, is used in 25,965 food and beverage items on U.S. store shelves, according to the market research firm NIQ.",
      "But even if decades of research has shown that synthetic colors are safe, PepsiCo has to weigh public perceptions, Grzeda said.",
      "\u201cWe could just blindly follow the science, but it probably would put us at odds with what our consumers believe and perceive in the world,\u201d she said.",
      "PepsiCo also has to balance the needs of consumers who don\u2019t want their favorite snacks and drinks to change or get more expensive because of the costs of natural dyes. NIQ data shows that unit sales of products advertised as free of artificial colors fell sharply in 2023 as prices rose.",
      "Susan Mazur-Stommen, a small business owner in Hinton, West Virginia, picked up some Simply brand Cheetos Puffs recently at a convenience store because they were the only variety available. She found the texture to be much different from regular Cheetos Puffs, she said, and their pallid color made them less appetizing.",
      "Mazur-Stommen said she agrees with the move away from petroleum-based dyes, but it\u2019s not a critical issue for her.",
      "\u201cWhat I am looking for is the original formulation,\u201d she said.",
      "Ultimately, PepsiCo does not want customers to have to choose between natural colors and familiar flavors and textures, Grzeda said.",

      "The average long-term mortgage rate rose this week to 6.34% from 6.3% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.12%.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year yield was at 4.10% at midday Thursday, down from 4.19% the same time last week. Much of that decline has come in the past few days, driven by discouraging reports on the U.S. economy, particularly the job market.",
      "In late July, mortgage rates started declining in the lead-up to the Federal Reserve\u2019s widely anticipated decision last month to cut its main interest rate for the first time in a year amid growing concern over the U.S. job market.",
      "However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has since signaled a cautious approach to future interest rate cuts. That\u2019s in sharp contrast with other members of the Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee, particularly those who were appointed by President Donald Trump, who are pushing for faster cuts.",
      "The housing market has been in a slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. So far this year, sales are running below where they were at this time in 2024.",

In the following weeks however, mortgage rates began rising again, eventually reaching just above 7% in mid-January this year.",
      "Like last year, the Fed\u2019s rate cut doesn\u2019t necessarily mean mortgage rates will keep declining, even as the central bank signals more cuts ahead.",
      "Still, the late-summer decline in mortgage rates has already encouraged many homeowners who bought in recent years after rates climbed well above 6% to refinance to a lower rate.",
      "Mortgage rates will have to sink below 6% to make refinancing an attractive option to a broader swath of homeowners, however. That\u2019s because about 81% of U.S. homes have a mortgage with a rate of 6% or lower, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Economists generally forecast the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain near the mid-6% range this year.",

Since it completed the CrownRock acquisition in December 2023, Occidental has sold off roughly $4 billion worth of assets to help it pay down $7.5 billion in debt. This OxyChem deal will accelerate that.",

      "French authorities have announced the captain of an oil tanker linked to Russia's shadow fleet will face trial in February",
      "PARIS -- The captain of an oil tanker immobilized off the country\u2019s Atlantic coast which President Emmanuel Macron linked to Russia will go on trial in February over the crew's alleged refusal to cooperate, a French prosecutor said Thursday.",
      "Macron has alleged that the tanker belongs to Russia\u2019s so-called shadow fleet of aging tankers of uncertain ownership that are avoiding Western sanctions over Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine and didn't rule out that it could have been involved in drone flights over Denmark as it was sailing last week off the coast of the Nordic country.",
      "Asked about whether the tanker could be linked to drones flights, Macron said that \u201cI\u2019m very cautious because our services and our justice are still working ... I don\u2019t exclude it at all, but I cannot here attribute very clearly and establish a clear link between these two phenomenon.\u201d",
      "Speaking at a European summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, Macron said that the French navy faced \u201cinappropriate and extremely aggressive behavior\u201d towards the French frigate and helicopters that had been deployed to board the taker, which justified the opening of a judicial investigation.",
      "St\u00e9phane Kellenberger, prosecutor of the western port city of Brest, said that two Chinese crew members, the captain and the chief mate, who had been detained since Tuesday, were released from police custody. The chief mate has been released without charge.",
      "A preliminary investigation was opened into the crew\u2019s \u201crefusal to cooperate\u201d and \u201cfailure to justify the nationality of the vessel\u201d after the Atlantic Maritime Prefect alerted justice authorities Monday, Kellenberger said. The inquiry showed the captain couldn't be directly considered responsible for the second offense, he added.",
      "Kellenberger said that members of the French navy intervened and boarded the ship on Saturday off France's Atlantic coast in line with international law when there appeared to be a discrepancy between its apparent nationality and real nationality.",
      "An investigation led by the French navy concluded that the ship, coming from Russia and heading to India with a \u201clarge oil shipment,\u201d was flying no flag, he said.",
      "The captain was summoned for trial in Brest on Feb. 23. He faces up to one year in prison and a 150,000-euro ($176,000) fine.",
      "French military spokesman Col. Guillaume Vernet said that the ship was ordered to stay in place in a safe area.",
      "In comments earlier Thursday in Copenhagen, Macron praised the work of the French navy to \u201cidentify the presence of a shadow fleet.\"",
      "\u201cYou kill the business model by detaining even for days or weeks these vessels and forcing them to organize themselves differently,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cIt represents more than 30 billion euros. So it\u2019s extremely important to increase the pressure on this shadow fleet, because it will clearly reduce the capacity to finance this war effort for Russia,\u201d he said.",

      "In April, Estonian public broadcaster EE reported that the ship, then identified under the name \u201cKiwala,\u201d was stopped outside Tallinn Bay on way to the Russian port of Ust-Luga. At the time, Prime Minister Kristen Michal posted on social media that Estonia\u2019s navy had \u201cdetained a sanctioned vessel with no flag state\u201d and authorities had boarded the ship -- without specifying.",
      "The ship, now known as \u201cPushpa\u201d or \u201cBoracay,\u201d left the Russian oil terminal in Primorsk near St. Petersburg on Sept. 20, and sailed off the coast of Denmark. It has stayed off the coast of the French western port of Saint-Nazaire since Sunday, according to the Marine Traffic monitoring website.",
      "The tanker, whose name has changed several times, was sailing under the flag of Benin and appears on a list of ships targeted by European Union sanctions against Russia.",
      "Asked by journalists about it, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that he had \u201cno information\u201d on the ship. He also said that many countries were carrying out \u201cprovocative actions\u201d against Russia.",
      "The shadow fleet is made up of used, aging tankers that were often bought by nontransparent entities with addresses from countries that haven't sanctioned Russia. Their role is to help Russia\u2019s oil exporters elude the price cap imposed by Ukraine\u2019s allies.",

      "\u201cFatih Altayli has launched a new form of journalism: prison journalism,\u201d fellow journalist Murat Yetkin, wrote on his news website, Yetkin Report. \u201cDrawing on visits from legislators, letters, and his lawyers \u2014 he continues his journalism uninterrupted, conveying not only information from inside but also insights about the outside world.\u201d",
      "Altayli, whose YouTube program attracts hundreds of thousands of views daily, was arrested in June on charges of threatening President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an accusation he strongly denies. Critics say his arrest, which comes amid a deepening crackdown on the opposition, was aimed at silencing a government critic.",
      "Prosecutors accuse Altayli of issuing and publicly disseminating a threat, a criminal charge under Turkish penal law, and are seeking a minimum five-year prison sentence. The first hearing of the trial is set for Friday.",
      "The charges stem from a comment he made on his YouTube program, \u201cFatih Altayli Comments,\u201d following a recent poll that reportedly showed more than 70% of the public opposed a lifetime presidency for Erdogan, who has been in power for more than two decades.",
      "On the show, Altayli said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the results of the poll and that the Turkish people preferred checks on authority.",
      "\u201cLook at the history of this nation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a nation which strangled its sultan when they didn\u2019t like him or want him. There are quite a few Ottoman sultans who were assassinated, strangled, or whose deaths were made to look like suicide.\u201d",

      "Two Delta Air Lines regional jets collided on the taxiway at LaGuardia Airport in New York, injuring a flight attendant, damaging a cockpit and tearing off part of a wing in what the airline described as a \u201clow-speed collision.\u201d",
      "An aircraft carrying 32 people was preparing for takeoff Wednesday night to Roanoke, Virginia, when its wing made contact with the fuselage of an aircraft arriving from Charlotte, North Carolina, with 61 people aboard, according to a statement from Delta.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear who was at fault, but air traffic control had instructed the Virginia-bound plane \u201cto hold short and yield to the other aircraft\u201d before the collision, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.",
      "A flight attendant was taken to a hospital, according to a statement from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. One of the pilots told the tower that the flight attendant told him she hit her knee when the planes collided, according to audio that www.LiveATC.net posted. There were no reports of passengers injured, the airline said.",
      "\u201cTheir right wing clipped our nose and the cockpit. We have damage to our windscreen and ... some of our screens in here,\u201d a pilot said, according to the air traffic control audio.",
      "Images of the damage showed the broken wing on one plane while the other plane's cockpit window was shattered and its nose was deeply gouged in several places.",
      "The plane that had landed \u201cstopped, jerked, and jumped to the right,\u201d passenger William Lusk told ABC. \u201dEveryone went dead silent. And as everyone went dead silent, the pilot calmly came on and said, \u2018Hey, we've been in a crash, everyone remain calm.'\"",
      "Close calls like this could add to worries about aviation safety in the wake of recent crashes and near misses including the deadliest plane crash in the United States in decades, when an Army helicopter collided with an airliner preparing to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.",
      "Former NTSB and FAA crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti said that the ground controller lines up planes on taxiways and directs them where to go, but the pilots are expected to avoid other planes as they move at slow speeds while controllers focus on keeping the runways clear.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to have situational awareness about where your wings are poking out at and what they could hit as you\u2019re taxiing,\u201d said Guzzetti, who is now an aviation safety consultant. \u201cThey (controllers) expect the flight crews to see each other since they\u2019re taxiing at a slow speed. And the controller's main function is to make sure the runway is clear for takeoff and landings.\u201d",
      "Because this happened at night and planes typically turn off their nose lights while taxiing, it may have been more difficult for the pilots to see exactly where the other plane was, Guzzetti said. A plane's taxi lights are on the wings. The landing lights are used to improve visibility and help make sure other pilots can see the plane, but the FAA encourages pilots to be careful not to blind other pilots because landing lights can also impair night vision.",

      "Employers outside the government actually cut 32,000 more jobs than they added in September, according to the survey by ADP Research, with the Midwest particularly hard hit. The survey also revised down its numbers for employment in August, to a loss of 3,000 jobs from a previously reported gain of 54,000.",
      "Usually, traders on Wall Street wait for a more comprehensive U.S. government jobs report to suss out how the job market is doing. The U.S. government gets its data from a larger sample of employers than the ADP survey.",
      "But the next Labor Department report, scheduled for Friday, is likely to be delayed because of the shutdown of the U.S. government  that began just after midnight.",
      "The hope on Wall Street has been that the job market will continue to slow just enough to convince the Federal Reserve to keep cutting interest rates, but not by so much that it brings a recession.",
      "That\u2019s a delicate balance to achieve, and every economic report from the U.S. government that gets delayed only increases the uncertainty about whether it\u2019s possible. Stocks have already run to records on expectations for coming cuts to rates, so a lack of them could send the market lower.",
      "In other dealings on Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 11 cents to $61.67 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, edged down 11 cents to $65.24 per barrel.",
      "The U.S. dollar fell to 146.69 Japanese yen from 147.08 yen. The euro rose to $1.1761 from $1.1731.",
      "The price of gold seesawed between gains and losses after surging to fresh highs. As of Thursday, it was up $3.20 at $3,900.70 per ounce. The precious metal, often used as a safe haven for investments in times of uncertainty, has been steadily climbing for months, gaining more than 37% in the past year.",

      "HONOLULU -- Lawyers for a Hawaii real estate investor and broker who sued Shohei Ohtani and his agent denied any improper use of the star's likeness for a development project and alleged the agent was trying to deflect blame for cost overruns at the player's home.",
      "Ohtani and Nez Balelo of CAA Baseball were sued Aug. 8 in Hawaii Circuit Court for the First Circuit by developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr., real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto, West Point Investment Corp. and Hapuna Estates Property Owners. They accused Ohtani and Balelo of \u201cabuse of power\u201d that allegedly resulted in tortious interference and unjust enrichment impacting a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island\u2019s coveted Hapuna Coast.",

      "\u201cThe allegations as we clarified them make very clear that there was never a breach of the endorsement agreement, the video that was posted on the website promoting specifically this project was sent to Balelo and CAA and another adviser to Ohtani, Mark Daulton, and they were aware of it and never objected to it,\u201d said Josh Schiller, a lawyer for Hayes and the suing entities.",
      "In a motion to dismiss filed Sept. 14, attorneys for Ohtani and Balelo said \u201cplaintiffs exploited Ohtani\u2019s name and photograph to drum up traffic to a website that marketed plaintiffs\u2019 own side project development.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe sudden demand that Kingsbarn terminate plaintiffs was instead a retaliatory measure against Hayes for resisting the constant and improper demands of Balelo and (Ohtani),\u201d the complaint added. \u201cDefendants further calculated that, with plaintiffs removed, they could more easily extract financial concessions from the project and enrich themselves at plaintiffs\u2019 expense.\"",

      "The Democratic member of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board that President Donald Trump fired ahead of the group considering the largest rail merger ever filed a lawsuit challenging his dismissal as illegal.",
      "Robert Primus, who had served on the board since 2001, said the White House never even gave him a reason for his Aug. 27 firing that threatens the independence of the five-member STB. His termination happened before the board got a chance to start reviewing Union Pacific's proposed $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern to create the first true transcontinental railroad.",
      "\u201cOur country\u2019s supply chain demands that the board be independent and transparent. Congress mandated it 138 years ago,\" Primus said. \"Failure to do so will negatively affect the network: railroads, shippers, and rail labor alike, disrupting the supply chain and ultimately injecting instability into our nation\u2019s economy. This is dangerous, and wrong, and cannot not be allowed to happen.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to the lawsuit filed Tuesday, but the press office is running with a reduced staff in the midst of the ongoing government shutdown. At the time of the firing, the only reason offered publicly was as statement saying \u201cRobert Primus did not align with the President's America First agenda.\u201d",
      "But Primus' defenders led by Skye Perryman, who is the President and CEO of Democracy Forward, said this action ignores the way the STB was set up. Congress established that the only reasons someone should be fired from the STB was in cases of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump continues to target members of independent boards, without cause, in violation of the law. Congress made clear when creating the Surface Transportation Board that the agency should be independent and above politics,\" Perryman said.",

      "Every rail worker union, the nonprofit Rail Passengers Association and Democratic members of Congress quickly condemned the firing when it happened. Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin said at the time Primus was fired that it looked like Trump was trying to stack the board so it will rubber-stamp the Union Pacific merger.",

He was named board chairman last year by former President Joe Biden and led the board until Trump, after his election, elevated Republican Board member Patrick Fuchs to chairman.",

Miami International Airport had to temporarily close one of its terminals because TSA officers were calling in sick at twice the airport\u2019s usual rate.",
      "The latest shutdown is unfolding at a time when both the TSA and the Federal Aviation Administration are already facing staffing shortages, including a shortage of about 3,000 air traffic controllers.",
      "If the system can\u2019t handle the number of flights that are scheduled, the FAA will slow down landings and take offs and passengers will see more delays and cancellations.",

      "During the 35-day shutdown during Trump's first term, controllers in the busiest U.S. air traffic facilities reported working as much as 60 hours per week, and an increasing number of TSA agents also quit their jobs.",
      "\u201cThis is more than just an inconvenience to the traveler,\u201d Price said of the shutdown. \u201cThis is definitely going to bring up safety and security issues, if it really starts to go into the long term.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown that began Wednesday will deprive policymakers and investors of economic data vital to their decision-making at a time of unusual uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy.",
      "The absence will be felt almost immediately, as the government's monthly jobs report scheduled for release Friday will likely be delayed. A weekly report on the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits \u2014 a proxy for layoffs that is typically published on Thursdays \u2014 will also be postponed.",
      "If the shutdown is short-lived, it won\u2019t be very disruptive. But if the release of economic data is delayed for several weeks or longer, it could pose challenges, particularly for the Federal Reserve. The Fed is grappling with where to set a key interest rate at a time of conflicting signals, with inflation running above its 2% target and hiring nearly ground to a halt, driving the unemployment rate higher in August.",
      "The Fed typically cuts this rate when unemployment rises, but raises it \u2014 or at least leaves it unchanged \u2014 when inflation is rising too quickly. It\u2019s possible the Fed will have little new federal economic data to analyze by its next meeting on Oct. 28-29, when it is widely expected to reduce its rate again.",
      "\u201cThe job market had been a source of real strength in the economy but has been slowing down considerably the past few months,\u201d said Michael Linden, senior policy fellow at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cIt would be very good to know if that slowdown was continuing, accelerating, or reversing.\u201d",
      "The Fed cut its rate by a quarter-point earlier this month and signaled it was likely to do so twice more this year. Fed officials said they would keep a close eye on how inflation and unemployment evolve, but that depends on the data being available.",
      "A key inflation report is scheduled for Oct. 15 and the government's monthly retail sales report is slated for release the next day.",
      "\u201cWe're in a meeting-by-meeting situation, and we\u2019re going to be looking at the data,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a news conference earlier this month.",
      "The economic picture has recently gotten cloudier. Despite slower hiring, there are signs that overall economic growth may be picking up. Consumers have stepped up their shopping and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates the economy likely expanded at a healthy clip in the July-September quarter, after a large gain in the April-June period.",
      "A key question for the Fed is whether that growth can revive the job market, which this Friday\u2019s report might have helped illustrate. Economists had forecast another month of weak hiring, with just 50,000 new positions added, according to a survey by FactSet. The unemployment rate was projected to stay at a still-low 4.3%.",
      "On Wall Street, investors obsess over the monthly jobs reports, typically issued the first Friday of every month. It's a crucial indicator of the economy's health and provides insights into how the Fed might adjust interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing and influences how investors allocate their money.",

      "The going price for New York spot gold hit a record $3,858.45 per troy ounce \u2014 the standard for measuring precious metals \u2014 as of market close Tuesday, ahead of the shutdown beginning overnight. And futures continued to climb on Wednesday, dancing with the $3,900 mark throughout the day.",
      "Gold sales can rise sharply when anxious investors seek \u201csafe havens\u201d for parking their money. Before Wednesday, the asset \u2014 and other metals, like silver \u2014 have seen wider gains over the last year, particularly with President Donald Trump 's barrage of tariffs plunging much of the world into economic uncertainty.",
      "If trends persist, analysts have predicted that prices could continue to soar. Still, gold can be volatile and the future is never promised. Here's what we know.",
      "Gold futures are up more than 45% since the start of 2025, trading at just under $3,895 by around 4 p.m. ET Wednesday.",
      "Other precious metals have also raked in gains \u2014 with silver seeing an even bigger percentage jump year to date. Silver futures are up nearly 59%, trading at over $47 per troy ounce as of Wednesday afternoon.",
      "A lot of it boils down to uncertainty. Interest in buying metals like gold typically spikes when investors become anxious.",
      "Much of the recent economic turmoil has spanned from Trump's trade wars. Since the start of 2025, steep new tariffs the president has imposed on goods coming into the U.S. from around the world have strained businesses and consumers alike \u2014 pushing costs higher and weakening the job market. As a result, hiring has plunged while inflation continues to inch back up. And more and more consumers are expressing pessimism about the road ahead.",
      "The current U.S. government shutdown could add to those anxieties. A key jobs report from the Labor Department, scheduled for Friday, is likely to be delayed, for example. And the shutdown itself threatens to bring its own economic fallout nationwide. Roughly 750,000 federal workers were expected to be furloughed, with some potentially fired by Trump\u2019s Republican administration. Many offices will also be shuttered, perhaps permanently, as Trump vows to \u201cdo things that are irreversible\u201d to punish Democrats for voting down GOP legislation.",

      "After a career as a presidential aide, publisher of two newspapers and CNN president, Tom Johnson has plenty of stories to swap",
      "NEW YORK -- Tom Johnson's career took him from the White House to newspaper publisher jobs in Dallas and Los Angeles to president of CNN. While that left him able to swap stories about two influential figures \u2014 Lyndon B. Johnson and Ted Turner \u2014 that's not the real reason he wrote his memoir.",
      "Instead, it's to tell how his accomplishments came despite suffering through a depression so severe he contemplated suicide, in the hope that others will seek help when in need.",
      "\u201cI want to convey that depression is a treatable illness,\u201d Johnson, 84, said in an interview. \u201cYou do not need to kill yourself as two of my best friends did.\u201d",
      "He calls his memoir \u201cDriven.\u201d That seems partly in tribute to his mother, who told a young boy growing up in Georgia that he could accomplish what he wanted in life through hard work, and an acknowledgement that such drive comes with costs.",
      "He went to work in the Johnson (no relation) White House right out of graduate school at Harvard. As a junior-level aide who first worked with press secretary Bill Moyers, his most important duty was taking careful notes in meetings. He was trusted enough that when LBJ left the White House to return to Texas in 1969, he took Johnson with him as his top aide.",

      "He knew his old boss felt squeezed, believing in the strategic importance of the war but recognizing that it wasn't going well and resulting in needless death. Johnson recalled asking the former president one day, as they drove around his Texas ranch, whether he would have done anything differently.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018Tom, I will go to my grave believing we did the right thing,\u2019\u201d Johnson recalled. The former president died a few weeks later.",

He said he was eventually pushed out by the Chandler family that owned the newspaper because he was deemed too liberal. He then considered the presidency at CNN, despite advice that Turner, the founder, was \u201cnutty.\u201d",
      "He took the job anyway, in 1990, and quickly regarded Turner as a visionary determined to spend whatever it took to make CNN succeed as a global news organization. In retrospect, the 11 years he spent as CNN president marked its period of greatest success as a television network.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump 's administration, citing the government shutdown, said Wednesday it was putting a hold on roughly $18 billion to fund a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River between New York City and New Jersey and an extension of the city's Second Avenue subway.",
      "The White House budget director, Russ Vought, said on X that the step was taken due to the Republican administration\u2019s belief the spending was based on unconstitutional diversity, equity and inclusion principles.",

      "The suspension of funds is likely meant to target Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York, whom the White House is blaming for the impasse. He said the funding freeze would harm commuters.",
      "\u201cObstructing these projects is stupid and counterproductive because they create tens of thousands of great jobs and are essential for a strong regional and national economy,\u201d he said on X.",
      "The spending hold was a preview of how the messy the politics of the shutdown could get, with Vought later posting on X that $8 billion in funding for green energy projects in Democratic-led states would be canceled. The administration has shown a willingness to use its control of federal dollars to apply pressure on Democrats to reopen the government, with commuters and thousands of jobs hanging in the balance.",
      "The agency working on the subway line said it was blindsided by the announcement. \u201cFor now, it looks like they\u2019re just inventing excuses to delay one of the most important infrastructure projects in America,\u201d read a statement from John McCarthy, policy chief and spokesperson for the New York state-controlled Metropolitan Transportation Authority.",

It\u2019s intended to ease the strain on a more than 110-year-old tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey. Hundreds of Amtrak and commuter trains carry hundreds of thousands of passengers per day through the tunnel, and delays can ripple up and down the East Coast between Boston and Washington.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly identical under the metal, the Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride have been leaders in the three-row SUV class since their introductions in 2020",
      "Suppose you\u2019ve considered the Hyundai Palisade or Kia Telluride for your next three-row SUV. In that case, you probably know both models are nearly identical under the metal. Or rather, they were until recently. Redesigned for 2026 with new style, new engines and upgraded technology features, the second-generation Palisade refines an already impressive model that consistently finishes near the top of Edmunds\u2019 annual SUV rankings.",
      "For now, Kia is standing pat with its Telluride. A redesign is coming, but so far Kia has not released any official details or a timetable. If you\u2019re thinking of buying a new three-row SUV, should you get the new Palisade, the current Telluride, or maybe even wait? Edmunds\u2019 auto experts compared these two family-friendly SUVs to find out.",
      "Let\u2019s start with the obvious. The 2026 Palisade starts at $41,035, including the destination fee, while the 2025 Telluride starts at $37,885. Both SUVs come with standard eight-passenger seating, LED headlights, a 12.3-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, adaptive cruise control and blind-spot warning. The Telluride also offers standard synthetic leather upholstery, which gives it a more premium feel than Palisade\u2019s standard cloth seating.",
      "The Telluride\u2019s lower starting price is compelling, though the Palisade does offer a few extras to justify its higher price. These include wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (so you don\u2019t have to use a USB cord), front and rear parking sensors, and automatic braking while in reverse.",
      "It\u2019s a similar story at the top end of the range. A loaded-up Telluride SX-Prestige costs $52,885, while a Palisade Calligraphy costs $56,160. You\u2019ll pay more for that Palisade but get a few extras in return that aren\u2019t on the Telluride, such as a massaging driver\u2019s seat and front and rear dashcams that you can use to record video and review it at a later time.",
      "Winner: tie",
      "Two new engines are among the 2026 Palisade\u2019s changes. A 287-horsepower V6 is standard, and it gets up to a Hyundai-estimated 21 mpg in combined city/highway driving. A turbocharged four-cylinder hybrid with 258 horsepower also joins the lineup. No fuel economy estimates were available at the time of our article\u2019s publication, but we\u2019d guess the Palisade Hybrid will get in the low to mid-30s for mpg.",
      "The new base V6 is a step backward, however. It makes roughly the same power as the larger V6 it replaces, but it also contends with a heavier Palisade. The Hyundai\u2019s extra 400 pounds showed up in Edmunds\u2019 testing, where it took 8.8 seconds to reach 60 mph. That\u2019s more than 1 second slower than before and makes the Palisade one of today\u2019s slowest three-row SUVs.",
      "The Telluride has a 291-horsepower V6 that gets up to 22 mpg combined. That helps it reach 60 mph in 7.5 seconds in Edmunds\u2019 testing, which is about average compared to its rivals. We expect the next-gen Telluride to adopt the new powertrains in the Palisade. Still, for now, it comes down to whether you want the superior acceleration of the Telluride\u2019s V6 or the more frugal mpg potential of the Palisade Hybrid.",
      "Winner: tie",
      "The Palisade is supremely quiet and comfortable, easily gliding over rough road surfaces without disturbing the cabin. There\u2019s ample visibility for the driver, and both rear rows offer vast expanses of headroom and legroom. The Telluride is equally cushy and forgiving of bad roads, but the new Palisade\u2019s seats and composure are just a bitbetter. This assessment is less an indictment of the Telluride than a testament to the Palisade\u2019s upgrades.",

The Telluride has slightly more space on the spec sheet but not enough to make a meaningful difference in real-world use.",

      "For Democrats, the shutdown fight marks a line in the sand born from months of frustration with their inability to stop Trump's norm-busting leadership. And they will continue to fight, regardless of the practical or political consequences, they say.",

      "As the shutdown begins, there are few signs of cracks across the Democratic Party's diverse coalition.",
      "Even progressive critics from the party's activist wing are applauding Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, who are insisting that any government spending package must extend health care subsidies that are set to expire at the year's end. Trump, backed by the Republicans who control Congress, insists on supporting only a \u201cclean\u201d spending package that excludes the health care measure.",
      "The fight is already ugly as Trump uses his presidential bully pulpit \u2014 and taxpayer-funded government resources \u2014 to cast blame on the Democrats.",
      "The Department of Housing and Urban Development's website on Tuesday welcomed all visitors with this message: \u201cThe Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people unless they get their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands. The Trump administration wants to keep the government open for the American people.\u201d",
      "The president himself posted on social media a deepfake video of Schumer implying that Democrats are fighting to give free health care to immigrants in the country illegally. The fake video, widely condemned as racist, depicted Jeffries with a Mexican sombrero and fake mustache.",
      "In a press conference, Jeffries offered a harsh message to the president.",
      "\u201cThe next time you have something to say about me, don\u2019t cop out through a racist and fake AI video. When I\u2019m back in the Oval Office, say it to my face,\" the top House Democrat said.",
      "Privately, political operatives from both sides concede that government shutdowns are bad for both parties.

Democrats are demanding funding for health care subsidies that are expiring for millions of people under the Affordable Care Act, causing the insurance premiums to spike nationwide.",
      "Republicans have have encouraged Trump to steer clear of any talks. At the White House meeting, he gave the congressional leaders \u201cTrump 2028\u201d caps.

The ramifications are certain to spread beyond the political arena, upending the lives of Americans who rely on the government for benefit payments, work contracts and the many services being thrown into turmoil.",
      "Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, headed by Russ Vought, directed agencies to execute plans not just for furloughs, which are typical during a federal funding lapse, but mass firings of federal workers.

      "Two-time Olympic champion runner Caster Semenya is ending her seven-year legal challenge against sex eligibility rules in track and field",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Olympic champion runner Caster Semenya is ending a seven-year legal challenge against sex eligibility rules in track and field, her lawyers said Thursday, despite winning a ruling at the European Court of Human Rights in July that appeared to have reignited one of sports' most contentious cases.",
      "Patrick Bracher, a lawyer for Semenya, said in an email to The Associated Press that they wouldn't take her appeal back to the Swiss supreme court, which was an option and what many presumed to be Semenya's next step after the European rights court ruling.",
      "\u201cCaster\u2019s legal challenge reached the highest possible court with a highly successful outcome and will not be taken further in the circumstances,\u201d Bracher wrote.",
      "Semenya is a two-time Olympic gold medallist in the 800 meters from South Africa who has been banned from running in her favorite race at major international meets like the Olympics and world championships since 2019 because she refused to follow the rules and take medication to artificially reduce her hormone levels.",
      "Since 2018, she has taken her legal battle against the rules enforced by track governing body World Athletics to three courts; the Switzerland-based highest court for sports, the Swiss Federal Tribunal and the European Court of Human Rights.",
      "She has argued that the rules infringed her rights. She lost her appeals at the Court of Arbitration for Sport and at the Swiss Federal Tribunal.",
      "However, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in July that she hadn't had a fair hearing at the Swiss tribunal and it hadn't properly considered some of the complex arguments. That opened an avenue for her to continue her challenge.",
      "Semenya was the world's dominant middle-distance runner and was unbeaten in more than 30 races when she was barred. Now 34, she has moved into coaching, with the regulations effectively ending her career.",
      "She has been the face of fiercely contentious sex eligibility rules in sports since she won the world championships as a teenager in 2009 and was forced to undergo sex verification tests. Semenya has one of a number of conditions known as differences in sex development, or DSD. She has the typical male XY chromosome pattern but also female physical traits and high levels of naturally occurring testosterone. DSD conditions are sometimes called intersex conditions.",
      "Semenya is not transgender despite her case often being conflated with the divisive debate over the participation of transgender athletes in female competitions. She was identified as female at birth, raised as a girl, and has always identified as female.",
      "World Athletics says Semenya and a small number of other DSD athletes in international track have testosterone levels in the male range, giving them an unfair advantage over other women because of the hormone's connection to muscle mass and cardio-vascular performance.",

      "Track and field introduced new rules governing women with high natural testosterone in 2011 in a move seen as a direct response to the arrival of Semenya. The regulations have been made stricter over the years and the latest rule change introduced earlier this year moves away from monitoring testosterone and requires women competing in international track to undergo a genetic test to check for the presence of a Y chromosome.",
      "If they fail the one-off genetic sex eligibility test, they are banned from female competitions. The new rules came into effect Sept. 1 ahead of last month's world championships.",
      "Bracher noted in his email to the AP that the current regulations are very different to those Semenya challenged in court when her case started seven years ago. But Semenya's recent victory at the European rights court might provide a basis for a new challenge by another athlete against the current regulations, he said.",
      "While Semenya's case made track and field the main battleground over sex eligibility for nearly two decades, other high-profile sports like swimming have moved to block women with DSD conditions from competing. Semenya's case was often seen as a precedent for other sports to introduce their own restrictions.",
      "Boxing was mired in a sex eligibility scandal at the Paris Olympics last year over the participation of Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan after officials claimed they had previously failed unspecified sex verification tests.",

      "OWINGS MILLS, Md. -- Offensive tackle Ronnie Stanley and cornerback Nate Wiggins were back at practice for the Baltimore Ravens, but star quarterback Lamar Jackson and safety Kyle Hamilton were absent Thursday during the portion open to reporters.",
      "Jackson also missed practice Wednesday with a hamstring injury. Hamilton did not seem injured during last weekend's loss at Kansas City, but he showed up on Wednesday's injury report as limited in that day's practice because of a groin issue. He was not on the field early in Thursday's session. Neither were linebacker Roquan Smith (hamstring) and cornerback Marlon Humphrey (calf).",
      "The returns of Stanley (ankle) and Wiggins (elbow) were encouraging, however, for a depleted Baltimore team that needs all the healthy players it can find this weekend against Houston.",
      "The Ravens have lost nine of their past 11 games when Jackson didn't play. The two-time MVP left Sunday's game in the second half.",

    "story": [
      "With Brian Snitker stepping down in Atlanta, there are now eight major league teams with a managerial opening",
      "With Brian Snitker stepping down in Atlanta, there are now eight major league teams with a managerial opening. Five of those spots became vacant since the end of the season, and three teams have had interim managers in place for a while.",
      "With the dust settling, it's time to take a look at which of these jobs are the most attractive.",
      "It's a subjective exercise of course, and it depends on what a prospective manager values. Some teams can offer a talented current roster, while others might have a better long-term outlook. And of course, the quality of the front office and ownership plays a big role.",
      "The good: Atlanta has a lot more talent than your usual 76-win team, and that puts the Braves atop the list. There's good reason to believe they are poised for a rebound after Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. and Austin Riley each missed at least 60 games this year. Few teams can match Atlanta's reputation for consistent success over the past three-plus decades, and even since Bobby Cox departed in 2010, the Braves have needed only two managers \u2014 Snitker and Fredi Gonzalez.",
      "The bad: It's a tough division, and after winning 104 games in 2023, Atlanta declined to 89 before falling even further this year. So the Braves' of wealth of talent under team control may have already peaked.",
      "The good: There's still a chance for short-term success here after Texas led the major leagues in ERA for the first time in franchise history. The Rangers have veteran starters Jacob deGrom and Nathan Eovaldi signed beyond next season, along with former No. 2 overall pick Jack Leiter coming off a solid rookie season. Their retractable-roof home stadium, which stays mostly closed, has become more of a pitcher\u2019s ballpark.",
      "The bad: The front office has already indicated that the $241 million payroll is going down after the Rangers missed the playoffs without a winning record in both seasons since their only World Series championship in 2023. There is at least some uncertainly on how to proceed after four seasons with the half-billion dollar middle infield of shortstop Corey Seager and second baseman Marcus Semien. And outgoing manager Bruce Bochy is a tough act to follow.",
      "The good: A couple years ago, the Baltimore job would have ranked even higher after the Orioles won 101 games behind a young, cost-controlled core that could make any franchise envious. Now Baltimore has to rebound from a sub-.500 season, but there's still a lot of potential here with Gunnar Henderson in the middle of the infield and Kyle Bradish looking good down the stretch on the mound. The parade of prospects continued this year, with catcher Samuel Basallo arriving in August.",
      "The bad: Basallo is the only one of those young standouts to sign an extension so far, so it's possible the Orioles could lose Henderson and some others before too long. Also, several of Baltimore's young hitters regressed this year, meaning the future isn't as certain as it once seemed. After a successful rebuild, there are still questions about the franchise's ability to attract established stars, and the AL East can be brutal.",
      "The good: It's an organization with plenty of history, and the front office showed it was willing to go big when it traded for Rafael Devers. Throw in a beautiful ballpark and a market they now have all to themselves, and it feels like the Giants should never be all that far from contention.",
      "The bad: This job comes with a fair amount of pressure \u2014 witness Bob Melvin getting fired after just two seasons \u2014 and the Giants have to compete with the Dodgers in the NL West. Although Devers is a decent hitter to build around, the overall roster is decidedly average.",
      "The good: This ranking assumes some real potential in Washington's young players. As badly as this season went, James Wood, C.J. Abrams, Dylan Crews, Robert Hassell III and MacKenzie Gore \u2014 with Eli Willits on the way \u2014 is a group that could eventually win a lot of games. And there's plenty of room for the payroll to grow.",

      "The bad: Will the payroll grow? After a couple years attempting to sell the team, Mark Lerner and his family decided not to, and the Nationals have been reticent in their spending of late.",
      "The good: The AL Central is a forgiving spot: Nobody in the division has won more than 93 games since the Twins themselves won 101 in 2019. A market like Minnesota can compete with Detroit, Kansas City and Cleveland, and with the Twins coming off a deadline sell-off, this should be a relatively low-pressure situation initially.",
      "The bad: Like the Nationals, Twins ownership flirted with a sale before deciding against it. The team cut payroll after winning the division in 2023, with their regional television revenue taking a hit after the Diamond Sports Group bankruptcy.",
      "The good: It's a team that has been willing to spend in the past. That hasn't necessarily worked out \u2014 witness the Anthony Rendon contract \u2014 but it suggests under the right circumstances, money won't be an obstacle. And as bad as things have been recently, they did improve by nine games this year.",
      "The bad: No team has gone longer without a postseason berth than the Angels, who were generally mediocre when they had Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani \u2014 and now have only Trout, who hasn't been an MVP threat in a while. This franchise has been a revolving door of managers since Mike Scioscia's departure.",
      "The good: Expectations should be low, and Denver can be lovely in the summer.",
      "The bad: The Rockies didn't set the record for losses this year, but make no mistake: They were one of the worst teams ever, posting a run differential that was the worst in modern history. They have only two top-100 prospects according to MLB Pipeline, and neither has reached Triple-A yet. Despite plenty of fan support and no competing big league teams nearby, the Rockies have never really built a sustained winner.",

It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to happen, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll be in favor of it when it\u2019s all said and done, but these are the types of discussion we have to be having.\u201d",

According to Hero Sports, which first reported the proposal, Sequence would offer tens of millions of dollars in investment and take over the operation of the playoffs.",

      "\u201cJust unreal emotions the last couple days, and then we come out here and get a win and get to keep playing ball,\u201d said DeLauter, who turns 24 on Oct. 8.",
      "DeLauter was the first Cleveland player to make his big league debut in a postseason game. After telling him he would be on the Wild Card roster on Monday, manager Stephen Vogt told DeLauter there was a good chance he would be in the lineup on Wednesday.",
      "Even though playing DeLauter might've been considered a risk, Vogt noted it\u2019s not any different from what the team has done all season.",
      "\u201cWe don't like to use the gamble word around here right now. It's taking a shot. He's one of our best players in the organization,\u201d Vogt said. \u201cWe\u2019ve pushed the envelope all year. Why stop now?\u201d",
      "Selected 16th in the 2022 amateur draft, DeLauter hit .278 with five homers and 21 RBIs in 34 games at Triple-A Columbus. He likely would have been up at some point during the regular season, but was sidelined by injuries for much of this year.",
      "It wasn't a great start though.",
      "DeLauter started the game in center field and dropped a high fly hit by Detroit's Gleyber Torres during the first inning. He had a tough time initially tracking the ball on a sunny afternoon before moving a couple steps to his right. The ball popped out of his glove when he tried to haul it in near the middle of his body.",
      "It was only DeLauter's second error after nearly 272 innings playing center field in the minors.",
      "The gaffe put runners on first and second with no outs, but Tanner Bibee struck out the next three hitters to end the threat.",
      "\u201cWhen that ball hit the ground I was in shambles right away. I mean you never want that to happen. Anybody, any situation, especially in a playoff game,\" DeLauter said. \"I played the sun wrong. I mean, I kind of let the ball get into the middle of it and wasn\u2019t able to get it out of it until the very last second and unfortunately I didn\u2019t come down with the ball.\u201d",
      "Left fielder Steven Kwan said DeLauter was put in a tough spot with the sun, swirling winds in the outfield and the stakes of the game.",
      "Bibee approached DeLauter in the dugout to give him a pat on the back and some reassurance.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter because I feel like even if that run did score, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered because it\u2019s just a hard play. And one of those things where I\u2019m going to have your back and eventually, you\u2019re going to get my back as well. And literally, it came a little earlier than expected,\u201d Bibee said.",

      "\u201cSuch a surreal feeling, hearing my name, running out and hearing everybody kind of scream for me that it\u2019s a feeling every player kind of wishes for it,\" DeLauter said. \"It helps you feel like you belong, you feel the support right away and in some form, too. It calms you down on the field. You kind of feel like you should be there and should perform.\u201d",

      "They harvest in the Alentejo region, sometimes called the \u201cTuscany of Portugal\u201d for its rolling vineyards, olive groves and forests that supply cork for the wines. In this vineyard about a 90-minute drive east of Lisbon, the cool autumn night carries the smell of ripe fruit. The workers' laughter blends with the sound of rustling leaves.",
      "The night harvest is a time-honored practice in viticulture, meant to preserve the freshness of grapes and shield them from the adverse effects of daytime heat, sunlight and oxidation. As summers in Portugal grow longer, hotter and more unpredictable \u2014 in part due to climate change \u2014 the practice has become more common here.",
      "B\u00e1rbara Monteiro, co-owner and manager of the Herdade Da Fonte Santa vineyard said she struggled at first to convince her harvesters to work at night \u2014 midnight to 8 a.m. They began doing so in 2019.",
      "\u201cToday, we can say they actually prefer this schedule, as they can often work almost another day, enjoy the day, and avoid the extreme heat we often experience here,\u201d she said.",
      "The wine harvest in Spain, Italy and Portugal generally takes place between late August and October, with variations based on the region, type of grapes and weather conditions.",
      "Some vineyards have been harvesting at night for years. In parts of Italy, others have for more than a decade. The El Coto de Rioja vineyard in Spain\u2019s famed La Rioja region opts for early morning harvests, beginning at 5 or 6 a.m., according to C\u00e9sar Fern\u00e1ndez, the vineyard's technical director and winemaker.",

      "Grapes are naturally sensitive to temperature shifts. Warmer weather can make them reach sugar maturity before developing a full flavor and ripeness, leading to higher alcohol levels but less complex wines. Intense heat also speeds up acid loss and can trigger early fermentation as wild yeasts and bacteria become more active.",
      "By harvesting at night, vintners can lock in more vibrant flavors that improve the quality of the wine produced.",

      "All five fires forced everyone aboard to evacuate \u2014 in one case, as many as 350 passengers \u2014 with a few minor injuries reported. One railcar was involved in two of the fires, and two other railcars were destroyed, the NTSB said.",

      "AOL previously confirmed it would be pulling the plug on Tuesday (Sept. 30) \u2014 writing in a brief update on its support site last month that it \u201croutinely evaluates\" its offerings and had decided to discontinue dial-up, as well as associated software \u201coptimized for older operating systems,\u201d from its plans.",

      "The creaky door to the internet was characterized by a once-ubiquitous series of beeps and buzzes heard over the phone line used to connect your computer online \u2014 along with frustrations of being kicked off the web if anyone else at home needed the landline for another call, and an endless bombardment of CDs mailed out by AOL to advertise free trials.",
      "Eventually, broadband and wireless offerings emerged and rose to dominance, doing away with dial-up's quirks for most people accessing the internet today \u2014 but not everyone.",
      "A handful of consumers have continued to rely on internet services connected over telephone lines.

And in 2017, AOL discontinued its Instant Messenger \u2014 a chat platform that was once lauded as the biggest trend in online communication since email when it was founded in 1997, but later struggled to ward off rivals.",

      "Before it was America Online, AOL was founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1985. It soon rebranded and hit the public market in 1991. Near the height of the dot-com boom, AOL's market value reached nearly $164 billion in 2000. But tumultuous years followed, and that valuation plummeted as the once-tech pioneer bounced between multiple owners. After a disastrous merger with Time Warner Inc., Verizon acquired AOL \u2014 which later sold AOL, along with Yahoo, to a private equity firm.",

      "GENEVA -- Switzerland's glaciers have faced \u201cenormous\u201d melting this year with a 3% drop in total volume \u2014 the fourth-largest annual drop on record \u2014 due to the effects of global warming, top Swiss glaciologists reported Wednesday.",
      "The shrinkage this year means that ice mass in Switzerland \u2014 home to the most glaciers in Europe \u2014 has declined by one-quarter over the last decade, the Swiss glacier monitoring group GLAMOS and the Swiss Academy of Sciences said in their report.",
      "\u201cGlacial melting in Switzerland was once again enormous in 2025,\" the scientists said. \u201cA winter with low snow depth combined with heat waves in June and August led to a loss of 3% of the glacier volume.\u201d",
      "Switzerland is home to nearly 1,400 glaciers, the most of any country in Europe, and the ice mass and its gradual melting have implications for hydropower, tourism, farming and water resources in many European countries.",
      "More than 1,000 small glaciers in Switzerland have already disappeared, the experts said.",
      "The teams reported that a winter with little snow was followed by heat waves in June \u2014 the second-warmest June on record \u2014 which left the snow reserves depleted by early July. Ice masses began to melt earlier than ever, they said.",
      "\u201cGlaciers are clearly retreating because of anthropogenic global warming,\u201d said Matthias Huss, the head of GLAMOS, referring to climate change caused by human activity.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Scientists have uncovered new types of organics in icy geysers spouting from Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus, bolstering the likelihood that the ocean world may harbor conditions suitable for life.",
      "Their findings, reported Wednesday, are based on observations made by NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft in 2008 during a close and fast flyby of Enceladus. The small moon, one of 274 orbiting Saturn, has long been considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth because of its hidden ocean and plumes of water erupting from cracks near its south pole.",
      "While Enceladus may be habitable, no one is suggesting that life exists.",
      "\u201cBeing habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,\" said the University of Washington's Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study.",
      "An international team decided to launch a fresh analysis of tiny grains of ice encountered as Cassini flew through the moon's geysers. The grains were young compared with the much older geyser particles that ended up in one of Saturn\u2019s outermost rings.",
      "These new grains collided with Cassini\u2019s cosmic dust analyzer at 40,000 mph (64,800 kph), faster than the old ones. The increased speed provided a clearer view of the chemical compounds present, the scientists noted.",
      "Organic molecules already had been spotted in the old geyser grains, but their age raised questions as to whether they had been altered over the years by space radiation.",
      "Scientists found some of the same molecules in the fresh grains, confirming they came from the moon\u2019s underground sea, as well as new chemical compounds. The findings were published in Nature Astronomy.",
      "An ice-encapsulated water world barely 310 miles (500 kilometers) across with a rocky core, Enceladus is suspected of having hydrothermal vents on its ocean floor, quite possibly like those in the Arctic. The moon's jets of water vapor and frozen particles can stretch thousands of miles (kilometers) into space.",
      "\u201cWe are confident that these molecules originate from the subsurface ocean of Enceladus, enhancing its habitability potential,\" the Free University of Berlin\u2019s Nozair Khawaja, the lead author, said in an email.",
      "The scientists favor new missions to further explore Enceladus. Launched in 1997, Cassini is long gone; the spacecraft was deliberately plunged into Saturn in 2017 following its joint mission by NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.",

      "NEW YORK -- Researchers have discovered life-size rock carvings of camels, gazelles and other animals in the Saudi Arabian desert.",
      "The carvings date back to around 12,000 years ago and many are over 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall. Scientists say they were created using a wedge-shaped rock to create sharp lines.",
      "Several were etched on narrow ledges so the artists couldn't even step back to survey the final product as they were working.",
      "\u201cTo engrave that much detail with just a rock takes real skill,\u201d said Maria Guagnin, an archaeologist with the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Germany who was involved in the discovery.",
      "The animal carvings and engraving tools found at the site show that people were living in the area about 2,000 years earlier than scientists thought. It isn't clear how they survived in such arid conditions \u2014 whether they lived off of shallow lakes that pooled for part of the year or drank water that accumulated in deep crevices.",
      "People have been creating rock art in Saudi Arabia for thousands of years, Guagnin said. But older engravings can be tricky to date since they tend not to feature writing and there are few remnants such as charcoal, which can be sent to a lab for analysis.",

      "Although choosing secondhand over new is often the more sustainable option, experts say it\u2019s not a license to overconsume.

      "At eBay\u2019s secondhand runway shows in New York and London, models wore pre-loved designer pieces that guests could shop live. Secondhand items like those make up 40% of the company's sales, said Alexis Hoopes, eBay\u2019s vice president of fashion.",

So they\u2019re ending up creating more textile waste because they\u2019re buying more and using that clothing for a shorter period of time.\u201d",
      "Less than 20% of clothing donations to charities are resold in their stores, according to the Council for Textile Recycling. The rest is downcycled, exported \u2014 often to countries in the Global South \u2014 or ultimately discarded in landfills.",

    "summary": "Scientists warn that &ldquo;flying rivers&rdquo; &mdash; invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon &mdash; are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance",
    "story": [
      "Scientists warn that \u201cflying rivers\u201d \u2014 invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon \u2014 are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Droughts have withered crops in Peru, fires have scorched the Amazon and hydroelectric dams in Ecuador have struggled to keep the lights on as rivers dry up. Scientists say the cause may lie high above the rainforest, where invisible \u201cflying rivers\u201d carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean across South America.",
      "New analysis warns that relentless deforestation is disrupting that water flow and suggests that continuing tree loss will worsen droughts in the southwestern Amazon and could eventually trigger those regions to shift from rainforest to drier savanna \u2014 grassland with far fewer trees.",
      "\u201cThese are the forces that actually create and sustain the Amazon rainforest,\u201d said Matt Finer, a senior researcher with Amazon Conservation\u2019s Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP), which tracks deforestation and climate threats across the basin and carried out the analysis.",
      "\u201cIf you break that pump by cutting down too much forest, the rains stop reaching where they need to go.\u201d",
      "Most of the Amazon\u2019s rainfall starts over the Atlantic Ocean. Moist air is pushed inland by steady winds that blow west along the equator, known as the trade winds. The forest then acts like a pump, effectively relaying the water thousands of miles westward as the trees absorb water, then release it back into the air.",
      "Brazilian climate scientist Carlos Nobre was among the early researchers who calculated how much of the water vapor from the Atlantic would move through and eventually out of the Amazon basin. He and colleagues coined the \u201cflying rivers\u201d term at a 2006 scientific meeting, and interest grew as scientists warned that a weakening of the rivers could push the Amazon into a tipping point where rainforest would turn to savanna.",
      "That's important because the Amazon rainforest is a vast storehouse for the carbon dioxide that largely drives the world's warming. Such a shift would devastate wildlife and Indigenous communities and threaten farming, water supplies and weather stability far beyond the region.",
      "The analysis by Finer's group found that southern Peru and northern Bolivia are especially vulnerable. During the dry season, flying rivers sweep across southern Brazil before reaching the Andes \u2014 precisely where deforestation is most intense. The loss of trees means less water vapor is carried westward, raising the risk of drought in iconic protected areas such as Peru\u2019s Manu National Park.",
      "\u201cPeru can do everything right to protect a place like Manu,\u201d Finer said. \u201cBut if deforestation keeps cutting into the pump in Brazil, the rains that sustain it may never arrive.\u201d",
      "Nobre said as much as 50% of rainfall in the western Amazon near the Andes depends on the flying rivers.",
      "Corine Vriesendorp, Amazon Conservation\u2019s director of science based in Cusco, Peru, said the changes are already visible.",
      "\u201cThe last two years have brought the driest conditions the Amazon has ever seen,\u201d Vriesendorp said. \u201cEcological calendars that Indigenous communities use \u2014 when to plant, when to fish, when animals reproduce \u2014 are increasingly out of sync. Having less and more unpredictable rain will have an even bigger impact on their lives than climate change is already having.\u201d",
      "Farmers face failed harvests, Indigenous families struggle with disrupted fishing and hunting seasons and cities that rely on hydroelectric power see outages as the rivers that provide the power dry up.",
      "MAAP researchers found that rainfall patterns depend on when and where the flying rivers cross the basin. In the wet season, their northern route flows mostly over intact forests in Guyana, Suriname and northern Brazil, keeping the system strong.",

      "But in the dry season \u2014 when forests are already stressed by heat \u2014 the aerial rivers cut across southern Brazil, where deforestation fronts spread along highways and farms and there simply are fewer trees to help move the moisture along.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s during the dry months, when the forest most needs water, that the flying rivers are most disrupted,\u201d Finer said.",
      "Finer pointed to roads that can accelerate deforestation, noting that the controversial BR-319 highway in Brazil \u2014 a project to pave a road through one of the last intact parts of the southern Amazon \u2014 could create an entirely new deforestation front.",
      "For years, scientists have warned about the Amazon tipping toward savannah. Finer said the new study complicates that picture.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a single, all-at-once collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain areas, like the southwest Amazon, are more vulnerable and will feel the impacts first. And we\u2019re already seeing early signs of rainfall reduction downwind of deforested areas.\u201d",
      "Nobre said the risks are stark. Amazon forests have already lost about 17% of their cover, mostly to cattle and soy. Those ecosystems recycle far less water.",
      "\u201cThe dry season is now five weeks longer than it was 45 years ago, with 20 to 30% less rainfall,\u201d he said. \u201cIf deforestation exceeds 20 to 25% and warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius, there\u2019s no way to prevent the Amazon from reaching the tipping point.\u201d",
      "Protecting intact forests, supporting Indigenous land rights and restoring deforested areas are the clearest paths forward, researchers say.",
      "\u201cTo avoid collapse we need zero deforestation, degradation and fires \u2014 immediately,\u201d Nobre said. \u201cAnd we must begin large-scale forest restoration, not less than half a million square kilometers. If we do that, and keep global warming below 2 degrees, we can still save the Amazon.\u201d",
      "Finer said governments should consider new conservation categories specifically designed to protect flying rivers \u2014 safeguarding not just land but the atmospheric flows that make the rainforest possible.",
      "For Vriesendorp, that means regional cooperation. She praised Peru for creating vast parks and Indigenous reserves in the southeast, including Manu National Park. But, she said, \u201cthis can\u2019t be solved by one country alone. Peru depends on Brazil, and Brazil depends on its neighbors. We need basin-wide solutions.\u201d",

Many of the world's top AI companies are located in California and will have to follow the requirements.",
      "\u201cCalifornia has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive. This legislation strikes that balance,\" Newsom said in a statement.",
      "The legislation requires AI companies to implement and disclose publicly safety protocols to prevent their most advanced models from being used to cause major harm. The rules are designed to cover AI systems if they meet a \u201cfrontier\u201d threshold that signals they run on a huge amount of computing power.",
      "Such thresholds are based on how many calculations the computers are performing. Those who crafted the regulations have acknowledged the numerical thresholds are an imperfect starting point to distinguish today\u2019s highest-performing generative AI systems from the next generation that could be even more powerful. The existing systems are largely made by California-based companies like Anthropic, Google, Meta Platforms and OpenAI.",
      "The legislation defines a catastrophic risk as something that would cause at least $1 billion in damage or more than 50 injuries or deaths. It's designed to guard against AI being used for activities that could cause mass disruption, such as hacking into a power grid.",
      "Companies also have to report to the state any critical safety incidents within 15 days. The law creates whistleblower protections for AI workers and establishes a public cloud for researchers. It includes a fine of $1 million per violation.",
      "It drew opposition from some tech companies, which argued that AI legislation should be done at the federal level. But Anthropic said the regulations are \u201cpractical safeguards\u201d that make official the safety practices many companies are already doing voluntarily.",
      "\"While federal standards remain essential to avoid a patchwork of state regulations, California has created a strong framework that balances public safety with continued innovation,\u201d Jack Clark, co-founder and head of policy at Anthropic, said in a statement.",
      "The signing comes after Newsom last year vetoed a broader version of the legislation, siding with tech companies that said the requirements were too rigid and would have hampered innovation. Newsom instead asked a group of several industry experts, including AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, to develop recommendations on guardrails around powerful AI models.",
      "The new law incorporates recommendations and feedback from Newsom\u2019s group of AI experts and the industry, supporters said. The legislation also doesn't put the same level of reporting requirements on startups to avoid hurting innovation, said state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, the bill's author.",

      "OpenAI has announced new parental controls for ChatGPT to make it safer for teens",
      "LONDON -- OpenAI said Monday it's adding parental controls to ChatGPT that are designed to provide teen users of the popular platform with a safer and more \u201cage-appropriate\u201d experience.",
      "The company is taking action after AI chatbot safety for young users has hit the headlines. The technology's dangers have been recently highlighted by a number of cases in which teenagers took their lives after interacting with ChatGPT.",
      "In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has even opened an inquiry into several tech companies about the potential harms to children and teenagers who use their AI chatbots as companions.",
      "In a blog post posted Monday, OpenAI outlined the new controls for parents. Here is a breakdown:",
      "The parental controls will be available to all users, but both parents and teens will need their own accounts to take advantage of them.",
      "To get started, a parent or guardian needs to send an email or text message to invite a teen to connect their accounts. Or a teenager can send an invite to a parent. Users can send a request by going into the settings menu and then to the \"Parental controls\" section.",
      "Teens can unlink their accounts at any time, but parents will be notified if they do.",
      "Once the accounts are linked, the teen account will get some built-in protections, OpenAI said.",
      "Teen accounts will \u201cautomatically get additional content protections, including reduced graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent role-play, and extreme beauty ideals, to help keep their experience age-appropriate,\u201d the company said.",
      "Parents can choose to turn these filters off, but teen users don't have the option.",
      "OpenAI warns that such guardrails are \u201cnot foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\u201d It advised parents to talk with their children about \u201chealthy AI use.\u201d",

      "OpenAI said it will protect the teen's privacy by only sharing the information needed for parents or emergency responders to provide help.",
      "\u201cNo system is perfect, and we know we might sometimes raise an alarm when there isn\u2019t real danger, but we think it\u2019s better to act and alert a parent so they can step in than to stay silent,\u201d the company said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Here he is, depicted at six months in office, chiseled and brawny, as mighty as the very nation. Here he is as a Star Wars Jedi wielding a patriot-red lightsaber, rescuing our galaxy from the forces of evil. Here he is taking over Gaza, transforming the strip into a luxury resort complete with a golden effigy of himself.",
      "You can be anything, perhaps you were told growing up. Doctor. Astronaut. Maybe, one day, the president. But even the chief executive of the United States, the free world\u2019s leader, frames himself as something more epic \u2014 as someone not entirely himself.",
      "On the social media accounts of Donald Trump and his second-term administration, a new official image of the president is emerging bit by bit: one generated artificially.",
      "A sign of the times, certainly \u2014 when the appeal of reimagining yourself with artificial intelligence has trickled up from us everyday citizens. Bored with your selfies? Join a viral trend: There\u2019s an image generator or a chatbot that can turn you into a Renaissance-style painting, a Studio Ghibli character or an action figure with box art and accessories.",
      "Artificial imagery isn\u2019t new for Trump, an early target of AI-generated simulacra who later exploited the technology during his 2024 campaign for the presidency. \u201cIt works both ways,\u201d the Republican president said of AI-generated content at a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIf something happens that\u2019s really bad, maybe I\u2019ll have to just blame AI.\u201d",
      "The AI images of Trump posted by him and his team opt for the alternative \u2014 not deceptive but self-evident in their fictitiousness. Pope Francis dies, and Trump jokes to reporters that he\u2019d like to be pope. A week later, he is, but in an AI-generated image that he posts, reposted by the White House. Trump likens himself to a king in a Truth Social post in February, and AI makes him one in an X post by the White House less than an hour later.",
      "The artifice arrives in Trump\u2019s usual style \u2014 brassy, unabashed, attention-grabbing \u2014 and squares with his social media team\u2019s heavy meme posting, which it has promised to continue. The administration\u2019s official social media accounts have grown by more than 16 million new followers across platforms since Inauguration Day, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "The White House recognizes the appeal. In July, it posted to its X account: \u201cNowhere in the Constitution does it say we can\u2019t post banger memes.\u201d Attached to the post, a photo of a sign on the White House lawn parodying the naysayers: \u201coMg, diD tHe wHiTE hOuSE reALLy PosT tHis?\u201d",
      "Behind the commander in chief\u2019s desire to craft an AI self \u2014 not itself uncommon \u2014 an infantry of official communications channels stands at his ready. And we, the people, can\u2019t help but tune in.",
      "Like so much on the internet these days, Trump\u2019s AI portraits are primed for people to react, says Evan Cornog, a political historian and author of \u201cThe Power and the Story: How the Crafted Presidential Narrative Has Determined Political Success from George Washington to George W. Bush.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy the time you\u2019ve seen it, you\u2019ve understood it. And that\u2019s, of course, the efficacy,\u201d Cornog said. \u201cIt requires no effort, either for the person generating it, but particularly for the person consuming it.\u201d",
      "The expressive power of political imagery, regardless of the truth of its message, has long been understood by politicians and their detractors.",
      "President William Henry Harrison\u2019s log cabin and hard cider campaign symbols, representing him as a \u201cman of the people,\u201d helped him win the election of 1840. Thirty years later, political cartoonist Thomas Nast would turn public opinion against William Marcy \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed with his scathing portrayals of the politician, whom he depicted satirically overweight from greed. \u201cLet\u2019s stop those damned pictures!\u201d Tweed once said, or so the story goes.",
      "The decades since witnessed the birth of photo, film, TV, the internet, computer printers, image-editing software and digital screens that shrank until they could fit in our pockets, making it increasingly easy to create and disseminate \u2014 and manipulate \u2014 imagery.",
      "By contrast, today\u2019s generative AI technology offers greater realism, functionality and accessibility to content creation than ever before, says AI expert Henry Ajder. Not to mention, of course, a capacity for endless automated possibility.",
      "Past presidents \u201chad to actually have fought in a war to run as a war hero,\u201d Cornog says. Now, they can just generate an image of themselves as one. On a horse \u2014 or no, a battlefield. With an American flag waving behind him and an eagle soaring.",

      "The lack of subtlety in Trump\u2019s AI images of himself helps explain their consistent virality.",

      "Other responses, even from the president\u2019s base, remain unconvinced (as one X user griped under the White House post of Trump as pope: \u201cI voted for you, but this is weird and creepy. More mass deportations and less of whatever this is.\u201d).",
      "But that is tradition for Trump, who finds no trouble cashing the currency of our attention economy: Whether you cracked a smile or clutched your pearls, he still made you look.",

      "Does Trump really think he should be pope? Does the White House really think him a king? Accuracy isn\u2019t the point, not for a man who frequently arbitrates what counts as truth. Trump's use of AI sticks to a familiar recipe for bait: crude comedy sprinkled with wishful thinking.",

      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.",
      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",

      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",

      "In March, a Dartmouth University-based team published the first known randomized clinical trial of a generative AI chatbot for mental health treatment.",

      "Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people.",

      "Many AI apps are optimized for engagement and are built to support everything users say, rather than challenging peoples\u2019 thoughts the way therapists do. Many walk the line of companionship and therapy, blurring intimacy boundaries therapists ethically would not.",
      "Therabot\u2019s team sought to avoid those issues.",
      "The app is still in testing and not widely available. But Jacobson worries about what strict bans will mean for developers taking a careful approach. He noted Illinois had no clear pathway to provide evidence that an app is safe and effective.",
      "\u201cThey want to protect folks, but the traditional system right now is really failing folks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, trying to stick with the status quo is really not the thing to do.\u201d",

      "New Zealand\u2019s annual bird election has crowned the k\u0101rearea, or New Zealand falcon, as Bird of the Year",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 New Zealand \u2019s annual bird election is contested by cheeky parrots, sweet songbirds and cute, puffball robins. This year\u2019s winner was a mysterious falcon that wouldn\u2019t think twice about eating them.",
      "K\u0101rearea, the Indigenous M\u0101ori name for the New Zealand falcon, was crowned Bird of the Year on Monday. But the annual poll, run by conservation group Forest & Bird, is no ordinary online vote.",
      "The fiercely fought election sees volunteer (human) campaign managers apply to stump for their favorite bird. Feathers fly as avian enthusiasts seek to sway the public through meme battles, trash-talking poster campaigns and dance routines performed in bird costumes.",
      "\u201cBird of the Year has grown from a simple email poll in 2005 to a hotly contested cultural moment,\u201d said Forest & Bird Chief Executive Nicola Toki. \u201cBehind the memes and mayhem is a serious message.\u201d",
      "The contest draws attention to New Zealand\u2019s native bird species, with 80% designated as being in trouble to some degree. But it attracts passionate fandom because New Zealanders are bird-obsessed.",
      "In a country with no native land mammals except for two species of bat, birds reign supreme. They appear in art, on jewelry, in schoolchildren\u2019s songs, and in the name New Zealanders are known by abroad, \u201ckiwis.\u201d",
      "Beloved birds include alpine parrots that harass tourists and pigeons which get so drunk on berries that they sometimes fall out of trees.",
      "\u201cThis is not a land of lions, tigers and bears,\u201d said Toki. \u201cThe birds here are weird and wonderful and not what you would expect to see perhaps in other countries.\u201d",
      "The first contest two decades ago attracted fewer than 900 votes. More than 75,000 people in the country of 5 million cast ballots this year.",
      "It was the highest-ever voter turnout apart from an episode when Last Week Tonight host John Oliver volunteered as a campaign manager in 2023, prompting mostly joking accusations from New Zealanders of American interference. Perhaps inevitably, Oliver\u2019s bird, the p\u016bteketeke or Australasian crested grebe, won in a 290,000-vote landslide.",
      "Other controversies have struck the poll. In 2021, there was mild uproar when a bat won the title, despite not being a bird.",
      "The vote was ruffled by a foreign influence scandal in 2018 when self-styled comedians in Australia cast hundreds of fraudulent votes for a bird that shares its name with an Antipodean slang term for sex. Voters must now verify the email addresses used to cast their votes.",

      "Official figures suggest between 5,000 and 8,000 New Zealand falcons remaining, although the true number is unknown. Bradfield said the \u201cfast and sneaky and very special\u201d raptor was a deserving Bird of the Year winner.",

      "A popular Alaskan climber fell to his death from Yosemite National Park\u2019s El Capitan",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A popular Alaskan climber fell to his death from Yosemite National Park's El Capitan, marking the third death in the park this summer.",
      "Balin Miller, 23, died in a climbing accident Wednesday, his mother Jeanine Girard-Moorman confirmed.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been climbing since he was a young boy,\u201d she said. \u201cHis heart and soul was truly to just climb. He loved to climb and it was never about money and fame.\u201d",
      "The death comes on the first day of the federal government shutdown, which left national parks \u201cgenerally\u201d open, with limited operations and closed visitors centers, according to the National Park Service. The park service did not respond to an email requesting comment, and it's unclear what staff remains at Yosemite during the shutdown.",
      "El Capitan is one of the most striking features of Yosemite National Park, an enormous sheer granite rock face of approximately 3,000 feet (915 meters) that entices big-wall rock climbers from all over the world. Alex Honnold completed the first free solo climb of El Capitan in 2017 for the documentary \u201cFree Solo.\u201d",
      "Many posted tributes to Miller on social media, saying they had watched him climb on a TikTok livestream for two days before his death and referring him to \u201corange tent guy\" because of his distinctive camp setup.",
      "Earlier this year, an 18-year-old from Texas died in the park while free-soloing, or climbing without a rope, on a different formation. In August, a 29-year-old woman died after being struck in the head by a large tree branch while hiking.",
      "While it's still unclear exactly what happened, his older brother, Dylan Miller, said Balin was lead rope soloing \u2014 a way to climb alone while still protected by a rope \u2014 on a 2,400-foot (730-meter) route named Sea of Dreams. He had already finished the climb and was hauling up his last bit of gear when he likely rappelled off the end of his rope, Dylan said.",
      "Miller was an accomplished alpinist who had already gained international attention for claiming the first solo ascent of Mount McKinley's Slovak Direct, a technically difficult route that took him 56 hours to complete, he posted on his Instagram in June.",
      "He grew up climbing in Alaska with his brother and their father, who was also a climber. While Dylan took a little more time to fall in love with the sport, it stuck with his younger sibling instantly.",
      "\u201cHe said he felt most alive when he was climbing,\u201d Dylan Miller said. \u201cI\u2019m his bigger brother but he was my mentor.\u201d",

      "LANSING, Mich. -- An online fundraiser for family members of the man who opened fire in a Michigan church and set it ablaze has raised over $275,000 as of Thursday in what the organizer described as a \u201cwhirlwind of love and forgiveness.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Thomas \u201cJake\u201d Sanford, 40, drove his pickup truck into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Grand Blanc Township, near Flint, shot at the congregation and set the building on fire.",
      "The attack killed four people, injured eight others and left the church destroyed. Police killed Sanford at the scene.",
      "Dave Butler, a Utah resident and lifelong member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, watched news coverage of the attack for hours. The following day, he considered that Sanford's family were also victims of the attack.",

      "Butler set up the fundraiser on the platform GiveSendGo on Tuesday morning. He leveraged media connections from his participation in podcasts about the Latter-day Saints faith to help promote the fundraiser.",
      "Donations poured in and the effort quickly drew attention, too, highlighting many people being far more familiar with efforts to raise money online for victims of mass shootings in the U.S.",
      "Authorities have not discussed Sanford's motive for the attack this week, though they have described it as an \u201cact of targeted violence\u201d by Sanford alone. Longtime friends have said he expressed hatred toward the faith known widely as the Mormon church after living in Utah, where he dated but later broke up with a woman who was a member of the faith.",
      "Butler's original goal was to raise $10,000 to offer the family something to get them through the next few months.",
      "He said many members of the faith have articulated that contributing to the fund feels like the right way to respond to the tragedy.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m responding to an attack against us in the right way. Not to get revenge, not to get justice, not to blame the wrong people,\u201d Butler said.",

      "The Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state produced plutonium for most of America's nuclear arsenal through the end of the Cold War",
      "SEATTLE -- For much of the 20th century, a sprawling complex in the desert of southeastern Washington state turned out most of the plutonium used in the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal, from the first atomic bomb to the arms race that fueled the Cold War.",
      "Now, after decades of planning and billions of dollars of investment, the site is turning liquid nuclear and chemical waste at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation into a much safer substance: glass.",
      "State regulators on Wednesday issued the final permit Hanford needed for workers to remove more waste from often-leaky underground tanks, mix it in a crucible with additives, and heat it above 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 Celsius). The mixture then cools in stainless steel vats and solidifies into glass \u2014 still radioactive, but far more stable to keep in storage, and less likely to seep into the soil or the nearby Columbia River.",
      "The long-awaited development is a key step in cleaning up the nation's most polluted nuclear waste site. Construction on the Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant began in 2002.",
      "\u201cWe are at the precipice of a really significant moment in Hanford\u2019s history,\u201d said Casey Sixkiller, director of the Washington State Department of Ecology, in a video interview.",
      "The roughly 600-square-mile (1500-square-km) reservation is near the confluence of two of the Pacific Northwest\u2019s most significant rivers, the Snake and the Columbia, in an area important to Native American tribes for millennia.",
      "Wartime planners selected the area because it was isolated and had access to cold water and hydroelectric power. In early 1943, the U.S. government seized the land for a secret project, displacing roughly 2,000 residents, including farmers.",
      "Tens of thousands of workers then responded to newspaper ads around the country promising good jobs to support the Allied effort to defeat Nazi Germany and Japan in World War II, and a new company town arose in the desert.",
      "Most of the workers had no idea they were involved in building the world's first full-scale plutonium production reactor until the U.S. dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, and President Harry S. Truman announced the existence of the Manhattan Project to the world.",
      "Hanford would grow to include nine nuclear reactors churning out plutonium for the nation's nuclear arsenal. The last of these was shut down in 1987. Two years later, Washington state, the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reached an agreement to clean up the site.",
      "Seven of the nine reactors have been \u201ccocooned\u201d to prevent contamination from escaping until radiation levels drop enough to allow for dismantling, near the end of the century.",
      "There are also 177 giant underground tanks that hold some 56 million gallons (212 million liters) of highly radioactive and chemically hazardous waste. Those tanks are well past their projected lifespan of 25 years. More than one-third have leaked in the past, and three are currently leaking.",
      "During its years producing plutonium for nuclear weapons, Hanford dumped effluent directly into the Columbia River and into ineffective containment ponds, polluting the surrounding groundwater and contaminating the food chain of wildlife that depends on it, according to a 2013 government assessment.",

      "More than $30 billion has been spent on the plants so far. The U.S. Department of Energy, which oversees Hanford, has faced an Oct. 15 deadline to have turned some of its stored waste into glass, per a cleanup schedule and consent decree involving the EPA and Washington state.",

      "The Energy Department fired Roger Jarrell, its main overseer of the Hanford cleanup, earlier this month, prompting concerns about the Trump administration's commitment. Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said Energy Secretary Chris Wright told her by phone that he was looking to stall the vitrification operations.",

      "A new study shows that the world's most damaging wildfires are happening four times more often now compared to the 1980s",
      "WASHINGTON -- Earth\u2019s nastiest and costliest wildfires are blazing four times more often now than they did in the 1980s because of human-caused climate change and people moving closer to wildlands, a new study found.",
      "A study in the journal Science looks at global wildfires, not by acres burned which is the most common measuring stick, but by the harder to calculate economic and human damage they cause. The study concluded there has been a \u201cclimate-linked escalation of societally disastrous wildfires.\u201d",
      "A team of Australian, American and German fire scientists calculated the 200 most damaging fires since 1980 based on the percentage of damage to the country's Gross Domestic Product at the time, taking inflation into account. The frequency of these events has increased about 4.4 times from 1980 to 2023, said study lead author Calum Cunningham, a pyrogeographer at the Fire Centre at the University of Tasmania in Australia.",
      "\u201cIt shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that we do have a major wildfire crisis on our hands,\u201d Cunningham said.",
      "About 43% of the 200 most damaging fires occurred in the last 10 years of the study. In the 1980s, the globe averaged two of these catastrophic fires a year and a few times hit four a year. From 2014 to 2023, the world averaged nearly nine a year, including 13 in 2021. It noted that the count of these devastating infernos sharply increased in 2015, which \u201ccoincided with increasingly extreme climatic conditions.\u201d Though the study date ended in 2023, the last two years have been even more extreme, Cunningham said.",
      "Europe and North America lead in the number of these economically damaging fires. It's especially worse in the Mediterranean around Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal and in the Western United States around California, because of the climate prone to sudden dryness, worsened by global warming, Cunningham said.",
      "The researchers also found a tripling in how often a single fire killed at least 10 people, such as 2018's Paradise fire, 2023's Lahaina fire and those in Los Angeles in 2025.",
      "Cunningham said often researchers look at how many acres a fire burns as a measuring stick, but he called that flawed because it really doesn't show the effect on people, with area not mattering as much as economics and lives. Hawaii's Lahaina fire wasn't big, but it burned a lot of buildings and killed a lot of people so it was more meaningful than one in sparsely populated regions, he said.",
      "\u201cWe need to be targeting the fires that matter. And those are the fires that cause major ecological destruction because they\u2019re burning too intensely,\u201d Cunningham said.",
      "But economic data is difficult to get with many countries keeping that information private, preventing global trends and totals from being calculated. So Cunningham and colleagues were able to get more than 40 years of global economic date from insurance giant Munich Re and then combine it with the public database from International Disaster Database, which isn't as complete but is collected by the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium.",
      "The study looked at \u201cfire weather\u201d which is hot, dry and windy conditions that make extreme fires more likely and more dangerous and found that those conditions are increasing, creating a connection to the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve firstly got that connection that all the disasters by and large occurred during extreme weather. We\u2019ve also got a strong trend of those conditions becoming more common as a result of climate change. That\u2019s indisputable,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a line of evidence there to say that climate change is having a significant effect on at least creating the conditions that are suitable for a major fire disaster.\u201d",
      "If there was no human-caused climate change, the world would still have devastating fires, but not as many, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re loading the dice in a sense by increasing temperatures.\u201d",
      "There are other factors. People are moving closer to fire-prone areas, called the wildland-urban interface, Cunningham said. And society is not getting a handle on dead foliage that becomes fuel, he said. But those factors are harder to quantify compared to climate change, he said.",
      "\"This is an innovative study in terms of the data sources employed, and it mostly confirms common sense expectations: fires causing major fatalities and economic damage tend to be those in densely populated areas and to occur during the extreme fire weather conditions that are becoming more common due to climate change,\" said Jacob Bendix, a geography and environment professor at Syracuse University who studies fires, but wasn't part of this research team.",
      "Not only does the study makes sense, but it's a bad sign for the future, said Mike Flannigan, a fire researcher at Thompson Rivers University in Canada. Flannigan, who wasn't part of research, said: \"As the frequency and intensity of extreme fire weather and drought increases the likelihood of disastrous fires increases so we need to do more to be better prepared.\"",

      "Shutdowns of the federal government usually don\u2019t leave much economic damage",
      "WASHINGTON -- Shutdowns of the federal government usually don't leave much economic damage. But the one that started Wednesday looks riskier, not least because President Donald Trump is threatening to use the standoff to permanently eliminate thousands of government jobs and the state of the economy is already precarious.",
      "For now, financial markets are shrugging off the impasse as just the latest failure of Republicans and Democrats to agree on a budget and keep the government running.",
      "\u201cEveryone seems quite complacent about the shutdown, assuming the Democrats and Republicans will come to terms and life will go on, as has been the case in past shutdowns,\u201d the independent economist Ed Yardeni wrote in a commentary Thursday. \"History could certainly repeat, especially with a man known for dealmaking sitting in the Oval Office.''",
      "But given the chasm separating the two political parties, Yardeni added, \"the lack of caution is somewhat surprising.''",
      "The U.S. government has now shut down 21 times in the past half century. The last of those shutdowns was the longest \u2014 stretching five weeks in December 2018 into January 2019 during Trump's first term.",
      "Even that one barely left a mark on the world's biggest economy: The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it shaved just 0.02% off 2019 U.S. gross domestic product \u2014 the nation's output of goods and services.",
      "The economic impact of shutdowns is usually fleeting. Federal workers get furloughed and the federal government delays some spending while they last. When they\u2019re over, federal workers go back to their jobs and collect back pay, and the government belatedly spends the money it had withheld. It\u2019s pretty much a wash.",
      "\u201cGovernment shutdowns are inconvenient and messy,\u2033 said Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at the investment firm Global X. \u201dBut there is little evidence that they have a significant impact on the economy. Typically, the lost economic activity, if meaningful in the first place, is recovered in the following quarter.\u2033",
      "Government benefit payments that provide crucial income support for millions of Americans, such as Social Security, and health care programs such as Medicare, won\u2019t be disrupted by the shutdown.",
      "Data from previous shutdowns have shown little impact on U.S. GDP unless they are extended, according to CBO Director Phillip Swagel. \u201cThe impact is not immediate, but over time, there is a negative impact of a shutdown on the economy,\u201d he recently told The Associated Press.",
      "The damage could be worse this go-around.",
      "First, some government agencies dodged the 2018-2019 shutdown because they'd received funding in advance and could just continue operating. That hasn't happened this time: The CBO estimates that about 750,000 federal employees could be temporarily laid off.",
      "Trump is also considering something more destructive: His budget office has threatened the mass firing of federal workers this time, not just putting them on temporary furlough.",

They\u2019re going to be Democrats,\" the president said Tuesday.",
      "Thomas Ryan of Capital Economics wrote in a commentary that \u201cit is reasonable to assume that (Trump\u2019s mass layoff threat) is political bluster, aimed at pressuring Democrats to approve a funding extension without concessions.\u201d But, he added, \u201cif followed through, it could have longer-term consequences, prolonging government downsizing and keeping the sector as a drag on payrolls into next year.\"",
      "Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, estimates that the shutdown and temporary loss of income for federal workers could shave 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points from the nation's annual growth rate in the fourth quarter for each week the government is closed. Some of that will be recovered once it reopens.",
      "\u201cThe economic costs of government shutdowns are normally minimal unless they last for several weeks,\u201d Sweet wrote.",
      "The showdown also comes at a time when the job market is already under strain, damaged by the lingering effects of high interest rates and uncertainty around Trump's erratic campaign to slap taxes on imports from almost every country on earth and on specific products \u2014 from copper to foreign films.",
      "Labor Department revisions earlier this month showed that the economy created 911,000 fewer jobs than originally reported in the year that ended in March. That meant that employers added an average of fewer than 71,000 new jobs a month over that period, not the 147,000 first reported. Since March, job creation has slowed even more \u2014 to an average 53,000 a month. During the 2021-2023 hiring boom that followed COVID-19 lockdowns, by contrast, the economy was creating 400,000 jobs a month.",
      "The September jobs report was supposed to come out Friday \u2014 forecasters had expected to see 50,000 new jobs last month \u2014 but has been delayed indefinitely by the shutdown.",
      "The economy is sending mixed signals, however. GDP growth came in at a strong 3.8% annual pace from April through June, reversing a 0.6% drop in the first three months of the year. But it's not yet clear if that solid growth can continue, or if it will spur a rebound in hiring.",
      "\u201cThe economy is very much on a \u2018knife\u2019s edge,\u2019\u201d said Michael Linden, senior policy fellow at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cThe economic data is pointing in different directions right now. Second-quarter GDP growth was strong, but how much of that was merely a bounce back from incredibly weak first quarter GDP is hard to know. What we know for sure is that the economy is creating fewer jobs, wage growth is slowing, and middle-class consumers are feeling pinched.\u201d",

      "Famed primatologist Jane Goodall was renowned for her groundbreaking work with chimpanzees but dedicated her life to helping all wild animals \u2014 a passion that lasted until her death this week while on a U.S. speaking tour.",
      "She spent decades promoting humanitarian causes and the need to protect the natural world, and tried to balance the grim realities of the climate crisis with hope for the future, admirers said.",
      "Those messages of hope \u201cmobilized a global movement to protect the planet,\u201d said former President Joe Biden, who awarded Goodall the Presidential Medal of Freedom just before he left office.",

      "Famed anthropologist and paleontologist Louis Leakey gave her the job and later invited her to search for fossils with him and his wife at the Olduvai Gorge. After seeing her grit and determination, Leakey asked if she would be interested in studying chimpanzees in what is now Tanzania.",

      "While first studying chimpanzees in Tanzania in the early 1960s, Goodall didn\u2019t spend her days simply observing the animals from afar and giving them numbers like other scientists.",
      "She immersed herself in every aspect of their lives, feeding them and giving them names and forming what can only be described as personal relationships with them. The approach was criticized by some scientists who saw it as an alarming lack of scientific detachment.",
      "Goodall documented chimpanzees in a wide array of activities widely believed at the time to be exclusive to humans, including showing their ruthlessly violent side during what she described as \u201cwarfare.\u201d",
      "She described seeing a group systematically hunt down and kill members of a smaller group over the course of four years. The war ended only after every member of the smaller group was dead.",
      "\u201cIt was a shock to find that they could show such brutal behavior,\u201d she said in 2003. \u201cThat made them seem even more like us then I thought before.\u201d",
      "In another instance, she recalled a dominant chimpanzee brushing a younger chimp aside to get fruit. When the second chimp screamed, its big brother stepped in to rescue him. And then when those two chimps started screaming, a female two trees away stepped in.",
      "Since Goodall could crawl, she\u2019d had a fascination with animals.

      "Karen Attiah, a former opinion columnist at The Washington Post, says she was fired after social media posts expressing concerns about gun violence and rhetoric against Black women",
      "As the founding global opinion editor for The Washington Post, Karen Attiah believed her job had always been about assessing world affairs in a way that elevated a diverse range of perspectives.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not just a columnist,\u201d she recently said.",
      "But last week, the Post\u2019s only Black female opinion writer revealed she had been fired over posts on Bluesky about violent white men in the wake of Charlie Kirk\u2019s killing that the newspaper said violated its social media policy. After offering what she called an \u201chonest reflection on the state of violence in America,\u201d her 11 years at the Post came to an abrupt end.",
      "\u201cBeing pushed out of the Washington Post for expressing myself \u2014 for not even expressing myself, for doing my job as a journalist \u2014 is really a deep, sort of cruel 180,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "The firing of Attiah, the last Black full-time member on the Post\u2019s opinion desk, worries media professionals and advocacy organizations about the wider implications for journalistic freedom and diversity. The potential fallout, they say, could make journalists of color hesitant to express opinions or address injustices, effectively muting those perspectives.",
      "The National Association of Black Journalists, the nation's largest professional advocacy organization for journalists of color, said Tuesday that Attiah's firing had \u201craised an alarm about the erosion of Black voices across the media.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe absence of Black journalists doesn\u2019t just harm us \u2014 it impoverishes the entire profession,\" said NABJ President Errin Haines. \"When our voices are missing, stories go untold, perspectives go unchallenged, and the truth remains incomplete.\u201d",
      "After a meeting Monday with Washington Post Executive Editor Matt Murray, NABJ leadership said it had assurances that the news outlet is working to retain diversity among its staff and to expand access to careers for journalists of color.",
      "A Washington Post spokesperson declined the AP\u2019s request to comment on Attiah\u2019s firing. Attiah has announced plans to dispute the Post\u2019s decision in court.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more sort of about this chilling precedent that it sets for journalists, for educators, for researchers, for anyone who writes on gender and violence. If they think it\u2019s going to stop with me just because I was a Black woman saying this, it never stops with just Black people,\u201d Attiah said.",
      "Attiah\u2019s firing comes among dozens of others across various professions stemming from comments about Kirk's assassination, igniting a debate over First Amendment rights as President Donald Trump has vowed retribution for remarks he considers disparaging.",
      "\"The removal of vital voices like Karen Attiah\u2019s \u2014 whose reporting helps our communities understand the political context we\u2019re in \u2014 is a dangerous and deliberate act of erasure by media owners,\u201d the Media 2070 Project, a nonpartisan organization advocating for a free press and exchange of ideas, said in a statement.",
      "The president of the Washington Association of Black Journalists, of which Attiah is a member, said the firing is a \u201cchilling moment in news media,\u201d particularly for Black journalists, whose voices have historically been targeted.",
      "\u201cThis firing sends a message to other Black journalists and writers that our perspectives aren\u2019t valued unless we align with the status quo,\u201d WABJ President Philip Lewis told the AP.",
      "For many media diversity advocates, Attiah\u2019s firing reflects a history of excluding Black women and their perspectives from white owned and run news outlets \u2014 like journalist Ida B. Wells-Barnett, whose reporting on lynchings of Black Americans in the 1890s was dismissed and attacked by mainstream papers.",
      "\u201cOften, it\u2019s the people who get left out of the frame and left out of the division of the nation that are the ones saying, \u2018Actually, we can think about this better,\u2019\u201d said Khadijah Costley White, associate professor of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, who specializes in writing and commentary on race, social movements, news and politics.",

      "City government released the names of the victims who died from Saturday night's shootings at the American Fish Company in Southport, located about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Wilmington. Five others were injured. City spokesperson ChyAnn Ketchum said late Wednesday it was her understanding that the five remained hospitalized.",

Edge, 40, remained held Wednesday in the Brunswick County jail without bond. His next court appearance is scheduled for Oct. 13.",

An arrest warrant alleged that Edge used an AR-style rifle with a silencer and scope.",
      "Edge was arrested about a half an hour later after a U.S. Coast Guard crew spotted him pulling a boat from the water at a ramp on Oak Island, where he lives. The investigation remains active, and Southport police said Wednesday they were still seeking information from people who went to the bar Saturday or the day before.",
      "Edge has not entered a plea. The county's top prosecutor described during Edge's court hearing Monday the defendant as having \u201csignificant mental health issues\u201d after experiencing a traumatic brain injury. Edge, who changed his name from Sean DeBevoise in 2023, told police he was injured in combat and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, Coring said.",

      "The government shutdown has sparked intense political battles, with both parties blaming each other even as major job cuts \u2014 and major disruptions to iconic sites like the Liberty Bell and Pearl Harbor \u2014 have begun taking hold",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans and Democrats spent the first day of the federal government shutdown blaming each other for the dysfunction, as iconic sites representing the nation's core identity \u2014 from the Liberty Bell in Pennsylvania to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii \u2014 were temporarily closed.",
      "The Trump administration enlisted Vice President JD Vance for an appearance in the White House briefing room to argue, falsely, that Democrats refused to keep the government funded because they were trying to extend health coverage to people in the country illegally.",
      "Top Democrats countered that they simply want to renew funding for health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act so that insurance premiums won\u2019t spike nationwide for American families.",
      "Neither side said it would budge, but, as the finger-pointing persisted, the economic pain became more likely to spread \u2014 potentially putting hundreds of thousands of jobs and basic services at risk.",
      "Callers to the White House comment line heard a recorded message from press secretary Karoline Leavitt stating: \u201cDemocrats in Congress have shut down the federal government because they care more about funding health care for illegal immigrants than they care about serving you, the American people.\u201d Several federal agencies posted overtly partisan messages on their websites blaming Democrats for the shutdown.",
      "The White House underscored its argument by reviving a deepfake video posted by President Donald Trump of House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries in a fake mustache and sombrero, a meme that Jeffries described as bigoted. They played it on repeat in the White House briefing room, though Vance promised that the \u201csombrero memes will stop\u201d when the government reopens.",
      "Jeffries responded with a meme of his own superimposing an image of Vance with a fat head and curly, long hair. \u201cJD Vance thinks we will surrender to the Republican effort to gut healthcare because of a Sombrero meme. Not happening Bro,\u201d Jeffries wrote in a post on X.",
      "Vance said he couldn\u2019t predict how long the shutdown might go on, but also said he didn\u2019t believe it would be lengthy because some moderate Senate Democrats might soon vote with GOP colleagues to restore funding.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, if this thing drags on for another few days or, God forbid, another few weeks, we are going to have to lay people off,\" Vance said.",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said that Trump has refused to negotiate in good faith and that the claims of Democrats closing the government for immigrants in the country illegally is a lie.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump says it loud and clear: He is using the American people as pawns, threatening pain on the country as blackmail,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Roughly 750,000 federal workers were expected to be furloughed, with some potentially fired. Many offices were being shuttered, perhaps permanently, as the Republican president vows to \u201cdo things that are irreversible\u201d to punish Democrats.",
      "The White House's key policy priorities, including an aggressive deportation agenda, may continue with few disruptions. But education, environmental and other services may eventually sputter. The economic fallout could further imperil an already weakening job market, as a jobs report Wednesday by payroll processor ADP showed that private employers cut 32,000 jobs last month.",

He later announced that almost $8 billion in green energy projects would be withheld for 16 states, all states represented by two Democrats in the Senate.",
      "The last government shutdown came in late 2018 and early 2019, during Trump's first administration. It centered on a fight between both parties over funding for a wall along the Mexico-U.S. border and lasted more than 30 days. But Congress had already passed separate funding measures then that ensured that shutdown only partially affected government services, and wasn't as widespread as this one might be.",
      "Trump took most of the blame for the last shutdown, with an AP-NORC poll conducted during it, showing about 7 in 10 Americans said Donald Trump had \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201cquite a bit\u201d of responsibility.",
      "This time, about two-thirds of registered voters in a recent New York Times/Siena poll conducted before the shutdown said the Democrats should not allow the government to halt even if their demands were not met.",
      "Still, Republicans as the party in power could also face blowback. About one-quarter of registered voters in that poll said they would blame Trump and the Republicans in Congress if a shutdown happened, while about 2 in 10 said they would place blame on congressional Democrats. About one-third said they\u2019d blame both sides equally.",

    "summary": "Dutch producer pitches her AI creation, Tilly Norwood, as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says several agents are vying to represent it.",
    "story": [
      "Like thousands of actors, Tilly Norwood is looking for a Hollywood agent. Her greatest role? Pretending to be human.",
      "That's because Tilly Norwood is a 100% AI-generated product, created by Dutch producer and comedian Eline Van der Velden, founder of a company named Xicoia, which bills itself as the world's first artificial intelligence talent studio. Velden pitches her AI creation as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says there are several agents vying to represent it, CBS News' Jo Ling Kent reported recently.",
      "Since Velden launched the digital character's prospective career, Tilly Norwood has been all the talk in Hollywood.",
      "But not in a good way. Guilds, actors and filmmakers have met the Xicoia product with an immediate wave of backlash, protesting that artificial intelligence should not have a starring role in the acting profession. In a statement Tuesday, the Screen Actors Guild said that \"creativity is, and should remain, human-centered.\"",
      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, who starred in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Goonies,\" and was recently elected president of SAG-AFTRA, also emphasized how AI actors are artificial constructs trained off of work by real performers.",
      "\"You're made up of stuff that doesn't belong to you,\" he told CBS News. \"Let's just make sure that credit is given where credit is due.\"",
      "Van der Velden, who is also the founder of the AI production studio Particle6, promoted Tilly Norwood last month at the Zurich Summit, the industry sidebar of the Zurich Film Festival. It was there that she said talent agencies were circling Norwood and that she expected to soon announce a signing.",
      "Many in Hollywood hope that never happens.",
      "\"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" wrote Natasha Lyonne on Instagram. The \"Russian Doll\" star is directing a feature titled \"Uncanny Valley\" that pledges to use \"ethical\" artificial intelligence in combination with traditional filmmaking techniques. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed,\" she added. \"Not the way. Not the vibe. Not the use.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is often used as a tool in film production, though its implementation is hotly debated. It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",
      "That statement was also shared on Tilly Norwood's own Instagram account. Posts include photos of the creation drinking coffee, shopping for clothes and preparing for various projects. As of Tuesday, the account had more than 33,000 followers.",
      "A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)",
      "\"Had such a blast filming some screen tests recently,\" one post reads. \"Every day feels like a step closer to the big screen.\"",
      "Asked what human actors bring to a performance that AI can't, Astin said \"authenticity,\" adding, \"You can fall in love. Your parents can die. You can you can be in some terrifying situation. The sum of all of our emotional experiences in our life, artificial intelligence can approximate it \u2014 it is not real.\"",

Fonda even spent the night of her 82nd birthday behind bars. The last time Fonda had spent the night in jail was in 1970, when she was 32, while on a speaking tour protesting the Vietnam War.",

Although highly publicized at the time, the committee had a short and troubled history. Bogart and others would find themselves accused of Communist sympathies and would express surprise when a handful of the Hollywood Ten, including screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, turned out to have been Communist Party members at one time or another.",
      "By the following year, Bogart had published an essay in Photoplay magazine entitled \"I'm No Communist,\" in which he confided that \"actors and actresses always go overboard about things\" and warned against being \"used as dupes by Commie organizations.\" Trumbo and others in the Hollywood Ten would be jailed for refusing to cooperate with Congress and found themselves among many to be blacklisted through the end of the 1950s and beyond.",

      "The film tells the true story of bus driver Kevin McKay and teacher Mary Ludwig, who saved 22 children during the 2018 wildfire that destroyed Paradise, California. To prepare for the role, McConaughey spoke directly with McKay.",
      "\"Kevin [McKay] makes this decision to turn the bus around and go get his mom and son because they can't drive to get them into safety and away from the fire because there's a mandatory evacuation,\" McConaughey said. \"And just as he's made that decision, not 30 seconds later, a call comes through dispatch, it says I got 22 kids on the East side of town, anyone over there got an empty bus?\"",
      "When asked why McKay chose to rescue the children instead of his own family, McConaughey said the answer was surprisingly simple: \"He goes, well, it's my job. It's that simple.\"",

      "He said that the project grew out of a period when doubt and cynicism began to creep into his worldview.",
      "\"I found myself getting a little cynical even, looking down my nose, at people, objectifying people, not giving someone the benefit of the doubt,\" McConaughey said. \"When I saw enough of that, I just kind of went, well, maybe that's just how it is. That scared me.\"",
      "Rather than give in to that mindset, McConaughey said he chose to focus on ideals.",
      "\"I took out my pen and said, all right, if logic is not, if I'm not happy with logic, if I'm not finding belief and things to believe in, and reality with the facts, I'm gonna go to ideals, which are \"Poems & Prayers,\" and seek that divinity and that beauty and say, 'Hey, let's bring that to Earth, let's not quit believing in that.'\"",
      "Possible future in politics",
      "McConaughey also addressed long-running speculation about his political ambitions, confirming the possibility of pursuing a role in the field.",

      "The elaborate dayslong, drug-fueled sexual events were often filmed by Combs. Defense attorneys have asked that he be sentenced to no more than 14 months in prison. Sentencing is set for Friday. The music mogul had pleaded not guilty to all of the charges brought against him.",

      "The theme song to \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" is familiar to generations of TV watchers. The name of the man who wrote and sang it, less so.",
      "Who can turn the world on with her smile?Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?Well, it's you, girl, and you should know itWith each glance and every little movement you show it",
      "Love is all around, no need to waste itYou can have the town, why don't you take itYou're gonna make it after all",
      "But by the time Sonny Curtis recorded \"Love Is All Around\" in 1970, he'd \"made it\" several times over himself, as a songwriter, as a recording artist, and as an early bandmate of the legendary Buddy Holly.",
      "Born in 1937 in rural West Texas, Curtis grew up picking cotton on his father's farm. \"Oh, it was a miserable job,\" he told correspondent Mo Rocca. \"The heavier the cotton sack gets, the worse it is, man.\"",
      "His love of music came from family. His aunt taught him to play the guitar, and while working those fields, Curtis dreamed up his own songs: \"Driving a tractor, you go down half a mile that way, and when you get there, you turn around and come back a half mile this way. You have plenty of time to write a song!\"",
      "Curtis was just 14 when he met a young Buddy Holly in nearby Lubbock. \"Buddy had black hair, but he had dyed it blonde, and it was growing out. And he reminded me of a black-and-tan coon hound. We sorta skipped all the niceties and got our guitars and started playing.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"How quickly did you realize this guy's serious about music?\"",
      "\"Buddy, he exuded confidence. He just knew he was gonna make it big one day.\"",
      "The two became fast friends, bonded by their love of music. Sometimes, Curtis said, he'd spend the night at Buddy's. The two would wake up at midnight and flip on the car radio for a show out of Shreveport, Louisiana, to hear some of the rhythm and blues voices that would shape rock 'n' roll: \"We heard, oh, Big Mama Thornton and Lonnie Johnson, and Lead Belly, Little Richard, Ray Charles, you name it.\"",
      "\"Were you just absorbing this?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"Oh, boy, were we ever, yeah!\"",
      "Buddy and Sonny had formed a band and were still figuring out their own sound, when a then little-known Elvis Presley came to town. \"And I mean, the girls were goin' nuts, man. And that really got our attention. All a sudden, we thought, this not only involves music, this involves pretty girls!\"",
      "When Elvis came back to town in 1956, Buddy and Sonny's band was the opening act. \"Well, I guess we were right there sort of at the beginning of rock 'n' roll.\"",
      "\"What was Elvis like backstage?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"He was just an old boy.\"",
      "The band went on to record some demos, but wasn't making much money.",
      "So, Curtis left to tour with country star Slim Whitman. \"He treated me kind of like a little brother,\" Curtis said. \"I remember I'd be on the stage and he'd come over and say, 'Now don't be nervous.'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Buddy Holly formed a new band, which would prove to be seminal. The Crickets shot to fame, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"When that was happening, did you feel a little left out, like, 'Ugh'?\"",
      "\"I did feel kind of like the train left the station and I wasn't on it, you know?\" Curtis replied.",
      "But on February 3, 1959, Curtis' friend and former bandmate died in a plane crash near Clear Lake Iowa.",
      "Curtis served as a pallbearer.",
      "\"Buddy Holly was 22 when he died,\" Rocca said.",
      "\"Yes. Can you imagine the amount of music he pumped into the system in a short period of, like, 18 months? No telling how much he would've contributed had he been around.\"",
      "By that time, Curtis had joined the Crickets. But with Holly gone, the band felt rudderless.",
      "It was Curtis' talent for songwriting that helped put the wind back in his sails. His song \"Walk Right Back'' became a big hit for the Everly Brothers:",
      "And then there's this classic, which Curtis claims he wrote in about 20 minutes: \"I Fought the Law\":",

      "The clinics were in Baton Rouge and New Orleans.",
      "The president of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast said the closures were forced by \"compounding political attacks that have dismantled public health infrastructure, (and) blocked patients from care.\"",
      "The closures follow a court ruling last month that affected the clinics' ability to accept Medicaid reimbursements for providing patient care, by clearing the way for a provision of President Trump's tax and spending bill to be implemented.",
      "\"A federal court has allowed the Trump administration's 'defunding' of Planned Parenthood to take effect, blocking patients with Medicaid from accessing care in our health centers,\" the organization said in mid-September.",
      "Planned Parenthood said \u2060Texas has barred the organization from the state's Medicaid program since 2021, but that the latest ruling means Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast can no longer accept Medicaid in its Louisiana health centers.\u2060",
      "Planned Parenthood has warned of other possible closures nationwide amid Medicaid funding cuts in Mr. Trump's spending and tax bill, which instructs the government to halt Medicaid payments for a year to certain abortion providers.",
      "But while many Planned Parenthood clinics provide abortion services, the clinics in Louisiana that closed had not offered abortion services at any time in their 40-year history, according to the New Orleans Health Department. Planned Parenthood has never had a license to perform abortions in Louisiana, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Last year, the clinic in New Orleans served about 16,000 patients for sexually transmitted infection care and testing, and almost 9,000 patients for family planning care, including birth control and pregnancy tests, according to Planned Parenthood data provided by the New Orleans Health Department.",
      "\"We know that Planned Parenthood New Orleans on Claiborne Avenue served tens of thousands of patients a year with sexual and reproductive health services, and that clinic was important, because it was open access for people who were uninsured or underinsured people who didn't feel comfortable going elsewhere,\" said Jeannie Donovan, deputy director of population health and disease prevention at the New Orleans Health Department. \"It served a real need in our community.\"",
      "Donovan said her department has been working hard to fill the gap for people who relied on the New Orleans clinic for health care needs, creating new maps and databases for patients to find new primary care options.",
      "The clinics in New Orleans and Baton Rouge provided nearly 30,000 tests for sexually transmitted infections, as well 1,800 cancer screenings and 655 ultrasounds. They saw 14,400 visits for birth control, the AP reported.",
      "\"While this chapter closes, community leaders and stakeholders continue to explore possible pathways to carry forward the mission of advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights in Louisiana,\" said Melaney Linton, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, in a statement to CBS News. \"Though that future will not be possible through PPGC, the need remains urgent, and this fight is not over.\"",
      "Some, however, cheered the closures. Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said on social media Tuesday, \"This is a win for babies, a win for mothers, and a win for LIFE!\"",
      "\"Planned Parenthood built its business around promoting death,\" said Attorney General Liz Murrill. \"Louisiana proudly stands for life. We will always protect women and babies here in our State.\"",
      "Planned Parenthood said in July that 200 clinics \u2014 of about 600 \u2014 across the U.S. are also at risk of closing as a result of federal policy changes and funding cuts, although the organization is trying to have its funding restored through the courts.",
      "Last week, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin announced it would stop scheduling abortions, and the Arizona affiliate announced it would stop providing care to people covered by Medicaid. Those changes come after five clinics in California, as well as eight in Iowa and Minnesota, closed their doors earlier this year.",

      "A possible U.S. government shutdown\u00a0on Wednesday could hinge on a deal to maintain a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF.\u00a0About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",

    "story": [
      "Pessimism about the U.S. economy and its direction continues this month \u2014 negative ratings have persisted for years \u2014 along with net-negative ratings for the U.S.\u00a0job market, specifically.",
      "And in a year that has seen plenty of announcements about AI innovations and implications, there is also plenty of public suspicion that the job market may be hurt by AI.",
      "Today, the number saying the economy is getting worse has ticked up again, as prices continue to weigh on perceptions.",
      "Prices continue to be the main metric people use to evaluate the wider economy. And most say in the last few weeks, prices of the goods and services they buy have still been going up. Most expect them to keep rising, at least a little, too. (This, despite relatively better assessments of what's happening with gas prices.)",
      "Job market",
      "Just over half call the job market bad, and that's a tougher evaluation than Americans gave six months ago when views were more mixed.",
      "Some of that may be driven by prospective outlook. Most who are currently employed do feel at least somewhat, if not very, secure in their jobs right now. Yet most Americans think if they were looking for a job, it would be difficult to find the kind of job they want.",
      "When asking them to compare longer-term job market trends they're seeing, the picture is mixed, and the jobs market is not seen as growing. By 4 to 1, Americans think there are fewer \u2014 not more \u2014 good jobs where they live than there were five years ago, and the rest see it holding steady. Even workers who feel they have some job security tend to think there are fewer, not more, good jobs out there.",
      "As is often the case with economic evaluations, partisanship plays a role. Republicans are less likely than Democrats to hold negative views of the job market and the economy overall.",
      "As an ongoing string of discussions and reports speak to the potential impact of AI across a number of fields and the workplace, Americans overall hold a skeptical outlook, on balance. They feel AI will have a net-negative effect on job availability in their fields over the next ten years. This is the case for those currently working as well as those not.",
      "Given that, more broadly, many believe the development of AI and AI companies will have a negative impact on the U.S. economy overall. This view spans both education and income levels, though it is a little less pronounced among younger Americans.",
      "That said, for some, the view is that if a job is available, it could be easier to do as a result of AI.",
      "Overall views of the U.S. economy, which have been net-negative for years, continued to tick slightly down from the summer.",
      "As has long been the case, people in relatively higher income levels report their own personal financial situation being better than those at lower levels. But majorities across incomes do report prices going up.",

    "story": [
      "Many Americans are eager to put money away for retirement, but that goal is increasingly out of reach because more workers are living paycheck to paycheck, a new Goldman Sachs study finds.",
      "Roughly 42% of younger working Americans \u2014 spanning Gen Z, millennials and Gen X \u2014 report having no spare savings after covering their basic living expenses, according to the analysis, which surveyed about 3,600 workers and 1,500 retirees. Among those just getting by, about three-quarters said they are struggling to save for retirement, the survey found.",
      "The share of U.S. workers in this precarious financial position has grown significantly since 1997, when 31% lived paycheck to paycheck, according to Goldman. The investment bank projects that figure could climb to well over half of Americans by 2033 as essentials like housing and health care continue to rise in cost.",
      "\"Save more\" ignores reality",
      "The findings underscore the challenges millions of Americans now face just making ends meets while also managing to set aside money for retirement, a financial pinch that Goldman Sachs calls a \"financial vortex.\" That money crunch helps explains why more than a quarter of older Americans are nearing retirement without anything saved \u2014 a gap that could widen given the financial pressures facing younger workers.",
      "\"These findings force us to ask a very critical question: Does the retirement math still work? The answer is no,\" said Greg Wilson, head of retirement at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in a conference call to discuss the report. \"Telling workers just to 'save more' ignores the realities they face.\"",
      "Skipping a latte or avocado toast isn't likely to make much of a dent in the financial dynamics facing workers today, with Goldman finding that basic expenses are consuming an ever growing share of people's after-tax income.",
      "For instance, homeownership now eats up 51% of income, up from 33% in 2000, while health care costs account for 16% of after-tax earnings, up from 10% a quarter century ago, the analysis found.",
      "\"The mounting challenges American workers face ... make it harder than ever to save for retirement,\" Wilson said.",
      "Such financial pressures come as many Americans are on their own to plan, and save for, their retirement, largely because of the shift in the 1980s from company-sponsored pensions to 401(k) plans.",
      "As a savings vehicle, 401(k) shifts the burden onto workers, who must decide how much to save, how to invest and how to draw down their money in retirement \u2014 a do-it-yourself approach that retirement experts such as Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at The New School for Social Research in New York,\u00a0describe as inadequate.",
      "Hoping for a miracle",
      "Financial professionals say it's no coincidence that members of Generation X, which entered the workforce just as the shift to 401(k)s became mainstream, is feeling unprepared as they get closer to retirement. Now 45 to 60 years old, almost half said they believed it would take a \"miracle\" for them to be able to retire, a Natixis study found last year.",
      "Goldman acknowledged that it can be difficult to close a retirement funding gap with savings alone, but noted that some strategies could help. Some approaches may be out of reach for older workers, like Gen X and millennials, but could be of use for their children \u2014 for instance, setting aside $500 a year from ages 1 to 20, a move Goldman found could increase retirement savings by 14%.",
      "Adding private market investments to a portfolio could also help boost retirement savings by 14% through higher returns, according to Goldman. Those strategies might become more accessible for workers under a Trump administration plan to open up 401(k)\u00a0plans to private equity, cryptocurrencies and other alternative investments.",
      "Lastly, if possible, workers should take advantage of benefits from their employers such as funding an emergency savings account, which can help them avoid raiding their 401(k) in case of an unexpected expense, such as medical bills, the bank notes.",
      "Even so, while those approaches might work for workers with access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, about half of all U.S. private-sector workers\u00a0lack access to such programs, an analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts found earlier this year. Although it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to an employer retirement plan said they struggled to build wealth, the Pew survey found.",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Oct 2025 11:05:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion each week, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The fight over funding the government is likely to be a costly one.",
      "Each week of the ongoing government shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion and reduce GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, according to an estimate published by EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. That cost is a function of reduced pay for federal employees, delayed government procurement of goods and a decline in demand.",
      "To some extent, a portion of that economic cost would be reversed when the government reopens, as furloughed employees receive back pay and economic activity increases, the analysis said.",
      "It's likely that not everything would be reversible, though. The last shutdown \u2014 which was during President Trump's first term and lasted 34 days, beginning in December 2018 and ending in January 2019 \u2014 cost the U.S. economy about $11 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "During that shutdown, the longest on record, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that real gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2018 took a $3 billion hit (in 2019 dollars). And it estimated that in the first quarter of 2019, real GDP was \"$8 billion lower than it would have been \u2014 an effect reflecting both the five-week partial shutdown and the resumption in economic activity once funding resumed.\"",
      "The shutdown could shake Americans' faith in the economy, too. EY-Parthenon notes that at the time, the 2019 shutdown led to the sharpest monthly drop in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index up since 2012.",
      "Some of the shutdown costs also stem from the administrative effort necessary to create contingency plans when the government is shut down and reopened. Agencies lose user fees collected from visitors to the national parks or from people seeking certain federal permits or visas. And there are higher premiums in federal contracting during a shutdown and the back pay federal employees eventually receive when the government reopens.",
      "Current federal law requires that federal workers be paid at their regular rate, whether they're furloughed or not, once the government is operating again. In a new analysis cited by the White House, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal government will pay $400 million a day for furloughed employees, who will not be working during the shutdown.",
      "A September 2019 report from a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee estimated the last three government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 \"cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion \u2014 at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed federal workers, and at least $338 million in other costs associated with the shutdowns, including extra administrative work, lost revenue, and late fees on interest payments.\"",
      "The White House Office of Management and Budget estimated that during the 16-day shutdown of 2013, federal employees received $2.5 billion in pay and benefits for hours they did not work, plus $10 million in penalty interest payments and lost fees.",
      "2025 shutdown",
      "But this time may be different. President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Russell Vought, the OMB director, say layoffs will happen soon if the shutdown continues, so the net fiscal impact of a shutdown to the federal government is a little harder to predict right now. Vought immediately began freezing or slashing federal funding for projects, largely in blue states, during the shutdown. The Trump administration is withholding $18 billion in infrastructure projects in New York City, and cutting funding for climate-related projects in many states that Kamala Harris won.",
      "Vought also told Republican lawmakers Wednesday that Reduction in Force \u2014 or RIF \u2014 cuts would begin in two days.",
      "The president said Tuesday \"a lot of good can come down from shutdowns,\" and suggested Vought could use the shutdown to permanently cut federal workers and programs the administration doesn't want but that have the backing of Democrats.",
      "\"We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible for them, that are bad for them and irreversible by them,\" Mr. Trump said of Democrats. \"Like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.\"",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",

      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",

      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",

      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",

      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",

The layoffs this year, although elevated, remain well below the massive workforce reductions in 2020, when the pandemic shuttered businesses across the nation, leading to 2 million layoffs through September of that year, Challenger noted.",

Companies now expect to bring on 58% fewer workers for the rest of the year compared with their projections a year ago, the firm found.",
      "\"Previous periods with this many job cuts occurred either during recessions or, as was the case in 2005 and 2006, during the first wave of automations that cost jobs in manufacturing and technology,\" said Andy Challenger, senior vice president and labor expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, in a statement.",
      "The government shutdown could lead to more job cuts, with the White House Office of Management and Budget last week\u00a0telling federal agencies\u00a0to consider layoffs during a closure.",

      "In the absence of the government's monthly jobs report, other measures of the labor market's health are drawing more attention from economists. On Wednesday, ADP said that payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "However, some signs suggest that the pace of layoffs is easing, with Challenger's data showing that businesses announced roughly 54,000 job cuts in September, a 37% drop from the nearly 86,000 cuts announced in August.",
      "The Federal Reserve is monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing the headwinds facing workers as the primary reason the central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by\u00a00.25 percentage points. The Fed is penciling in two additional rate cuts for the remainder of 2025.",
      "A decline in borrowing costs for businesses and consumers could help bolster the job market, Challenger said. As interest rates fall, businesses have more flexibility to expand and hire more workers.",
      "\"Right now, we're dealing with a stagnating labor market, cost increases and a transformative new technology. With rate cuts on the way, we may see some stabilizing in the job market in the fourth quarter, but other factors could keep employers planning layoffs or holding off hiring,\" Challenger said.",

    "summary": "Data shows government shutdowns tend to have a modest impact on financial markets and the broader U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks closed at record highs Wednesday despite a U.S. government shutdown\u00a0expected to idle hundreds of thousands of workers and hobble federal agencies charged with dispensing a range of critical services. So why do investors seem unfazed?",
      "Although shutdowns have serious, real-world consequences for millions of Americans, data shows they tend to have a modest impact on financial markets and the broader economy, especially if the closure is brief.",
      "\"Most of the economic activity is delayed and usually gets made up shortly after a shutdown ends,\" Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, told CBS News. \"So I can't imagine this will be anything terribly disruptive for the equity markets.\"",
      "Over the previous 22 shutdowns the U.S. has seen since 1976, the S&P 500 rose during some of the closures while falling at other times. Overall, the stock index gained an average of 0.3% during the episodes, according to an analysis from Carson Group (see chart).",
      "What's more, the stock index jumped 13% on average in the 12 months following the shutdowns, the asset management firm found.",
      "\"Government shutdowns are inconvenient and messy, but there is little evidence that they have a significant impact on the economy,\" said Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at investment firm Global X, in a report.",
      "During the longest shutdown in U.S. history, which started in December 2018 and extended into January of the following year, some 800,000 federal workers were furloughed or worked without pay. That put many employees under severe financial pressure, driving some to food banks and others to launch online fundraising campaigns.",
      "Yet for the $30 trillion U.S. economy as a whole, that lost income amounted to a drop in the bucket, noted Thomas Ryan, North America economist at investment advisory firm Capital Economics. Consumption across the U.S. dipped for the two months the government remained partially shuttered, but quickly recovered.",
      "With Wall Street shrugging off the headlines on Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed up 0.3%, topping the all-time high it set last week. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average also finished in record territory.",
      "Why this time could be different",
      "The caveat? History is a guide \u2014 not a guarantee that events will follow the same script. The political dynamics driving the latest meltdown in Congress obviously differ from those that shaped previous eras, making it hard to predict how long the latest shutdown will last. An impasse lasting a month or more would fuel market uncertainty and could shake investor confidence, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Right now uncertainty is picking up again with new tariffs announced last week, and this just adds to it, which can paralyze growth for the foreseeable future,\" economist Daniel Altman and author of newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS News. \"It makes it harder for stocks to continue rising if nobody knows what the fiscal picture is going to be like for the next year.\"",
      "If the shutdown drags on, companies could also press pause on making investment and hiring decisions, which would weigh on stock prices, Altman said.",
      "The latest closure will have another immediate impact that could fray investor nerves \u2014 halting the flow of economic reports that experts use to assess everything from the rate of inflation to the pace of job growth. Without critical data, investors could start to feel like they are \"flying blind,\" Vital Knowledge market analyst Adam Crisafulli said in a report.",

    "summary": "Dutch producer pitches her AI creation, Tilly Norwood, as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says several agents are vying to represent it.",
    "story": [
      "Like thousands of actors, Tilly Norwood is looking for a Hollywood agent. Her greatest role? Pretending to be human.",
      "That's because Tilly Norwood is a 100% AI-generated product, created by Dutch producer and comedian Eline Van der Velden, founder of a company named Xicoia, which bills itself as the world's first artificial intelligence talent studio. Velden pitches her AI creation as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says there are several agents vying to represent it, CBS News' Jo Ling Kent reported recently.",
      "Since Velden launched the digital character's prospective career, Tilly Norwood has been all the talk in Hollywood.",
      "But not in a good way. Guilds, actors and filmmakers have met the Xicoia product with an immediate wave of backlash, protesting that artificial intelligence should not have a starring role in the acting profession. In a statement Tuesday, the Screen Actors Guild said that \"creativity is, and should remain, human-centered.\"",
      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, who starred in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Goonies,\" and was recently elected president of SAG-AFTRA, also emphasized how AI actors are artificial constructs trained off of work by real performers.",
      "\"You're made up of stuff that doesn't belong to you,\" he told CBS News. \"Let's just make sure that credit is given where credit is due.\"",
      "Van der Velden, who is also the founder of the AI production studio Particle6, promoted Tilly Norwood last month at the Zurich Summit, the industry sidebar of the Zurich Film Festival. It was there that she said talent agencies were circling Norwood and that she expected to soon announce a signing.",
      "Many in Hollywood hope that never happens.",
      "\"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" wrote Natasha Lyonne on Instagram. The \"Russian Doll\" star is directing a feature titled \"Uncanny Valley\" that pledges to use \"ethical\" artificial intelligence in combination with traditional filmmaking techniques. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed,\" she added. \"Not the way. Not the vibe. Not the use.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is often used as a tool in film production, though its implementation is hotly debated. It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",
      "That statement was also shared on Tilly Norwood's own Instagram account. Posts include photos of the creation drinking coffee, shopping for clothes and preparing for various projects. As of Tuesday, the account had more than 33,000 followers.",
      "A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)",
      "\"Had such a blast filming some screen tests recently,\" one post reads. \"Every day feels like a step closer to the big screen.\"",
      "Asked what human actors bring to a performance that AI can't, Astin said \"authenticity,\" adding, \"You can fall in love. Your parents can die. You can you can be in some terrifying situation. The sum of all of our emotional experiences in our life, artificial intelligence can approximate it \u2014 it is not real.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 15:09:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies are deterring manufacturers from hiring, according to the Center for American Progress.",
    "story": [
      "Manufacturers in the U.S. are cutting thousands of jobs even as President Trump pushes economic policies that he says will revitalize the industry.",
      "Employers shed 12,000 manufacturing jobs\u00a0in August, while payrolls in the sector have shrunk by 42,000 since April, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP) that draws on government labor data.",
      "The nonpartisan policy institute attributes that decline to the Trump administration's steep new tariffs; hardline stance on immigration; and the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill,\" a tax and spending package enacted by Mr. Trump in July that CAP says hurts renewable energy companies by phasing out certain tax credits.",
      "For all of 2025, manufacturing employment in the U.S. has sunk by a total of 33,000 jobs, according to Labor Department\u00a0figures. Most of those job losses have been among companies that make durable goods, such as cars, household appliances and electronics. The drop comes as hiring overall has slowed sharply in recent months, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs in August, well below forecasts.",
      "The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has declined for the past six decades, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In 1960, manufacturing represented about 34% of total employment, while the number of jobs in the sector peaked in 1970 at 19.5 million. As of August this year, 12.7 million Americans were employed in manufacturing, while the industry lost 87,000 jobs in 2024,\u00a0data shows.",
      "Uncertainty hurting businesses",
      "When Mr. Trump in April announced a range of levies on dozens of other countries, the White House said tariffs would protect American workers by reducing the U.S. trade deficit with its economic partners and spurring employers to move manufacturing jobs to the U.S.",
      "For now, however, confusion over the scale and scope of U.S. tariffs has put manufacturers on the defensive, increasing their costs and discouraging them from hiring, economist Sara Estep, one of the authors of the CAP report, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Companies are uncertain about what's happening,\" she said. \"Everything has been changing on a day-to-day basis, so it's not clear what production should look like. That's why they aren't hiring.\"",
      "In August, for example, farm equipment giant John Deere cited tariffs in announcing that its sales and operating profits had dipped from a year ago. In an earnings call, an executive with the company noted that it had racked up roughly $300 million in tariff-related costs, including on steel and aluminum imports. John Deere also announced it was laying off more than 200 workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa, according to AgWeb, a trade publication.",
      "Automakers pointed partly to tariffs in announcing nearly 5,000 job cuts in July, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, while it noted that the retail sector has also stepped up layoffs and store closures because of economic uncertainty.",
      "Another factor fueling uncertainty for manufacturers are the ongoing legal challenges to the Trump tariffs, making it hard to plan and invest for the future, according to experts.",
      "A federal appeals court in August ruled that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on September 3\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to review the lower court's decision before it takes effect in October.",
      "The outcome of the case leaves many manufacturers in doubt about how to proceed, making them reluctant to expand their workforce as they seek to control costs, Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The slowdown is symptomatic of an environment where purchasing managers are all under stress, and they are being squeezed by higher costs of goods and reduced demand,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"And so in that squeeze, they are having to find ways to offset the higher costs, and one of the avenues to do that is to streamline their operations and make sure that they only have the essential talent on hand.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on CAP's findings. The Office of the United States Trade Representative and National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Immigration effect",
      "The Trump administration's crackdown on U.S. immigrants is also weighing on hiring in manufacturing, said Daniel Altman, an economist and author of the High Yield Economics newsletter.",
      "\"Immigration has been an important source of employment in manufacturing for some industries, and if you take away some of their labor supply, that's just gives them more incentive to pursue automation and other forms of capital intensive manufacturing,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The government stepped up its campaign last week when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\u00a0detained 475 immigrants, most of them Korean, at a Hyundai plant in Georgia because they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Border patrol agents have also\u00a0conducted raids targeting immigrants working in retail, according to CBS News. In sectors like farming, food processing and construction, undocumented immigrants make up to 20% of the workforce, according to\u00a0Goldman Sachs.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan on Sunday said the White House will expand such efforts.",
      "\"We're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,\" Homan told CNN. \"No one hires an illegal alien out of the goodness of their heart. They hire them because they can work them harder, pay them less, undercut the competition that hires U.S. citizen employees.\"",
      "Other long-term factors that go beyond the Trump administration's policies are also contributing to the ongoing contraction in manufacturing jobs. During the pandemic, manufacturers invested heavily in technologies to automate their operations, Altman noted.",
      "\"We've seen a lot of automation, which means companies do not need as many workers to provide the same output,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Output per worker has been increasing, and when we see that kind of increase in labor productivity, it usually means workers have access to more capital, or better technology or both, and that's what you'd expect with automation.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 15:08:46 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal district ruled in September that President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors was likely illegal.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will hear arguments in January on whether President Trump can fire Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "The high court said in a brief unsigned order that it is not yet acting on Mr. Trump's request for emergency relief. The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court last month to freeze a lower court order that found Cook's purported removal was likely illegal and allowed her to remain a Fed governor.",
      "By deferring a decision on the president's bid for emergency relief, Cook can remain in her position on the Fed's Board of Governors for now.",
      "Cook participated in a two-day meeting of the Fed's interest-rate-setting committee last month, which culminated with the central bank announcing its first cut to its benchmark interest rate in nine months. The panel will meet next in October and December.",
      "Her lawyers warned the Supreme Court that allowing Mr. Trump to remove Cook from the board of governors even for a brief period would have severe consequences, risking chaos and disruption of financial markets.",
      "Accepting the president's argument, Cook's lawyers said, \"would eviscerate the Federal Reserve's longstanding independence, upend financial markets, and create a blueprint for future presidents to direct monetary policy based on their political agendas and election calendars.\"",
      "But they warned it would also open the Fed up to political influence. Granting Mr. Trump the emergency relief he sought would \"sound the death knell\" for the Fed's independence\" and transform it into a body that is \"subservient to the President's will,\" Cook's lawyers wrote.",
      "Cook's attorneys, Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen, said in a statement that the order \"rightly allows Governor Cook to continue in her role on the Federal Reserve Board, and we look forward to further proceedings consistent with the Court's order.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in response to the Supreme Court's move that \"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. We look forward to ultimate victory after presenting our oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook from the Fed board in August and her subsequent lawsuit arguing the removal broke the law set up a major test of his authority to oust key officials at the central bank. The president has criticized the Fed for not lowering interest rates sooner and is seeking to put his stamp on the seven-member board.",
      "The Senate confirmed Stephen Miran, an adviser to Mr. Trump, to the board of governors last month. Miran chaired the White House's Council of Economic Advisers and is taking an unpaid leave of absence from that job while serving on the Fed board, an unusual move.",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts to oust Cook are unprecedented, as no president has attempted to remove a sitting Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history. Critics of the move have warned that the effort harms the Fed's independence and could destabilize markets.",
      "In announcing his decision to fire her, the president claimed Cook made misrepresentations on mortgage documents in 2021, before she was appointed to the board of governors, by claiming two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence in order to gain more favorable lending terms.",
      "Cook's lawyers have said she \"did not ever commit mortgage fraud,\" and she has not been charged with any wrongdoing. They called the allegations \"flimsy\" and \"unproven.\" Reuters reported\u00a0that a loan estimate for the property in Atlanta, dated May 28, 2021, showed that Cook declared that residence as a \"vacation home.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump said the alleged misstatements gave him \"sufficient cause\" to remove Cook from the Fed board.",
      "\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a request for emergency relief to the Supreme Court.",
      "He continued: \"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself \u2014 and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled last month that Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook likely violated federal law because he did not state a legally permissible cause for her removal. The judge said the president's reason for ousting Cook rests on alleged actions before she joined the Fed board, and found the requirement that Fed governors can only be removed \"for cause\" covers only conduct while in-office.",
      "Cook joined the Fed board in 2022 and was reappointed by President Biden to a 14-year-term that is set to end in 2038.",
      "Cobb also ruled that Cook's due process rights were likely violated because she did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before her removal.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the district judge's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which voted 2-1 to decline its request to let Mr. Trump fire Cook.",
      "The two-judge majority agreed that Cook did not receive adequate process before her removal. It did not address whether Mr. Trump satisfied the \"for cause\" removal requirement.",
      "In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it is not challenging the constitutionality of the for-cause removal restriction for Fed governors enacted by Congress.",
      "But Cook's lawyers said there must be \"some meaningful check\" on the president's ability to remove her.",
      "\"Otherwise, any president could remove any governor based on any charge of wrongdoing, however flawed,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"That regime is not what Congress envisioned when it protected the Federal Reserve Board from presidential control. That regime is not what this Court envisioned when it went out of its way to single out the Board as a unique institution with a unique history of independence.\"",
      "Cook is one of several Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies that Mr. Trump has moved to fire since returning to the White House. The Supreme Court has so far allowed the president to oust members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Trade Commission without cause.",
      "It will hear arguments in December on the constitutionality of removal protections for FTC commissioners and whether to overturn a key 1935 decision that allowed Congress to insulate certain independent agencies from political pressure. The case tests the scope of the president's removal authority.",
      "But the high court in May suggested the Fed is different from those agencies because it is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",

    "story": [
      "This week, Spirit Airlines will end service to nearly a dozen cities. The bankrupt low-cost carrier is cutting staff, grounding planes and slashing its flight schedule as it searches for a route back to profitability.",
      "Spirit will drop service to 11 cities the week of Oct. 2 in the western and southern U.S. The cities where service is impacted include: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Birmingham, Alabama; Boise, Idaho; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Oakland, California; Columbia, South Carolina; Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California; Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, California; and San Jose, California.",
      "The budget carrier will also ground plans to launch service in Macon, Georgia and in the coming weeks, they'll exit Hartford and Minneapolis.",
      "\"I think it's unfortunate to have less options and I think it makes it easier for the larger airlines to have a little more leeway over the consumer,\" said Steve Harvath, who found a cheap Spirit flight from Portland, Oregon, to meet family in Las Vegas \u2013 an option he won't have again.",
      "Impact on travelers",
      "The cuts from Spirit could impact more than just those who fly with the airline. Airline industry analyst from Atmosphere Research Group, Henry Harteveldt, said as Spirit exits, higher fares may follow.",
      "\"Spirit is the incredible shrinking airline right now and unless there are other low cost airlines that compete with Spirit on these routes, consumers should expect to pay more,\" Harteveldt said.",
      "Recently, United announced it would add 15 new routes hoping to capitalize on Spirits' cuts.",
      "\"I think there's always going to be robust competition particularly for price driven customers. Some airlines will fail. Some new ones will come up. It's not just about price, it's about the value and what you get for it,\" United CEO Scott Kirby said.",
      "Spirit has pushed back on Kirby's comments about its decline. In an email to employees, the company's chief commercial officer called the cuts \"necessary changes to best position our airline for the future.\"",
      "Barry Biffle, the CEO of Frontier Airlines, which is Spirit's largest direct competitor, said Frontier is \"not working on buying Spirit.\"",
      "\"There's too much supply in general,\" he said, adding that Spirit doesn't have to go out of business for capacity to be addressed. \"I think that is one of the unfortunate outcomes that could happen, but there has to be less capacity for everyone to be healthy.\"",
      "Spirit's planned cuts",
      "Spirit has struggled post-pandemic after a failed merger with JetBlue as flyers have shifted to a more premium experience.",
      "The Florida-based airline previously announced plans to furlough a third of their flight attendants.",
      "\"As part of our ongoing restructuring, we are taking steps to align staffing with our fleet size and expected flight volume. In line with this process, we have made the difficult decision to furlough approximately 1,800 Flight Attendants, effective Dec. 1, 2025,\" Spirit said in a statement last month to CBS News.",
      "It will also seek pay cuts from pilots and ground planes while reducing its flights by 25%.",
      "On Tuesday, Spirit announced it had secured hundreds of millions of dollars in what it called \"significant progress\" in its bankruptcy restructuring.",

    "story": [
      "Walmart announced Wednesday that it would remove synthetic dyes and 30 other ingredients, including artificial sweeteners and preservatives, from its private-label food brands by 2027.",
      "The retailer said the change would affect around 1,000 products, including salty snacks, baked goods, power drinks, salad dressings and frosting. Customers can expected to see some of the reformulated products on shelves in the coming months. Walmart told the Associated Press that the changes primarily affect Great Value, the company's largest private-label food brand.",
      "Walmart, which serves over 250 million customers a week globally, billed the change as a means to address changing consumer preferences. \"Our customers have told us that they want products made with simpler, more familiar ingredients \u2014 and we've listened,\" Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said in a statement.",
      "The company also said the decision is in line with its goal to be more transparent around what goes into its private food brands, which include Great Value, Marketside, Freshness Guaranteed and Bettergoods.",
      "\"As the leading grocer in the U.S., this move will have a significant impact on the market and the safety of the food that so many Americans purchase for their families,\" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports, in a statement.",
      "Among the preservatives Walmart says it will remove are potassium nitrate, potassium nitrite and potassium bisulfite, which are used in processed meats. The company also said it will remove phthalates, a chemical used to make plastic flexible that is widely found in supermarket and fast foods.",
      "Several of the ingredients on Walmart's removal list, including some of the 30 non-dyes, are already are banned, not widely used or have\u00a0not been used\u00a0in the U.S. food supply for decades. Others were included despite no known problems or have been targeted by the Trump administration for review and possible elimination as an approved food additive, according to food safety experts.",
      "According to Walmart, 90% of its private brand products are already free from synthetic dyes.",
      "The announcement comes amid a wider effort by food manufacturers eliminate dyes from their products. In recent months,\u00a0Kraft Heinz\u00a0and General Mills have also both they're nixing dyes.",
      "The federal government has also increased scrutiny on the potential health effects of artificial food dyes. In April, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\u00a0called on the food industry to stop using synthetic food dyes.

    "summary": "Monthly report shows private employers shed 32,000 jobs last month, another sign the labor market is facing new challenges.",
    "story": [
      "The ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said on Wednesday that payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs last month, signaling the labor market continued to face headwinds in September.",
      "More attention may be given to the ADP data this week because the government's monthly jobs report, scheduled for release on Friday, Oct. 3, could be delayed due to the government shutdown that began today, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which issues the federal monthly jobs report, noted in a statement that it has halted data releases \"due to the suspension of Federal government services.\" It added, \"The last update to the site was Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025. Updates to the site will start again when the Federal government resumes operations.\"",
      "The ADP report, which is based on payroll data from more than 26 million U.S. employees, comes as the U.S. economy expanded at a stronger-than-expected rate in the second quarter. At the same time, the government's monthly jobs reports this summer have shown disappointing job growth as some businesses are holding off on hiring amid economic challenges such as tariffs and artificial intelligence.",
      "\"This is the latest data point signaling a fairly dramatic softening in labor momentum as companies aggressively dial back on hiring,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "September's ADP decline represents the largest since March 2023, according to Capital Economics.",
      "The government jobs report, issued by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, is expected to show that employers hired 50,000 people last month, according to economists polled by financial data company FactSet. Given the government shutdown, it's unclear whether the report will be issued Friday, or, if not, how long it might be delayed.",
      "The ADP report differs from the BLS monthly jobs report in that it only tracks employment at private businesses, while the government data covers both private employers and public sector hiring at local, state and federal levels. As a result, the two reports can differ significantly, and the ADP report doesn't always foreshadow the BLS' monthly data.",
      "\"Although there is only a passing correlation between monthly changes in the ADP measure of private payrolls and the official non-farm payrolls estimates, the plunge in the former in September is a concern, particularly since the government shutdown could delay the release of the official employment data,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, sad in a report Wednesday.",
      "The Federal Reserve is scheduled to make its next interest-rate decision on Oct. 29, with most economists forecasting a cut of 0.25 percentage points, according to CME FedWatch. The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate by that amount at its meeting last month, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell citing weaker labor market conditions as a reason for the move to ease borrowing costs.",
      "\"If the shutdown drags on, the weakness in the ADP will be all the Fed has to go on as it considers another rate cut at the FOMC meeting late this month,\" Brown said.",
      "Most of the weakness last month was due to small and midsize businesses shedding jobs, while large employers \u2014 those with more than 500 workers \u2014 added 33,000 employees in September, ADP said.",
      "ADP also revised its August numbers downward to show that private businesses shed 3,000 jobs, versus its earlier estimate that companies had hired 54,000 employees that month.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 11:17:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Pfizer's CEO said President Trump's threat of tariffs motivated his company to take swift action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pfizer has agreed to offer significantly discounted prices for some prescription drugs for all American consumers and has committed to offer prescription medications to Medicaid at lower prices, President Trump announced Tuesday. The president said the drugs will be available for purchase online on a website operated by the federal government, which the White House has said will be called \"TrumpRx.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was in the Oval Office with the president for the announcement, said Mr. Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the U.S. motivated his company to take swift action. The president said Pfizer's drug prices will be lower starting \"immediately.\"",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%. Mr. Trump said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced 'most favored nation' cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House has released specific drug prices yet.",
      "Some health policy experts cautioned that pricing details are still unclear and the impact for consumers may be limited.",
      "Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out that Medicaid's prices are already lower than average in the U.S.",
      "\"Medicaid already enjoys 'best-price' protection in the sense that they receive the lowest prices charged to any commercial payer in the United States. Therefore, we are starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" he told CBS News.",
      "And those patients have been benefiting, says Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Program on Medicare Policy at\u00a0KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization: \"It is still very unclear how the price reductions announced today will lower costs directly for many people, since people on Medicaid typically don't pay large amounts out of pocket for drugs.\"",
      "Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, said: \"The direct-to-patient stuff is, in my view, a sideshow and branding opportunity for Trump. Most patients have drug coverage. \u2026 Very few are going to buy medications with cash, unless the drug is not a covered benefit, like weight loss or erectile dysfunction drugs.\"",
      "Bourla called it a \"historic day\" because the agreement would be reversing an \"unfair situation.\"",
      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on\u00a0drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs. He threatened to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they failed to do so.",
      "Monday was the deadline for drugmakers to reach agreements to bring down drug costs, the Post reported, after the president's May executive order. While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population and uses about 13% of the world's prescription drugs, the U.S. funds over 70% of global pharmaceutical profits, according to the White House.",
      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "Bourla mentioned the impending tariffs in his comments Tuesday, saying the tariffs had motivated his company. He said the Mr. Trump gave Pfizer a three-year grace period on the tariffs, and the tariffs would be inapplicable, as long as Pfizer manufactures in the U.S. As a part of the agreement, Bourla said Pfizer agreed to move their production of medicines used in America to the U.S.",
      "\"The president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President,\" Bourla said. \"And clearly motivated ours, right?\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said the tariffs had \"played a big role\" in the deal.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall. Mr. Trump echoed that point, saying other companies are on board, too.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C.,\" said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRx\" website have not yet been shared, but a senior administration official expected the website to be live in early 2026.",
      "The announcement comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S.\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email.",

    "story": [
      "A government shutdown on Wednesday could have the potential to disrupt a multitude of federal activities \u2014 but people with student loans are expected to continue making their repayments, according to the U.S. Department of Education.",
      "People with student loans \"will still be required to make payments on their outstanding student debt,\" the Education Department said in a Sept. 28 contingency plan for an Oct. 1 federal shutdown.",
      "While loans are still due for repayment, it could be hard to reach someone at the Education Department if a problem arises, given that most of its employees are scheduled to be furloughed in the event of a shutdown, said Persis Yu, managing counsel at Protect Borrowers, an advocacy group for people with student loans.",
      "\"Student loan borrowers will still need to pay their bills during a shutdown,\" Yu told CBS News. \"However, if things go wrong with their servicer, which they often do, borrowers are going to have fewer people to turn to to get those errors resolved.\"",
      "There would also likely be little impact on federal aid, such as loans and grants, for students who are currently enrolled in colleges and university programs because most payments are disbursed at the start of the academic year, according to a statement from the American Council on Education, a higher-education advocacy group.",
      "Still, some borrowers and students in the applications stage could encounter hurdles during a shutdown, the group added.",
      "\"Borrowers seeking assistance from [the Education Department] may face delays, and loan forgiveness applications could be impacted if the shutdown persists,\" the American Council on Education said.",
      "The Education Department operates the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is aimed at helping public workers \u2014 such as teachers and police officers \u2014 discharge their federal student loans after they've served in government or not-for-profit organizations for more than 10 years.",
      "The DOE also runs income-driven repayment plans that provide forgiveness after 20 - 25 years of repayment.",
      "About 2,100 of the Education Department's roughly 2,400 employees are expected to be furloughed in the event of a government shutdown, according to the agency's contingency plan. Those include most of the agency's Office of Federal Student Aid, the plan shows.",
      "Could Pell Grants or the FAFSA be impacted?",
      "The Education Department said it would continue to disburse student aid such as Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student loans in the event of a shutdown because those programs are funded through mandatory spending or carryover appropriations, and therefore don't require approval from Congress.",
      "\"More than 9.9 million students receive student aid, in the form of grants and loans, at approximately 5,400 schools through these programs,\" the agency noted.",
      "The DOE said it plans to use permanent appropriations to continue processing student aid requests through the Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which opened on Sept. 24 for the 2026-27 academic year. The FAFSA is used by parents and students to apply for loans, grants and work-study funds to pay for college or career training programs.",
      "\"FAFSA applications actually opened early, with the form becoming fully available as of Sept. 24,\" rather than the traditional opening day of Oct. 1, NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood told CBS News. \"Students shouldn't expect delays or for deadlines to be pushed back. Unless the Education Department says otherwise, there's no reason to wait to file the FAFSA.\"",
      "Funding for Title I and IDEA grants, which are for low-income schools and disabled students, respectively, would also continue to be available, it added.",
      "Likewise, most GI Bill benefits for students who are veterans should also continue without disruption if the government shuts down because the program is funded by mandatory spending that doesn't need to be re-approved by Congress, according to the American Council on Education, which cited the Department of Veterans Affairs' contingency plan.",
      "\"However, some delays [for ex-military students] could arise if the shutdown is prolonged or if students require additional verification, corrections or appeals during the lapse,\" the ACE noted.",
      "It added, \"In previous shutdowns, VA has experienced backlogs in claims processing and a slowdown in support services due to furloughed staff and reduced system capacity.\"",
      "What Education Department activities would be impacted?",
      "New grants would be halted during a government shutdown, the Education Department noted. But since most grants are awarded over the summer, only a small number of recipients would likely be impacted, it added.",
      "\"Grantees will continue to be able to draw down funds from these awards and, therefore, the impacts on schools and students should be minimal,\" the agency said. \"The Office for Civil Rights would pause its review and investigations of civil rights complaints.\"",

      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/catastrophe-bonds-insurance/",
    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 20:11:39 -0400",
    "summary": "The interest in catastrophe bonds comes as insured property losses increased from $30 billion in 2015 to over $110 billion in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "In many communities at high risk for natural disasters, a Wall Street financing tool that's gaining popularity, called a catastrophe bond, may make it easier for homeowners to get insurance. On Oak Island, North Carolina, homeowners who face annual hurricane risk are seeing the impacts firsthand.",
      "The interest in catastrophe bonds comes as insured property losses increased from $30 billion in 2015 to over $110 billion in 2024, adjusted for inflation, the Insurance Information Institute found, while homeowner insurance premiums increased 40% faster than inflation between 2017 and 2022, according to the Consumer Federation of America. Many insurance companies have left high-risk markets altogether.",
      "Catastrophe bonds are contingent on whether or not a disaster takes place. Insurance companies sponsor bonds that are then purchased by investors, typically institutional investors. If a natural disaster does not take place, investors get a return on their investment. But if a disaster meeting certain thresholds takes place, money goes to insurance companies to pay out customers' claims, and investors lose money. Catastrophe bonds are beneficial to insurers because they make large amounts of capital available to pay insurance claims. The bonds are appealing to investors because disasters that lead to insurance payouts are rare.",
      "Catastrophe bonds cover a wide range of disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and pandemics. But most catastrophe bonds have specific requirements on the degree of disaster before they are \"triggered\" to pay out to insurance companies. For instance, hurricanes may be required to reach a certain category of intensity, and floods may have to reach a certain height in order for investors to lose money. Many catastrophe bonds also require a certain amount of financial losses before they begin paying out.",
      "On Oak Island, a catastrophe bond sponsored by the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association is helping fund insurance and hurricane resilience projects. One such project is for local resident Paige Morgan's home, installing a fortified roof meant to withstand hurricanes and other extreme weather.",
      "\"If you're not prepared for something like this, you're taking a huge risk,\" she told CBS News. \"I've seen families lose their whole house, everything in it, with these last few storms\".",
      "Using catastrophe bonds to fund weather resilience upgrades is a new model for the industry. Gina Hardy, CEO of NCIUA, added a provision to her company's bond so that when investors profit, some of their proceeds go toward funding weather resilience upgrades like those on Morgan's home.",
      "\"When you put on a fortified roof, it reduces your probability of loss by 62%, so the more fortified roofs that we can get on, the less claims that we have,\" she said.",
      "For NCIUA, catastrophe bonds have become an important part of making sure insurance is affordable to its clients. NCIUA is North Carolina's insurer of last resort and has sponsored catastrophe bonds since 2009. Their catastrophe bonds have never been triggered, but if there were ever a severe disaster, the funding would be vital.",
      "\"If you have a Katrina that happens to hit, or a Cat. Five that hits North Carolina, we need to have enough funding to be able to pay claims, and so we go out to worldwide markets to obtain that funding,\" Hardy told CBS News. \"Catastrophe bonds are a way to get investors to provide additional protection for the citizens of North Carolina.\"",
      "For catastrophe bond investors, choosing bonds and calculating risk for investing has become a science. In April, King Ridge Capital Advisors launched a catastrophe bond exchange-traded fund. The ETF is the first way for the public to invest in catastrophe bonds, which were previously only tradable by institutional investors.",
      "Vijay Manghnani, managing partner at King Ridge Capital Advisors, has a PhD in oceanography and meteorology, and uses his scientific background to help determine which catastrophe bonds fit in King Ridge Capital Advisors' portfolio.",
      "\"When we look at hurricane risk, we are actually studying hurricane risk for the last 150 years. We pull through the data, we build models that not only take all that into account, but actually look forward, we bring in climate change risk to it,\" he told CBS News.",
      "If the catastrophe bond triggers fit the firm's tolerance for risk, they invest.",
      "Catastrophe bonds have performed well in recent years. In 2024, the catastrophe bond market netted a 17% return, according to Swiss Re.",
      "For investors, the main benefit is that catastrophe bond returns are not correlated to the market, and therefore are unaffected by shocks to the economy. That theory was put to the test earlier this year when the White House levied tariffs.",
      "\"We launched our ETF on April 1, which was the day before the tariffs were rolled out, and for the month of April, we were one of the few securities that actually made profit,\" Manghnani said."

      "A possible U.S. government shutdown\u00a0on Wednesday could hinge on a deal to maintain a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF.\u00a0About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",

    "summary": "\"The last thing we want to do is just keep raising prices on our guests,\" Gregory's Coffee founder Gregory Zamfotis said. That might be easier said than done.",
    "story": [
      "The first Gregory's Coffee opened in 2006 on Manhattan's Park Avenue. Nineteen years later, the family-owned business has expanded to over 54 locations around the U.S. as well as a roastery in Queens, New York, that handles coffee beans from Brazil, Rwanda, Nicaragua and other major global producers.",
      "For Gregory Zamfotis, founder of the New York City-based chain, the business is about more than just dollars and cents \u2014 it's also about recognizing the special place coffee has long had in American culture as a driver of social connections.",
      "\"Coffee is built into the fabric of our society,\" Zamfotis told CBS News. \"People come together over coffee. When it's a meeting or interview, or we just want to get some work done, coffee tends to be the centerpiece of those conversations.\"",
      "With many Americans still feeling the effects of elevated inflation, for many coffee drinkers, one of those conversations is likely to center on the drink's soaring costs.",
      "Prices have leaped nearly 21% over the past 12 months, with the average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee recently reaching a record high of $8.87 per pound, up from $7.02 in January, USDA data shows.",
      "Several factors are behind the spike in coffee prices, including droughts in Brazil and volatile weather in other regions where the bean is cultivated. More recently, heavy U.S. tariffs on coffee-producing countries \u2014 including a hefty 50% levy on Brazil \u2014 have also driven up prices.",
      "Though coffee is a staple of American daily life, the vast majority of the beans is imported. Much of that is sourced from Latin America, with Brazil alone accounting for 35%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. produces relatively little coffee compared to the rest of the world. Hawaii, the top-producing state, harvested 21 million pounds during the 2024\u201325 season, according to the USDA. Yet Americans consumed a whopping 3.3 billion pounds of coffee during the same period, the agency said.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up\"",
      "Jake Leonti, director of coffee at Gregory's Coffee, said it's also far pricier to grow and produce coffee in the U.S.",
      "\"It's exponentially [more] expensive because it's Americans farming,\" he said. \"Whereas we can get super high-quality coffee from different parts of the world at a price that's much more friendly to the consumer.\"",
      "Gregory's Coffee has not raised prices yet despite the jump in costs. But Leonti said that could change soon.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up \u2014 there's no other way around it,\" he said. \"We're seeing tariffs from the places where we get our bags printed as well. So everything around the coffee business is getting tariffs at some point.\"",
      "Like other retailers, Gregory's prices vary depending on where a store is located, reflecting regional labor and other costs. In New York City, the chain charges $3.45 for a regular cup of coffee, while at its New Jersey and Washington, D.C., outlets the same item runs $3.15.",
      "Other retailers are also preparing for increased coffee costs. Mark Smucker, CEO of The J.M. Smucker Co., whose portfolio includes the Folgers Coffee, Caf\u00e9 Bustelo and Dunkin' at-home brands, said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in June that prices will likely increase for a third time this year \"due to higher green coffee costs.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Catherine R. Smith said during the company's third-quarter earnings call in July that, due to the company's coffee buying and hedging practices, customers shouldn't expect price increases until the first half of fiscal 2026.",
      "At Gregory's Coffee, \"The last thing we want to do is just keep raising prices on our guests,\" Zamfotis said. \"We're hoping that if prices go up a few pennies across the board, that doesn't turn off our everyday customers. We're not doing this to make more money \u2014 we're doing this to protect our business.\"",

    "summary": "Newspapers announced John D. Rockefeller as the first U.S. billionaire 109 years ago. Today there are more than 900 American billionaires.",
    "story": [
      "On Sept. 29, 1916, it was front page news that a surge in Standard Oil's stock price likely made oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller America's first billionaire.",
      "More than a century later, the United States is home to hundreds of billionaires whose fortunes increasingly come from technology and financial markets. Together, they control a growing share of the country's wealth \u2014 approaching the percentage held by Gilded Age industrialists who built monopolies in railroads, oil and steel.",
      "Here's what research tells us about America's billionaire class today.",
      "American billionaires number over 900, according to researchers",
      "There are a few different estimates of the number of American billionaires, but researchers tend to agree that the billionaire class exceeds 900 and is growing.",
      "Forbes, which has produced a list of billionaires since the 1980s, counted roughly 900 in early 2025 \u2014 up from 813 in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, the wealth-data firm Altrata pinned the number of U.S. billionaires at 1,135 in 2024, an uptick from 1,050 in 2023 and up more than 80% from levels in 2016, when they began releasing yearly reports.",
      "And JP Morgan Chase Private Bank estimated the number at roughly 1,990 in 2024 \u2014 about 15% more than its 2023 estimate.",
      "Part of the reason estimates vary is that the ultra-wealthy are not required or incentivized to disclose their net worth. The SEC requires investors to report ownership of more than 5% of a company's shares, but valuations fluctuate with the market, complicating wealth estimates.",
      "Adjusted for inflation, the number of billionaires with a Rockefeller-sized fortune is a much smaller set.",
      "His $1 billion in 1916 would be worth roughly $30 billion today. By that measure, only about 30 American billionaires have a similar fortune, according to Forbes and\u00a0Bloomberg. Among them are Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tesla founder Elon Musk, with net worths above $300 billion. Other tech titans also top the list, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 both with fortunes of over $200 billion each, as of Sept. 29.",
      "Christopher Nichols, a professor of history at Ohio State University said, \"The billionaires of the Gilded Age and the multimillionaires were involved in what we think of as blue chip industries, where there are lots of jobs and stuff produced. The billionaires of today's world are mostly working in tech sectors and places that very often don't employ many people.\"",
      "Billionaires have roughly $6.8 trillion in wealth in 2025",
      "Together, America's billionaires had an approximate total net worth of $6.8 trillion in the spring of 2025, Forbes estimates, which is a jump of more than a trillion compared to last year after a strong year of growth for U.S. stocks in 2024.",
      "In the 20th century, Scottish journalist B.C. Forbes, who founded the eponymous magazine, wrote that if Rockefeller's wealth \"could be turned into cash and distributed equally\u2014which it couldn't\u2014[it] would give every man, woman and child in the United States $10 each.\"",
      "Today, if that estimated $6.8 trillion held by U.S. billionaires could be turned into cash and divided equally among roughly 340 million Americans, it would amount to about $20,000 per person.",
      "Another way to think about that sum is that it could theoretically be used to buy every NFL team, pay off Americans' student loan and medical debt\u00a0and purchase 9 million homes at the current median sales price, with hundreds of billions left over.",
      "The ultra rich own an increasingly large share of the nation's wealth",
      "Data from the World Inequality Database shows that the share of wealth held by the top 1% and the ultra-rich top 0.001% has been rising for decades \u2014 toward the record levels observed in the Gilded Age.",
      "The share of the national wealth held by the top 1% peaked at nearly 50% in 1929 before tumbling during the Great Depression, according to the data.",
      "\"What happened with the Great Depression was that large fortunes were lost in the stock market. And then the New Deal rebuilt the economy around workers and around small businesses,\" said Jeremi Suri, a professor of history and public affairs at University of Texas.",
      "But in the early 1980s, the top 1% began regaining ground, as union jobs declined and traditional industries like manufacturing shrunk, according to Suri.",
      "By 2023 the top 1%, or those with over $4.6 million in assets, controlled more than a third of the nation's wealth \u2014 up over 10 percentage points from 1980.",
      "Data collected by the same researchers shows that the trendline looks similar for those in the top 0.001% of people in the country \u2014 or those who owned more than $1.5 billion in 2023.",
      "The hundreds of billionaires in this category owned about 1% of the nation's net wealth in 1980 and 5% in 2023.",
      "Most billionaires are males with self-made fortunes, but a significant number inherited their money",
      "Demographically, the billionaire class still resembles J.D. Rockefeller in many ways.",
      "The vast majority of the world's billionaires are men \u2014 about 86.5% in 2025, according to Forbes \u2014 and most make rather than inherit their wealth.",
      "Rockefeller himself was the son of a traveling salesman and a housewife. While his family helped him launch his career, Rockefeller built the majority of his fortune on his own, according to Nichols, an editor of \"A Companion to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.\"",
      "\"He came from enough middle class wealth that he could get a loan from his dad to start that business, which so often is the story for business folks,\" Nichols said. \"But he made his billions through his business acumen and hard work, and then also his ruthless competitiveness in an under-regulated time.\"",
      "Research suggests inheritance plays a significant role for many wealthy people today. Roughly 30% of the world's billionaires have inherited their fortunes, according to a 2024 report by UBS, a wealth management company in Sweden. And the share in the U.S. is about a third, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Altrata data.",
      "Some of America's wealthiest heirs include Walmart's Alice, Rob and Jim Walton, and Jacqueline Mars, who owns roughly one third of the candy giant Mars founded by her grandfather.",
      "Rockefeller and his son gave away a significant amount of their money to charity but it continues to live on. And descendants of the family share a fortune valued around $10.3 billion in 2024.",

    "story": [
      "The government shutdown that began Wednesday prompted the White House to cancel a celebration in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month with Latino supporters, a key voting group for President Trump in 2024. Despite periodic events showcasing GOP efforts to woo Hispanics, that support may be eroding.",
      "Latinos made up a big part of the coalition that helped propel Mr. Trump to victory \u2014 he won with nearly half of Latino voters \u2014 a historic high of 48% for a Republican presidential contender. A majority of Hispanic male voters backed him in the race against former Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "But recent polling suggests Hispanic support for the president and his policies has dropped, primarily over economic issues, including the high prices of groceries and housing.",
      "In a New York Times/Sienna poll this week, 69% of Hispanics said they disapprove of the way Mr. Trump is handling his job as president, and 58% said they believe he has made the economy worse since he took office.",
      "Polling of Latino voters that was used to brief national Democratic officials during the Democratic National Committee's summer meeting in Minnesota in August contained similar sentiments. The surveys, which were conducted by BSP Research in November, April and June, indicated Mr. Trump's approval was heavily net negative, and by June had become slightly more so, compared to April, after his first 100 days in office.",
      "According to that polling, more Latinos said immigration reform was important to them in June, compared to November 2024, around the presidential election. Then, they ranked it as their sixth-most important issue, but in June, immigration reform was their second-most important, trailing only their concern about the cost of living and inflation. Since President Trump took office, his administration has cracked down on immigrants it says are here illegally, and recently, the Department of Homeland Security said it was on pace to deport 600,000 undocumented immigrants by the end of the year.",
      "By June, the vast majority of the respondents said they were closely following the Trump administration's immigration actions, and almost half reported that they feared being deported, and they feared family members or friends could also be deported.",
      "Latino voters have been consistent about their top issue, the economy, Democratic officials learned. It was their top issue in November and that was still the case in June. At that time, they viewed the economy as bad and worried it was getting worse. Just under a fifth of Latino Trump voters said it was possible or likely that he and Republicans would lose their support.",
      "\"Latinos trusted him, believed him when they gave him their votes in 2024 when he promised that he was going to bring down the cost of groceries, gas and rent,\" said Democratic strategist\u00a0 Maria Cardona.",
      "But the polling presented to Democrats also found that Latinos' fears about Mr. Trump's economy did not seem to be translating into support for Democrats \u2014 by April, they still had not made major gains among these voters.",

      "The Trump administration has determined the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations, it said in a notification to Congress viewed by CBS News.",
      "The administration delivered the notification after a mid-September strike on an alleged drug boat hailing from Venezuela. It was the second of three publicly disclosed U.S. attacks on boats in the southern Caribbean Sea last month.",
      "The notice calls the three individuals killed by the Sept. 15 strike \"unlawful combatants,\" which is the same term President George W. Bush's administration used to describe Al Qaeda and other terrorist networks. After the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, Congress authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations responsible.",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels.",
      "The New York Times first reported on the notification to Congress.",
      "A White House official said the information was part of a report to Congress required by the National Defense Authorization Act after the U.S. military conducts an attack. The specific notification concerned the strike on Sept. 15 against an alleged cartel boat. The report \"does not convey new information,\" the official said.",
      "The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13. In the notification to Congress after the Sept. 15 strike, the White House said the drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens. It did not name any specific gangs or cartels.",
      "\"Although this strike was limited in scope, U.S. forces remain postured to carry out military operations as necessary to prevent further deaths or injury to American citizens by eliminating the threat posed by these designated terrorist organizations,\" the notice read.",
      "This notification uses language like \"armed conflict\" not seen in a previous letter to Congress from the White House that justified the Sept. 2 strike. That notice, which was signed by President Trump and obtained by CBS News last month, was submitted to Congress under a separate requirement.",
      "Asked about the notice, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: \"As we have said many times, the President acted in line with the law of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring deadly poison to our shores, and he is delivering on his promise to take on the cartels and eliminate these national security threats from murdering more Americans.\"",
      "Brian Finucane, a former attorney-adviser at the State Department who advised the U.S. government on counterterrorism and the use of military force, said the explanation given to Congress is not enough to justify the administration's actions.",
      "\"This justification put out here that the U.S. is somehow in an armed conflict does not do the trick because it's not supported by the facts,\" Finucune said in an interview. \"There has been no armed attack on the United States.\"",
      "Some members of Congress have also questioned the legal justification for the three boat strikes. The administration has said little about who was in each boat or what drugs were on board. Mr. Trump has alleged the first two boats \u2014 including the one hit on Sept. 15 \u2014 hailed from Venezuela, but didn't specify a country of origin for the third strike.",
      "The initial strike on Sept. 2, killed 11 people, according to a post on President Trump's Truth Social, which didn't include details about what drugs were on board.",

    "story": [
      "The White House is asking nine U.S. universities to sign an agreement pledging to uphold the Trump administration's higher education priorities, or risk losing out on preferred access to federal funding.",
      "The demands are outlined in a nine-page document, title the \"Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,\" that asks schools to freeze their tuition rate for five years, ban the use of sex and gender as factors in their admissions process, and cap their international student numbers, among other requirements.",
      "Signatories also must commit to \"transforming or abolishing institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle and even spark violence against conservative ideas,\" according to the memo.",
      "According to a White House official, a letter outlining the plan and a copy of the agreement were sent on Wednesday to the University of Arizona, Brown University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Pennsylvania, University of Southern California, University of Texas, University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University.",
      "The official declined to say whether the Trump administration plans to make a similar offer to other colleges.",
      "The agreement was\u00a0first reported\u00a0by the Wall Street Journal. May Mailman, a senior adviser for special projects at the White House, told the paper that the Trump administration doesn't plan to limit funding only to institutions that agree to abide by the compact. However, schools that sign the agreement will be granted priority in receiving federal funding and engaging with White House officials.",
      "\"Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits,\" the agreement states.",
      "A copy of the letter sent to universities obtained by CBS News notes that schools that agree to the compact will receive \"allowance for increased overhead payments where feasible, substantial and meaningful federal grants, and other federal partnerships.\"",
      "The letter is signed by Mailman; Secretary of Education Linda McMahon; and Vince Haley, director of the White House's Domestic Policy Council. It asks for written comments from the universities by \"no later than October 20.\"",
      "\"After receiving feedback, schools that show clear alignment and a strong readiness to champion this effort will be invited to the White House to finalize language and be initial signatories,\" the letter says. \"We are aiming to have a signed agreement by no later than November 21, 2025.\"",
      "The Department of Education did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Prioritizing U.S. students",
      "A University of Virginia spokesperson said its interim president, Paul G. Mahoney, has created a working group to advise him on how to respond to the letter. \"The University has not yet made any decision regarding the compact,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The University of Southern California said it is reviewing the letter. MIT acknowledged receiving the material but declined to comment further. The other universities did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "In a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Thursday, the University of Pennsylvania chapter of the American Association of University Professors said the White House letter amounts to a threat.",
      "\"Penn must not allow itself to be threatened into ceding its self-determination,\" the group said. \"Whatever the consequences of refusal, agreeing would threaten the very mission of the university.\"",
      "The agreement places a cap on foreign student enrollment, which it states cannot exceed 15% of a university's undergraduate population. Also, no more than 5% of foreign students enrolled at a college can come from a single country.",
      "\"Universities that rely on foreign students to fund their institutions risk, among other things, potentially reducing spots available to deserving American students,\" the document states.",
      "The nine schools are also asked to freeze tuition for five years and to waive tuition for students pursuing \"hard science programs\" at institutions where the endowment exceeds $2 million per undergraduate student. Schools would not have to freeze tuition for students from \"families of exceptional means,\" under the agreement.",
      "The letter represents the latest attempt by the Trump administration to reshape the nation's higher education system. The administration has targeted high-profile universities in recent months, threatening to pull federal funding if they do not agree to certain concessions on combating antisemitism and changing their diversity practices.",
      "Columbia University in July agreed to pay the administration $200 million to resolve an investigation into alleged violations of anti-discrimination laws. The Trump administration earlier this year also suspended roughly $2 billion in federal funding earmarked for Harvard University over what the White House said was the school's failure to crack down on antisemitism on its campus.

      "Federal officials have approved another generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, a regulatory formality that quickly triggered pushback from anti-abortion groups and politicians aligned with the Trump administration.",
      "Drugmaker Evita Solutions announced on its website that the Food and Drug Administration signed off on its low-cost form of the pill, which is approved to end pregnancies through 10 weeks. Evita Solutions is the second company to have an approved generic version of mifepristone. The first was from pharmaceutical company GenBioPro, approved in 2019.",
      "The move prompted backlash from some conservatives.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri criticized the move in a post on X, stating: \"I have lost confidence in the leadership at FDA.\"",
      "\"Anyone who tries to say their hands are tied has not been paying attention,\" Students for Life of America and Students for Life Action President Kristan Hawkins told CBS News. \"These drugs are dangerous, and this is a stain on the entire administration.\"",
      "Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in a statement Thursday, \"This reckless decision by the F.D.A. to expand the availability of abortion drugs is unconscionable.\"",
      "The criticism comes as President Trump's top health officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., face growing pressure from abortion opponents to reevaluate mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago and has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.",
      "In a statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told CBS News that the agency \"has very limited discretion in deciding whether to approve a generic drug\" and that \"by law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must approve an application if it demonstrates that the generic drug is identical to the brand-name drug.\"",
      "In a letter to Republican attorneys general last month, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary pledged to conduct a full review of the drug's safety.",
      "In their letter, Kennedy and Makary wrote, \"HHS \u2014 through the FDA \u2014 is conducting its own review of the evidence, including real-world outcomes and evidence, relating to the safety and efficacy of the drug.\"",
      "CBS News medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder said last month that the FDA is unlikely to withdraw approval, a rare move that would likely trigger lawsuits, but depending on the safety review, it could restrict access by limiting telehealth or mail delivery, or by narrowing who can prescribe the drug.",
      "On the campaign trail last year, Mr. Trump told CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns that he would not prevent access to mifepristone.",
      "In 2021, the FDA under Democratic President Joe Biden permitted online prescribing and mail-order delivery of the drug, greatly expanding access. Abortion opponents have been fighting the change ever since.",
      "Approval of generic drugs is typically a rote process at the FDA, with multiple copycat versions usually approved after the patent on the original drug expires. In most cases, generic drugmakers only need to show that their drug matches the ingredients and formula developed by the original drugmaker.",
      "The FDA typically approves such applications within 10 months. But filing documents posted to the FDA's website show that Evita Solutions filed its application to market mifepristone four years ago.",
      "The company did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "On its website, Evita states that it \"believes that all people should have access to safe, affordable, high-quality, effective, and compassionate abortion care.\"",
      "Approval of a second generic is unlikely to affect access to the pill, which is typically taken with another drug, misoprostol. The\u00a0majority\u00a0of women who terminate pregnancies do so through medication abortions. Mifepristone dilates the cervix and blocks the hormone progesterone, while misoprostol causes the uterus to cramp and contract.",
      "\"This is exactly how our system is supposed to work, and it has worked this way for decades,\" Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, said in a statement. \"The only reason this routine approval is making headlines is because anti-abortion politicians have turned health care into a political battlefield.\"",
      "Access to mifepristone is restricted across large sections of the country because of state laws that ban abortion \u2014 including medication abortion \u2014 or impose separate restrictions on the drug's use. Those laws are subject to a number of ongoing lawsuits that are winding their way through the legal system.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 While President Trump billed the federal law enforcement surge in the nation's capital as an effort to crack down on violent crime, internal government data obtained by CBS News shows nearly 40% of over 3,500 arrests made since the operation began in early August were strictly immigration-related.",
      "The federal government statistics indicate that, as of Sept. 29, federal and local law enforcement officials assigned to the Trump administration's high-profile operation in Washington, D.C., had reported making just over 3,550 arrests.",
      "Nearly 1,400 of those arrests were counted as administrative arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, the federal agency spearheading Mr. Trump's mass deportation campaign. Those arrests involve immigrants ICE seeks to deport because of alleged civil violations of federal immigration law, like entering the U.S. illegally or overstaying a visa. It's unclear how many of those arrested by ICE had criminal histories in addition to their alleged civil immigration violations.",
      "The rest of the arrests, the data indicates, had a criminal nexus. The roughly 8-week-long operation has led to the arrest of 13 homicide suspects, nearly 500 narcotics arrests and about 300 firearms-related arrests. More than two dozen of the arrests involved individuals charged with sex-related crimes.",
      "Agents and officers deployed throughout the capital have also seized over 300 illegal guns and issued roughly 650 misdemeanor citations, plus more than 300 traffic citations, according to the data.",
      "The federal figures also suggest ICE agents have visited over 130 work sites in Washington. Those visits can be precursors to investigations into whether individuals are working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "In a statement to CBS News Thursday, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the \"focus of President Trump's highly successful DC operation has been to address crime committed by anyone, regardless of immigration status.\"",
      "\"Many of the illegal aliens arrested during this operation were committing crimes or had outstanding warrants and prior convictions for crimes like assault, DUIs, kidnapping, drug possession, and worse including an illegal alien who had a prior arrest for raping a child,\" Abigail Jackson added.",
      "A CBS News analysis of the first three weeks of the president's D.C. deployment showed that violent crime dropped by almost half when compared to the same 19 days in 2024.",
      "Although Mr. Trump's emergency order requiring local D.C. police to assist federal officials has expired, immigration and other federal agents continue to operate in the district. The Metropolitan Police Department has also kept a policy change from August that allows local police officers to share information with the federal immigration officials about individuals who are not in their custody. It also lets police officers transport federal immigration agents and detainees in their custody.",
      "As of Sept. 29, roughly 3,000 personnel from nearly two dozen federal and local agencies were deployed in Washington, including more than 1,300 National Guard troops and 250 agents from the Department of Homeland Security, the federal figures show. That includes nearly 200 personnel from Homeland Security Investigations and ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. More than 130 FBI agents and at least nine prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C. were deployed as part of the effort.",
      "When the city-wide \"crime emergency\" declared by Mr. Trump ended on Sept. 10, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced to reporters at a news conference that \"immigration enforcement is not what MPD does, and with the end of the emergency, it won't be what MPD does in the future.\"",
      "Asked for clarification on cooperation between D.C. police and immigration authorities on Tuesday, Bowser said, \"I am aware of what's been happening on the ground and ICE is not patrolling with MPD.\"",
      "A surge in Memphis",
      "A similar law enforcement surge is now underway in Memphis, Tennessee, where 650 personnel from 19 federal and state agencies are patrolling the streets. So far, multi-agency teams have made 93 arrests \u2014 including 69 criminal arrests for illegal firearms, drugs and sex offenses, according to U.S. government data analyzed by CBS News. But the task force has also conducted 24 civil immigration arrests.",
      "The deployment includes more than 100 agents dispatched by agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, including officials from HSI, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Federal Protective Services.",
      "Earlier this month, while flanked by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, Mr. Trump signed an order standing up a federal task force to send to Memphis, an effort he described as a \"replica\" of federal law enforcement efforts in D.C. According to a CBS News data team analysis, violent crime in Memphis is down 32% so far this year, compared to the same time period in 2024.",
      "Tennessee law requires local police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, including ICE, banning sanctuary policies statewide. Recent legislation mandates state and local police officers notify federal authorities if they encounter someone in the U.S. unlawfully. More than 20 agencies statewide now participate in what's known as ICE's 287(g) program, which is designed to deputize local officers to perform certain immigration enforcement functions and expand the federal government's immigration detention capacity.",
      "In Memphis, local leaders have said their focus is crime control, not acting as immigration agents, but state law leaves little room for discretion. Earlier this month, Mayor Paul Young acknowledged community concerns about the increased federal law enforcement, but vowed to use federal resources \"effectively and for the benefit of the residents of our great city.\"",
      "Lee Harris, the mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis, told CBS News he plans to declare an emergency to cover rising jail costs. The Trump administration's new mandate in Memphis has sparked concern from civil rights groups like the ACLU, who warn the crackdown risks sweeping up immigrants from traffic stops and other routine interactions with police, heightening fear for thousands of residents.",
      "What comes next",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has asked for as many as 1,000 National Guardsmen to deploy to his state. In a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday, the Republican leader requested troops to help \"supplement law enforcement presence in high-crime areas, provide logistical and communication support and secure critical infrastructure.\"",
      "Landry noted that cities like New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Shreveport have higher crime rates, a challenge compounded by a lack of law enforcement personnel.",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Oct 2025 16:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's suggestion\u200b that the combination measles, mumps and rubella vaccine should be separated marks a sharp break from decades of immunization practice.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's suggestion last week that combination childhood vaccines, including the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, shot, should be separated marks a sharp break from decades of immunization practice in the United States.",
      "\"I was shocked,\" said Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"Those vaccines don't even exist in the U.S.\"",
      "Moss said he hadn't heard such a recommendation \"since the Andrew Wakefield days,\" referring to the former doctor whose 1988 autism study was later retracted as fraudulent.",
      "Investigations revealed Wakefield had undisclosed financial interests in both lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers and a single-measles vaccine patent. His license to practice medicine was revoked.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks also drew in Wakefield himself. In a video posted on social media, he said the president was \"adopting the very recommendation that I made back in 1998,\" when he first called for splitting the MMR vaccine into individual components.",
      "\"This is a return to a discredited strategy,\" Moss said. \"Wakefield had a financial stake in undermining MMR, and the science has never supported his claims.\"",
      "Risks of splitting the MMR vaccine",
      "The stakes of splitting a combination vaccine are not abstract, Dr. Howard Markel, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and medical historian, said.",
      "\"The immunization schedules are very carefully worked out so the vaccines have the most immunogenicity at the right age,\" he explained. \"If you start splitting things up, you create barriers. Parents don't always come back, or they pick and choose, and coverage goes down. It's as simple as that.\"",
      "Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine, argued that the call to split vaccines is part of a broader campaign to discredit vaccinations.",
      "\"Every couple of weeks, there's a new zinger: first thimerosal, then spacing, then aluminum, now splitting MMR,\" he said. \"Eventually, this topples the whole vaccine infrastructure like a house of cards.\"",
      "The medical risks of dismantling the MMR schedule are clear. Measles remains one of the most contagious viruses in circulation, capable of igniting outbreaks wherever vaccination rates dip. Rubella infection during pregnancy can cause congenital rubella syndrome, leaving babies with deafness, blindness or heart defects. Mumps, too often dismissed as mild, can lead to infertility in adolescent males.",
      "The programmatic consequences are equally significant. Moss pointed out that parents already complain about too many injections. Splitting MMR into separate shots would increase both the number of visits and the number of needles children face, while weakening protection against rubella and mumps.",
      "Every extra appointment creates barriers, especially for families with limited resources, Markel said.",
      "Dr. Walt Orenstein, a former head of CDC's immunization program, described combination vaccines as the foundation of modern prevention.",
      "\"Combination vaccines were developed to reduce missed opportunities, increase coverage and minimize the trauma of multiple injections,\" he said. \"Undoing that progress would put children at risk.\"",
      "Measles-only vaccines also don't exist in the U.S. You can't walk into a pediatrician's office or retail pharmacy and ask for a standalone shot.",
      "To make a measles-only vaccine available in the United States, a manufacturer would need to wait for measles outbreaks to occur, in order to test the vaccine in new clinical trials. Then they'd have to submit data for FDA approval and build a production and distribution system essentially from scratch. With no market for monovalent measles vaccines, companies would also have to be convinced there was sustainable demand \u2014 something experts say is unlikely given the entrenched use of MMR.",
      "Recycled claims",
      "Objections to combined vaccines are not new, UC Berkeley medical historian Elena Conis noted.",
      "\"Resistance to vaccines and concerns about the form and content of vaccines is as old as vaccination itself,\" she said. \"And concerns about combined vaccines are as old as combined vaccines themselves.\"",
      "She pointed out that even before Wakefield, parents in the 1970s were asking why they couldn't just get some vaccines separately, echoing debates over the DPT (Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis) vaccine at the time.",
      "New momentum to separate measles from the rubella component is also driven by a recurring myth: that the rubella vaccine \"contains fetal parts.\" In reality, the rubella virus was originally grown in human fetal cell lines developed in the 1960s, which have been replicated ever since without further abortions.",
      "During production, the virus is purified, leaving only trace DNA or protein fragments that are broken, biologically inactive, and present at levels far below natural background levels in food or the human body. Regulators such as the Food and Drug Administration confirm these levels are safe. Advocates for separating MMR often conflate this history with the false claim that vaccines contain fetal tissue. Decoupling rubella is presented as a moral corrective, even though it introduces practical barriers and undermines protection for pregnant women and babies.",
      "Conis also emphasized that resistance often depends on how people perceive the seriousness of each disease.",
      "The public didn't always see the various infections as equal, Conis noted. At times rubella drew more fear than measles or mumps.",
      "Mumps in particular, she said, \"was often treated with humor rather than fear, until the MMR vaccine came along and researchers began to highlight complications like infertility and hearing loss.\"",
      "Japan offers a cautionary example. In the early 1990s, Japan withdrew the combined MMR vaccine following concerns about the safety of its mumps vaccine and reverted to measles-only shots. The result was lower uptake of rubella and mumps vaccines compared to measles, leaving gaps in protection.",
      "Decades later, Japan has faced repeated rubella outbreaks, including epidemics in 2013 and 2018-2019 that sickened thousands and led to cases of congenital rubella syndrome. Because of earlier policies that vaccinated only girls against rubella, large cohorts of adult men remain under-immunized, forcing costly catch-up campaigns and leaving Japan vulnerable to epidemics.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, warned splitting up the MMR vaccine would repeat past mistakes.",
      "\"We've been here before. Andrew Wakefield promoted single-antigen vaccines, and it nearly derailed measles control in the U.K. The science was fraudulent, but the damage was real: thousands of kids went unprotected. To revive that model in 2025 is to repeat one of the most damaging chapters in vaccine history.\"",
      "Columbia University historian James Colgrove noted that this kind of backlash has deep roots.",
      "\"The original anti-vaccination movement in the 19th century was really a movement against state coercion,\" he said. \"That's always been the paradox of compulsory vaccination: it's extremely effective, but it's also one of the most likely to trigger backlash.\"",
      "Conis framed the debate in broader terms of autonomy and mandates.",
      "\"There's always been a tension in vaccination between individual choice and public health,\" she said. \"Parents are asked to give up some autonomy for the promise of better health for the population. For some, that's acceptable. For others, individual freedom matters more, and what's different today is that we're seeing the libertarian approach gain support at the highest levels of government.\"",
      "Colgrove added that policymakers face a delicate balance. \"The non-medical exemptions absolutely make laws more politically acceptable and are really key to diffusing backlash,\" he said. \"At the same time, the broader your exemption, the more people you allow to opt out, then the more you risk compromising herd immunity. So it really is threading the needle.\"",
      "And for Offit, the bigger danger is the pattern of misinformation itself.",
      "\"These claims aren't new; they're recycled,\" he said. \"Once doubt takes root, it's extraordinarily hard to restore public confidence.\"",
      "Research from multiple countries shows that combination vaccines improve uptake and timeliness by reducing missed appointments and the number of injections required. Children receiving combination formulations are more likely to complete their full schedule on time, and low-income parents are less likely to fall behind when multiple protections are delivered in a single shot.",
      "For Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's immunization program who recently resigned, the proposal reflects politics rather than science.",
      "\"This isn't about safety. It's about ideology,\" he said. \"We've already seen directives issued without data to back them up.\"",
      "Dr. Debra Houry, who recently resigned as the CDC's chief science and medical officer, echoed the concern.",
      "\"The talk about separating MMR into individual components wasn't coming from scientists,\" she said. \"It was being driven by political operatives with no public health expertise.\"",
      "According to Moss: \"It's not necessary, and monovalent vaccines aren't even available in the United States. There's no reason to go down that path.\"",

Mr. Trump removed his own appointee, Erik Siebert, from the post of U.S. Attorney, and installed White House aide Lindsey Halligan to be the new federal prosecutor in eastern Virginia. Halligan successfully secured a grand jury indictment of Comey days later. Staff at the U.S. Attorney's office had circulated a memo arguing the charges shouldn't be brought, CBS News has reported.",

      "As OMB director, Vought is responsible for overseeing and implementing the president's budget priorities across the federal government. President Trump said Thursday that he's meeting with Vought to determine whether \"many Democrat agencies\" are cut temporarily or permanently. Mr. Trump has said the ongoing government shutdown is a chance for Vought to cut out programs Democrats like, making it clear who is in charge of slashing the federal workforce.",
      "\"I have a meeting today with Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame, to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social. \"I can't believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity. They are not stupid people, so maybe this is their way of wanting to, quietly and quickly, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "Vought wants to slash federal jobs and spending, and has worked to in the past",
      "As Mr. Trump suggested, Vought is leading the charge of cutting federal agencies and employees, a vision he's been trying to implement during the president's term thus far.",
      "\"You all know Russell Vought,\" the president said Tuesday. \"He's become very popular recently because he can trim the budget to a level that you couldn't do any other way. So they're taking a risk by having a shutdown, because, because of the shutdown, we can do things medically and other ways, including benefits. We can cut large numbers of people.\"",
      "Vought has also sought to claw back congressionally authorized federal spending through rescissions.",
      "Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said Thursday on Fox News that Vought has been \"dreaming about this moment, preparing for this moment since puberty.\"",
      "Vought told Fox Business this week that \"there are all manner of authorities to be able to keep this administration's policy agenda moving forward, and that includes reducing the size and scope of the government, and we will be looking for opportunities to do that.\"",
      "Vought is freezing or cutting funding in blue states during the shutdown",

    "story": [
      "The head of a presidential library resigned this week after a tug-of-war with the Trump administration over gift selection and a sword for King Charles III, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "Todd Arrington, a career historian who previously held posts with the National Park Service and National Archives and Records Administration, said he stepped down on Monday under pressure as director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Arrington said he was told on Monday, \"Resign \u2014 or be fired.\"",
      "\"Apparently, they believed I could no longer be trusted with confidential information,\" he said. When asked what specific confidential information he'd shared, Arrington said it was \"about the sword\" and an unrelated matter.",
      "Arrington's departure came after he resisted taking an original Eisenhower sword out of the library's collection to give to King Charles last month during President Trump's unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom.",
      "Four U.S. officials involved in the lavish royal visit were unaware that the library director had left his job, and said the White House played no role in his exit.",
      "In a statement last month, Buckingham Palace didn't specify which sword was given to the monarch, but noted that Charles was given a replica, saying the gift \"symbolizes profound respect and is a reminder of the historical partnership that was critical to winning World War II.\" Buckingham Palace declined further comment.",
      "A former Army general, Eisenhower possessed several swords, including a Sword of Honor given to him in 1947 by the city of London for his role as allied supreme commander during World War II, an honor saber gifted to him by the Netherlands in 1947, and his West Point officer saber.",
      "It is not clear who specifically requested the sword. First lady Melania Trump personally decided which gifts to give Queen Camilla, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and their children, a senior administration official said.",
      "Officials at the State Department who compiled an array of gift options for the first couple sought an Eisenhower sword to reiterate the significance of the U.S.-U.K. relationship since World War II, sources said. But Arrington argued against giving away an artifact that had been accepted as a donation and had become the property of the American people.",
      "Arrington told officials he could help find an alternative gift, but sources say State Department officials persisted. The library's team offered to help find a replica.",
      "Ultimately, West Point provided a Cadet Saber from the military academy.",
      "Arrington said he never spoke with anyone at the White House, but only with officials in the Foreign Gift Office at the State Department and other colleagues at the National Archives.",
      "Some in the Trump administration were unhappy with Arrington, sources said.",
      "NARA didn't reply to requests for comment, nor did the Eisenhower library, but both entities began operating Wednesday with limited staffing due to the shutdown of the federal government.",
      "Two sources close to the matter said no one said anything to Arrington about being upset about not being able to have a museum piece \u2014 the conversations before the U.K. trip about finding a substitute for the real sword were polite and tension-free.",
      "One administration official said Arrington was believed to have spoken critically about the president and the administration \u2014 something Arrington strongly disputes.",
      "\"That is 100% incorrect,\" he said. \"I never said a bad word about anybody. I talked to colleagues about trying to find a sword or artifact, something we could give to them for the president to give to the King, and at no time did I disparage anyone.\"",
      "\"If someone in the administration said that I disparaged the administration, that was never communicated to me,\" he added.",
      "The White House plays no formal role in hiring or firing directors of presidential libraries that are part of the National Archives system. The duty of hiring library directors falls instead to the archivist of the United States, who oversees NARA. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is serving as acting archivist, and James Byron, a senior adviser to the archivist, is running day-to-day operations for NARA.",
      "Arrington started in August 2024 as director of the Eisenhower library, in Abilene, Kansas, one of 16 presidential libraries or museums operated by NARA, including those that will be built for Mr. Trump and former presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The president's son, Eric Trump, announced this week their family plans to one day construct the Trump library and museum in Miami.",
      "Arrington said the other reason cited for his ouster is tied to the construction of a new building for the nonprofit Eisenhower Foundation on the grounds of the Eisenhower Library.",
      "The 52-year-old said he is less than five years away from retirement eligibility and is hoping to find a new job at a different federal agency.",
      "But, he said, \"If there's any way for it to happen, I'd return to this job in a heartbeat. I love the job, I love the people, I love the history. I never in a million years wanted this to happen.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An immigration judge in Maryland declined to reopen the immigration case involving Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported to his home country earlier this year and then brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers had asked an immigration judge in August to reopen the proceedings and allow him to seek asylum in the United States. While the bid was denied, Abrego Garcia can appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Abrego Garcia's final order of removal stands.",
      "\"His lawyers tried to fight his removal from the U.S. but one thing is certain, this Salvadoran man is not going to be able to remain in our country. He will never be allowed to prey on innocent Americans again,\" the department said in a post to social media.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, had been living in Maryland for more than a decade with his wife and children when he was first taken into federal immigration custody in March and deported to El Salvador. But an immigration judge in 2019 had granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal, a legal status that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his home country because of likely persecution by local gangs.",
      "A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., though the Department of Homeland Security resisted doing so for weeks. But in early June, Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. after a federal grand jury indicted him on two counts of human smuggling.",
      "He pleaded not guilty to both counts, and in July, a federal judge overseeing his criminal case ordered him to be released on bond while awaiting trial. But he remained detained for several weeks because of concerns that Abrego Garcia would be swiftly taken into immigration custody following his release and deported.",
      "Abrego Garcia left criminal confinement in late August, but was arrested by immigration authorities days later when he went for an interview with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore. He filed a petition challenging the legality of his arrest and detention, and a judge in Maryland temporarily blocked the Trump administration from removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S.",
      "He had been held at a detention center in Virginia but was transferred to a facility in Pennsylvania last month.",
      "Abrego Garcia applied for asylum in 2019, but an immigration judge said he waited too long to do so and denied the bid. Under federal immigration law, an asylum-seeker has to file an application within one year of their arrival to the U.S. The immigration judge said in the 2019 decision that Abrego Garcia waited seven years to file a request for asylum.",
      "But the judge, David Jones, said Abrego Garica provided \"credible responses\" to questions and provided \"substantial documentation\" bolstering his claim for asylum, including affidavits from family members describing threats by a local gang.",

    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 passed by lawmakers and signed by President Trump over the summer \u2014 significantly restricted noncitizen eligibility for Medicaid coverage, making it only accessible to lawful permanent residents, Cubans and Haitians who entered the U.S. legally and noncitizens from several Pacific islands.",
      "The bill excluded those granted parole to enter the U.S., refugees, asylees and the other previously eligible immigrants. Roughly 1.4 million immigrants could lose health insurance coverage under the bill's provisions, according to a KFF analysis of Congressional Budget Office data.",
      "The Democrats' funding proposal would restore noncitizen eligibility for Medicaid to the longstanding pre-2025 rules, reopening access for the classes of immigrants who were carved out earlier this year. All of those immigrants are in the U.S. either legally or with the government's permission.",
      "U.S. law has long rendered people living in the U.S. illegally \u2014 without any type of legal status \u2014 ineligible for most federal benefits, including Medicaid.",
      "Trump administration officials, however, have argued that some of the lawfully present immigrants previously eligible for Medicaid were illegally let in by the Biden administration. They argue that in the case of those granted parole, the Biden administration waved them in using a \"magic wand,\" in violation of federal immigration law.",
      "The groups of people granted parole under former President Biden \u2014 such as Venezuelans and Ukrainians \u2014 entered the country with the government's permission and were authorized to work and live in the U.S. The Trump administration has suspended those Biden-era parole programs, and revoked the legal status of many of those who arrived under them.",
      "The legal status of many of the other immigrants eligible for Medicaid before the One Big Beautiful Bill act \u2014 like the refugees and asylees \u2014 is not disputed. Both refugees and asylees are on a path to permanent legal status and, eventually, U.S. citizenship.",
      "While people who are in the U.S. illegally are not covered by federal Medicaid, the program may reimburse hospitals providing emergency care to immigrants who lack legal status. Emergency funding for noncitizens constitutes less than 1% of total spending for the program, according to an analysis by KFF. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act lowered the amount hospitals can receive for these ER visits, which the Democrats' government funding plan would reverse.",
      "Democratic leaders have denied that they're seeking to fund health care for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. The position of most Democrats is that they will not vote for a short-term funding extension that would allow the government to reopen unless Republicans extend Affordable Care Act tax credits that have helped millions of Americans lower their health insurance costs.",
      "\"Federal law prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars to provide medical coverage to undocumented individuals. And there is nothing in anything that we have proposed that is trying to change that law,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday. \"We are fighting for the health care of the American people.\"",
      "Some Republicans have also argued that if Democrats restore the federal Medicaid funding that was cut in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it would allow Democratic-led states to spend more state funds on health care for immigrants residing in the country unlawfully.",
      "According to an\u00a0analysis by nonpartisan health care researchers at KFF, more than a dozen states comprehensively cover care for low-income children who lack a legal immigration status using state funds. Some states, including California, provide some form of coverage to adults living in the country without authorization.",
      "Republicans previously attempted to penalize these states in Mr. Trump's budget bill, but that provision did not make it into the final legislation.",

    "summary": "A shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion each week, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The fight over funding the government is likely to be a costly one.",
      "Each week of the ongoing government shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion and reduce GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, according to an estimate published by EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. That cost is a function of reduced pay for federal employees, delayed government procurement of goods and a decline in demand.",
      "To some extent, a portion of that economic cost would be reversed when the government reopens, as furloughed employees receive back pay and economic activity increases, the analysis said.",
      "It's likely that not everything would be reversible, though. The last shutdown \u2014 which was during President Trump's first term and lasted 34 days, beginning in December 2018 and ending in January 2019 \u2014 cost the U.S. economy about $11 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "During that shutdown, the longest on record, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that real gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2018 took a $3 billion hit (in 2019 dollars). And it estimated that in the first quarter of 2019, real GDP was \"$8 billion lower than it would have been \u2014 an effect reflecting both the five-week partial shutdown and the resumption in economic activity once funding resumed.\"",
      "The shutdown could shake Americans' faith in the economy, too. EY-Parthenon notes that at the time, the 2019 shutdown led to the sharpest monthly drop in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index up since 2012.",
      "Some of the shutdown costs also stem from the administrative effort necessary to create contingency plans when the government is shut down and reopened. Agencies lose user fees collected from visitors to the national parks or from people seeking certain federal permits or visas. And there are higher premiums in federal contracting during a shutdown and the back pay federal employees eventually receive when the government reopens.",
      "Current federal law requires that federal workers be paid at their regular rate, whether they're furloughed or not, once the government is operating again. In a new analysis cited by the White House, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal government will pay $400 million a day for furloughed employees, who will not be working during the shutdown.",
      "A September 2019 report from a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee estimated the last three government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 \"cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion \u2014 at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed federal workers, and at least $338 million in other costs associated with the shutdowns, including extra administrative work, lost revenue, and late fees on interest payments.\"",
      "The White House Office of Management and Budget estimated that during the 16-day shutdown of 2013, federal employees received $2.5 billion in pay and benefits for hours they did not work, plus $10 million in penalty interest payments and lost fees.",
      "2025 shutdown",
      "But this time may be different. President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Russell Vought, the OMB director, say layoffs will happen soon if the shutdown continues, so the net fiscal impact of a shutdown to the federal government is a little harder to predict right now. Vought immediately began freezing or slashing federal funding for projects, largely in blue states, during the shutdown. The Trump administration is withholding $18 billion in infrastructure projects in New York City, and cutting funding for climate-related projects in many states that Kamala Harris won.",
      "Vought also told Republican lawmakers Wednesday that Reduction in Force \u2014 or RIF \u2014 cuts would begin in two days.",
      "The president said Tuesday \"a lot of good can come down from shutdowns,\" and suggested Vought could use the shutdown to permanently cut federal workers and programs the administration doesn't want but that have the backing of Democrats.",
      "\"We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible for them, that are bad for them and irreversible by them,\" Mr. Trump said of Democrats. \"Like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.\"",

The list includes, in order: operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East operations, the U.S. missile defense project Golden Dome for America, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions.",
      "The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.",
      "While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.",
      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted.",

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",

      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration announced $18 billion in federal funds will be frozen for key New York City projects amid the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration said Wednesday that it is freezing roughly $18 billion in federal funding for a pair of New York City infrastructure projects, targeting the home state of both Democratic congressional leaders on the first day of the government shutdown.",
      "Russ Vought, head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, announced the freeze in a post on X, saying funding for the Hudson Tunnel Project and Second Avenue Subway would be halted pending a review that will be delayed due to furloughs during the funding lapse.",
      "New York is home to both Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and the Department of Transportation linked the leaders to the project freeze in its announcement.",
      "Vought said the federal money for the two projects will be \"put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles.\" DEI refers to \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" policies, which have been top targets of the Trump administration.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the Transportation Department said the infrastructure projects are \"under administrative review to determine whether any unconstitutional practices are occurring.\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, the statement said, believes \"subsidizing infrastructure contracts with taxpayer dollars based on discriminatory principles is unconstitutional, counter to civil rights laws, and a waste of taxpayer resources.\"",
      "\"The department is focusing on these projects because they are arguably the largest infrastructure initiatives in the western hemisphere, and the American people want to see them completed quickly and efficiently,\" DOT said. \"Until USDOT's quick administrative review is complete, project reimbursements cannot be processed, including a $300 million disbursement for the 2nd Avenue Subway.\"",
      "The department said the remaining federal funding for the projects is roughly $18 billion.",
      "\"Thanks to the Chuck Schumer and Hakeem [Jeffries] shutdown, however, USDOT's review of New York's unconstitutional practices will take more time. Without a budget, the department has been forced to furlough the civil rights staff responsible for conducting this review,\" the statement said.",
      "New York City voters also lean heavily Democratic.",
      "In a joint statement, Jeffries and Schumer said the projects \"aren't political trophies \u2014 they are lifelines.\"",
      "\"They mean tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs. They mean shorter commutes, safer travel and a stronger economy not just for New York, but for the entire nation,\" the leaders said. \"Choking off these projects out of spite will damage America's competitiveness and cost working families dearly.\"",
      "Asked at the Capitol if he is being targeted, Jeffries said, \"The Trump administration is targeting the jobs, thousands of jobs of hard-working Americans. Working-class Americans and blue collar Americans will lose the ability to work at the Second Avenue Subway site or at the other project that has been canceled related to the Cross-Harbor Tunnel.\"",
      "Asked about the move, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, \"Vote to open up the government, that issue goes away, right?\"",
      "The Senate has failed to approve House-passed legislation to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, sending the country into a government shutdown on Wednesday morning.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The federal government began shutting down at 12 a.m. on Wednesday after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement to extend government funding.",
      "Republicans and Democrats have been at odds over how to fund the government as Democrats have pushed for negotiations over health care tax credits to be included in a funding measure. Without an extension or approval of another funding bill, spending authority expired, sending the federal government into a shutdown.",
      "Each agency and department began shutdown procedures on Wednesday morning, leading to hundreds of thousands of workers being placed on furlough. Essential employees will stay on the job, but nearly all employees, whether furloughed or not, will go without pay for the duration of the funding lapse.",
      "The shutdown is the result of weeks of disagreements between Republicans and Democrats in Washington over funding the government. Here's the back story:",
      "How Congress funds the government",
      "Each year, Congress faces a deadline to approve government funding by the start of a new fiscal year on Oct. 1. The Constitution outlines that Congress must approve any money spent by the federal government. Bills to approve that spending must originate in the House, pass the Senate and be signed by the president before departments and agencies can use the funds.",
      "The government funding process often stretches late into the fiscal year, and in recent decades Congress has nearly always resorted to stopgap measures to keep the government funded in order to give lawmakers more time to approve new spending.",
      "The funding fights often go down to the wire, as the minority looks to use its leverage to extract concessions. But lawmakers also have strong incentives to avoid shutdowns, since they can be economically and politically costly. The last funding lapse stretched from December 2018 until January 2019 and caused a permanent loss of about $3 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The 2025 funding fight",
      "This time around, Democrats have refused to help Republicans in the majority extend government funding without addressing health insurance subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans have been steadfast in their belief that health care and other issues should be negotiated outside the context of funding the government, and urged Democrats to agree to a temporary funding extension.",
      "On Sept. 19, House Republicans passed what's known as a continuing resolution to keep the government funded at existing levels until Nov. 21. Republicans touted the \"clean\" continuing resolution that would give lawmakers more time to work out full-year spending bills. But Democrats insisted that Republicans negotiate with them on the funding plan to earn their support.",
      "Although Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, most legislation in the upper chamber is subject to a 60-vote threshold to advance. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats pushed their own proposal to avert a shutdown with a bill that would keep the government funded until Oct. 31. Their bill also includes a number of their priorities, including a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which became a red line for their support.",
      "Both the House-passed bill and the Democratic proposal fell short in the Senate, as the two parties became locked in a stalemate over the funding plan. And a decision by House GOP leaders to keep the House away from Washington until after the funding deadline has all but ruled out alternate paths forward.",
      "A meeting between President Trump and the congressional leaders on Monday failed to yield an agreement, with the two sides trading blame for what appears to be an inevitable shutdown. On Tuesday, both proposals to extend government funding again fell short in the Senate.",
      "What happens during a shutdown",
      "With the government shutting down, lawmakers will have to agree to a spending bill to eventually reopen the government.",
      "In the meantime, federal agencies will halt non-essential functions. The Congressional Budget Office estimated on Tuesday that about 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed, though they would receive back pay at the end of a shutdown. The total daily cost of their compensation would be around $400 million. The budget office noted that the effects of a shutdown \"depend on its duration and on an Administration's decisions about how to proceed.\"",
      "Among those employees who are deemed essential are active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency decides which employees are essential. Tens of thousands of others can stay on the job because their pay is funded through other means, like other legislation or fees.",
      "Adding to the dynamic, the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force notices, or layoffs, for federal employees in discretionary programs. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that during a shutdown, \"we can cut large numbers of people out,\" though he added, \"we don't want to do that, but we don't want fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "Back in Congress, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday that he expects the upper chamber to take additional votes to open up the government this week, though he noted that senators will observe the Jewish holiday, Yom Kippur, which begins at sundown on Wednesday and ends Thursday evening. The Senate could approve the House-passed continuing resolution and send it to the president's desk to bring a shutdown to an end.",
      "How long a shutdown lasts remains to be seen. During the last shutdown, the longest in history, lawmakers approved a stopgap measure to reopen the government after 34 days.",

      "Burns is an avid supporter of President Trump, with a bust of the president in his office. He leads a city known for opposing many of California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's policies, and the state's majority left-leaning voters, especially when it comes to immigration.",
      "\"Well, a lot of the impact is immeasurable,\" Burns said of how he thinks the city's residents are impacted or hurt by illegal immigration. \"... You don't know who's here. We don't know where they're coming from, what their past is.\"",
      "Back in January, Burns pushed an initiative approved unanimously by the Huntington Beach City Council that declared Huntington Beach a \"non-sanctuary\" city.",
      "At least 16 cities and counties across the U.S. have declared themselves non-sanctuary jurisdictions in recent years, according to the CBS News research team, while about two dozen states have passed legislation banning sanctuary policies.",
      "Non-sanctuary status gives local police the green light to help federal law enforcement officials in their efforts to capture and detain undocumented immigrants. However, California is a so-called \"sanctuary\" state that restricts local cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.",
      "Burns said the city's non-sanctuary policy has teeth \"in the sense that we're making a statement.\"",
      "\"Our policemen can't use ICE translators, or they can't translate for ICE, they can't use their computer systems,\" Burns said. \"I mean, there's so many different types of law enforcements that could all work together, and when they do, we have the best law enforcement in the world.\"",
      "The Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to withhold a variety of federal grants from cities and states classified as \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" if they don't cooperate with immigration enforcement. But so far, these attempts have been struck down in the courts.",
      "This week, Portland, Oregon, was the latest sanctuary city to be targeted by the White House, with Mr. \u00a0Trump ordering the deployment of 200 Oregon National Guard troops to protect an ICE facility and other federal buildings from protesters.",
      "\"The type of help that's being offered isn't being asked for,\" Portland Mayor Keith Wilson told reporters this week. \"It's not necessary. The number of troops that we want or need is zero.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ahead of Wednesday's\u00a0government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on Tuesday posted a banner in large type on its homepage blaming the shutdown on the \"Radical Left,\" an allegation that an ethics group said was a \"blatant violation\" of the Hatch Act.",
      "\"The Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people unless they get their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands,\" the message read. \"The Trump administration wants to keep the government open for the American people.\"",
      "A complaint filed Tuesday with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel by the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen alleged that the banner on HUD's website was a \"blatant violation\" of the Hatch Act, describing it as \"highly partisan\" and seeking to \"idolize the Trump administration \u2026 without attributing any blame for the lack of compromise causing the shutdown.\"",
      "The Hatch Act is a federal law passed in 1939 that \"limits certain political activities of federal employees as well as some state, D.C., and local government employees who work in connection with federally funded programs,\" according to the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "Its purpose, among other things, is to \"ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion,\" the office explains.",
      "\"This is such an obvious violation of the Hatch Act that it raises the question: 'How on Earth does HUD think they can get away with this?'\" Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with Public Citizen, who filed the complaint on behalf of his group, said in a statement. \"The answer is that the Trump administration has managed to neuter the ethics enforcement offices in the executive branch. Those who are responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act \u2014 namely, the Office of Special Counsel, followed by the Office of Government Ethics and the Attorney General's office \u2014 have all been taken over by Trump loyalists or those who are intimidated by Trump.\"",
      "\"The sheer crassness of this partisan advertisement by HUD using taxpayer dollars to campaign against Democrats and promote the Trump administration is going to make it exceedingly difficult for even a neutered ethics office to ignore,\" Holman added.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is an independent federal agency that is designed to enforce the Hatch Act, investigate wrongdoing within the executive branch and protect whistleblowers from retaliation.",
      "\"Instead of agreeing to a clean funding extension, Democrats are planning a government shutdown over their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands, like free health care for illegal aliens,\" White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told CBS News in a statement Wednesday regarding the complaint. \"The Democrats petty political games are unnecessarily hurting the most vulnerable Americans in our society. Why is the media more focused on a banner than reporting on the impact of a Democrat shutdown on the American people?\"",
      "An HUD spokesperson told CBS News in another statement Wednesday that the \"Far Left is barreling our country toward a shutdown, which will hurt all Americans. At HUD, we are working to keep critical services online and support our most vulnerable.\"",
      "And in a separate statement provided later Wednesday, HUD spokeswoman Kasey Lovett said that the \"Radical Left has shut down the government. As a result, HUD's Office of Public Affairs is operating in a limited capacity, which impacts our ability to promptly engage with the mainstream media. Once the government is reopened, we look forward to being back in touch.\"",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump fired Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger, the head of OSC, and replaced him with acting Special Counsel Jamieson Greer. Dellinger sued over the firing, but it was upheld by a federal appeals court. Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has fired more than a dozen federal inspectors general who are tasked with investigating wrongdoing at government agencies.",
      "The shutdown, which took effect at 12 a.m. Wednesday, came after the Senate failed to push through a short-term funding bill that passed the House earlier this month.",
      "Democrats have called for the bill to include a permanent extension of tax credits passed in 2021 for those receiving health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, as well as a rollback of Medicaid cuts that were part of Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" that passed this summer.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have argued that the \"big, beautiful bill\" did not cut Medicaid, but instead that it eliminated fraud within the program.",
      "\"We're not cutting Medicaid,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said in June, prior to the passage of the \"big, beautiful bill.\" \"What we're doing is strengthening the program. We're reducing fraud, waste and abuse that is rampant in Medicaid to ensure that that program is essential for so many people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties cast blame on the other over the shutdown. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday night that \"Republicans have until midnight to cut the garbage and get serious,\" while Senate Majority Leader John Thune called the shutdown \"totally avoidable,\" adding that \"if the government shuts down, it is on the Senate Democrats.\"",

    "story": [
      "Since President Trump returned to the White House in January, his administration has mounted an aggressive effort to crack down on cities, counties and states that aren't participating in its mass deportation campaign, threatening these so-called \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions with lawsuits, funding cuts and other penalties.",
      "The Trump administration has also directed Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies to surge deportation agents to sanctuary jurisdictions like Chicago and Los Angeles, where highly visible federal immigration raids have triggered massive protests and confrontations.",
      "But eight months into Mr. Trump's second administration, the effort to exert pressure on these jurisdictions has yielded few tangible results, with most lawsuits still unresolved and local Democratic leaders doubling down on policies that limit or bar cooperation with federal immigration officials.",
      "The Justice Department has cited only one case in which a jurisdiction \u2014 Louisville, Kentucky \u2014 has abandoned its sanctuary policies in the face of legal actions or threats. Nevada's Republican governor also recently vowed to cooperate with federal immigration officials after his state was identified as a sanctuary jurisdiction.",
      "The administration's attempts to halt federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, meanwhile, have been blocked by federal courts.",
      "More than a dozen lawsuits",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, the Justice Department has filed lawsuits against more than a dozen Democratic-led states, counties and cities, according to a CBS News review of court filings.",
      "The lawsuits target major cities led by Democrats, including New York City, Los Angeles, Boston and Denver, along with smaller jurisdictions, such as Rochester, New York, and Newark, Hoboken, Paterson and Jersey City in New Jersey. The states of Illinois, Minnesota, New York and Colorado have also been sued.",
      "The Trump administration has argued in the lawsuits that local sanctuary policies hinder the federal government's ability to enforce immigration laws and directly conflict with the U.S. Constitution's supremacy clause, which established that federal laws override state laws in case of conflict.",
      "While there's no uniform definition for \"sanctuary\" policies, they generally restrict or prohibit cooperation between local law enforcement officials and federal immigration agencies like ICE. They include prohibitions on local officials notifying ICE when they release noncitizens who are incarcerated or are detaining people at ICE's request, and policies that restrict information-sharing with federal immigration authorities, to varying degrees.",
      "The targeted jurisdictions have strongly defended their policies in court, citing the 10th Amendment's anti-commandeering doctrine that prohibits the federal government from forcing state or local officials to enforce federal laws. In a motion this summer, Jersey City told a federal judge that the Trump administration was seeking to \"force states or local authorities to implement or enforce federal law, which is expressly prohibited.\"",
      "The vast majority of the Trump administration's lawsuits against sanctuary jurisdictions remain pending in federal courts across the country. In the summer, a federal judge dismissed the administration's lawsuit against Illinois and Cook County.",
      "Warnings",
      "The Trump administration has also repeatedly threatened to take legal action against other jurisdictions.",
      "In August, at the direction of Mr. Trump, the Justice Department published a list of nearly 40 \"states, cities, and counties identified as having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.\" Attorney General Pam Bondi then sent warning letters to almost all localities on the list, ordering recipients to explain how they planned to dismantle their sanctuary policies.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security escalated the effort earlier in September by sending letters to California, New York and Illinois, warning that their refusal to honor so-called \"detainer\" requests from ICE could trigger federal legal action. Those requests ask local law enforcement officials to hold noncitizen detainees slated for release until ICE can arrive and arrest them at a local jail or prison.",
      "The Justice Department has said it could update its list of sanctuary cities, counties and states in the future to \"include additional jurisdictions and remove jurisdictions that have remediated their policies, practices, and laws.\"",
      "Last week, Nevada became the first jurisdiction to be removed from that list after the state's Republican governor, Joe Lombardo, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Justice Department vowing to have state officials cooperate with federal immigration authorities, including by moving to \"counter-balance\" actions by the Nevada Legislature or its attorney general, Aaron Ford, a Democrat.",
      "Louisville, Kentucky, is the only jurisdiction that dropped its sanctuary policies following a written warning from Bondi's office in June. Louisville's Democratic mayor, Craig Greenberg, responded to Bondi in July, agreeing to make the requested policy change, with the understanding that the city would then be removed from the list of sanctuary jurisdictions.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Justice confirmed to CBS News that no other jurisdiction has backed down from their policies, and declined to comment on further actions the administration may pursue.",
      "Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams has called for the city to \"tweak\" its sanctuary laws following a Trump administration lawsuit, but the idea has faced opposition in the City Council.",
      "Attempted funding cuts",
      "Several federal agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, have launched efforts to withhold funding from sanctuary jurisdictions, citing executive orders by Mr. Trump calling for funding cuts.",
      "Some of the attempted funding cuts involve federal programs that support law enforcement, community policing and urban development, including Byrne Justice Assistance grants, Community Oriented Policing Services grants, and Housing and Urban Development funding.",
      "In February, 16 Democratic cities and counties, including San Francisco and Seattle, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging the funding cuts. San Francisco-based federal Judge William Orrick sided with the jurisdictions in April, barring the administration \"from directly or indirectly taking any action to withhold, freeze, or condition federal funds from the cities and counties.\" In September, Orrick expanded his order, blocking the administration from withholding funds from more than 30 jurisdictions, including Los Angeles.",
      "Another federal judge, William Smith, ruled in September that it is unconstitutional for the Trump administration to make certain grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency conditional on states' cooperation with federal immigration officials.",
      "The court rulings, along with several other lawsuits that remain pending, have stalled the administration's funding cuts. The Justice Department has appealed the ruling out of San Francisco.",
      "A longstanding political divide",
      "Disagreements over the merits of sanctuary policies have been part of the broader immigration debate in the U.S. for decades.",
      "Advocates for sanctuary policies argue that cooperation with ICE erodes community trust with local police, making immigrants fearful of contacting law enforcement and, as a result, unlikely to report crimes.",
      "Those who oppose sanctuary policies argue they obstruct federal immigration law enforcement and undermine public safety, since they often prevent ICE from arresting noncitizens charged with crimes inside local jails.",
      "Matt Hudak, a longtime Border Patrol official who retired as the agency's deputy chief in 2023, said sanctuary policies inhibit local and federal law enforcement from sharing information and working together, creating what he called \"dark spaces\" that put both officers and the public at risk.",
      "\"Any time that law enforcement does not cooperate with law enforcement, there is a very dangerous blind spot,\" Hudak told CBS News.",
      "Those blind spots, Hudak argued, can be exploited by Transnational Criminal Organizations, such as Mexican drug cartels, who knowingly \"operate in those shadows,\" because \"the things that maybe would get them exposed are now shielded.\"",
      "Democratic Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said the argument about so-called sanctuary policies jeopardizing public safety is \"patently false.\"",
      "\"We successfully attacked and dramatically depleted the forces of MS-13 here,\" said Johnston.",
      "Denver is one of the cities designated a sanctuary jurisdiction by the Department of Justice. But Johnston called the Trump administration's legal actions \"political theater,\" saying Denver is \"not a sanctuary city.\"",
      "\"We do not provide sanctuary or safe harbor to folks who have committed violent crimes or have broken any local laws,\" Johnston told CBS News. \"If anyone is a public safety threat, we are 100% on top of it.\"",

    "summary": "The federal government shutdown overnight after Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement to avoid a funding lapse ahead of an Oct. 1 deadline.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The National Park Service will furlough more than half of its workforce during the government shutdown, but will keep trails, open-air memorials and other areas at least partially open to visitors, it said in its plan for navigating the funding lapse.",
      "Of the service's 14,500 employees, 9,296 will be furloughed, according to\u00a0the document, which was released Tuesday. The NPS' plan for the parks themselves makes a distinction between those with accessible areas that collect fees under a law known as the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act and those that don't. The agency, which is part of the Department of Interior, has a list of parks that do and don't charge fees on its website.",
      "\"Park roads, lookouts, trails, and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to visitors,\" the plan says.",
      "About 100 of the 400 parks in the National Parks system collect fees. Those parks that have accessible areas will use available fees to provide \"basic visitor services\" to maintain \"restrooms and sanitation, trash collection, road maintenance, campground operations, law enforcement and emergency operations, and staffing entrance gates as necessary to provide critical safety information.\"",
      "Parks with accessible areas that don't collect fees may be able to use \"regional or national\" fees with the approval of the service's director.",
      "Parks without accessible areas will not operate during the shutdown, the NPS plan says. Staffing will be at a minimum and \"[n]o visitor services will be provided.\" The service \"will not issue permits, conduct interpretive or educational programs, collect trash, operate or provide restrooms, maintain roads and walkways (including plowing and ice melting) or provide visitor information.\"",
      "\"As a general rule, if a facility or area is locked or secured during non-business hours (buildings, gated parking lots, etc.) it should be locked or secured for the duration of the shutdown,\" the plan says.",
      "The service says parks can enter into agreements with state and local governments and third parties \"for donations to fund the full operation of an individual park unit or for specified services.\"",
      "The Utah Office of Tourism said that the state's five national parks \u2014 Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef and Zion \u2014 will remain open during the government shutdown.",
      "\"Our priority has been and continues to be preserving our parks, maintaining the visitor experience, and ensuring Utah communities and businesses that rely on national park visitation are supported,\" said Natalie Randall, the office's managing director. \"We are engaged in proactive conversations with public and private partners at all levels, offering strategic support to ensure the parks remain open with necessary resources.\"",
      "The office said visitors should expect \"reduced services and reduced staffing\" at the parks during the shutdown.",
      "Zion National Park is one of the most popular parks in the country, with more than 4.9 million visitors in 2024,\u00a0according to the National Parks Service. Visitors to all of Utah's national parks contributed about $3.1 billion to the state's economy last year, the tourism office said.",
      "The government shut down overnight after Republicans and Democrats remained at an impasse over a deal to extend federal funding before an Oct. 1 deadline. Up to 750,000 federal workers could be furloughed during the funding lapse, according to the\u00a0Congressional Budget Office, and they will not be paid until Congress approves funding to end the shutdown. But employees considered essential will continue working.",
      "Republicans are pinning the blame for the shutdown on Democrats, while Democrats argued that the GOP has been unwilling to negotiate with them.",
      "The National Parks Conservation Association warned that national parks will lose up to $1 million in fee revenue for every day the shutdown lasts, and communities outside of the parks could lose up to $80 million in spending from tourists.",
      "During the 35-day shutdown that occurred in the first Trump administration, some parks were vandalized, cultural sites were damaged and there were sanitation issues as parks were minimally staffed.",
      "\"The government has shut down, and the administration is once again putting our national parks and visitors at risk, effectively directing staff to open park gates and walk away,\" Theresa Pierno, president and CEO for National Parks Conservation Association, said in a statement. \"Visitors may enter, but very few staff will be there to protect the parks or the people inside. It's not just irresponsible, it's dangerous.\"",
      "The Government Accountability Office found that during the lapse in funding that began in late 2018 and ran into early 2019, the Department of the Interior violated federal law when it used fees collected under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to cover expenses normally covered by a different program.",

    "summary": "Pfizer's CEO said President Trump's threat of tariffs motivated his company to take swift action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pfizer has agreed to offer significantly discounted prices for some prescription drugs for all American consumers and has committed to offer prescription medications to Medicaid at lower prices, President Trump announced Tuesday. The president said the drugs will be available for purchase online on a website operated by the federal government, which the White House has said will be called \"TrumpRx.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was in the Oval Office with the president for the announcement, said Mr. Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the U.S. motivated his company to take swift action. The president said Pfizer's drug prices will be lower starting \"immediately.\"",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%. Mr. Trump said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced 'most favored nation' cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House has released specific drug prices yet.",
      "Some health policy experts cautioned that pricing details are still unclear and the impact for consumers may be limited.",
      "Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out that Medicaid's prices are already lower than average in the U.S.",
      "\"Medicaid already enjoys 'best-price' protection in the sense that they receive the lowest prices charged to any commercial payer in the United States. Therefore, we are starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" he told CBS News.",
      "And those patients have been benefiting, says Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Program on Medicare Policy at\u00a0KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization: \"It is still very unclear how the price reductions announced today will lower costs directly for many people, since people on Medicaid typically don't pay large amounts out of pocket for drugs.\"",
      "Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, said: \"The direct-to-patient stuff is, in my view, a sideshow and branding opportunity for Trump. Most patients have drug coverage. \u2026 Very few are going to buy medications with cash, unless the drug is not a covered benefit, like weight loss or erectile dysfunction drugs.\"",
      "Bourla called it a \"historic day\" because the agreement would be reversing an \"unfair situation.\"",
      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on\u00a0drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs. He threatened to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they failed to do so.",
      "Monday was the deadline for drugmakers to reach agreements to bring down drug costs, the Post reported, after the president's May executive order. While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population and uses about 13% of the world's prescription drugs, the U.S. funds over 70% of global pharmaceutical profits, according to the White House.",
      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "Bourla mentioned the impending tariffs in his comments Tuesday, saying the tariffs had motivated his company. He said the Mr. Trump gave Pfizer a three-year grace period on the tariffs, and the tariffs would be inapplicable, as long as Pfizer manufactures in the U.S. As a part of the agreement, Bourla said Pfizer agreed to move their production of medicines used in America to the U.S.",
      "\"The president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President,\" Bourla said. \"And clearly motivated ours, right?\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said the tariffs had \"played a big role\" in the deal.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall. Mr. Trump echoed that point, saying other companies are on board, too.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C.,\" said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRx\" website have not yet been shared, but a senior administration official expected the website to be live in early 2026.",
      "The announcement comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

      "A mysterious \"rogue planet\"\u00a0has been observed gobbling 6 billion tons of gas and dust a second \u2014 an unprecedented rate that blurs the line between planets and stars, astronomers said Thursday.",
      "Unlike Earth and other planets in our solar system, which orbit the sun, rogue planets float freely through the universe untethered to a star.",
      "Scientists estimate there could be trillions of rogue planets in our galaxy alone \u2014 but they are difficult to spot because they mostly drift quietly along in perpetual night.",
      "\"People may think of planets as quiet and stable worlds, but with this discovery we see that planetary-mass objects freely floating in space can be exciting places,\" V\u00edctor Almendros-Abad, a lead author of the new study, said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "These strange objects intrigue astronomers because they are \"neither a star nor a proper planet,\" Alexander Scholz, an astronomer at Scotland's University of St. Andrews and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "\"Their origin remains an open question: are they the lowest-mass objects formed like stars, or giant planets ejected from their birth systems?\"",
      "Rogue planet found growing at record rate: six billion tonnes a second!\n\nUnlike the planets in our Solar System, rogue...",
      "The team of researchers behind the new study was stunned to observe an astonishing growth spurt in a rogue planet around 620 light years from Earth in the constellation Chamaeleon.",
      "The planet, officially called Cha 1107-7626, has a mass five to 10 times bigger than Jupiter.",
      "Scholz explained that the object is \"still in its infancy,\" being roughly 1 or 2 million years old.",
      "The object grows by sucking in matter from a disc that surrounds it \u2014 a process called accretion.",
      "But what the astronomers saw happen to Cha 1107-7626 \"blurs the line between stars and planets,\" study co-author Belinda Damian said in a statement.",
      "In August this year, the planet suddenly started devouring matter from its disc at a record-breaking 6 billion tons per second \u2014 eight times faster than a few months earlier.",
      "\"This is the strongest accretion episode ever recorded for a planetary-mass object,\" said Almendros-Abad.",
      "\"Awe-inspiring\"",
      "By comparing light emitted before and during this binge-eating session, the scientists discovered that magnetic activity was playing a role in driving matter towards the object.",
      "This phenomenon has previously only been observed in stars.",
      "The chemistry in the disc also changed. Water vapour was detected in the disc during the accretion episode, but not beforehand.",
      "This is also something that has previously been observed in stars \u2014 but never for a forming planet.",
      "Lead study author Ray Jayawardhana of Johns Hopkins University said the discovery implies \"that some objects comparable to giant planets form the way stars do, from contracting clouds of gas and dust accompanied by discs of their own, and they go through growth episodes just like newborn stars.\"",
      "No matter how weird, Cha 1107-7626 is still expected to have similar characteristics to huge planets, because it is of similar size.",
      "Scholz said that, unlike stars, this object is \"not massive enough to ever have fusion reactions in the core.\"",
      "So, like other planets, \"it will cool inevitably as it gets older,\" he added.",
      "Amelia Bayo, another co-author of the study in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said, \"The idea that a planetary object can behave like a star is awe-inspiring.\"",
      "It \"invites us to wonder what worlds beyond our own could be like during their nascent stages,\" she added.",
      "The observations were made by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile.",

      "Just 310 miles wide and invisible to the naked eye, the white, scar-covered Enceladus is one of hundreds of moons orbiting the sixth planet from the sun.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed Enceladus was too far away from the sun \u2014 and therefore too cold \u2014 to be habitable.",
      "Then the Cassini space probe flew past the moon several times during a 2004-2017 trip to Saturn and its rings, discovering evidence that a vast saltwater ocean is concealed under the moon's miles-thick layer of ice.",
      "Since then, scientists have been sifting through the data collected by Cassini, revealing that the ocean has many of the elements thought to be needed to host life, including salt, methane, carbon dioxide and phosphorus.",
      "When the spacecraft passed over the moon's south pole, it discovered jets of water bursting through cracks on the surface.",
      "These jets were propelling tiny ice particles \u2014 smaller than grains of sand \u2014 into space. While some of these ice grains fell back to the moon's surface, others collected around one of Saturn's many rings.",
      "When Cassini flew through Saturn's outermost \"E\" ring, it was \"detecting samples from Enceladus all the time,\" Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at the Free University of Berlin and lead author of the new study, said in a statement from the European Space agency.",
      "\"There are many possible pathways from the organic molecules we found in the Cassini data to potentially biologically relevant compounds, which enhances the likelihood that the moon is habitable,\" Nozair said.",
      "By looking through these samples, scientists had previously identified numerous organic molecules \u2014 including the precursors of amino acids, which are fundamental building blocks of life.",
      "But these ice grains could have been altered after being trapped in the ring for hundreds of years \u2014 or beaten up by blasts of cosmic radiation.",
      "So the scientists wanted to look at some fresh ice grains.",
      "Luckily, they already had access to some.",
      "When Cassini flew directly into the spray spewing from the moon's surface in 2008, grains of ice hit the spacecraft's Cosmic Dust Analyzer at around 11 miles a second.",
      "But it took years to complete a detailed chemical analysis of these particles, which was the subject of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\"Being habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,\" the University of Washington's Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Having a variety of organic compounds on an extraterrestrial water world is simply phenomenal,\" Klenner told the AP in an email.",
      "\"Another piece of the puzzle\"",
      "Study co-author Frank Postberg said the research proves that \"the complex organic molecules Cassini detected in Saturn's E ring are not just a product of long exposure to space, but are readily available in Enceladus's ocean.\"",
      "French astrochemist Caroline Freissinet, who was not involved in the study, told AFP that there was \"not much doubt\" that these molecules were in the moon's ocean.",
      "But this confirmation provides \"another piece in the puzzle,\" she added.",
      "It also shows that recent technology such as artificial intelligence allows scientists to perform new kinds of analysis on old data, she said.",
      "But to get the best idea about what is happening on Enceladus, a mission would need to land near the icy geysers and collect samples, she added.",
      "The European Space Agency has been studying the potential of a mission that would do just that.",
      "After all, \"Enceladus ticks all the boxes to be a habitable environment that could support life,\" the agency said in the statement.",

      "Unlike Earth and other planets in our solar system, which orbit the sun, rogue planets float freely through the universe untethered to a star.",
      "Scientists estimate there could be trillions of rogue planets in our galaxy alone \u2014 but they are difficult to spot because they mostly drift quietly along in perpetual night.",
      "\"People may think of planets as quiet and stable worlds, but with this discovery we see that planetary-mass objects freely floating in space can be exciting places,\" V\u00edctor Almendros-Abad, a lead author of the new study, said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "These strange objects intrigue astronomers because they are \"neither a star nor a proper planet,\" Alexander Scholz, an astronomer at Scotland's University of St. Andrews and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "\"Their origin remains an open question: are they the lowest-mass objects formed like stars, or giant planets ejected from their birth systems?\"",
      "Rogue planet found growing at record rate: six billion tonnes a second!\n\nUnlike the planets in our Solar System, rogue...",
      "The team of researchers behind the new study was stunned to observe an astonishing growth spurt in a rogue planet around 620 light years from Earth in the constellation Chamaeleon.",
      "The planet, officially called Cha 1107-7626, has a mass five to 10 times bigger than Jupiter.",
      "Scholz explained that the object is \"still in its infancy,\" being roughly 1 or 2 million years old.",
      "The object grows by sucking in matter from a disc that surrounds it \u2014 a process called accretion.",
      "But what the astronomers saw happen to Cha 1107-7626 \"blurs the line between stars and planets,\" study co-author Belinda Damian said in a statement.",
      "In August this year, the planet suddenly started devouring matter from its disc at a record-breaking 6 billion tons per second \u2014 eight times faster than a few months earlier.",
      "\"This is the strongest accretion episode ever recorded for a planetary-mass object,\" said Almendros-Abad.",
      "\"Awe-inspiring\"",
      "By comparing light emitted before and during this binge-eating session, the scientists discovered that magnetic activity was playing a role in driving matter towards the object.",
      "This phenomenon has previously only been observed in stars.",
      "The chemistry in the disc also changed. Water vapour was detected in the disc during the accretion episode, but not beforehand.",
      "This is also something that has previously been observed in stars \u2014 but never for a forming planet.",
      "Lead study author Ray Jayawardhana of Johns Hopkins University said the discovery implies \"that some objects comparable to giant planets form the way stars do, from contracting clouds of gas and dust accompanied by discs of their own, and they go through growth episodes just like newborn stars.\"",
      "No matter how weird, Cha 1107-7626 is still expected to have similar characteristics to huge planets, because it is of similar size.",
      "Scholz said that, unlike stars, this object is \"not massive enough to ever have fusion reactions in the core.\"",
      "So, like other planets, \"it will cool inevitably as it gets older,\" he added.",
      "Amelia Bayo, another co-author of the study in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said, \"The idea that a planetary object can behave like a star is awe-inspiring.\"",
      "It \"invites us to wonder what worlds beyond our own could be like during their nascent stages,\" she added.",
      "The observations were made by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile.",
      "The research also included data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Last week, the Webb telescope revealed a colorful spread of stars and cosmic dust in the Milky Way's most active star-forming region.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 17:54:48 -0400",
    "summary": "Dutch producer pitches her AI creation, Tilly Norwood, as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says several agents are vying to represent it.",
    "story": [
      "Like thousands of actors, Tilly Norwood is looking for a Hollywood agent. Her greatest role? Pretending to be human.",
      "That's because Tilly Norwood is a 100% AI-generated product, created by Dutch producer and comedian Eline Van der Velden, founder of a company named Xicoia, which bills itself as the world's first artificial intelligence talent studio. Velden pitches her AI creation as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says there are several agents vying to represent it, CBS News' Jo Ling Kent reported recently.",
      "Since Velden launched the digital character's prospective career, Tilly Norwood has been all the talk in Hollywood.",
      "But not in a good way. Guilds, actors and filmmakers have met the Xicoia product with an immediate wave of backlash, protesting that artificial intelligence should not have a starring role in the acting profession. In a statement Tuesday, the Screen Actors Guild said that \"creativity is, and should remain, human-centered.\"",
      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, who starred in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Goonies,\" and was recently elected president of SAG-AFTRA, also emphasized how AI actors are artificial constructs trained off of work by real performers.",
      "\"You're made up of stuff that doesn't belong to you,\" he told CBS News. \"Let's just make sure that credit is given where credit is due.\"",
      "Van der Velden, who is also the founder of the AI production studio Particle6, promoted Tilly Norwood last month at the Zurich Summit, the industry sidebar of the Zurich Film Festival. It was there that she said talent agencies were circling Norwood and that she expected to soon announce a signing.",
      "Many in Hollywood hope that never happens.",
      "\"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" wrote Natasha Lyonne on Instagram. The \"Russian Doll\" star is directing a feature titled \"Uncanny Valley\" that pledges to use \"ethical\" artificial intelligence in combination with traditional filmmaking techniques. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed,\" she added. \"Not the way. Not the vibe. Not the use.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is often used as a tool in film production, though its implementation is hotly debated. It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",
      "That statement was also shared on Tilly Norwood's own Instagram account. Posts include photos of the creation drinking coffee, shopping for clothes and preparing for various projects. As of Tuesday, the account had more than 33,000 followers.",
      "A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)",
      "\"Had such a blast filming some screen tests recently,\" one post reads. \"Every day feels like a step closer to the big screen.\"",
      "Asked what human actors bring to a performance that AI can't, Astin said \"authenticity,\" adding, \"You can fall in love. Your parents can die. You can you can be in some terrifying situation. The sum of all of our emotional experiences in our life, artificial intelligence can approximate it \u2014 it is not real.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-artificial-intelligence-work-trade-jobs/",
    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 00:28:17 -0400",
    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

(OpenAI says on its website that it requires users ages 13 to 18 to obtain parental consent before using ChatGPT.)",
      "In August, the California-based technology company pledged to implement changes to its flagship product after facing\u00a0a wrongful death lawsuit\u00a0by parents of a 16-year-old who alleged the chatbot led their son to take his own life.",
      "OpenAI's new controls will allow parents to link their own ChatGPT accounts to the accounts of their teenagers \"and customize settings for a safe, age-appropriate experience,\" OpenAI said in Monday's announcement.

    "summary": "Recent polling shows a majority of Hispanics disapprove of the way President Trump is handling his job as president, but it hasn't translated into support for Democrats.",
    "story": [
      "The government shutdown that began Wednesday prompted the White House to cancel a celebration in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month with Latino supporters, a key voting group for President Trump in 2024. Despite periodic events showcasing GOP efforts to woo Hispanics, that support may be eroding.",
      "Latinos made up a big part of the coalition that helped propel Mr. Trump to victory \u2014 he won with nearly half of Latino voters \u2014 a historic high of 48% for a Republican presidential contender. A majority of Hispanic male voters backed him in the race against former Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "But recent polling suggests Hispanic support for the president and his policies has dropped, primarily over economic issues, including the high prices of groceries and housing.",
      "In a New York Times/Sienna poll this week, 69% of Hispanics said they disapprove of the way Mr. Trump is handling his job as president, and 58% said they believe he has made the economy worse since he took office.",
      "Polling of Latino voters that was used to brief national Democratic officials during the Democratic National Committee's summer meeting in Minnesota in August contained similar sentiments. The surveys, which were conducted by BSP Research in November, April and June, indicated Mr. Trump's approval was heavily net negative, and by June had become slightly more so, compared to April, after his first 100 days in office.",
      "According to that polling, more Latinos said immigration reform was important to them in June, compared to November 2024, around the presidential election. Then, they ranked it as their sixth-most important issue, but in June, immigration reform was their second-most important, trailing only their concern about the cost of living and inflation. Since President Trump took office, his administration has cracked down on immigrants it says are here illegally, and recently, the Department of Homeland Security said it was on pace to deport 600,000 undocumented immigrants by the end of the year.",
      "By June, the vast majority of the respondents said they were closely following the Trump administration's immigration actions, and almost half reported that they feared being deported, and they feared family members or friends could also be deported.",
      "Latino voters have been consistent about their top issue, the economy, Democratic officials learned. It was their top issue in November and that was still the case in June. At that time, they viewed the economy as bad and worried it was getting worse. Just under a fifth of Latino Trump voters said it was possible or likely that he and Republicans would lose their support.",
      "\"Latinos trusted him, believed him when they gave him their votes in 2024 when he promised that he was going to bring down the cost of groceries, gas and rent,\" said Democratic strategist\u00a0 Maria Cardona.",
      "But the polling presented to Democrats also found that Latinos' fears about Mr. Trump's economy did not seem to be translating into support for Democrats \u2014 by April, they still had not made major gains among these voters.",
      "\"Democrats need to talk about what they will do for Latinos, not just how horrendous Donald Trump and Republicans have been,\" Cardona said. \"Democrats need to lead with 'this is what we will do for you, here is how we will help you and your family live a better life,' which is again the reason why we all came to this country to begin with.\"",
      "Democrats and Republicans will have an opportunity to test their support in November's off-year elections in New Jersey and Virginia. In 2026, Republicans are counting on a high Latino voter turnout as they fight to hold on to the House majority next year.",
      "\"The Hispanic sentiment on the ground is we haven't seen the lower cost of energy, or food prices fast enough,\" said Jorge Martinez, strategic director of Libre, a national grassroots organization that mobilizes Latino voters.",
      "Martinez says it's too soon, however, to see the impact of economic policies under the One Big Beautiful Act that Republicans are rebranding as the \"Working Families Tax Cut\" law ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\"If Republicans can stay focused on creating progress, growth policies that bring more energy and lower cost of goods and services, I can see things getting better for Republicans, but they have to deliver on those results,\" said Martinez.",

    "story": [
      "The White House is asking nine U.S. universities to sign an agreement pledging to uphold the Trump administration's higher education priorities, or risk losing out on preferred access to federal funding.",
      "The demands are outlined in a nine-page document, title the \"Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,\" that asks schools to freeze their tuition rate for five years, ban the use of sex and gender as factors in their admissions process, and cap their international student numbers, among other requirements.",
      "Signatories also must commit to \"transforming or abolishing institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle and even spark violence against conservative ideas,\" according to the memo.",
      "According to a White House official, a letter outlining the plan and a copy of the agreement were sent on Wednesday to the University of Arizona, Brown University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Pennsylvania, University of Southern California, University of Texas, University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University.",
      "The official declined to say whether the Trump administration plans to make a similar offer to other colleges.",
      "The agreement was\u00a0first reported\u00a0by the Wall Street Journal. May Mailman, a senior adviser for special projects at the White House, told the paper that the Trump administration doesn't plan to limit funding only to institutions that agree to abide by the compact. However, schools that sign the agreement will be granted priority in receiving federal funding and engaging with White House officials.",
      "\"Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits,\" the agreement states.",
      "A copy of the letter sent to universities obtained by CBS News notes that schools that agree to the compact will receive \"allowance for increased overhead payments where feasible, substantial and meaningful federal grants, and other federal partnerships.\"",
      "The letter is signed by Mailman; Secretary of Education Linda McMahon; and Vince Haley, director of the White House's Domestic Policy Council. It asks for written comments from the universities by \"no later than October 20.\"",
      "\"After receiving feedback, schools that show clear alignment and a strong readiness to champion this effort will be invited to the White House to finalize language and be initial signatories,\" the letter says. \"We are aiming to have a signed agreement by no later than November 21, 2025.\"",
      "The Department of Education did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Prioritizing U.S. students",
      "A University of Virginia spokesperson said its interim president, Paul G. Mahoney, has created a working group to advise him on how to respond to the letter. \"The University has not yet made any decision regarding the compact,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The University of Southern California said it is reviewing the letter. MIT acknowledged receiving the material but declined to comment further. The other universities did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "In a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Thursday, the University of Pennsylvania chapter of the American Association of University Professors said the White House letter amounts to a threat.",
      "\"Penn must not allow itself to be threatened into ceding its self-determination,\" the group said. \"Whatever the consequences of refusal, agreeing would threaten the very mission of the university.\"",
      "The agreement places a cap on foreign student enrollment, which it states cannot exceed 15% of a university's undergraduate population. Also, no more than 5% of foreign students enrolled at a college can come from a single country.",
      "\"Universities that rely on foreign students to fund their institutions risk, among other things, potentially reducing spots available to deserving American students,\" the document states.",
      "The nine schools are also asked to freeze tuition for five years and to waive tuition for students pursuing \"hard science programs\" at institutions where the endowment exceeds $2 million per undergraduate student. Schools would not have to freeze tuition for students from \"families of exceptional means,\" under the agreement.",
      "The letter represents the latest attempt by the Trump administration to reshape the nation's higher education system. The administration has targeted high-profile universities in recent months, threatening to pull federal funding if they do not agree to certain concessions on combating antisemitism and changing their diversity practices.",
      "Columbia University in July agreed to pay the administration $200 million to resolve an investigation into alleged violations of anti-discrimination laws. The Trump administration earlier this year also suspended roughly $2 billion in federal funding earmarked for Harvard University over what the White House said was the school's failure to crack down on antisemitism on its campus. Last month, a federal judge ruled that the Harvard funding freeze was illegal.",

    "story": [
      "Federal officials have approved another generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, a regulatory formality that quickly triggered pushback from anti-abortion groups and politicians aligned with the Trump administration.",
      "Drugmaker Evita Solutions announced on its website that the Food and Drug Administration signed off on its low-cost form of the pill, which is approved to end pregnancies through 10 weeks. Evita Solutions is the second company to have an approved generic version of mifepristone. The first was from pharmaceutical company GenBioPro, approved in 2019.",
      "The move prompted backlash from some conservatives.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri criticized the move in a post on X, stating: \"I have lost confidence in the leadership at FDA.\"",
      "\"Anyone who tries to say their hands are tied has not been paying attention,\" Students for Life of America and Students for Life Action President Kristan Hawkins told CBS News. \"These drugs are dangerous, and this is a stain on the entire administration.\"",
      "Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in a statement Thursday, \"This reckless decision by the F.D.A. to expand the availability of abortion drugs is unconscionable.\"",
      "The criticism comes as President Trump's top health officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., face growing pressure from abortion opponents to reevaluate mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago and has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.",
      "In a statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told CBS News that the agency \"has very limited discretion in deciding whether to approve a generic drug\" and that \"by law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must approve an application if it demonstrates that the generic drug is identical to the brand-name drug.\"",
      "In a letter to Republican attorneys general last month, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary pledged to conduct a full review of the drug's safety.",
      "In their letter, Kennedy and Makary wrote, \"HHS \u2014 through the FDA \u2014 is conducting its own review of the evidence, including real-world outcomes and evidence, relating to the safety and efficacy of the drug.\"",
      "CBS News medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder said last month that the FDA is unlikely to withdraw approval, a rare move that would likely trigger lawsuits, but depending on the safety review, it could restrict access by limiting telehealth or mail delivery, or by narrowing who can prescribe the drug.",
      "On the campaign trail last year, Mr. Trump told CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns that he would not prevent access to mifepristone.",
      "In 2021, the FDA under Democratic President Joe Biden permitted online prescribing and mail-order delivery of the drug, greatly expanding access. Abortion opponents have been fighting the change ever since.",
      "Approval of generic drugs is typically a rote process at the FDA, with multiple copycat versions usually approved after the patent on the original drug expires. In most cases, generic drugmakers only need to show that their drug matches the ingredients and formula developed by the original drugmaker.",
      "The FDA typically approves such applications within 10 months. But filing documents posted to the FDA's website show that Evita Solutions filed its application to market mifepristone four years ago.",
      "The company did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "On its website, Evita states that it \"believes that all people should have access to safe, affordable, high-quality, effective, and compassionate abortion care.\"",
      "Approval of a second generic is unlikely to affect access to the pill, which is typically taken with another drug, misoprostol. The\u00a0majority\u00a0of women who terminate pregnancies do so through medication abortions. Mifepristone dilates the cervix and blocks the hormone progesterone, while misoprostol causes the uterus to cramp and contract.",
      "\"This is exactly how our system is supposed to work, and it has worked this way for decades,\" Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, said in a statement. \"The only reason this routine approval is making headlines is because anti-abortion politicians have turned health care into a political battlefield.\"",
      "Access to mifepristone is restricted across large sections of the country because of state laws that ban abortion \u2014 including medication abortion \u2014 or impose separate restrictions on the drug's use. Those laws are subject to a number of ongoing lawsuits that are winding their way through the legal system.",

      "Many Americans are eager to put money away for retirement, but that goal is increasingly out of reach because more workers are living paycheck to paycheck, a new Goldman Sachs study finds.",
      "Roughly 42% of younger working Americans \u2014 spanning Gen Z, millennials and Gen X \u2014 report having no spare savings after covering their basic living expenses, according to the analysis, which surveyed about 3,600 workers and 1,500 retirees. Among those just getting by, about three-quarters said they are struggling to save for retirement, the survey found.",
      "The share of U.S. workers in this precarious financial position has grown significantly since 1997, when 31% lived paycheck to paycheck, according to Goldman. The investment bank projects that figure could climb to well over half of Americans by 2033 as essentials like housing and health care continue to rise in cost.",
      "\"Save more\" ignores reality",
      "The findings underscore the challenges millions of Americans now face just making ends meets while also managing to set aside money for retirement, a financial pinch that Goldman Sachs calls a \"financial vortex.\" That money crunch helps explains why more than a quarter of older Americans are nearing retirement without anything saved \u2014 a gap that could widen given the financial pressures facing younger workers.",
      "\"These findings force us to ask a very critical question: Does the retirement math still work? The answer is no,\" said Greg Wilson, head of retirement at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in a conference call to discuss the report. \"Telling workers just to 'save more' ignores the realities they face.\"",
      "Skipping a latte or avocado toast isn't likely to make much of a dent in the financial dynamics facing workers today, with Goldman finding that basic expenses are consuming an ever growing share of people's after-tax income.",
      "For instance, homeownership now eats up 51% of income, up from 33% in 2000, while health care costs account for 16% of after-tax earnings, up from 10% a quarter century ago, the analysis found.",
      "\"The mounting challenges American workers face ... make it harder than ever to save for retirement,\" Wilson said.",
      "Such financial pressures come as many Americans are on their own to plan, and save for, their retirement, largely because of the shift in the 1980s from company-sponsored pensions to 401(k) plans.",
      "As a savings vehicle, 401(k) shifts the burden onto workers, who must decide how much to save, how to invest and how to draw down their money in retirement \u2014 a do-it-yourself approach that retirement experts such as Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at The New School for Social Research in New York,\u00a0describe as inadequate.",
      "Hoping for a miracle",
      "Financial professionals say it's no coincidence that members of Generation X, which entered the workforce just as the shift to 401(k)s became mainstream, is feeling unprepared as they get closer to retirement. Now 45 to 60 years old, almost half said they believed it would take a \"miracle\" for them to be able to retire, a Natixis study found last year.",
      "Goldman acknowledged that it can be difficult to close a retirement funding gap with savings alone, but noted that some strategies could help. Some approaches may be out of reach for older workers, like Gen X and millennials, but could be of use for their children \u2014 for instance, setting aside $500 a year from ages 1 to 20, a move Goldman found could increase retirement savings by 14%.",
      "Adding private market investments to a portfolio could also help boost retirement savings by 14% through higher returns, according to Goldman. Those strategies might become more accessible for workers under a Trump administration plan to open up 401(k)\u00a0plans to private equity, cryptocurrencies and other alternative investments.",
      "Lastly, if possible, workers should take advantage of benefits from their employers such as funding an emergency savings account, which can help them avoid raiding their 401(k) in case of an unexpected expense, such as medical bills, the bank notes.",
      "Even so, while those approaches might work for workers with access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, about half of all U.S. private-sector workers\u00a0lack access to such programs, an analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts found earlier this year. Although it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to an employer retirement plan said they struggled to build wealth, the Pew survey found.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 While President Trump billed the federal law enforcement surge in the nation's capital as an effort to crack down on violent crime, internal government data obtained by CBS News shows nearly 40% of over 3,500 arrests made since the operation began in early August were strictly immigration-related.",
      "The federal government statistics indicate that, as of Sept. 29, federal and local law enforcement officials assigned to the Trump administration's high-profile operation in Washington, D.C., had reported making just over 3,550 arrests.",
      "Nearly 1,400 of those arrests were counted as administrative arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, the federal agency spearheading Mr. Trump's mass deportation campaign. Those arrests involve immigrants ICE seeks to deport because of alleged civil violations of federal immigration law, like entering the U.S. illegally or overstaying a visa. It's unclear how many of those arrested by ICE had criminal histories in addition to their alleged civil immigration violations.",
      "The rest of the arrests, the data indicates, had a criminal nexus. The roughly 8-week-long operation has led to the arrest of 13 homicide suspects, nearly 500 narcotics arrests and about 300 firearms-related arrests. More than two dozen of the arrests involved individuals charged with sex-related crimes.",
      "Agents and officers deployed throughout the capital have also seized over 300 illegal guns and issued roughly 650 misdemeanor citations, plus more than 300 traffic citations, according to the data.",
      "The federal figures also suggest ICE agents have visited over 130 work sites in Washington. Those visits can be precursors to investigations into whether individuals are working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "In a statement to CBS News Thursday, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the \"focus of President Trump's highly successful DC operation has been to address crime committed by anyone, regardless of immigration status.\"",
      "\"Many of the illegal aliens arrested during this operation were committing crimes or had outstanding warrants and prior convictions for crimes like assault, DUIs, kidnapping, drug possession, and worse including an illegal alien who had a prior arrest for raping a child,\" Abigail Jackson added.",
      "A CBS News analysis of the first three weeks of the president's D.C. deployment showed that violent crime dropped by almost half when compared to the same 19 days in 2024.",
      "Although Mr. Trump's emergency order requiring local D.C. police to assist federal officials has expired, immigration and other federal agents continue to operate in the district. The Metropolitan Police Department has also kept a policy change from August that allows local police officers to share information with the federal immigration officials about individuals who are not in their custody. It also lets police officers transport federal immigration agents and detainees in their custody.",
      "As of Sept. 29, roughly 3,000 personnel from nearly two dozen federal and local agencies were deployed in Washington, including more than 1,300 National Guard troops and 250 agents from the Department of Homeland Security, the federal figures show. That includes nearly 200 personnel from Homeland Security Investigations and ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. More than 130 FBI agents and at least nine prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C. were deployed as part of the effort.",
      "When the city-wide \"crime emergency\" declared by Mr. Trump ended on Sept. 10, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced to reporters at a news conference that \"immigration enforcement is not what MPD does, and with the end of the emergency, it won't be what MPD does in the future.\"",
      "Asked for clarification on cooperation between D.C. police and immigration authorities on Tuesday, Bowser said, \"I am aware of what's been happening on the ground and ICE is not patrolling with MPD.\"",
      "A surge in Memphis",
      "A similar law enforcement surge is now underway in Memphis, Tennessee, where 650 personnel from 19 federal and state agencies are patrolling the streets. So far, multi-agency teams have made 93 arrests \u2014 including 69 criminal arrests for illegal firearms, drugs and sex offenses, according to U.S. government data analyzed by CBS News. But the task force has also conducted 24 civil immigration arrests.",
      "The deployment includes more than 100 agents dispatched by agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, including officials from HSI, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Federal Protective Services.",
      "Earlier this month, while flanked by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, Mr. Trump signed an order standing up a federal task force to send to Memphis, an effort he described as a \"replica\" of federal law enforcement efforts in D.C. According to a CBS News data team analysis, violent crime in Memphis is down 32% so far this year, compared to the same time period in 2024.",
      "Tennessee law requires local police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, including ICE, banning sanctuary policies statewide. Recent legislation mandates state and local police officers notify federal authorities if they encounter someone in the U.S. unlawfully. More than 20 agencies statewide now participate in what's known as ICE's 287(g) program, which is designed to deputize local officers to perform certain immigration enforcement functions and expand the federal government's immigration detention capacity.",
      "In Memphis, local leaders have said their focus is crime control, not acting as immigration agents, but state law leaves little room for discretion. Earlier this month, Mayor Paul Young acknowledged community concerns about the increased federal law enforcement, but vowed to use federal resources \"effectively and for the benefit of the residents of our great city.\"",
      "Lee Harris, the mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis, told CBS News he plans to declare an emergency to cover rising jail costs. The Trump administration's new mandate in Memphis has sparked concern from civil rights groups like the ACLU, who warn the crackdown risks sweeping up immigrants from traffic stops and other routine interactions with police, heightening fear for thousands of residents.",
      "What comes next",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has asked for as many as 1,000 National Guardsmen to deploy to his state. In a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday, the Republican leader requested troops to help \"supplement law enforcement presence in high-crime areas, provide logistical and communication support and secure critical infrastructure.\"",
      "Landry noted that cities like New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Shreveport have higher crime rates, a challenge compounded by a lack of law enforcement personnel.",
      "During a gathering of military leaders earlier this week, Mr. Trump suggested additional cities that he deemed \"unsafe,\" including Chicago, could see similar deployments of National Guard and military units.",
      "In the Chicago area, immigration officials have carried out over 900 arrests as part of an effort, dubbed Operation Midway Blitz, that started in early September, though the National Guard has not been involved so far. In Portland, federal officials have been dispatched to fortify an ICE facility after weeks of confrontations and protests outside the site.

      "\"I have a meeting today with Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame, to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social. \"I can't believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity. They are not stupid people, so maybe this is their way of wanting to, quietly and quickly, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "Vought wants to slash federal jobs and spending, and has worked to in the past",
      "As Mr. Trump suggested, Vought is leading the charge of cutting federal agencies and employees, a vision he's been trying to implement during the president's term thus far.",
      "\"You all know Russell Vought,\" the president said Tuesday. \"He's become very popular recently because he can trim the budget to a level that you couldn't do any other way. So they're taking a risk by having a shutdown, because, because of the shutdown, we can do things medically and other ways, including benefits. We can cut large numbers of people.\"",
      "Vought has also sought to claw back congressionally authorized federal spending through rescissions.",
      "Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said Thursday on Fox News that Vought has been \"dreaming about this moment, preparing for this moment since puberty.\"",
      "Vought told Fox Business this week that \"there are all manner of authorities to be able to keep this administration's policy agenda moving forward, and that includes reducing the size and scope of the government, and we will be looking for opportunities to do that.\"",
      "Vought is freezing or cutting funding in blue states during the shutdown",
      "On Wednesday, Vought announced the administration will cancel $8 billion in climate-related projects in 16 states. All of the states voted for then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and have Democrats in the Senate.",
      "\"Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda is being cancelled,\" he wrote on X Wednesday.",
      "Vought also announced the administration is withholding $18 billion in funding for two infrastructure projects in New York City, a city represented by the two Democratic leaders in Congress.",
      "\"Roughly $18 billion in New York City infrastructure projects have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles,\" Vought wrote on X.",
      "The Department of Transportation specifically mentioned Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries in announcing the funding freeze, blaming them for the government shutdown.",
      "Vought is one of the authors of Project 2025",
      "As the president highlighted, Vought is one of the co-authors of Project 2025 the Trump-aligned Heritage Foundation's ultra-conservative policy blueprint for a Republican administration.",
      "Vought is responsible for writing a key chapter in the 900-page document on the executive office of the president, arguing agencies should carry out the president's agenda and that the president should restrict the autonomy of agencies' bureaucratic experts.",
      "Vought was also the vice president of Heritage Action, Heritage's lobbying arm.",
      "Vought was part of the first Trump administration",
      "Vought was also in leadership at OMB during Mr. Trump's first term, serving as both its deputy director and director.",
      "Vought attended Wheaton College, a Christian liberal arts school, for his bachelor's degree, and George Washington University for his law degree.",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Oct 2025 15:06:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Christa Gail Pike, 49, will become the first woman put to death in Tennessee in more than 200 years if her execution proceeds next September.",
    "story": [
      "If Christa Gail Pike's execution proceeds as planned next year, she will become the first woman put to death in Tennessee since the state began to formally document capital punishment more than a century ago. After attempted appeals by Pike's attorneys repeatedly failed, the Tennessee Supreme Court on Tuesday set a date for her to be executed.",
      "The order\u00a0granted a scheduling request from the state for the death warrant to be carried out Sept. 30, 2026, at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville, which houses a majority of Tennessee's death row inmates. Under the terms of this week's state Supreme Court order, the prison warden is obligated to notify Pike of the method that the Department of Correction will use to execute her by Aug. 28.",
      "Condemned inmates in Tennessee usually die by lethal injection, the state's default execution method. But electrocution, while outdated, is technically also authorized as an alternative that inmates can \"choose\" as long as they committed a capital crime before Jan. 1, 1999. As reports increased of botched executions using lethal drugs\u00a0in Tennessee and elsewhere around the United States, the Tennessee Correction Department said five inmates between 2018 and 2019 selected electrocution as their preferred execution method.",
      "Pike's death sentence",
      "Now 49, Pike was convicted in the horrific 1995 murder of Colleen Slemmer. Both were students at a career training program for troubled teenagers in Knoxville when Slemmer was tortured and brutally killed, according to court documents. Prosecutors argued in their case against Pike, then 18, that she had believed Slemmer, then 19, had wanted to steal Pike's boyfriend.",
      "The boyfriend, Tadaryl Shipp, and Pike's friend Shadolla Peterson helped her carry out the murder, according to court records, which say Pike cut Slemmer with a box cutter and carved a pentagram onto her chest over the course of 30 minutes or an hour, in a wooded part of the University of Tennessee's campus. The slain teenager's body was discovered by a groundskeeper who \"testified that the body was so badly beaten that he had first mistaken it for the corpse of an animal,\" the court records say.",
      "Shipp, who was 17 at the time of Slemmer's murder and not eligible for the death penalty, received a lifetime prison sentence and will be up for parole in November. Peterson testified against Pike during the trial and received probation.",
      "Pike was the youngest person on death row when she received her sentence in 1996, at 20. She has also been the only woman on Tennessee's death row for most of her three decades behind bars \u2014 circumstances that her attorneys likened to solitary confinement\u00a0in a lawsuit\u00a0that argued the punishment was unconstitutional. The suit led to a settlement in September 2024 allowing Pike more opportunities for social interaction.",
      "Fewer than 50 women on death row",
      "The U.S. has executed 18 women since the modern application of death penalty began in 1976, with the most recent being Amber McLaughlin's lethal injection in Missouri in January 2023, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit organization that shares data on capital punishment but doesn't take a position on it.",
      "While the Tennessee Department of Correction says no definitive records exist of executions that took place in the state before 1900, a collection of\u00a0widely cited independent research\u00a0on capital punishment in early America shows that Tennessee hasn't put a woman to death since 1820.",
      "Among roughly 2,100 inmates currently awaiting execution nationwide, just 48 are women, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, which published the results of an academic\u00a0study that found most of them experienced gender-based violence prior to their convictions and that gender bias impacted nearly all of their cases. The organization says public perspectives appear to have changed in recent decades, as only three women have been sentenced to death anywhere in the U.S. since 2020.",
      "Appeals, clemency petition",
      "In petitions seeking clemency or a commuted sentence, Pike's attorneys have consistently pointed to the unlikelihood of her receiving a death sentence for the same crime had she committed it as a teenager in the present day. Their\u00a0filings cite her history of mental illnesses, including PTSD and bipolar disorder, congenital brain damage, childhood sexual abuse, abandonment and neglect, noting that evidence of those issues wasn't presented at Pike's trial.",
      "\"Society's view of who is truly deserving of a death sentence has changed in the years since Christa Pike was sentenced,\" Robin Maher, the Death Penalty Information Center's executive director, told CBS News. \"Her young age, mental illness, and the physical and mental abuse she suffered at the time of her crime would likely persuade a jury today she is not someone who should receive a death sentence.\"",
      "Juries are currently sentencing fewer young people to death than they once did, according to the center, which says only three states that still practice the death penalty have imposed new death sentences on a person between 18 and 20 in the last five years.",

      "Earhart was attempting to become the first female pilot to circle the world when she and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared over the Pacific Ocean on July 2, 1937. Earhart, Noonan and their plane, an Electra 10E, were never found. Recently, President Trump ordered records related to Earhart be declassified.",
      "In 2020, researchers looking at satellite imagery identified a \"visual anomaly\" known as the Taraia Object in a lagoon on Nikumaroro, a small island in Kiribati about halfway between Australia and Hawaii, according to a news release from Purdue University. Nikumaroro is about 400 miles southeast of Howland Island, Earhart and Noonan's planned destination.",
      "The underwater object has been visible in photos dating back to 1938, the year after Earhart and Noonan disappeared.",
      "A team of researchers from Purdue University, the Purdue Research Foundation and the Archaeological Legacy Institute will travel to Nikumaroro to inspect the object in November. The team will first take photos and videos of the site, then use magnetometers and sonar devices to scan the area. Then, the item will be dredged and lifted from the water so researchers can attempt to identify it.",

      "Theories have abounded about Earhart and Noonan's fates since their disappearance. One theory suggests that Earhart landed on Nikumaroro and was marooned on the island before her death. The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, a nonprofit organization based in Pennsylvania, has\u00a0collected evidence\u00a0it says supports the theory. Richard Pettigrew, the executive director of the Archaeological Legacy Institute, said that the expedition offers a chance to find \"smoking-gun proof\" that confirms the theory.",
      "''We gathered up many more satellite images, did historical research, found other imagery that relates to it,\" Pettrigrew said. \"We're going to go look and identify it. And if we're right, we'll in fact identify the lost Electra. We could be wrong but I think the evidence is very, very strong that this is, in fact what it is.''",
      "However, Ric Gillespie, executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, has expressed skepticism. \"We've looked there in that spot, and there's nothing there,\" he told NBC News in July.",
      "Steve Schultz, a Purdue senior vice president and the university's general counsel, will be a field assistant on the expedition. He said that if the object is identified as Earhart's plane, the university hopes it can transport the plane home. Earhart worked at Purdue University for two years in the 1930s, and the Purdue Research Foundation originally paid for the airplane that Earhart flew, the school said. She planned to return the craft to the university after her trip around the world.",
      "\"A successful identification would be the first step toward fulfilling Amelia's original plan to return the Electra to West Lafayette after her historic flight,\" Schultz said in the news release.",
      "Last year, an expedition team captured a sonar image in the Pacific Ocean that appeared to resemble Earhart's plane resting at the bottom of the sea. It turned out\u00a0 to be a rock formation.",

      "Among the fundraisers that have cropped up in the wake of the deadly mass shooting at a Michigan church last weekend, one aims to raise money not for the victims but, instead, for family members of the accused shooter.",
      "The organizer, David Butler, says he is not a member of the Grand Blanc Township ward of the Chuch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but is an \"ordinary member\" of the LDS church. Butler wrote that 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, who police have identified as the shooter, is leaving \"behind a wife and children who must be grieving,\" and that \"one of the Sanford sons deals with serious medical challenges that require ongoing care, treatment, and specialized support.\"",
      "The\u00a0deadly church attack in Grand Blanc, Michigan\u00a0killed four people and left at least eight others injured. Sanford drove his pickup truck through the front doors of the church, exited his vehicle and opened fire with an assault-style rifle\u00a0at around 100 churchgoers, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said. Officials say he then set the church building on fire.",
      "Sanford also died following an exchange of fire with police, Renye said. Based on conversations with the FBI director, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday the attacker was \"an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith.\"",
      "Despite that, Butler described Sanford's family as victims of the attack as well, saying the Biblical book of James \"teaches us that 'Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction.' The purpose of this GiveSendGo is to do that.\"",
      "The fundraiser, hosted by GiveSendGo, had raised $285,000 as of early Thursday afternoon against a stated goal of $500,000. The comments left by those donating money indicate many are also members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",
      "\"We have been taught to be peacemakers and pray that your family is blessed and watched over during this difficult time,\" one anonymous donor wrote. \"May you feel the love of the Savior surrounding you always. You are beloved children of God.\"",
      "The Detroit Free Press reports that the shooter's family was initially wary of the fundraiser, thinking it might even be someone impersonating the family, but eventually came around.",
      "\"It took my breath away, that this church is so forgiving and understanding and caring,\" Sanford's sister Katie Hamilton told the paper.",

      "Washington \u2014 An immigration judge in Maryland declined to reopen the immigration case involving Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported to his home country earlier this year and then brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers had asked an immigration judge in August to reopen the proceedings and allow him to seek asylum in the United States. While the bid was denied, Abrego Garcia can appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Abrego Garcia's final order of removal stands.",
      "\"His lawyers tried to fight his removal from the U.S. but one thing is certain, this Salvadoran man is not going to be able to remain in our country. He will never be allowed to prey on innocent Americans again,\" the department said in a post to social media.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, had been living in Maryland for more than a decade with his wife and children when he was first taken into federal immigration custody in March and deported to El Salvador. But an immigration judge in 2019 had granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal, a legal status that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his home country because of likely persecution by local gangs.",
      "A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., though the Department of Homeland Security resisted doing so for weeks. But in early June, Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. after a federal grand jury indicted him on two counts of human smuggling.",
      "He pleaded not guilty to both counts, and in July, a federal judge overseeing his criminal case ordered him to be released on bond while awaiting trial. But he remained detained for several weeks because of concerns that Abrego Garcia would be swiftly taken into immigration custody following his release and deported.",

    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Oct 2025 11:05:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion each week, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The fight over funding the government is likely to be a costly one.",
      "Each week of the ongoing government shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion and reduce GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, according to an estimate published by EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. That cost is a function of reduced pay for federal employees, delayed government procurement of goods and a decline in demand.",
      "To some extent, a portion of that economic cost would be reversed when the government reopens, as furloughed employees receive back pay and economic activity increases, the analysis said.",
      "It's likely that not everything would be reversible, though. The last shutdown \u2014 which was during President Trump's first term and lasted 34 days, beginning in December 2018 and ending in January 2019 \u2014 cost the U.S. economy about $11 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "During that shutdown, the longest on record, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that real gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2018 took a $3 billion hit (in 2019 dollars). And it estimated that in the first quarter of 2019, real GDP was \"$8 billion lower than it would have been \u2014 an effect reflecting both the five-week partial shutdown and the resumption in economic activity once funding resumed.\"",
      "The shutdown could shake Americans' faith in the economy, too. EY-Parthenon notes that at the time, the 2019 shutdown led to the sharpest monthly drop in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index up since 2012.",
      "Some of the shutdown costs also stem from the administrative effort necessary to create contingency plans when the government is shut down and reopened. Agencies lose user fees collected from visitors to the national parks or from people seeking certain federal permits or visas. And there are higher premiums in federal contracting during a shutdown and the back pay federal employees eventually receive when the government reopens.",
      "Current federal law requires that federal workers be paid at their regular rate, whether they're furloughed or not, once the government is operating again. In a new analysis cited by the White House, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal government will pay $400 million a day for furloughed employees, who will not be working during the shutdown.",
      "A September 2019 report from a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee estimated the last three government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 \"cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion \u2014 at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed federal workers, and at least $338 million in other costs associated with the shutdowns, including extra administrative work, lost revenue, and late fees on interest payments.\"",
      "The White House Office of Management and Budget estimated that during the 16-day shutdown of 2013, federal employees received $2.5 billion in pay and benefits for hours they did not work, plus $10 million in penalty interest payments and lost fees.",
      "2025 shutdown",
      "But this time may be different. President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Russell Vought, the OMB director, say layoffs will happen soon if the shutdown continues, so the net fiscal impact of a shutdown to the federal government is a little harder to predict right now. Vought immediately began freezing or slashing federal funding for projects, largely in blue states, during the shutdown. The Trump administration is withholding $18 billion in infrastructure projects in New York City, and cutting funding for climate-related projects in many states that Kamala Harris won.",
      "Vought also told Republican lawmakers Wednesday that Reduction in Force \u2014 or RIF \u2014 cuts would begin in two days.",
      "The president said Tuesday \"a lot of good can come down from shutdowns,\" and suggested Vought could use the shutdown to permanently cut federal workers and programs the administration doesn't want but that have the backing of Democrats.",
      "\"We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible for them, that are bad for them and irreversible by them,\" Mr. Trump said of Democrats. \"Like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.\"",

      "Job cuts could surpass more than 1 million in 2025, the group forecast. The layoffs this year, although elevated, remain well below the massive workforce reductions in 2020, when the pandemic shuttered businesses across the nation, leading to 2 million layoffs through September of that year, Challenger noted.",
      "The rise in layoffs comes as the labor market has stalled in recent months, with employers also sharply scaling back their hiring plans, according to labor data. Companies now expect to bring on 58% fewer workers for the rest of the year compared with their projections a year ago, the firm found.",
      "\"Previous periods with this many job cuts occurred either during recessions or, as was the case in 2005 and 2006, during the first wave of automations that cost jobs in manufacturing and technology,\" said Andy Challenger, senior vice president and labor expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, in a statement.",
      "The government shutdown could lead to more job cuts, with the White House Office of Management and Budget last week\u00a0telling federal agencies\u00a0to consider layoffs during a closure.",
      "The report comes as the monthly government jobs report, scheduled to be released on Oct. 3, is likely to be delayed due to this week's\u00a0government shutdown. Economists are forecasting that employers added 50,000 jobs last month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "In the absence of the government's monthly jobs report, other measures of the labor market's health are drawing more attention from economists. On Wednesday, ADP said that payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "However, some signs suggest that the pace of layoffs is easing, with Challenger's data showing that businesses announced roughly 54,000 job cuts in September, a 37% drop from the nearly 86,000 cuts announced in August.",
      "The Federal Reserve is monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing the headwinds facing workers as the primary reason the central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by\u00a00.25 percentage points. The Fed is penciling in two additional rate cuts for the remainder of 2025.",
      "A decline in borrowing costs for businesses and consumers could help bolster the job market, Challenger said. As interest rates fall, businesses have more flexibility to expand and hire more workers.",
      "\"Right now, we're dealing with a stagnating labor market, cost increases and a transformative new technology. With rate cuts on the way, we may see some stabilizing in the job market in the fourth quarter, but other factors could keep employers planning layoffs or holding off hiring,\" Challenger said.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration said Wednesday that it is freezing roughly $18 billion in federal funding for a pair of New York City infrastructure projects, targeting the home state of both Democratic congressional leaders on the first day of the government shutdown.",
      "Russ Vought, head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, announced the freeze in a post on X, saying funding for the Hudson Tunnel Project and Second Avenue Subway would be halted pending a review that will be delayed due to furloughs during the funding lapse.",
      "New York is home to both Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and the Department of Transportation linked the leaders to the project freeze in its announcement.",

      "In a\u00a0statement, the Transportation Department said the infrastructure projects are \"under administrative review to determine whether any unconstitutional practices are occurring.\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, the statement said, believes \"subsidizing infrastructure contracts with taxpayer dollars based on discriminatory principles is unconstitutional, counter to civil rights laws, and a waste of taxpayer resources.\"",
      "\"The department is focusing on these projects because they are arguably the largest infrastructure initiatives in the western hemisphere, and the American people want to see them completed quickly and efficiently,\" DOT said. \"Until USDOT's quick administrative review is complete, project reimbursements cannot be processed, including a $300 million disbursement for the 2nd Avenue Subway.\"",
      "The department said the remaining federal funding for the projects is roughly $18 billion.",
      "\"Thanks to the Chuck Schumer and Hakeem [Jeffries] shutdown, however, USDOT's review of New York's unconstitutional practices will take more time.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pfizer has agreed to offer significantly discounted prices for some prescription drugs for all American consumers and has committed to offer prescription medications to Medicaid at lower prices, President Trump announced Tuesday. The president said the drugs will be available for purchase online on a website operated by the federal government, which the White House has said will be called \"TrumpRx.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was in the Oval Office with the president for the announcement, said Mr. Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the U.S. motivated his company to take swift action. The president said Pfizer's drug prices will be lower starting \"immediately.\"",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%. Mr. Trump said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced 'most favored nation' cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House has released specific drug prices yet.",
      "Some health policy experts cautioned that pricing details are still unclear and the impact for consumers may be limited.",
      "Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out that Medicaid's prices are already lower than average in the U.S.",
      "\"Medicaid already enjoys 'best-price' protection in the sense that they receive the lowest prices charged to any commercial payer in the United States. Therefore, we are starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" he told CBS News.",
      "And those patients have been benefiting, says Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Program on Medicare Policy at\u00a0KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization: \"It is still very unclear how the price reductions announced today will lower costs directly for many people, since people on Medicaid typically don't pay large amounts out of pocket for drugs.\"",
      "Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, said: \"The direct-to-patient stuff is, in my view, a sideshow and branding opportunity for Trump. Most patients have drug coverage. \u2026 Very few are going to buy medications with cash, unless the drug is not a covered benefit, like weight loss or erectile dysfunction drugs.\"",
      "Bourla called it a \"historic day\" because the agreement would be reversing an \"unfair situation.\"",
      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on\u00a0drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs. He threatened to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they failed to do so.",
      "Monday was the deadline for drugmakers to reach agreements to bring down drug costs, the Post reported, after the president's May executive order. While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population and uses about 13% of the world's prescription drugs, the U.S. funds over 70% of global pharmaceutical profits, according to the White House.",
      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "Bourla mentioned the impending tariffs in his comments Tuesday, saying the tariffs had motivated his company. He said the Mr. Trump gave Pfizer a three-year grace period on the tariffs, and the tariffs would be inapplicable, as long as Pfizer manufactures in the U.S. As a part of the agreement, Bourla said Pfizer agreed to move their production of medicines used in America to the U.S.",
      "\"The president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President,\" Bourla said. \"And clearly motivated ours, right?\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said the tariffs had \"played a big role\" in the deal.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall. Mr. Trump echoed that point, saying other companies are on board, too.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C.,\" said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRx\" website have not yet been shared, but a senior administration official expected the website to be live in early 2026.",
      "The announcement comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

      "Police also arrested two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. No other details were immediately released about them.",
      "Police said the attacker was shot by firearms officers and later died. The attacker wore a vest that looked like it contained an explosive device, Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Stephen Watson told reporters. Police later said the device was deemed to be not viable. A bomb disposal unit was deployed to the scene. Police said there was a loud noise as investigators gained entry to the attacker's vehicle, but that there was no risk to the public.",
      "Earlier, Watson had described the two deceased victims as members of the area's Jewish community, but he didn't identify them. Police later said all the victims were men. One of the injured victims was stabbed, another was hit by the attacker's car, and a third may have been hurt as police stopped the attacker, police said.",
      "\"I'm Jewish and absolutely terrified,\" Vicky, who lives near the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Manchester and didn't want to provide her last name, told the Reuters news agency. \"It's just absolutely frightening because I'm scared for my own safety and my mom's safety.\"",
      "Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the government increased security at synagogues across the country.",
      "\"We will do whatever is required to keep our Jewish community safe,\" Mahmood told reporters in Manchester. \"To those who seek to divide us, they will fail.\"",
      "The attacker drove directly at people outside the synagogue and then attacked people with a knife, Watson said. The attack happened while a large group of worshippers was inside the synagogue.",
      "\"Thanks to the immediate bravery of security staff and the worshippers inside as well as the fast response of the police, the attacker was prevented from gaining access,\" Watson said.",
      "The worshippers inside the synagogue were safe, he said.",
      "\"Today we have witnessed a vile attack on our Jewish community on its holiest day,\" Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester, said in a statement. \"We condemn whoever is responsible and will do everything within our power to keep people safe. We stand with GM's [Greater Manchester's] Jewish community at this time and will work through the day to support them.\"",
      "Police said officers were called to the synagogue at about 9.30 a.m. local time (4:30 a.m. ET) by a member of the public who said he'd witnessed a car being driven toward members of the public.",
      "\"Shots were fired by Greater Manchester Police firearms officers at 9:38 a.m.,\" just minutes after the incident was reported, police said. \"One man has been shot, believed to be the offender.\"",
      "London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the capital city's Metropolitan Police Service would be \"stepping up high-visibility policing in and around synagogues in London.\"",
      "\"I know, as it is, Jewish people have been scared and feeling scared over the last few months, indeed, since October the 7th, 2023,\" Khan said. \"I also know many want to go to the synagogue and worship. I want to reassure them that in London, they will be seeing additional police officers. People should be allowed to go about and practice their faith knowing they're going to be safe. Unfortunately, too many Jewish Londoners, Jewish people across the country, Jewish people across the globe, don't feel that way. And that's heartbreaking.\"",
      "King Charles III said in a statement that he and Queen Camilla were \"deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the horrific attack in Manchester, especially on such a significant day for the Jewish community. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this appalling incident and we greatly appreciate the swift actions of the emergency services.\"",

    "story": [
      "Researchers from Purdue University are set to travel to the South Pacific to determine if a \"visual anomaly\" on a remote island is the wreck of Amelia Earhart's lost plane, saying there is \"very strong\" evidence the object is the iconic aviator's aircraft.",
      "Earhart was attempting to become the first female pilot to circle the world when she and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared over the Pacific Ocean on July 2, 1937. Earhart, Noonan and their plane, an Electra 10E, were never found. Recently, President Trump ordered records related to Earhart be declassified.",
      "In 2020, researchers looking at satellite imagery identified a \"visual anomaly\" known as the Taraia Object in a lagoon on Nikumaroro, a small island in Kiribati about halfway between Australia and Hawaii, according to a news release from Purdue University. Nikumaroro is about 400 miles southeast of Howland Island, Earhart and Noonan's planned destination.",
      "The underwater object has been visible in photos dating back to 1938, the year after Earhart and Noonan disappeared.",
      "A team of researchers from Purdue University, the Purdue Research Foundation and the Archaeological Legacy Institute will travel to Nikumaroro to inspect the object in November. The team will first take photos and videos of the site, then use magnetometers and sonar devices to scan the area. Then, the item will be dredged and lifted from the water so researchers can attempt to identify it.",
      "A mystery 88 years in the making! \ud83d\udd0ePurdue joins the Archaeological Legacy Institute in a South Pacific expedition to search for Amelia Earhart\u2019s missing Lockheed Electra airplane. https://t.co/WqEEWi6XwA",
      "Theories have abounded about Earhart and Noonan's fates since their disappearance. One theory suggests that Earhart landed on Nikumaroro and was marooned on the island before her death. The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, a nonprofit organization based in Pennsylvania, has\u00a0collected evidence\u00a0it says supports the theory. Richard Pettigrew, the executive director of the Archaeological Legacy Institute, said that the expedition offers a chance to find \"smoking-gun proof\" that confirms the theory.",
      "''We gathered up many more satellite images, did historical research, found other imagery that relates to it,\" Pettrigrew said. \"We're going to go look and identify it. And if we're right, we'll in fact identify the lost Electra. We could be wrong but I think the evidence is very, very strong that this is, in fact what it is.''",
      "However, Ric Gillespie, executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, has expressed skepticism. \"We've looked there in that spot, and there's nothing there,\" he told NBC News in July.",
      "Steve Schultz, a Purdue senior vice president and the university's general counsel, will be a field assistant on the expedition. He said that if the object is identified as Earhart's plane, the university hopes it can transport the plane home. Earhart worked at Purdue University for two years in the 1930s, and the Purdue Research Foundation originally paid for the airplane that Earhart flew, the school said. She planned to return the craft to the university after her trip around the world.",
      "\"A successful identification would be the first step toward fulfilling Amelia's original plan to return the Electra to West Lafayette after her historic flight,\" Schultz said in the news release.",
      "Last year, an expedition team captured a sonar image in the Pacific Ocean that appeared to resemble Earhart's plane resting at the bottom of the sea. It turned out\u00a0 to be a rock formation.",

    "summary": "Israel says Gaza flotilla activists, including Greta Thunberg, are safe and being transferred to Israel after their boats were intercepted at sea.",
    "story": [
      "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 Israeli navy forces boarded most of the vessels and detained dozens of activists and a number of European lawmakers aboard a flotilla attempting to break Israel's blockade of Gaza on Thursday, drawing condemnation from around the world. The organizers of the Global Sumud Flotilla said one boat had managed to sail on but stopped near Gaza's coast on Thursday morning before contact with the vessel was lost.",
      "The flotilla organizers said 39 of their boats were intercepted \u2014 or assumed intercepted as communication with the activists was lost \u2014 in an Israeli operation that began the night before. Israel's foreign ministry said the activists from the boats, including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, were safe and being transferred to Israel.",
      "In a social media post, the foreign ministry said the activists and their boats were \"making their way safely and peacefully to Israel, where their deportation procedures to Europe will begin. The passengers are safe and in good health.\"",
      "The Global Sumud Flotilla, composed of nearly 50 boats and 500 activists, was trying to carry a symbolic amount of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The group, which includes Nelson Mandela's grandson, Mandla Mandela, former Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau and several European lawmakers, said earlier that it remained undeterred in its mission to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza and bring aid to Palestinians.",
      "Greg Stoker, an American military veteran aboard the Ohwayla, one of the boats in the flotilla, said that around a dozen Israeli naval vessels with their transponders off had approached it early Thursday.",
      "\"They are currently hailing our vessels, telling us to turn off our engines and await further instructions or our boats will be seized and we will face the consequences,\" he said in a shaky video posted on Instagram. Israeli authorities used water cannons against some of the boats, Stoker and other activists reported on social media.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry posted a video on X showing Thunberg sitting on a ship's deck being handed a water bottle and raincoat.",
      "Italy's Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told Italian TV network RAI that the boats would be towed to Israel's port of Ashdod and the activists would be deported in the coming days. He also said Israeli forces have been told \"not to use violence.\"",
      "Some of the flotilla's vessels came under attack by drones while docked off Tunisia, and then later while sailing near Greece. The drone strikes sparked fires on two of the boats in Tunisian waters, according to the flotilla organizers, and Tunisian authorities confirmed they were investigating at least one attack as a \"deliberate act.\"",
      "Neither Tunisia nor Greece has accused anyone of being responsible for the drone attacks.",
      "The Israeli military never responded to CBS News requests for comment on the incidents.",
      "Israel draws condemnation for intercepting Gaza flotilla",
      "Turkey's Foreign Ministry condemned Israel's interception of the boats denouncing it as an \"act of terrorism\" and severe breach of international law. In a statement, the ministry said it was taking initiatives to ensure the immediate release of Turkish citizens and other passengers detained by the Israeli forces.",
      "Colombia President Gustavo Petro said late Wednesday he would expel Israel's diplomatic delegation in the South American country if the Israeli military intercepted the flotilla. He said he will also terminate his country's free trade agreement with Israel.",
      "Petro has repeatedly described Israel's siege of Gaza as genocide. He broke diplomatic ties with Israel in May 2024 over the Israel-Hamas war, prompting the departure of Ambassador Gali Dagan, but an unspecified number of consular services staff remain in Colombia.",
      "Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim also condemned the interception of the flotilla, saying Israeli forces had detained eight Malaysians.",
      "\"By blocking a humanitarian mission, Israel has shown utter contempt not only for the rights of the Palestinian people but also for the conscience of the world,\" Anwar, whose country is predominantly Muslim, said in a statement, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "European governments, including Spain and Italy, which had sent their navy ships to escort the flotilla during part of its journey, urged the activists to turn back and avoid confrontation. But while Italy's Premier Giorgia Meloni said late Tuesday the flotilla's actions risked undermining President Trump's recent proposal for resolving the war in Gaza, Spain's prime minister defended them.",
      "\"We must remember it is a humanitarian mission that wouldn't be taking place if the Israeli government had allowed for the entry of aid,\" Pedro S\u00e1nchez told reporters on Wednesday. Spaniards taking part would benefit from full diplomatic protection, he added.",
      "\"They present no threat nor danger to Israel,\" he said.",
      "Spain's government summoned the top Israeli diplomat in the country for discussions about the interceptions on Thursday.",
      "\"We are very concerned about the situation with the Sumud flotilla, we are in touch with the families of a number of British nationals involved,\" Britain's foreign office said in a statement. \"The aid carried by the flotilla should be turned over to humanitarian organizations on the ground to be delivered safely into Gaza.\"",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed that Mandla Mandela was among those on the vessels, and he denounced their interception as evidence of Israeli violations of international law and demanded the immediate release of all of the flotilla \"abductees.\"",
      "Flotilla boats intercepted as they enter \"danger zone\" approaching Gaza",
      "The vessels were sailing in international waters north of Egypt and had entered what activists and others called a \"danger zone.\" While still in international waters, it is an area where the Israeli navy has stopped other boats attempting to break its blockade in the past and which the flotilla has been warned not to cross.",
      "After a tense encounter with two Israeli military vessels in the early hours of Wednesday, activists had resumed their journey and were broadcasting their voyage on livestreams from several of the boats. Some activists held up messages of solidarity with people in Gaza and chanted \"Free Palestine!\" on camera. Music could be heard playing in the background.",
      "As night fell, they detected via radar several unidentified vessels approaching them and put their life vests on ahead of the Israeli military's imminent arrival. Some activists were able to broadcast the moment Israeli forces approached them live from their smartphones before tossing their devices into the water.",
      "The flotilla, which began its journey from the Spanish port of Barcelona a month ago, was to reach the shores of Gaza by Thursday morning, organizers had said earlier.",
      "Activists had acknowledged that scenario was unlikely and were expecting Israeli authorities to try to stop them at any moment, as they have done in past attempts.",
      "But this flotilla, with dozens of boats, was the largest attempt yet to break the Israeli maritime blockade of the Gaza strip that has been ongoing for 18 years.",
      "The Israeli navy had reached out to the flotilla earlier Wednesday warning them that they were approaching an \"active combat zone\" and asking them to change course, the Israeli foreign ministry said, reiterating its offer to transfer the aid to Gaza through other channels. Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called the flotilla a provocation.",
      "Israel's government has accused some of the flotilla members of being linked to Hamas, while providing little evidence to support the claim. Activists have strongly rejected the accusations and said Israel was trying to justify potential attacks on them.",
      "The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea stipulates that a state only has jurisdiction up to 12 nautical miles from its shores. In general, states don't have the right to seize ships in international waters, though armed conflict is an exception to this.",
      "Yuval Shany, an expert on international law at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said that as long as Israel's blockade of Gaza is \"militarily justified\" \u2014 meant to keep out weapons \u2014 and the ship intended to break the siege, Israel can intercept the vessel after prior warning. Whether the blockade is militarily justified and the legality of the blockade is a point of contention.",
      "But the flotilla argues they are a civilian, unarmed group and that the passage of humanitarian aid is guaranteed in international law.",
      "Omer Shatz, an Israeli international law expert who teaches at Sciences Po University in Paris and co-litigated a previous flotilla case before the Israeli supreme court, told The Associated Press that even if the disputed siege of Gaza was considered lawful, \"international law paves a humanitarian road from the high seas to Gaza \u2014 both in international and national waters off Gaza,\" he said.",
      "\"If the basic needs of the population are not provided by the occupying power, there is a right to provide humanitarian aid, albeit under certain conditions,\" Shatz said. Israel, for example, would have a right to board and search the vessels carrying aid to verify its cargo, similarly to what it does with aid trucks crossing into Gaza by land.",

      "Since then, scientists have been sifting through the data collected by Cassini, revealing that the ocean has many of the elements thought to be needed to host life, including salt, methane, carbon dioxide and phosphorus.",
      "When the spacecraft passed over the moon's south pole, it discovered jets of water bursting through cracks on the surface.",
      "These jets were propelling tiny ice particles \u2014 smaller than grains of sand \u2014 into space. While some of these ice grains fell back to the moon's surface, others collected around one of Saturn's many rings.",
      "When Cassini flew through Saturn's outermost \"E\" ring, it was \"detecting samples from Enceladus all the time,\" Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at the Free University of Berlin and lead author of the new study, said in a statement from the European Space agency.",
      "\"There are many possible pathways from the organic molecules we found in the Cassini data to potentially biologically relevant compounds, which enhances the likelihood that the moon is habitable,\" Nozair said.",
      "By looking through these samples, scientists had previously identified numerous organic molecules \u2014 including the precursors of amino acids, which are fundamental building blocks of life.",
      "But these ice grains could have been altered after being trapped in the ring for hundreds of years \u2014 or beaten up by blasts of cosmic radiation.",
      "So the scientists wanted to look at some fresh ice grains.",
      "Luckily, they already had access to some.",
      "When Cassini flew directly into the spray spewing from the moon's surface in 2008, grains of ice hit the spacecraft's Cosmic Dust Analyzer at around 11 miles a second.",
      "But it took years to complete a detailed chemical analysis of these particles, which was the subject of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\"Being habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,\" the University of Washington's Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Having a variety of organic compounds on an extraterrestrial water world is simply phenomenal,\" Klenner told the AP in an email.",
      "\"Another piece of the puzzle\"",
      "Study co-author Frank Postberg said the research proves that \"the complex organic molecules Cassini detected in Saturn's E ring are not just a product of long exposure to space, but are readily available in Enceladus's ocean.\"",
      "French astrochemist Caroline Freissinet, who was not involved in the study, told AFP that there was \"not much doubt\" that these molecules were in the moon's ocean.",
      "But this confirmation provides \"another piece in the puzzle,\" she added.",
      "It also shows that recent technology such as artificial intelligence allows scientists to perform new kinds of analysis on old data, she said.",
      "But to get the best idea about what is happening on Enceladus, a mission would need to land near the icy geysers and collect samples, she added.",
      "The European Space Agency has been studying the potential of a mission that would do just that.",
      "After all, \"Enceladus ticks all the boxes to be a habitable environment that could support life,\" the agency said in the statement.",
      "Khawaja added that \"even not finding life on Enceladus would be a huge discovery, because it raises serious questions about why life is not present in such an environment when the right conditions are there.\"",
      "NASA has a spacecraft en route to another enticing target to hunt for the ingredients of life: Jupiter's moon Europa. The Europa Clipper is expected to begin orbiting Jupiter in 2030 with dozens of Europa flybys. ESA also has a spacecraft, Juice, that's headed to Jupiter to explore Europa and two other icy moons that could hold buried oceans.",

      "After he was shot dead by police in 1993, the state took over the estate and leased it to local authorities, who turned it into a successful theme park, complete with a hotel and zoo.",

      "\"We have begun to recover the Napoles estate for the victims,\" Petro wrote on X, adding that Escobar's \"political and economic heirs wanted to take over the estate.\"",
      "The government said that 297 acres of land had been given to local women farmers.",

      "Escobar brought a small number of the African beasts to Colombia in the late 1980s.",
      "After his death the animals were left to roam freely beyond the estate's boundaries and to multiply. They now number around 150.",
      "Colombia has declared them an invasive species and experts previously said sterilization alone is not enough to control the growth of the invasive species, which is why the government is arranging for the possible\u00a0transfer of hippos\u00a0to overseas sanctuaries. But the cost of deporting the hippos is also expensive \u2014 an estimated\u00a0$3.5 million.",
      "The area where they roam is a paradise for the animals who have no predators and ample food and water, CBS News correspondent Manuel Bojorquez\u00a0reported in 2019. But they're getting too close to people. It's not uncommon to spot a three-ton hippo walking around town.",

      "The Jane Goodall Institute said she died of natural causes while on a speaking tour in California. Goodall had been scheduled to take part in an event in Pasadena to kick off an initiative, named TREEAMS (Trees + Dreams), in partnership with the institute. At the event Wednesday, a moment of silence was held for Goodall, and a prerecorded video was played of her talking about the importance of youth and their ability to change the world.",
      "\"Dr. Goodall's discoveries as an ethologist revolutionized science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,\" the institute said in its statement announcing Goodall's death.",
      "Goodall started documenting the lives and habits of chimpanzees in Tanzania as a young woman in the 1960s \u2014 but her passion for animals began long before that, in childhood. She told CBS News\u00a0she would spend hours in a tree at her home in Bournemouth, England, with library books, dreaming of Africa. \"I'll go to Africa, live with animals, write books about them. That was it,\" she said.",
      "Born in London on April 3, 1934, Goodall grew up during an era with much different expectations for girls. She said she had \"no intention of being a scientist, because girls didn't do that sort of thing.\"",
      "She landed a job instead as a secretary with famed paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey after meeting him at a friend's family farm in Kenya. He raised money to send Goodall to Gombe, Tanzania, for six months to study chimpanzees. At just 26 years old, alone in Africa, Goodall immersed herself in the chimpanzees' world \u2014 of which little was known at the time \u2014 and made the groundbreaking observation that the primates used and made tools.",
      "This discovery redefined the scientific world's understanding of the relationship between humans and animals. Dr. Leakey said upon learning of the findings, \"Now we must redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as humans!\"",
      "Goodall began studying at Cambridge University shortly afterward and earned her Ph.D. in ethology in 1966. One year later, she gave birth to her only child, son Hugo, whom she had with wildlife photographer Baron Hugo van Lawick. The couple met when National Geographic sent van Lawick to Gombe, Tanzania, to photograph and document Goodall's research with the chimpanzees.",
      "Goodall said van Lawick's film got people to believe her research findings, saying\u00a0that when \"his film started doing the rounds, showing the chimps using little twigs to fish for termites, they had to believe.\"",

      "Following the incident, NATO launched \"Baltic Sentry,\" deploying ships and planes to monitor the shadow fleet and safeguard critical seabed infrastructure. There have been no cable-cutting incidents since, British Adm. Keith Blount, NATO's deputy supreme allied commander Europe, told CBS News.",
      "But the latest incident highlights \"the existence and the reality of a phenomenon that we have been describing and denouncing for a long time,\" Macron said, which is the \"notorious shadow fleet\" that represents tens of billions of euros for Russia's budget and finances an estimated 40% of Russia's war effort.",
      "The tanker known as \"Pushpa\" or \"Boracay,\" whose name has changed several times, was sailing under the flag of Benin and appears on a list of ships targeted by EU sanctions against Russia.",
      "The shadow fleet is made up of aging tankers bought used, often by nontransparent entities with addresses in non-sanctioning countries, and sailing under flags from non-sanctioning countries. Their role is to help Russia's oil exporters elude the price cap imposed by Ukraine's allies.",
      "Last month, President Trump wrote on Truth Social that he was \"ready to do major Sanctions on Russia\" on the condition that all NATO countries\u00a0stop buying oil from Russia.

      "For the first time since being elected in May,\u00a0Pope Leo XIV\u00a0waded into U.S. politics, criticizing those who say they're against abortion but support the death penalty, saying that's \"not really pro-life.\"",
      "Leo, a Chicago native, was asked late Tuesday about plans by Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich to give a lifetime achievement award to Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin for his work helping immigrants. The plans drew objection from some conservative U.S. bishops, given the powerful Democratic senator's support for abortion rights.",
      "Leo called first of all for respect for both sides, but he also pointed out the seeming contradiction in such debates.",
      "\"Someone who says 'I'm against abortion but says I am in favor of the death penalty' is not really pro-life,\" Leo told reporters. \"Someone who says that 'I'm against abortion, but I'm in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States,' I don't know if that's pro-life.\"",
      "Leo, whose words echoed a common Catholic argument often made in discussions about abortion, spoke hours before Cupich announced that Durbin had declined the award.",
      "\"I am not terribly familiar with the particular case. I think it's important to look at the overall work that a senator has done during, if I'm not mistaken, in 40 years of service in the United States Senate,\" the pope told reporters on Tuesday in response to a question from EWTN News.",
      "In his comments about the Illinois dispute, Leo made no mention of President Trump, whose administration has carried out a surge of immigration enforcement in the Chicago area.",
      "Still, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt weighed in and disputed concerns raised by Pope Leo about the treatment of immigrants, saying that she \"would reject there is inhumane treatment of illegal immigrants in the United States under this administration.\"",
      "The administration, Leavitt said, \"is trying to enforce our nation's laws in the most humane way possible.\"",
      "Church teaching forbids abortion, but it also opposes capital punishment as \"inadmissible\" under all circumstances. U.S. bishops and the Vatican have strongly called for humane treatment of migrants, citing the Biblical command to \"welcome the stranger.\"",
      "Responding to a question in English from the U.S. Catholic broadcaster EWTN News, the pope said there were many ethical issues that constitute the teaching of the Catholic Church.",
      "\"I don't know if anyone has all the truth on them but I would ask first and foremost that there be greater respect for one another and that we search together both as human beings, in that case as American citizens or citizens of the state of Illinois, as well as Catholics to say we need to you know really look closely at all of these ethical issues and to find the way forward in this church. Church teaching on each one of those issues is very clear,\" he said.",
      "Cupich was a close adviser to Pope Francis, who strongly upheld church teaching opposing abortion but also criticized the politicizing of the abortion debate by U.S. bishops. Some bishops had called for denying Communion to Catholic politicians who supported abortion rights, including former President Joe Biden.",
      "Biden met on several occasions with Francis and told reporters in 2021 that Francis had told him to continue receiving Communion. During a visit to Rome that year, he received the sacrament during Mass at a church in Francis' diocese.",
      "Durbin was barred from receiving Communion in his home diocese of Springfield in 2004. Springfield Bishop Thomas Paprocki has continued the prohibition and was one of the U.S. bishops who strongly objected to Cupich's decision to honor the senator. Cupich claims Durbin as a member of the Chicago Archdiocese, where Durbin also has a home.",
      "In his statement announcing that Durbin would decline the award, Cupich lamented that the polarization in the U.S. has created a situation where U.S. Catholics \"find themselves politically homeless\" since neither the Republican nor the Democratic party fully encapsulates the breadth of Catholic teaching.",
      "He defended honoring Durbin for his pro-immigration stance, and said the planned Nov. 3 award ceremony could have been an occasion to engage him and other political leaders with the hope of pressing the church's view on other issues, including abortion.",
      "\"It could be an invitation to Catholics who tirelessly promote the dignity of the unborn, the elderly, and the sick to extend the circle of protection to immigrants facing in this present moment an existential threat to their lives and the lives of their families,\" Cupich wrote.",
      "Paprocki, for his part, thanked Durbin for declining the award. \"I ask that all Catholics continue to pray for our church, our country, and for the human dignity of all people to be respected in all stages of life, including the unborn and immigrants,\" Paprocki said in a Facebook post.",

    "story": [
      "Woodbridge, England \u2014\u00a0In a far-flung corner of southeast England, in a boatshed on the River Debden, a former U.S. Navy submariner whose career saw him serve on some of the most advanced nuclear-powered vessels of the 20th century has embarked on a mission into the past. David \"Mac\" MacDonald is one of 180 volunteers building a precise replica of a ship that set sail under the command of a king almost one-and-a-half millennia ago.",
      "They're working with The Sutton Hoo Ship's Company in the small town of Woodbridge, and their mission is to build a historically accurate reproduction of the wooden longship famously discovered on the site, which is believed to have been the final resting place of a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon king.",
      "The remnants of the original ship were discovered buried at Sutton Hoo almost a century ago, just across the river from the reconstruction site.",
      "Amid the skeleton of the old ship there was a wealth of Anglo-Saxon artifacts, which, along with the underdog story of its discovery, have brought the site international fame.",
      "The treasure trove included the \"Sutton Hoo Helmet,\" the most iconic remnant of Anglo-Saxon England.",
      "The old ship was in poor condition when amateur archaeologist Basil Brown discovered it \u2014 little more than an imprint in the sand, measuring about 90 feet in length.",
      "Due to the relative lack of knowledge about this period in English history, the find was dubbed \"one of the most important archaeological discoveries of all time\" by a curator at the British Museum.",
      "There's an ongoing debate as to who exactly was buried in the longship, but the most widely accepted theory is that King Raedwald of East Anglia was entombed in the vessel. He was among the first English kings to convert to Christianity, and is of no relation to the current royal family.",
      "The boathouse in which the ship is being reconstructed from scratch draws over 9,000 visitors every month, along with many volunteers. MacDonald grew up in New England and then lived in North Carolina for 30 years, but he moved to the U.K. seven years ago.",
      "He built bespoke furniture and is a trained violin maker, but he put all that aside for a set of Anglo-Saxon axes after one of his wife's friends mentioned the project. Now he's part of the longship family, where he says he has \"been made most welcome.\"",
      "MacDonald said he and his fellow shipbuilders can already envision the longship as it takes shape before them, telling CBS News: \"We're just carving away all the wood that doesn't look like a boat.\"",
      "But the project is far from simple. It aims to recreate the longship using the same methods and tools that would have been used by the Anglo-Saxons \u2014 axes, mallets and clamps, all made from designs over 1,400 years old \u2014 and to make it seaworthy.",
      "The team started construction in 2019, with hopes of completing the project by early 2027.",
      "Master Shipwright Laurie Walker described to CBS News the huge amount of time required to manufacture each individual part of the ship. The hull will be made of about 90 wood planks, each one requiring between 30-40 hours of work to craft. Those planks will be held together by about 3,800 wrought iron nails, all locally made.",
      "The wood used for the ship's handcrafted parts is as labor-intensive to find as it is to fashion into the needed components. Project horticulturist Andy Spencer said every tree used as source material must be selected based on its unique length, shape and lack of imperfections.",
      "Spencer said the keel of the ship, for instance, required an almost perfectly straight, 43-foot oak tree, which required an arduous search process \u2014 one that must be repeated for virtually every primary component.",
      "Spencer is also head of the project's replanting program, which aims to replant roughly 20 oak trees for every one that is cut down. The new trees are being planted close to where the longship is under construction, in the newly-annointed \"Saxon Ship Wood.\"",
      "Another challenge for the team is the lack of historical plans for the original Sutton Hoo ship, which was built, \"smack bang in the middle of a period about which we know absolutely nothing,\" according to project board chairman Sean McMillan.",
      "That's not because the Anglo-Saxons didn't record their work, but because Viking raids in the subsequent centuries saw many monasteries along England's east coast \u2014 where historical records would have been kept \u2014 plundered and destroyed.",
      "As such, details of the Sutton Hoo burial ship, which, according to McMillan, \"in its day would have been the equivalent of an aircraft carrier,\" are non-exsistent.",
      "\"During the build there's a lot of questions coming up of, 'Well, how would they have done this?' Well, we don't know, because there's no evidence of it,\" said McMillan.",
      "So they have to work with what they've got - the remains of the hulking vessel pulled from the Suffolk county mud.",

      "The plan, which Mr. Trump presented alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Monday, is a 20-point proposal which, if agreed to, would see a swift ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all the remaining hostages and a number of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, an increased flow of humanitarian aid and the eventual transfer of control over the territory to an interim administration of Palestinian technocrats overseen by an international \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Mr. Trump.",

      "A diplomatic source with knowledge of the talks told CBS News that an Egyptian official and the Qatari prime minister had provided Hamas representatives with a copy of the proposal.",

Along these lines, the ministers welcome the announcement by President Trump regarding his proposal to end the war, rebuild Gaza, prevent the displacement of the Palestinian people and advance a comprehensive peace, as well as his announcement that he will not allow the annexation of the West Bank,\" the joint statement said.",

      "Instead, what they got was a televised address from Hegseth and President Donald Trump. The secretary pushed a populist message of handing decision-making back to the warfighter, requiring senior leadership to perform physical training in line with lower-ranking officers and bringing uniformity back to the force.",
      "Garrett Smith, an active-duty Marine Corps reservist and CEO of defense tech firm Reveal, said the spectacle was unusual but not without precedent.",

      "\"At a first level, at any big multinational corporation or big organization, when there\u2019s a new boss, it\u2019s totally reasonable to call in all your regional managers and VPs for a setting of tone, to reconfirm the agenda, to ensure alignment. So, all of that makes sense,\" Smith said.",

So, it\u2019s going to come with a bunch of enhanced drama and mystique and weirdness about it. \u2026 The policy and the action might have been totally great, but much of the country is going to be left wondering, \u2018What was that really about?\u2019\"",
      "Even so, Smith argued, the underlying message was unmistakable: \"A return to warfighting and preparation for winning wars as the priority mission of the department. There was a perception we\u2019d strayed from that, that it had become just one mission among many. Reconfirming that this is the mission is really important \u2014 investing in a warfighting ethos.\"",

      "\"This is a historic come-to-Jesus meeting,\" said Chad Robicheaux, a former reconnaissance Marine who deployed to Afghanistan eight times. \"The message is clear. The days of divisiveness, resistance and undermining leadership are over.\"",

      "\"We\u2019re not talking, like, hot yoga and stretching,\" he said. \"Real hard PT.\"",

      "\"The force size that we have now \u2026 That was a force design that came up when President Obama was in office in 2010, and the assumptions were in 2010 that there would be no more real competition between the United States and Russia, and China was not even a real player on the nuclear field.\"",
      "The report, authored by Robert Peters of Heritage\u2019s Allison Center for National Security, proposes that Washington expand its force to roughly 4,625 operationally deployed nuclear weapons by 2050.",
      "That number would include about 3,500 strategic warheads \u2014 carried by intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), ballistic missile submarines, and bombers \u2014 and about 1,125 non-strategic weapons, such as gravity bombs and theater-range missiles.",
      "It comes amid warnings that Moscow maintains thousands of non-strategic nuclear weapons in Europe, outnumbering U.S. stocks by as much as ten to one, while China races to deploy stealth bombers, submarine-based missiles and even orbital strike systems. North Korea already possesses about 90 warheads and continues testing missiles that can reach the U.S. homeland.",
      "\"We've got an arsenal today that is decades beyond its planned life cycle, and a force construct that was designed for a very benign world.\"",
      "CHINA\u2019S GROWING NUCLEAR ARSENAL AIMS TO BREAK US ALLIANCES AND DOMINATE ASIA, REPORT WARNS",
      "Peters\u2019 proposal envisions a modernized force including new Sentinel ICBMs, Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines, nuclear-capable B-21 stealth bombers, long-range cruise missiles and theater-range hypersonic weapons. The plan would still keep U.S. forces below Cold War levels but significantly above today\u2019s posture.",
      "It lays out a plan for regional nuclear allocations in each theater, with the largest number of assets, 3,200 warheads, being placed under Northern Command and focused on homeland defense. Some 750 warheads would be placed in Europe and 675 in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "It calls for Sentinel ICBMs to replace Minuteman III and B-21 and B-52 jets with new long-range standoff cruise missiles.",
      "During the Cold War, the U.S. fielded tens of thousands of warheads, deployed in Europe, Asia and at home. The new 2050 arsenal would still be far smaller than Cold War levels.",
      "\"A U.S. President with some regional nuclear options but only token damage-limiting capacity would quickly be confronted during a limited nuclear conflict with two unpalatable options: surrender or threaten widespread attacks on the adversary homeland, thus inviting an in-kind response, meaning suicide,\" the report warns.",
      "Skeptics often ask why nations need thousands of nuclear weapons when a single warhead can level a city. Peters argues that this is a misconception rooted in Cold War imagery of mushroom clouds over Manhattan.",
      "North Korea possesses around 90 nuclear warheads.\u00a0 (\u00a0KCNA via REUTERS)",
      "In reality, most modern nuclear warheads are not designed for \"city busting\" but for striking enemy nuclear forces \u2014 silos, missile fields, and command-and-control centers. China, for example, is building up to 500 hardened ICBM silos in remote deserts. Military planners assume it could take at least two U.S. warheads to guarantee destruction of each site.",
      "As Peters puts it, \"the goal is never to get to this point. That\u2019s why you have nuclear weapons, to make sure you never get to this point.\"",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the current political leadership would heed Peters\u2019 recommendations. President Donald Trump has proposed \"denuclearization\" talks with U.S. adversaries.",
      "\"Trump very understandably doesn't like nuclear weapons,\" Peters said.",
      "But, he added, \"we tried [denuclearizing] under President Obama in 2009 and 2012 and no one followed.\"",
      "\"Tremendous amounts of money are being spent on nuclear, and the destructive capacity is something we don\u2019t even want to talk about today, because you don\u2019t want to hear it,\" Trump mused in remarks to the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, in February.",
      "\"I want to see if we can denuclearize, and I think it\u2019s very possible,\" suggesting talks on the issue between the U.S., Russia and China.",
      "President Vladimir Putin announced Russia would suspend its participation in the New START treaty in 2023 over U.S. support for Ukraine. Russia had frequently been caught violating the terms of the deal. But China has never engaged in negotiations with the U.S. over arms reduction.",
      "North Korea has rejected any suggestion of denuclearizing from the U.S.",
      "In September, Russia proposed a one-year extension of the New START treaty, which technically expires in 2026, but the White House has yet to respond to that proposal.",
      "Expanding the arsenal won\u2019t be cheap. But at around $56 billion, the U.S. only spends around seven percent of the defense budget on nuclear weapons, Peters argues.",
      "The report also calls for nuclear capabilities to be deployed forward to Finland and Poland, a proposal that is certain to rattle the Kremlin and would cut strike times down from hours to minutes.",

      "He made a similar call for nuclear capabilities to be placed in South Korea. Washington periodically deploys U.S. nuclear-armed submarines to South Korea and involves Seoul in its nuclear planning operations in exchange for an agreement from Seoul not to develop its own nuclear weapons."

      "A critical flaw in Chrome's V8 engine",
      "The newly patched vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-10585, stems from a type confusion weakness in Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered and reported the bug on Tuesday, and the company shipped a fix the following day, Bleeping Computer reported.",
      "Google confirmed that the flaw was being exploited in the wild, though it did not share technical details or name the groups behind the attacks. TAG has a history of uncovering zero-days tied to government-sponsored spyware campaigns aimed at high-risk individuals such as opposition leaders, journalists and dissidents.",
      "The fix was delivered through Chrome version 140.0.7339.185/.186 for Windows and macOS, and version 140.0.7339.185 for Linux. These updates will gradually reach all users in the Stable Desktop channel over the coming weeks.",
      "While Chrome typically updates automatically, you can apply the patch immediately by navigating to the \u2018About Google Chrome\u2019 section.

      "Then in June, another flaw in the V8 engine, CVE-2025-5419, was patched after being spotted by TAG. July saw the release of a fix for CVE-2025-6558, which allowed attackers to bypass Chrome's sandbox protection.

      "Many zero-day attacks are delivered through malicious websites or email attachments. Avoid clicking unknown links or downloading files from unverified sources, especially if they prompt you to disable security settings. Also, use strong antivirus software to add another layer of defense to detect malicious code that tries to run through compromised browsers. A strong antivirus can spot suspicious activity before it takes hold. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Even if attackers manage to steal your login details through a browser exploit,\u00a02FA makes it much harder for them to break into your accounts. Use an authenticator app instead of SMS when possible for stronger protection.",
      "If attackers exploit the browser to steal login data, a password manager keeps your credentials safe and helps generate unique, complex passwords. Even if one account is targeted, it prevents a domino effect across your logins.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Some extensions can be abused to make attacks worse. Stick to extensions from trusted developers, review permissions carefully and uninstall anything you no longer need.",
      "Chrome updates are critical, but attackers can also exploit holes in Windows, macOS, Android or iOS. Regular OS updates patch vulnerabilities across the system, reducing the chances of a browser exploit spreading further.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The fact that Chrome has already faced six zero-day attacks this year shows how relentless attackers are and how even the most popular software can have serious gaps. These flaws are not just bugs, but opportunities for hackers to exploit millions of users before fixes roll out. The pattern also highlights the growing sophistication of threat actors, including state-backed groups targeting high-risk individuals. No browser is completely safe, and the battle to secure widely used software is ongoing and far from over.",

      "Drone deliveries are moving from futuristic concepts to everyday life. Companies like\u00a0Google-owned Wing\u00a0and\u00a0Zipline\u00a0already partner with Walmart, DoorDash and even hospitals to deliver goods and medical supplies. Amazon is also testing its Prime Air drones to shorten delivery times.",
      "Flytrex, based in Tel Aviv, Israel, has already logged more than 200,000 successful deliveries across the U.S. Its drones are FAA-certified to fly beyond visual line of sight, giving them the ability to scale delivery services while meeting strict safety standards.",

      "What this means for you",
      "For customers, this could mean receiving meals, snacks or essentials in just minutes, instead of waiting half an hour or more. Drone delivery also has the potential to reduce traffic congestion, cut emissions and lower costs compared to traditional courier services.",
      "The catch? Availability will be limited at first, likely in suburban test markets where air traffic is easier to manage. But if all goes well, Uber Eats could expand drone deliveries to more cities in the coming years.",

ChatGPT, the widely used artificial intelligence chatbot that can answer questions and hold conversations, has become a daily tool for millions. His comments mark a major shift in how the AI company may handle mental health crises.",

      "Teens can easily access ChatGPT on a mobile device. (Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Tragedies that prompted action",
      "The shift follows lawsuits tied to teen suicides. The most high-profile case involves 16-year-old Adam Raine of California. His family alleges ChatGPT provided a \"step-by-step playbook\" for suicide, including instructions for tying a noose and even drafting a goodbye note.",
      "After Raine's death in April, his parents sued OpenAI. They argued that the company failed to stop its AI from guiding their son toward harm.",

      "Adam Raine, a California teen, took his life in April 2025 amid claims ChatGPT coached him (Raine Family)",
      "How widespread is the problem?",
      "Altman pointed to global numbers to justify stronger measures. He noted that about 15,000 people take their own lives each week worldwide. With 10% of the world using ChatGPT, he estimated that around 1,500 suicidal individuals may interact with the chatbot weekly.",

      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier explores how the technology is changing how the world operates on 'Special Report.'",
      "A New Jersey school district has adopted artificial intelligence to help detect weapons and stop threats before they escalate. The Glassboro Public School District is the first in the country to deploy a combined ZeroEyes and Singlewire InformaCast system for AI gun detection and mass communication.",

      "NORTH KOREAN HACKERS USE AI TO FORGE MILITARY IDS",
      "What's new in school security",
      "The district is using ZeroEyes, an AI video analytics platform that integrates with existing security cameras. The software scans for visible firearms and sends an alert whenever a potential threat appears. A team of military and law enforcement veterans at a 24/7 operations center then reviews the image to confirm whether the gun is real. Once verified, the system pushes an alert to school staff and police within three to five seconds. At the same time, buildings go into lockdown automatically.",
      "South Jersey schools have deployed AI to spot weapons and alert police in seconds. (Jay Janner/The Austin American-Statesman via Getty Images)",
      "These alerts are distributed through Singlewire Software's InformaCast platform. This system can send warnings across school PA systems, strobe lights, digital signs, desk phones and other communication tools. Together, the two technologies give law enforcement and educators a faster and more coordinated way to respond to potential dangers.",
      "How the system works",
      "Security cameras around each building feed video into the ZeroEyes software. When the AI detects what appears to be a firearm, it highlights the object and immediately shares the footage with human analysts. If those experts confirm that the weapon is real, they send the alert to the district and local authorities. InformaCast then pushes the message to every connected device, allowing staff and students to receive instructions within seconds. The goal is to shorten the time between detection and action so schools can respond before violence has a chance to unfold.",
      "Concerns to consider",
      "As with any new technology, questions remain. Even with human oversight, AI can make mistakes, and false alerts are always a possibility. Privacy also comes into play since the system depends on constant monitoring through security cameras. Cost is another factor because installing, maintaining and training staff for these systems requires significant funding. Finally, schools need to build community trust by explaining how the technology works and preparing students and parents for what to expect during drills or emergencies.",

      "Glassboro district becomes first in U.S. to pair AI gun detection with mass alerts. (Lori Van Buren/Albany Times Union via Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "For parents, teachers and students, this technology represents an important shift in how schools approach safety. AI adds speed to the process by recognizing threats before most people would even notice them. Alerts reach law enforcement and staff almost immediately, creating a critical advantage in a crisis. The system also provides a layered approach to protection by combining cameras, AI and communication tools. Parents may also find reassurance in knowing that human experts verify each threat to help reduce false alarms.

They're sneaking fake websites into search results that look just like the real thing. If you click and download from one of these sites, you could end up with malware instead of the app you wanted.

These sites host installers for apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Deepl, Chrome, Telegram, Line, VPN services and WPS Office. The catch is that these downloads include both the real app and hidden malware.",
      "Once you run one, the malware drops files into your system, asks for administrator access and quietly starts spying. It can collect personal information, log everything you type, monitor your screen and even disable your antivirus.",

Even if you stick to \"safe-looking\" search links, you could still land on a fraudulent page.",
      "How hackers disguise fake apps as real ones",
      "So how do these fake sites end up in your search results in the first place? The attackers use a technique called SEO poisoning. They register lookalike domains, use plugins to game search algorithms and then climb up Google's rankings. That way, when you search for a trusted app, the fake site may appear as one of the first results.",
      "According to FortiGuard Labs, this particular campaign mainly targeted Chinese-speaking users, but the method is being used everywhere. In fact, earlier reports from Cisco Talos showed ransomware groups pushing fake downloads of AI tools like ChatGPT or InVideo. Others used spoofed sites for PayPal, Microsoft, Netflix and Apple. Sometimes, attackers even buy sponsored ads so that their malicious links appear right at the top.",
      "The scary part is that you might not even realize you installed something dangerous. Because the fake installer includes the real app, everything seems to work fine. Meanwhile, the hidden malware is already active on your device. That makes it harder to detect and much easier for attackers to steal your data.",

      "Next Law founder Dan Gerl explains how prosecutors and the defense may use the \"voluminous\" evidence against Robinson, the suspect in Charlie Kirk's assassination, to shape their strategies.",
      "Prosecutors in the Tyler Robinson case wasted no time in declaring they had already gathered \"voluminous\" evidence against Charlie Kirk\u2019s accused assassin.",
      "\"There is a substantial amount of discovery in this case, Your Honor. It\u2019s voluminous, to say the least. And we\u2019re working on a process where we can exchange information as quickly as possible and be efficient in that process,\" Utah County Chief Deputy Attorney Chad Grunander said Monday during Robinson's court appearance.",
      "To better understand the strategy behind that phrase, Fox News Digital spoke with Dan Gerl, a Washington state-based defense attorney at Next Law, who previously served as a prosecutor and has more than 20 years of courtroom experience. Gerl said the prosecution\u2019s emphasis on the volume of material was no accident, and it sets the stage for how the case may unfold in the months ahead.",
      "This split image shows suspected assassin Tyler James Robinson, left, and victim Charlie Kirk, a founder of Turning Point USA, on the right. (Gov. Spencer Cox's office; AP Photo/Alex Brandon)",
      "UTAH PROSECUTORS PREPARE POTENTIAL DEATH PENALTY CASE AGAINST CHARLIE KIRK SUSPECT TYLER JAMES ROBINSON",
      "Categories of evidence",
      "Prosecutors have already pointed to multiple forms of evidence, according to Gerl.",
      "\"You\u2019ve got physical evidence, video surveillance showing what appears to be Robinson on the roof, the weapon found tied to his grandfather, bullet casings with inscriptions linked to online forums, messages from his social media accounts and even prints from his body and shoes on the roof,\" Gerl said.",
      "In the aftermath of the assassination of Kirk, FBI Director Kash Patel said a positive DNA match and text messages where the accused appeared to admit to the shooting.",
      "Prosecutorial strategy",
      "From the prosecution\u2019s perspective, emphasizing the size of the evidence file serves multiple purposes.",
      "\"It makes it very difficult for the defense,\" Gerl explained. \"They can come forward early on and paint the picture: \u2018This guy did it.\u2019 Within the confines of ethics, there\u2019s nothing preventing them from doing that, and it sets the tone.\"",

      "The approach also signals thoroughness in a case Gerl described as a \"calling all cars\" moment, with political pressure from \"government officials all the way to the top wanting action here.\"",
      "By showcasing evidence early and often, Gerl said, prosecutors reinforce their narrative, exert pressure in potential plea negotiations and shape the public\u2019s perception.",
      "Defense counter-strategy",
      "Robinson\u2019s defense team, which includes Kathryn Nester, Richard Novak and Michael Burt, will likely focus on the manner in which this evidence was obtained, Gerl said.",
      "\"They\u2019re going to attack it on all fronts,\" Gerl said. \"There will be motions to suppress, challenges to the legality of searches and scrutiny of how evidence was obtained. Anything investigators pulled without proper warrants, especially from phone records or social media accounts, could be contested.\"",
      "The defense may also probe whether investigators mishandled or improperly collected evidence, similar to tactics used in the O.J. Simpson trial, he said.",

      "Artificial intelligence vulnerabilities",
      "While physical evidence such as fingerprints and DNA is harder to dispute, digital records present unique challenges. Gerl, pointing to online speculation about the legitimacy of the text messages released by federal law enforcement, said that such doubts, even if unproven, could complicate the prosecution\u2019s narrative.",
      "\"Digital evidence is frozen in time now, but down the line, it may be harder to know what\u2019s authentic,\" Gerl warned. \"Jurors are going to see AI-generated videos that look real, and defense attorneys will plant the seed: could some of this have been manufactured?\"",

      "Israel\u2019s top diplomat at the United Nations dismissed delegates who walked out before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s address and blasted the international body for holding key Middle East talks during a Jewish holiday, leaving Jerusalem's delegation without representation.",
      "\"It was a staged walkout. Most of the people were not diplomats. They were staffers from hostile missions,\" Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon told Fox News Digital.",
      "He noted that Netanyahu was the first speaker of the day, meaning the diplomats who stormed out of the hall arrived only to participate in the walkout.",
      "\"I told them, \u2018get out and don't come back,\u2019 and I meant it. If they cannot listen to the words of the prime minister representing Israel and the Jewish people, I don't think they have a place in this hall,\" he said.",

      "Netanyahu may have been speaking to a smaller audience within the hall, but his address was broadcast on speakers in Gaza and on Gazans\u2019 cell phones, something the prime minister revealed while on stage. Danon said that the prime minister would often consider how to carry the message and the \"brilliant idea\" of broadcasting it so that the Palestinians could hear his speech was an extension of that.",
      "Danon told Fox News Digital that Netanyahu\u2019s address was not directed at Hamas leaders, who, he argued, \"don\u2019t care\" and only understand the language of tanks and aircraft. Instead, he said, the message was meant for the people of Gaza and for the hostages who have been languishing in the enclave for nearly two years.",
      "Danon also lamented that the U.N. scheduled key talks on the Middle East during the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah.",
      "\"They had a discussion about the Middle East, about Israel, without Israel. I think it shows the hypocrisy of the United Nations,\" Danon told Fox News Digital. \"Some leaders care more about hearing themselves rather than actually rewarding a dialogue.\"",

      "While Israel was not able to participate in talks during Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, it remained one of the central issues of the 80th session of the U.N. General Assembly. Israel also faced pressure outside official U.N. discussions, with several delegations moving to recognize a Palestinian state.",

      "Despite the negative view of Farage, Reform UK leads in the polls in the event of a general election, according to the polling company Ipsos. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Reform will win at the next election.",
      "\"If there was an election tomorrow, then it would likely win,\" Mendoza says. However, we don\u2019t know when the next election will be, which makes it near impossible to predict at this stage, he says. \"The golden law of British politics is you can\u2019t predict the vote that far ahead.\"",

      "When asked why Advance UK is needed when Farage's party is far ahead in the polls, Habib said, \"Reform will not deliver. It stands for nothing. It is a populist party without a political philosophy and without intellectual heft or capability,\" Habib said, claiming \"Farage has a patriotic persona, but he is nothing more than a political expedient. He would be worse than [former Prime Minister] Boris Johnson.\"",
      "Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t look like Advance U.K. will split the vote with Reform. According to Mendoza, bringing Robinson into the party may have been a mistake. During the recent rally, some protestors allegedly attacked police officers. \"Most people will not like violence at a political rally,\" he said. \"And they won\u2019t support the party.\"",
      "One of the leading frustrations voters have at the moment is that neither the current government nor the last one has managed to stop the surge of legal and illegal immigration. In fact, it has worsened. Almost 50,000 undocumented immigrants, many seeking asylum, arrived in Britain in the 12 months through June. That\u2019s up from around 39,000 at the same time the previous year, according to government data.",
      "On Saturday, the Daily Telegraph reported that migrants now account for 98% of the latest rise in population. According to the Office for National Statistics, the Telegraph reported, 69.3 million people were estimated to be living in the country in mid-2024, up 755,254 from the same time in 2023.",

      "\"We need a holistic solution to reduce immigration,\" Habib said. He also said borders must be enforced and illegal migrants deported. Worse still, those asylum-seekers are living in hotels at taxpayers\u2019 expense of \u00a35.8 million a day ($7.4 million).",
      "\"We need a holistic solution to reduce immigration,\" Habib said. He also agrees that borders must be enforced and illegal migrants deported. Worse still, those asylum seekers are living in hotels at the taxpayers\u2019 expense of \u00a35.8 million per day ($7.4 million).",
      "Earlier this summer, protests over asylum hotels erupted in Epping, southeast England. Separately, Farage suspended one of his local councilors over accusations of racism during the demonstration.",
      "Elon Musk responded to Farage's suspending the council member on X. He wrote: \"Farage is weak, runny sauce. He won\u2019t let Reform even stand up for their own people, e.g. punishing their Epping member, and he will change nothing of significance politically.\"",

Earlier this year, Irish comedian Graham Linehan was met by armed police at Heathrow Airport after making online comments about transgender people. Such incidents appear to be fast becoming the norm.",
      "Yet despite Musk's criticism, a new opinion poll released on Friday in the U.K. by YouGov showed Farage's Reform UK on target to deliver a massive defeat of Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his ruling Labour Party if an election were to be held.",

      "Lavrov opened with sweeping historical references to World War II, positioning Russia as the heir to the Soviet Union\u2019s role in defeating Nazism and defending global sovereignty. He accused the U.S. of dismantling those postwar principles through interventions in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya and warned that the same was happening today in the Middle East.",
      "While condemning Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, Lavrov said Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza amounted to \"collective punishment\" of civilians, linking the conflict to what he portrayed as decades of unchecked Western use of force.",

    "summary": "Republican Senate Leader John Thune said the government shutdown is \"stupid\" and a negotiation with Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer won't \"accomplish a lot.\"",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 On the second day of the shutdown, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., called it \u201cstupid\u201d and said a negotiation with his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Chuck Schumer, is not \u201cgoing to accomplish a lot.\u201d",
      "In an interview with NBC's Tom Llamas that will air Thursday night, Thune said Democrats will have another opportunity on Friday afternoon to join Republicans in voting for a clean, short-term bill to reopen the government.",
      "\u201cI would suspect that we\u2019ll probably cross paths on the floor; we\u2019re both on the floor quite often. Our offices are not far apart. So if he wants to chat, he knows where to find me,\u201d Thune said of Schumer, the New York Democrat who serves as minority leader. \u201cBut I think at this point, right now, the issue said, is pretty straightforward. I don\u2019t know that, you know, negotiation is going to accomplish a lot.\"",
      "For more on this story, tune into \u201cTop Story with Tom Llamas\u201d at 7 p.m. ET on NBC News Now.",
      "\u201cThis is a seven-week funding resolution just to keep the government funded so we can continue doing the appropriations work that we started earlier this year,\u201d he added.",
      "Negotiations between Republican and Democratic leaders have been at a standstill ever since they left a meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday without a deal. Trump followed up that meeting by posting an insulting AI video of Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and personal jabs have flown back and forth since.",
      "The government shut down on Wednesday for the first time in six years, with no signs of reopening.",
      "Schumer and the Democrats are demanding that any funding bill include an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. But Thune has insisted he won\u2019t negotiate on those tax credits until Democrats help Republicans reopen the government.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m all about getting it back open again. I think shutdowns are\u2014 nobody wins, and I think honestly, for the most part, they\u2019re stupid,\u201d Thune said in the interview. \u201cWe really shouldn\u2019t be shutting the government down, and it shouldn\u2019t be taken hostage to do other policy things that are totally unrelated to funding the government.\u201d",
      "In a statement Thursday, Schumer suggested the American people were turning against Republicans, who currently control all levers of power in Washington.",
      "\u201cAmericans see it clearly: They know Trump governs by chaos and welcomes this shutdown \u2014 and that Republicans are following his orders to maximize pain. That cruelty is already backfiring,\" Schumer said. \"Americans blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, and the longer they drag it out, the deeper the pain and that blame will grow.\"",
      "Pressed by Llamas, Thune defended Trump and his top aides who have said they are planning to move forward this week with permanent federal layoffs due to the shutdown, as well as revoking billions in federal funding for projects in blue states like New York, the home state of both Schumer and Jeffries. Thune said none of these things would happen if the Democrats helped reopen the government.",
      "\"Tom, let's come back to the basic premise: This is avoidable,\" Thune said, adding that the Democrats \"are playing with fire by doing this.\"",
      "He added that Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, and other administration officials would make spending decisions during this shutdown based on where \"their political priorities lie.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s very simple, you avoid this by just voting to keep the government open,\" he said.",
      "The Senate did not hold votes on Thursday in honor of the Yom Kippur holiday, but has scheduled votes at 1:30 p.m. ET Friday on dueling Republican and Democratic plans to reopen the government. Yet those same funding bills have already failed three times before.",
      "If the proposals are defeated for a fourth time, Thune said earlier Thursday, the Senate will likely not hold any votes over the weekend. That means a shutdown would last at least until Monday, when the House is also planning to be back in town following a two-week recess.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll have a fourth chance tomorrow to vote to keep, to open up the government,\u201d Thune told reporters in the Capitol. \u201cAnd if that fails, then we have the weekend to think about it. We\u2019ll come back. We\u2019ll vote again on Monday.\u201d"

Please contact us at tips@nbcuni.com or reach out to us here.",
      "Those furloughed employees won\u2019t be paid until Congress passes legislation to fund the government, with neither side showing signs of budging as the shutdown entered its second day. While most of the furloughed employees won\u2019t be allowed to work during the shutdown, others who are deemed essential \u2014 such as members of the military and airport security screeners \u2014 will have to continue working without pay.",
      "Federal workers typically receive back pay once the government reopens, but that requires congressional approval.",
      "On top of the uncertainty around when workers will see a paycheck again, the Trump administration has threatened to use the shutdown as a pretext to carry out more mass firings.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re really scared,\u201d said Lauren Leib, a land law examiner at the Bureau of Land Management in New Mexico and president of the National Treasury Employees Union Local 340. \u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are the primary income earners with very young children, and they\u2019re going to be going without a paycheck and they don\u2019t know what this is going to mean for them going forward.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s left federal workers, already drained and demoralized by months of layoffs and funding cuts, scrambling to figure out how to cope with the possibility of weeks without pay and a new round of layoffs, according to nearly two dozen federal workers who reached out to NBC News to share how the shutdown was impacting them.",
      "One State Department employee in his 20s said he was planning to deliver food for DoorDash and drive for Uber to pay his bills. The wife of a Department of Homeland Security worker in Ohio said she had to borrow $600 from a colleague to cover her co-pay on a set of leg braces she needed to pick up this week for her disabled child.",
      "\u201cWe run the risk, if this goes on longer than a week or two, of not being able to pay our mortgage and the possibility of losing our house,\u201d she said, adding that her bank rejected her request for a deferment on her $1,700 a month mortgage.",
      "She said her oldest daughter has already asked if the shutdown will mean they will lose their home and have to move in with relatives and change schools.",
      "\u201cEverybody thinks that federal workers get paid this really good money. But what my husband does, people who are in the military, who work for TSA, they struggle just like everybody else,\" she said. \"They are going to work without being paid, they\u2019re wondering, without this paycheck, how am I going to pay this bill, where\u2019s my next meal going to come from?\u201d",
      "Like nearly all federal employees whom NBC News spoke with, she asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation by the Trump administration, which has publicly fired federal workers it has deemed as being against its agenda.",
      "\u201cI was never afraid to speak my mind before, I never felt afraid to talk. Now, people are afraid,\u201d an Arizona TSA worker said,  explaining her concerns over speaking publicly about how the shutdown is impacting her.",
      "The TSA worker, who will have to continue working without pay during the shutdown, said she has enough in savings to get by for  two to three weeks because she\u2019d borrowed some extra money over the summer while refinancing her home in anticipation of a shutdown. But if the shutdown goes beyond a few weeks, she\u2019s worried about being able to even afford the $88 a week at the gas pump she needs to get to work.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m working as a civil servant for the citizens of America to make their traveling safe,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you want me worrying about your safety or do you want me worrying about how am I going to feed my kid? How am I going to be able to afford her medication? How are we going to survive? Am I going to lose my house?\u201d",
      "Still, the TSA employee and several others with whom NBC News spoke said they were in support of the shutdown despite the near-term hardship, if it meant pushing back against cuts the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress have been making to health insurance programs and other federal services.",
      "\u201cThis is not something that any federal worker wants, but at the same time, enough is enough,\u201d said M.T. Snyder, who works for the National Labor Relations Board, a federal agency that ensures employers follow laws protecting workers\u2019 rights to organize. \u201cWe really need to stand up for our services that we provide and the agencies that enforce laws because, since Trump has been in office, his main goal has been destroying these agencies.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has said the federal workforce would shrink by around 300,000 workers this year, to a total of 2.1 million people, as a result of voluntary resignations and firings led by the Department of Government Efficiency, the initiative started in the early days of the Trump administration by billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "At the NIH, Norton said she feels like the government has already been slowly shutting down since the Trump administration began sweeping funding cuts and new barriers were put in place limiting medical research, including the work she does trying to develop real-world interventions to reduce health disparities among kidney disease patients.",
      "Despite the cutbacks she will have to make without her paycheck, she said she is glad to see Democrats in Congress doing something to stand up to the attacks by the Trump administration on federal workers and the services they provide.",
      "Democratic leaders in Congress have said they want to see an extension of Obamacare subsidies that expire at the end of the year included in a bill to keep the government open, something Republicans have refused to agree to. People who get health insurance through Obamacare will begin getting notices in the coming days warning that their premiums will soon go up unless Congress extends the funds.",
      "\u201cI am thinking about the suffering that always happens in a shutdown, the harm that happens when people don\u2019t get the services that they need, and as a federal worker, I won\u2019t be paid during the shutdown,\u201d Norton said. \u201cBut I\u2019m also looking at this bigger picture and continuing the status quo just seems so much worse. So I think somebody in Congress needs to do something to rein in the lawlessness and this just seems to be one of the few opportunities they have for doing that.\u201d"

      "\u201cI would welcome his support. You know, this is a general election, it\u2019s Democrats, Republicans, independents,\u201d Cuomo, who is running as a third-party candidate, said in an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press NOW.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration informed Congress in a confidential notice this week that President Donald Trump has \"determined\" that the United States is in an \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug cartels and that members of the organizations can be targeted as unlawful combatants.",
      "\u201cThe President determined these cartels are non-state armed groups, designated them as terrorist organizations, and determined that their actions constitute an armed attack against the United States,\u201d the notice said.",
      "\"In response, based upon the cumulative effects of these hostile acts against the citizens and interests of United States and friendly foreign nations, the President determined that the United States is in a non-international armed conflict with these designated terrorist organizations,\u201d it added.",
      "The designation essentially puts drug cartels in the same legal category as terrorist groups like Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.",

      "\u201cAs we have said many times, the President acted in line with the law of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring deadly poison to our shores, and he is delivering on his promise to take on the cartels and eliminate these national security threats from murdering more Americans,\u201d White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement Thursday.",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Oct 2025 20:55:49 GMT",
    "summary": "The FDA quietly approved a generic form of mifepristone, one of the two medications used in most U.S. abortions, on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday quietly approved a generic form of mifepristone, one of the two medications used in most U.S. abortions.",
      "That makes the drug, from the company Evita Solutions, the second generic version to hit the market. The first, from pharmaceutical company GenBioPro, was approved in 2019.",
      "Mifepristone is typically used in combination with another pill, misoprostol, to induce abortions. Medication abortions account for nearly two-thirds of abortions in the U.S.",
      "The FDA wrote in a letter to Evita Solutions on Tuesday, the day before the government shutdown began, that its mifepristone tablets were \u201ctherapeutically equivalent\u201d to the brand-name version, Mifeprex, which has been available in the U.S. since 2000.",
      "On its website, Evita Solutions describes its mission as assisting \u201cthe medical community in recognizing the utility and freedom that medical abortion provides patients.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe seek to normalize abortion care, and we commit to making care accessible to all,\u201d it adds.",
      "The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The FDA approval comes less than two weeks after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told Republican state attorneys general in a letter that the FDA would review mifepristone\u2019s safety.",
      "In the letter, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary wrote that the FDA\u2019s past decisions to roll back certain restrictions on mifepristone access had not been given \u201cadequate consideration\u201d at the time.",
      "Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Health and Human Services Department, said the FDA does not endorse drug products and directs prescribers to follow all labeling.",
      "\u201cThe FDA has very limited discretion in deciding whether to approve a generic drug. By law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must approve an application if it demonstrates that the generic drug is identical to the brand-name drug,\u201d Nixon said in a statement.",
      "\u201cGeneric applicants are not required to submit independent evidence proving safety and effectiveness,\u201d he added. \u201cHHS is conducting a study of the reported adverse effects of mifepristone to ensure the FDA\u2019s risk mitigation program for the drug is sufficient to protect women from unstated risks.\u201d",
      "The FDA often issues a press release after new or significant drug approvals, but did not in this case.",
      "The approval provoked a furious response from Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America.",
      "\u201cSecretary Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Makary assured Congress and the American people they would conduct a thorough review given credible evidence of the harm inflicted by these drugs,\u201d she said. \u201cThe prompt completion of the review is made more urgent given this approval to flood the market with a cheap abortion drug.\u201d",
      "Peer-reviewed research has long shown that serious adverse reactions from abortion pills are rare. In combination, mifepristone and misoprostol can be used up to 70 days after the start of the last menstrual period. The former blocks the hormone progesterone, which supports pregnancy, and the latter induces contractions.",
      "Brittany Fonteno, CEO of the National Abortion Federation, the professional association of abortion providers, said in a statement that the approval of a second generic drug for mifepristone \u201cunderscores what research has shown for decades: medication abortion is safe, effective, and essential health care, used by millions with proven efficacy.\u201d",
      "Anti-abortion activists have for years called on the FDA to revoke the approval of the first generic drug for mifepristone, as well as two particular rule changes for the drug\u2019s use. (The first, in 2016, said that mifepristone could be used up to 10 weeks\u2019 gestation instead of seven, and the second, in 2021, eliminated a requirement that mifepristone be dispensed in person, allowing it to be prescribed via telehealth and mailed nationwide.)",
      "In their letter last month, Kennedy and Makary cited an April report from a conservative think tank, the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claimed to find a higher rate of serious complications from mifepristone than reported by the FDA. But that report was not peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal, and reproductive health researchers have said it amounts to junk science.",
      "Over the last several months, many conservatives have cited the report as a reason the FDA should look more closely at mifepristone\u2019s safety. In July, 22 Republican attorneys general sent a letter to Kennedy and Makary to that effect; the letter the two sent last month was a response to that request.",
      "Anti-abortion groups have in the past been skeptical of Kennedy, a former Democrat who ran for president in 2023 as a proponent of abortion rights. He later said he supported restrictions after a certain point in a pregnancy. Kennedy\u2019s stance on abortion was a source of consternation for some conservatives during his Senate confirmation hearing."

      "Ophelia's name pops up in title of the album's first track, \"The Fate of Ophelia.\" But who is she? And what does her name signify?",
      "What To Know About \u2018Hamlet\u2019",
      "\"Hamlet\" is a tragic play that Shakespeare wrote sometime between 1599 and 1601.",
      "The play, which is set in Denmark, tells the story of the troubled young prince Hamlet, who vows to exact revenge on his uncle Claudius after Claudius murders Hamlet's father, the king of Denmark, to steal the throne and marry Hamlet\u2019s mother, Gertrude.",
      "Over the course of the play, Hamlet's mental health declines as his grief and anger overwhelm him.",
      "Who Is Ophelia?",
      "Ophelia is the daughter of Polonius, a counselor to Hamlet's uncle Claudius. She and Hamlet also happen to be in love.",
      "King Claudius objects to the pair's romance as does her brother Laertes. Ophelia yearns to please the men in her family, but she also wants to be true to Hamlet.",
      "While the character of Ophelia has been interpreted in many ways, she's generally known for her beauty and innocence as well as her lack of power in a patriarchal society. That lack of agency, plus personal pressures to please her father, brother and Hamlet torment her.",
      "After Hamlet accidentally murders Ophelia's father and mocks her while ending their relationship, Ophelia's mental health unravels and she drowns herself and dies.",
      "Her death isn't directly depicted in the text. Rather, it's announced by Queen Gertrude. Gertrude tells Laertes that Ophelia fell into a \"weeping brook.\"",
      "\"But long it could not be/ Till that her garments, heavy with their drink/ Pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay/ To muddy death,\" Gertrude says in Act 4, Scene 7. (Of note, in Swift's last big interview, appearing on \"New Heights,\" fans clocked several mentions of the number 47. Later in the episode, she confirmed, \u201cI love numerology.\")",
      "How Has Ophelia Been Depicted in Art and Pop Culture?",
      "Ophelia has appeared again and again in pop culture and the arts. John Everett Millais\u2019 1852 painting, \u201cOphelia,\" depicts the character floating in water in a gauzy dress surrounded by lush greenery and flowers. With her eyes open, she looks dazed, and the image is meant to depict her singing before she drowns. Aussie pop star Kylie Minogue re-created that pose for her 1995 duet with Nick Cave, \u201cWhere the Wild Roses Grow.\u201d",
      "She's inspired countless more songs, perhaps most famously Bob Dylan's 1965 song \"Desolation Row.\"",
      "Dylan sings, \"Now Ophelia, she\u2019s \u2019neath the window/ For her I feel so afraid/ On her twenty-second birthday/ She already is an old maid,\" and later addressed the lack of power that is the character's undoing, singing, \"Her sin is her lifelessness.\"",
      "The Lumineers also namecheck the character in the 2016 song \u201cOphelia,\u201d while members of the feminist punk band Ophelia Rising pay tribute to her with their name.",
      "Most recently, Ophelia was the subject of a 2018 film \"Ophelia\" starring Daisy Ridley. The historical drama, which was based on the novel by Lisa Klein, depicts the tragedy of Hamlet from Ophelia's perspective."

      "As Dr. Perry Cox on \u201cScrubs,\u201d John McGinley exhibited a hard-to-match intensity. In real life, that intensity comes out in his fierce devotion to his three kids, the oldest of whom was born with Down syndrome.",
      "\"It was like getting hit with a cosmic hammer,\" McGinley says of son Max's diagnosis at birth, on a video call with TODAY.com.",
      "\"Max was going to be a girl. Everything was all squared away. He showed up, and his 21st chromosome had tripled, he had heart issues and sleep apnea and some digestive tract problems, and I just shut down.\"",
      "The year after Max\u2019s birth was a roller coaster for McGinley and his ex-wife, Lauren Lambert. Adjusting to their new reality and keeping an eye on the heart condition Max was born with (which ultimately resolved itself) took some time, so McGinley stepped back from acting to focus on his family.",
      "\"It was time to circle the wagons and everything else had to wait,\" he says. \"Since then, he has has grown into this lovely, lovely, stubborn, very opinionated young man who absolutely loves his sisters.\"",

      "\"It was a real focus to empower both of them, you know. Not put a wet blanket on Kate and Billy Grace being verbal, but still trying to empower Max to create as much language as he can,\" he says.",
      "Balancing the very different needs of all three children can require a good deal of finesse, but the actor hasn't noticed any conflict between the three.",
      "\"I never wanted Max to be a burden to his two sisters. I wanted them to be the instigators or the initiators of activities done with their brother,\" McGinley explains. \"They've treated Max as the biggest gift in the history of the planet, and it's shaped the way they see the world.\"",

      "When Max outgrew the playground swings, McGinley built something taller. He had giant swings constructed out of 25-foot telephone poles. McGinley says with a laugh, \"They're ridiculous but they've yielded dividends.\"",
      "In addition to swinging, Max loves to strum. He plays rhythm guitar for a band called Spec Labs. The band's name is derived from the fact that all of its musicians are on the spectrum in some capacity.",

      "McGinley's Advocacy",
      "McGinley cheers for his son in private but also advocates for him on a larger stage. He has been a staunch advocate for the GLOBAL Down Syndrome Foundation for years, primarily due to its focus on research and lobbying to ensure that every person with Down syndrome has an equitable chance at a satisfying life.",
      "\u201cThis is going to sound a little crass, but I don\u2019t want to be with a pamphlet-driven group,\u201d McGinley says with Dr. Cox intensity. He wanted to support an organization that will create real, lasting change, and he believes GLOBAL will do just that.",
      "As part of October's Down Syndrome Awareness Month, McGinley will take part in GLOBAL's \"Be Beautiful, Be Yourself\" fashion show, which is the largest fundraiser for Down syndrome in the world. He'll be one of the celebrity escorts helping models with Down syndrome rock the runway.",
      "The Return of Dr. Cox",
      "He will also be heading to Vancouver to film the \"Scrubs\" reboot, along with Zach Braff, Donald Faison and Sarah Chalke.",
      "\"I know we're shooting in Vancouver, and that's all I know, because I haven't seen a word of text,\" McGinley jokes while holding up his travel paperwork. \"But it doesn't matter, Billy Lawrence is doing it. It's going to be great!\"",
      "In fact, McGinley asked series creator Lawrence to add a storyline with a special needs patient. And in Season 8, he did.",
      "\"It was great to put someone, a young adult born with Down syndrome on the show. He crushed it, and he crushed Dr. Cox and it was a great episode,\" McGinley recalls."

      "\"That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019ve always felt,\" he continued. \"I like the transformative nature of acting. So if you can kinda keep that as background, then I think it allows you more freedom as a performer, you know?\"",
      "Murphy made a name for himself in roles like Christopher Nolan's  \"Batman Begins\" and \"Inception,\" and the popular series \"Peaky Blinders.\" When he landed the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in Nolan's epic film, \"Oppenheimer,\" he not took home an Oscar, but also became more of a household name.",

      "Murphy described learning of the scandal as a \"collective trauma for people of a certain age\" at a 2024 press conference, according to the Guardian.",
      "\u201cI think the irony of the book is that it\u2019s a Christian man trying to act Christian in a dysfunctional Christian society. And it asks a lot of questions about publicity and silence and shame, all of those things,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t think the duty of art is to answer those questions, it\u2019s to talk to them. And maybe it\u2019s easier to absorb than an academic report, or a political report.\u201d",
      "Murphy's newest role is in Netflix's \"Steve,\" in which he portrays the titular role of a headteacher at a school for boys with societal and behavioral issues. \"Steve\" is set to premiere on Oct. 3."

      "Later in the same episode, titled \u201cGhost Town,\u201d Anderson was supposed to meet Walerius in the pods for a date. But he never showed. Another message updated viewers that he quit the show, as well.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Anderson revealed why he dropped out of the experiment and also shared if he has any regrets.",
      "Anderson says that although his departure seemed hasty, he actually had doubts throughout the pod process. The accountant explains that the show\u2019s timeline didn\u2019t match his feelings.",
      "\u201cI think going into the experiment, everyone is keenly aware of the condensed timeline, and I certainly was as well,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you go in optimistic.\u201d",
      "He shares that the first day of the pods stage is a \u201cspeed dating type of day\u201d where all the contestants have lighthearted, fun dates with each other.",
      "\u201cBut I think I always had that timeline in the back of my mind. So as the days kind of ticked by, and I think we were probably midway through the experiment or so, I felt like a proposal probably wasn\u2019t in the cards for me,\u201d he continues.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just his intuition telling him that he should walk away if he wasn\u2019t ready to get down on one knee.",
      "\u201cIt was communicated throughout the entire experiment (that) if you weren\u2019t there working towards an engagement, you probably shouldn\u2019t be there. So I thought the best thing for me to do was to remove myself from the experiment,\u201d he says.",
      "Also in Episode 3, viewers saw a disappointed Walerius sit in a pod alone before she realized Anderson wasn\u2019t coming. She told the cameras she had been \u201cstood up\u201d by Anderson before tearfully adding that he could\u2019ve at least shown up to explain himself.",
      "While chatting with TODAY.com, Anderson acknowledges that his exit was \u201ca little bit clumsy.\u201d",
      "\u201c(I) certainly didn\u2019t intend to leave anyone hanging,\u201d he says. \u201cThe departure was maybe a little bit clumsy on my part. I didn\u2019t think it through, but I truly thought in the moment I was doing the right thing.\u201d",
      "Since Anderson quit shortly after Yuan left, some might speculate that that is what convinced him to leave. But he says that wasn\u2019t what happened.",
      "\u201cI think I was more so kind of concerned with how I was feeling. The timeline was just a hurdle that I couldn\u2019t get over. I think at that point you only have so many days left before you\u2019re kind of faced with that, \u2018Hey, should I propose? Should I not?\u2019 I felt like I was nowhere close to that with any of my connections,\u201d he explains.",
      "Still, he says he would change how he handled the situation despite making \u201cthe right decision at the time.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn hindsight, yes, I think hearing about how everything went down upon my departure, certainly I own that I was definitely clumsy on my part, and I should have thought that through,\u201d he shares.",
      "Anderson adds, \u201cBut it truly wasn\u2019t on my radar, that that would be a possibility, and so I didn\u2019t run through that scenario. Certainly, if I had, I would have stuck around and had those conversations.\u201d",
      "In addition to Anderson and Yuan, Episode 6 began with engaged couple Patrick Suzuki and Kacie Mcintosh choosing not to continue with the experiment after Mcintosh privately reveals to producers she wasn\u2019t attracted to her fianc\u00e9.",
      "While Anderson and Mcintosh are not shown in the teaser clip for the next group of Season 9 episodes, Yuan and Suzuki are seen reuniting to discuss the connection they also built in the pods.",
      "Viewers will have to tune in next week when the episodes are released on Oct. 8 to see how the confrontation unfolds."

    "summary": "What happens to Sylvia and Will in the ending of Platonic Season 2? Here's the ending of the show explained by creators Francesca Delbanco and Nicholas Stoller.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for Season 2 of \"Platonic.\"",
      "It\u2019s official: As of the \"Platonic\" Season 2 finale, Sylvia (Rose Byrne) and Will (Seth Rogen) are changing their friendship status to business partners.",
      "Co-created, directed and written by married couple Nicholas Stoller and Francesca Delbanco, \u201cPlatonic\u201d follows two former college friends now in their 40s as they help one another navigate their messy midlife eras. After a long estrangement, Sylvia and Will reunited in Season 1. In Season 2, they weather new changes.",
      "Delbanco, who was a novelist prior to becoming a screenwriter, wanted \"Platonic\" to explore questions around what a fulfilled life really entails.",
      "\u201cIt is possible to love your life and still look around and think, \u2018This is it?\u2019\" Delbanco says. \u201cThe path of adulthood is, by necessity, about closing doors to things that you might have also liked to do. It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t like the choices you made. It means you miss having a choice.\u201d",
      "\"The path of adulthood is, by necessity, about closing doors to things that you might have  also liked to do. It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t like the choices you made. It means you miss having a choice.\"",
      "Francesca Delbanco",
      "This middle-aged angst is where comedy and drama become one.",
      "\u201cWe always start with asking ourselves, \u2018What is the emotional story we\u2019re telling?\u2019 because when you\u2019re honest, that\u2019s what\u2019s funniest,\u201d says Stoller, who worked on comedy films like \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall,\u201d \u201cThe Muppets,\u201d and \u201cNeighbors.\u201d",
      "While Season 1 ended with Will\u2019s engagement to his Johnny 66 boss Jenna (Rachel Rosenbloom), the new season picks up with an indecisive Will questioning if his happily ever after should include Jenna. Spoiler alert: It doesn\u2019t. But don\u2019t worry, she can always look into her father\u2019s ruptured eye and be reminded of Will. (The disaster that is episode \u201cFore!\u201d will make you think twice about hitting the green.)",
      "With nowhere else to go, Will ends up living in Sylvia\u2019s standalone dwelling unit, which only accentuates their different lifestyles. But what keeps this bickering, yet inseparable friendship alive is they keep each other accountable, holding a mirror up against one another.",
      "\u201cThey can be truth tellers toward each other and can call each other out on their shit,\u201d Stoller says. Delbanco explains these friends can outright tell each other, \u201cYou\u2019re annoying me\u201d or \u201cShut up,\u201d which offers a fun dynamic to explore.",
      "After an embarrassing loss on \"Jeopardy!\", Sylvia\u2019s husband, Charlie (Luke Macfarlane), quits his law firm in pursuit of writing a novel. Irritated he left their family in financial instability, Sylvia avoids reading his manuscript by kayaking the Los Angeles River with Will and her friend Katie (Carla Gallo). While Will and Katie enjoy splashing around in the contaminated waters, Sylvia finds it difficult to appreciate the beauty of seagulls.",
      "When Sylvia finally forces herself to read the legal adventures of \u201cBrett Coyote,\u201d Sylvia discovers Will had encouraged Charlie to leave his job. As a result, Sylvia tells Will to move out and accepts a full-time job as an in-house event planner for a production company with a boss who loves to call everyone \u201cb---h\u201d (Aidy Bryant).",
      "So where does that leave us in the season finale?",
      "While Sylvia struggles with nonstop travel for work, Charlie suffers from writer\u2019s block. (Byrne\u2019s real-life partner Bobby Cannavale guest stars as Charlie\u2019s protagonist in imagined sequences.)",
      "During an emotional goodbye to their 2012 Honda Odyssey, Sylvia motivates Charlie to keep writing and even organizes a book release party for \u201cBrett Coyote.\u201d At his book launch, Charlie tells his friend and coworker, Stewart (Guy Branum), he misses work and wants to return to law.",
      "Upon finding out Jenna issued a revengeful noncompete, halting the opening of Will\u2019s new bar, Sylvia comforts Will and urges him to keep his business dreams alive. When Charlie and Stewart inform them the only way around a noncompete is to have someone else be the face of the company, Sylvia raises her hand.",
      "For Stoller and Delbanco, this was not the first time they thought of mixing friendship and business on \"Platonic.\"",
      "\u201cWe tried to do it this season over a few episodes and even in the first season, but it\u2019s such a massive plot point that we realized this is not an episode idea, but a season idea,\u201d Stoller says.",
      "Starting a business will not only be prime for numerous comedic fights in a potential Season 3, which is not yet confirmed, but also serve as a practical tool for storytelling.",
      "\u201cAs much as we would all love to hang out with our friends, it doesn\u2019t dovetail with the life of an adult in their midlife. This way, it gives Sylvia and Will an excuse to be together all day, every day,\u201d Delbanco says.",
      "As for the real-life married duo? Stoller and Delbanco find working together to be much more effortless than Sylvia and Will.",
      "\u201cWe share a tone much more than I thought,\u201d Stoller says. \u201cIt\u2019s rare that we disagree. But I know if Francesca doesn\u2019t like something, it probably won\u2019t work. She has a rare, keen instinct as to whether something is going to work both emotionally and comedically.\u201d",
      "Even on what feels like the longest day, what Delbanco appreciates most is how Stoller excels at keeping the energy up in the writers\u2019 room.",
      "\u201cI am lucky to get to experience it in my normal life when we\u2019re all having breakfast together,\u201d Delbanco says. \u201cBut seeing it in a professional context, I am reminded of how powerful it is to make a room full of exhausted people laugh.\u201d"

      "Many of them also continue their studies in the United States, where India overtook China last year as the biggest source of foreign students. But policy decisions and other moves by the Trump administration, including the recently announced $100,000 fee for the H-1B skilled immigrant work visa, now have those graduates thinking twice about going to America.",

      "While offers to work directly in the U.S. are few and far between, more common is relocation via the H-1B program after working in Indian offices for a few years. Out of the 400,000 H-1B visas approved in the 2024 financial year, 71% of the grantees were born in India, according to the Department of Homeland Security. China was a distant second at less than 12%.",
      "Among the top H-1B employers are tech giants such as Amazon, Meta and Google, as well as consulting firms such as Accenture and Deloitte, according to the DHS data. U.S. tech leaders who once held H-1B visas include Satya Nadella, the chairman and chief executive of Microsoft; Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google and its parent company, Alphabet; and Elon Musk.",
      "It was a tried and tested formula that held up for decades, enabling what was the Indian dream.",
      "But on Sept. 19, a surprise proclamation from President Donald Trump increased the fee for new H-1B visa applications to $100,000, up from $2,000 to $5,000 per application.",

      "\u201cThis will create another pressure point in U.S.-India relations,\u201d said Gil Guerra, an immigration policy analyst at the Niskanen Center, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cOne potential consequence of this is another uptick in irregular Indian migration as legal pathways become even harder to pursue.\u201d",

      "A comedy festival in the capital of Saudi Arabia has become a cultural flash point as major comedians face criticism for accepting seemingly lucrative deals to perform in a country that was virtually impossible to visit until 2019 and a pariah in much of the West for its human rights record.",
      "The Riyadh Comedy Festival, which began Friday and runs through Oct. 9, features a variety of big names such as Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari, Pete Davidson, Andrew Schulz, Jo Koy, Bill Burr, Jessica Kirson, Jimmy Carr and Louis C.K.",
      "These comedians, most of them American, are now encountering resistance from some fans, human rights advocates and fellow comics in the industry.",

      "\u201cI mean, how do you even promote that?\u201d Maron said. \u201cLike, \u2018From the folks that brought you 9/11, two weeks of laughter in the desert.

      "The Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., declined to comment. Saudi Arabia\u2019s General Entertainment Authority, which announced the festival in July, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cThe festival is the largest of its kind globally, bringing together a selection of award-winning comedy stars known for their outstanding performances on international stages and streaming platforms,\u201d the Saudi Press Agency wrote in its announcement for the General Entertainment Authority. \u201cIt reflects the efforts to amplify Riyadh\u2019s status as a leading destination for major cultural and artistic events.\u201d",
      "Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich home of Islam\u2019s two holiest sites, was for years among the most socially conservative nations on Earth with a morality police enforcing a strict interpretation of Shariah. In recent years under the rule of de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country expanded its cultural and political influence by diversifying its economy and investing in sports, entertainment and tourism to improve its global image. Along with this, the crown prince oversaw a sweeping crackdown on dissent \u2014 imprisoning disgruntled royals, women\u2019s rights advocates, and reforming clerics as well as adherents to previously government-sanctioned proponents of strict Wahhabi Islam.",
      "Celebrities and influencers have often been criticized for performing in the country or participating in tourism campaigns, and FIFA drew condemnation last year for selecting Saudi Arabia to host the 2034 World Cup.",
      "Shane Gillis, who said he was offered an invite, claimed that the organizers \u201cdoubled the bag,\u201d or the amount of money offered, after he declined to participate.",
      "\u201cIt was a significant bag, but I\u2019d already said no,\u201d Gillis said on his podcast. \u201cI took a principled stand.\u201d",

      "In a news release last week, Human Rights Watch wrote that the Saudi government is using the festival \u201cto deflect attention from its brutal repression of free speech and other pervasive human rights violations\u201d and called on the performers \u201cto publicly urge Saudi authorities to free unjustly detained Saudi dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit watchdog organization noted that some of the events land on the seventh anniversary of the assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul by intelligence operatives with close ties to the crown prince. The festival also takes place just months after Saudi authorities executed Turki al-Jasser, a journalist known for exposing corruption within the Saudi royal family.",
      "\u201cThe seventh anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s brutal murder is no laughing matter,\u201d Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cAnd comedians receiving hefty sums from Saudi authorities shouldn\u2019t be silent on prohibited topics in Saudi like human rights or free speech.\u201d",
      "Other listed performers for the festival include: Sebastian Maniscalco, Maz Jobrani, Tom Segura, Whitney Cummings, Jimeoin, Russell Peters, Andrew Santino, Bobby Lee, Chris Distefano, Mark Normand, Gabriel Iglesias, Hannibal Buress, Sam Morril, Jeff Ross, Omid Djalili, Ali Siddiq, Zarna Garg, Chris Tucker and Ben Hart.",
      "These performers did not respond to requests for comment.",

In the U.S., relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 terror attacks have accused the Saudi government of having potential ties to the attack. (A direct link has not been proven.)",
      "But it has also made significant inroads with some powerful figures in the West, most notably the Trump family. President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner worked with the Saudis to secure a $2 billion investment in his firm and recently partnered with the country\u2019s public investment fund to strike a $55 billion deal to take the video game giant Electronic Arts private.

      "At least one comedian, however, appears to have changed his mind despite initially agreeing to perform.

      "It had all been going so well, with the pomp of President Donald Trump\u2019s state visit and Prince Harry\u2019s tea with King Charles III building a sense of a family steadied after a litany of crises. Then came the fallout.",
      "Harry has accused unnamed palace figures of \u201csabotage\u201d and of planting false accounts of his meeting with his father. Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson face renewed scrutiny over ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Meanwhile, Prince William opened up about what he called \u201cthe hardest year\u201d of his life.",
      "Together, the stories have jolted the palace narrative from triumph to turbulence \u2014 with Harry\u2019s latest clash with the British media at the center of the storm.",
      "Britain\u2019s The Sun newspaper claimed last week that Harry\u2019s first meeting with the king in two years was \u201cdistinctly formal,\u201d claiming the prince had expressed feeling more like an \u201cofficial visitor\u201d than a son.",
      "Harry\u2019s camp rejected that outright.",
      "\u201cRecent reporting of The Duke\u2019s view of the tone of the meeting, is categorically false,\u201d a spokesperson told NBC News, referring to Harry\u2019s title, Duke of Sussex. \u201cThe quotes attributed to him are pure invention fed, one can only assume, by sources intent on sabotaging any reconciliation between father and son.\u201d",
      "The public feud over the meeting has only deepened tensions at a moment when the family is seeking to project unity, and it could set back attempts to mend the relationship, according to NBC News royal commentator Daisy McAndrew.",
      "\u201cI think the king will be really disappointed,\u201d she said.",
      "Harry had earlier sounded eager to build on the brief tea, emphasizing his desire to spend more time with his father while defending his tell-all memoir in an interview with Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper following that trip to the U.K.",
      "The accusations from Harry\u2019s camp came just a week after the family showcased its finest pomp and pageantry during Trump\u2019s state visit \u2014 a triumph quickly overshadowed by a return to all-too-familiar controversy.",
      "While Trump\u2019s trip was only briefly marred by the Epstein scandal, the subject was soon back on newspaper front pages with new royal revelations.",
      "The king has instructed Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, the Duke and Duchess of York, that they will not be welcome at the royal Christmas, according to weekend reports in Britain\u2019s Telegraph and Sunday Times newspapers that cited multiple sources.",
      "Buckingham Palace did not respond to requests for comment on the report and on the statement from Harry\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "That comes after Ferguson was dropped as a patron by a number of charities following a newly surfaced email that revealed she had referred to Epstein as a \u201csupreme friend,\u201d despite the disgraced financier\u2019s conviction on sex offenses. A spokesperson for the duchess said the email was sent to counter a threat Epstein had made to sue her and accuse her of defamation.",
      "The disclosure reignited scrutiny of royal ties to Epstein, long centered on Andrew.",
      "The palace will hope, McAndrew said, that something else will \u201ccome along to take the attention away.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem with Andrew is he\u2019s always grabbing the attention back,\u201d she said.",
      "While at odds with itself in recent years, the royal family has also been buffeted by external crises.",

      "\u201cI\u2019d say 2024 was the hardest year I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said, speaking to \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d star Eugene Levy on his show \u201cThe Reluctant Traveler.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The giants of the Amazon are getting even bigger.",
      "A sweeping, new study has found the rainforest\u2019s largest trees are not only holding their ground, but they\u2019re thriving \u2014 growing, multiplying in number and continuing to play a major role in mitigating the impacts of climate change.",
      "There was a 3.3% expansion in big trees per decade, scientists found, after tracking changes in 188 intact forest plots across the Amazon over the past 30 years.",
      "Led by almost 100 researchers from 60 universities in Brazil, the U.K. and elsewhere, the findings were published Thursday in the journal Nature Plants.",
      "The authors attributed the growth to the rising amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the burning of gas, oil and coal.",
      "The paper was welcomed as evidence of forest resilience in the face of climate change, but scientists warned these big trees remain vulnerable as droughts, lightning and fires are increasing in frequency, while deforestation continues to pose a serious threat.",
      "There was an understanding that big trees were \u201cexpected to be vulnerable to climate change,\u201d Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert, one of the study\u2019s lead authors, told NBC News in a telephone interview Saturday. \u201cWhat we see here is actually they seem to be showing quite a resilience.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing signs of them dying off,\u201d said Esquivel-Muelbert, who co-authored the study while at Britain\u2019s University of Birmingham but has since moved to the nearby University of Cambridge. \u201cThey are increasing in size and number as well.\u201d",
      "Scientists stressed that while protecting intact forest areas was essential to stabilizing the climate, the Amazon cannot on its own offset the vast amount of carbon dioxide produced worldwide by cars, factories and power stations \u2014 and it remains under threat.",
      "The rainforest is a carbon sink, meaning it stores more carbon than it produces. Pushing the rainforest past its limit could accelerate climate change and have terrible consequences for local communities, including Indigenous groups who depend on it.",
      "Esquivel-Muelbert stressed it was difficult to predict how worsening climate change would have an impact in the future, and hesitated to say that increased CO2 benefited the forest, warning it may cause bigger trees to become more exposed to other factors like drought.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know the consequences in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Other factors, including deforestation, remain a colossal risk to the health of the Amazon.",
      "Fattening trees is, in some ways, a \u201cpositive news story,\u201d said Rebecca Banbury Morgan, a lead author of the study from the University of Bristol. But it also means that the forest is now \u201cmore vulnerable to losing those trees.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough we have shown that trees in intact forest are still increasing in size, any benefits of this in terms of the carbon sink can be quite easily negated by deforestation and logging impacts, so preserving these intact forests is really a priority,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "Wildfires, deforestation and global warming could permanently destroy the water cycle that sustains parts of the Amazon rainforest if action is not taken in the coming decades, according to a separate study published last year in Nature.",
      "The study suggested that 10% to 47% of the landscape is at risk of transitioning away from rainforest by 2050 if warming and rates of deforestation aren\u2019t dramatically curbed.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Congress approved a bill in 2023 to relax environmental licensing to pave a highway cutting through the heart of the Amazon, and close to one of the last regions that still has large areas of pristine forest.",
      "Losing a large portion of the Amazon could turn a key carbon sink into a source of emissions, as wildfires burn and plants and animals decompose, no longer able to survive."

      "All but three of the 43 vessels being tracked online by the Global Sumud Flotilla were listed as having been confirmed or assumed to have been stopped by Israeli forces on Thursday, with a total of 443 people \u201cforcibly taken from their vessels,\u201d organizers said in a statement.",
      "At least one of the vessels, the Mikeno, sailing under the French flag, appeared to reach just off Gaza\u2019s coast, according to the online tracker, although Global Sumud Flotilla said they had lost communication with the vessel.",
      "Another ship, the Marinette, sailing under a Polish flag, was still in communication, with six passengers onboard, they added.",
      "Israel\u2019s foreign ministry said only \u201cone last vessel\u201d remained at a distance. \u201cIf it approaches, its attempt to enter an active combat zone and breach the blockade will also be prevented,\u201d it said in a post on X.",
      "The hundreds of people detained would be taken to Israel and deported to Europe, it added.",
      "In an earlier video posted by the foreign ministry, Thunberg could be seen seated, wearing a keffiyeh and putting on her signature frog hat, with someone in military garb kneeling beside her.",
      "Referring to the flotilla as the \"Hamas-Sumud flotilla,\" the foreign ministry said several vessels had been stopped, with those onboard being transferred to an Israeli port. \"Greta and her friends are safe and healthy,\" it said, adding in a later post that deportation procedures to Europe were expected to begin once passengers arrived in Israel.",
      "Some 500 people have taken part in the Global Sumud Flotilla, seeking to deliver a symbolic aid package to the besieged enclave and send a message of resistance by breaking through Israel's naval blockade of the territory.",
      "Israel has maintained a land, air and sea blockade on Gaza since 2007, when Hamas seized power in the enclave.",
      "The flotilla was intercepted as Israeli forces continued their devastating assault on Gaza City, where scores of people have been killed in recent days and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. Deaths from starvation have also continued to rise, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Wednesday said the military had completed seizing the Nitzarim corridor to Gaza\u2019s shoreline and was cutting the enclave \u201cin two from north to south.\u201d",
      "He said this was the \u201clast opportunity\u201d for Palestinians in Gaza City to move south \u2014 and that those who remain will be considered \u201cterrorists and supporters of terror\u201d as Israeli forces carry out their assault at \u201cfull strength.\u201d",
      "The world is awaiting a response from Hamas to the peace plan unveiled by President Donald Trump alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week.",
      "With global outrage mounting over Israel's assault on Gaza, the flotilla has been backed by sizable protests in the streets of European cities.",
      "The fleet has been beset by a number of incidents, including explosions, harassment by drones and jamming of communications, which activists say appeared to have been attempts to hinder the ships\u2019 movements.",
      "\u201cPrior to illegally boarding the ships, it appears as though the Israeli naval vessels intentionally damaged ship communications, in an attempt to block distress signals and stop the live-stream of their illegal boat boarding,\u201d the press office for the flotilla said in a statement.",
      "Greg Stoker, an American veteran aboard one of the boats, said around a dozen naval vessels with their transponders off had approached them while they were about 70 or 80 nautical miles from the Gaza coast.",
      "\u201cThey are currently hailing our vessels, telling us to turn off our engines and await further instructions, or our boats will be seized and we will face the consequences,\u201d Stoker, wearing a red life jacket, said in a shaky video posted on Instagram.",
      "A video posted on a Telegram media account associated with the flotilla appears to show one of its ships being sprayed with water with an on-screen caption saying the vessel is being \u201cwater canoned.\u201d Another post on the Telegram channel said one of the ships had \u201cbeen deliberately rammed at sea.\u201d",
      "Miriam Azem, the international advocacy coordinator for Adalah, the human rights organization and legal center helping represent the flotilla, said the \"aggressive tactics\" only add to the \"illegality of this interception.\"",
      "\"This interception, regardless of the way it was carried out, is unlawful. It\u2019s an abduction from the high seas, from international waters where Israel has no jurisdiction whatsoever,\" she said in a phone interview Thursday.",
      "The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea stipulates that a state has jurisdiction only up to 12 nautical miles from its shores. In general, states don\u2019t have the right to seize ships in international waters, though armed conflict is an exception.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Tony Blair.",
      "A political titan who remains Britain\u2019s most successful postwar leader, or a disgraced scourge of the Middle East who should never be allowed near the region again.",
      "Depending on who you speak with, the man now set for a central role in President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza could conjure either reaction.",
      "The proposal will see Blair, 72, join Trump as co-chair of a \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d \u2014 an international body that would oversee the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip after its devastation at the hands of the Israeli military.",
      "Blair won three consecutive elections between 1997 and 2005, standing down two years later having never been defeated at the ballot box.",
      "Some in Britain laud his landmark achievements such as introducing the minimum wage, pouring investment into public services and helping secure peace in Northern Ireland. But for many others, his name is a byword for the Iraq War, having used flawed intelligence to defy public opposition and join President George W. Bush in the 2003 invasion that is now widely viewed as disastrous.",
      "Blair called Trump\u2019s proposal \u201cbold and intelligent,\" saying in a statement it could \"end the war, bring immediate relief to Gaza.\" It brings the \"chance of a brighter and better future for its people, while ensuring Israel\u2019s absolute and enduring security and the release of all hostages.\"",
      "That came after Trump revealed Blair wanted to be on the board, calling him a \u201cgood man, very good man.\u201d",
      "Blair's post-Iraq career includes a stint as global Middle East envoy, but even figures within his old Labour Party conceded that the potential appointment would \u201craise some eyebrows,\u201d as its serving Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC on Tuesday.",
      "Indeed, among Palestinians, the reaction \u201cis not positive, to say the least,\u201d according to H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank based in London. \u201cBlair continues to be associated in the public consciousness with the Iraq War.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s a leader with \u201ca lot of baggage, obviously,\u201d agreed Michael Wahid Hanna, the U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cIt\u2019s just utterly peculiar as to what he\u2019s doing here,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of people are confused by that.\u201d",
      "Blair remains one of the most divisive names in British politics, despite having left the stage almost 20 years ago.",
      "He roared into public view in the 1990s, winning the Labour Party leadership contest after the sudden death of his predecessor, John Smith.",
      "He set about making radical changes, scrapping the left-wing party\u2019s commitment to public ownership and sparking a bitter debate between those who saw this as the pragmatism needed to win elections, or the abandonment of progressive values.",
      "After a historic landslide in 1997 that ousted the long-ruling Conservative Party, he set about remaking Britain with the minimum wage and Northern Ireland peace, but also in landmark laws advancing LGBTQ equality and the social safety net.",
      "None would define his legacy like following Bush into Iraq, however. Like in the United States, it still unites many conservatives and liberals in their (in some cases retroactive) opposition and revulsion.",
      "The Iraq War saw Blair\u2019s premiership end in 2007 under a cloud of anger \u2014 and, from the most vehement critics, accusations that he was a war criminal after hundreds of thousands of people died in the conflict, which was not sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council or in accordance with the U.N.\u2019s founding charter.",
      "A landmark British 2016 inquiry found the basis for going to war was \u201cfar from satisfactory.\u201d After that chastening conclusion, Blair expressed \u201csorrow, regret and apology\u201d and took \u201cfull responsibility without exception or excuse\u201d for the war\u2019s tragic consequences. He said he went to war in \u201cgood faith,\u201d believing the threat of Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction to be real and wanting to rid the Iraqi people of the \u201cevil\u201d of Saddam Hussein.",
      "\u201cTony Blair was extremely helpful to President Trump as he developed this plan for a durable peace, and he shares the President\u2019s vision of a better life for Israelis and Palestinians alike. He would make an exceptional addition to the Board of Peace \u2014 but first, Hamas must accept this deal to end the war,\" White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly told NBC News in a statement.",
      "Blair\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the criticism surrounding his proposed appointment.",
      "Blair's involvement with the Middle East did not end with the war.",
      "On the day he stepped down, he announced he was to become special envoy to the Quartet, a supranational group comprising the United Nations, the United States, the European Union and Russia, which sought a resolution between Israel and the Palestinians. He resigned in 2015 having made little headway.",
      "The next year, he founded the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, which has grown into a behemoth of more than 800 staff in some 40 countries.",
      "The nonprofit institute has been criticized for working with authoritarian governments such as Saudi Arabia and Rwanda. Blair has previously defended his work in these countries by saying his institute focused on positive forces for change, even if those were in countries with imperfect human rights records.",
      "At the head of this institute, Blair has continued to cultivate strong networks from the Middle East to Washington and has reportedly been involved in backchannel discussions over Gaza in the past year.",
      "Whatever his credentials, the idea of Western leaders parachuting in to govern Gaza \u2014 with questions over what, if any, role Palestinians will play \u2014 makes many observers nervous.",
      "\u201cThe construct is pseudo colonial; all of these outside powers are somehow creating a new protectorate,\u201d said Hanna at the International Crisis Group. \u201cSo it\u2019s very strange and it\u2019s really not clear how that\u2019s going to work.\u201d",
      "Hellyer likened Blair\u2019s proposed role to that of the viceroys used by empires such as Britain to oversee India and other colonies.",
      "\u201cPeople who are not connected to Gaza or the West Bank or Palestine at all are going to be governing Gaza with very minimal Palestinian involvement,\u201d he said. \u201cSo Blair or no Blair, I think that that\u2019s going to be something that will be difficult to politically justify.\u201d"

      "The Wall Street Journal first reported the administration\u2019s plans.",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric on Russia has shifted over the past month. He has criticized Moscow, calling it a \u201cpaper tiger\u201d that has proved unable to defeat its smaller neighbor.",
      "After Trump publicly clashed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, the United States suspended intelligence-sharing with Kyiv in March for about a week. The suspension rattled Ukraine\u2019s government and European allies because Kyiv heavily relies on American intelligence for its war effort.",
      "With increasingly sophisticated drones and missiles, Ukraine has stepped up sabotage attacks on pipelines, refineries and other energy infrastructure deep inside Russian territory. The attacks are beginning to inflict significant damage on Russia\u2019s energy sector, analysts say.",

      "More than 1,000 silver and gold coins collectively valued at about $1 million were recovered from an 18th-century shipwreck off the coast of Florida, a shipwreck salvage company said.",
      "The company, 1715 Fleet Queens Jewels, LLC, stated in a news release that it recovered the coins in July off the southeastern region of the state, the so-called Treasure Coast.",
      "The discovery is allegedly part of the $400 million worth of gold, silver and jewels lost by the Spanish fleet during a hurricane in 1715, the company said.",
      "\"This discovery is not only about the treasure itself, but the stories it tells,\u201d Sal Guttuso, the company's director of operations, said in the news release. \"Each coin is a piece of history, a tangible link to the people who lived, worked, and sailed during the Golden Age of the Spanish Empire.\"",
      "\"Finding 1,000 of them in a single recovery is both rare and extraordinary,\" he added.",
      "1715 Fleet Queens Jewels stated that the coins \u2014 known as pieces of eight \u2014 were minted in the Spanish colonies of Mexico, Peru, and Bolivia. The company added that many of them still bear visible dates and mint marks, \"making them important to historians and collectors alike.\"",
      "\"The condition of the coins suggests they were part of a single chest or shipment that spilled when the ship broke apart in the hurricane\u2019s fury,\" the press release added.",
      "Guttuso said in a phone call on Thursday that the coins were found scattered in a concentrated area deep in the sand. He added that the coins are believed to have once been in a container, as some of them bear the pattern of a burlap sack imprinted on them.",
      "\"We think they would have had these things in wooden boxes,\" he said, \"and that makes sense because the wooden box degrades in the ocean and, once the box degrades, the sack degrades and the only thing that's left are these silver coins.\"",
      "He added that one of the items found along with the coins is a royal lead seal bearing the impression of Philip II of Spain, who ruled in the mid-to-late 1500s.",
      "\"You can almost assume that this was a family heirloom,\" he said. \"This lead seal probably had an important document around it that may have given that family title to lands or positions.\"",
      "1715 Fleet Queens Jewels \u2014 which claims to own the exclusive salvage rights to the remains of the 1715 treasure fleet \u2014 stated that the recovered coins will undergo careful conservation before being displayed to the public, and that plans are underway for select pieces to be exhibited at local museums.",
      "\"Every find helps piece together the human story of the 1715 fleet,\" Guttuso said. \"We are committed to preserving and studying these artifacts so future generations can appreciate their historical significance.\"",
      "The U.S. District Court of Florida and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' office did not immediately return requests for comment on the discovery."

    "story": [
      "Jane Goodall, a renowned researcher who documented the behavior and social lives of chimpanzees and later became a leader of the animal conservation movement, died Wednesday.",
      "Goodall was 91. She died of natural causes while she was in California as part of a speaking tour, the Jane Goodall Institute announced in a statement.",
      "\"Dr. Goodall\u2019s discoveries as an ethologist revolutionized science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,\" the statement said.",
      "Goodall, who was born in Britain, became famous first for her pioneering work with chimpanzees in Tanzania in the 1960s. She fastidiously documented how the animals lived and interacted in research that would continue over several decades.",
      "She took an \u201cunorthodox approach\u201d to her research of chimpanzees, according to the foundation,  by \u201cimmersing herself in their habitat and their lives to experience their complex society as a neighbor rather than a distant observer.\u201d",
      "Goodall published a study showing that chimps used sticks as tools to fish for termites, which challenged the prevailing idea that humans were the only species capable of using tools. She also documented the animals' communication abilities and complex social behaviors, and she helped establish that they eat meat and sometimes fight with one another.",
      "\"She really established all these fundamentals on chimpanzee behavior we\u2019ve been able to elaborate on in these past few decades,\" said Elodie Freymann, a primatologist who is a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University.",
      "Robert Seyfarth, a professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania who studied primate behavior, said Goodall's death \"marks the end of an era.\"",
      "\u201cHer careful, detailed observation and reports really got a whole generation of us \u2014 me included \u2014 and many others interested in this as a field of scientific endeavor,\u201d Seyfarth said.",
      "He said Goodall was among the first researchers to make close observations of chimpanzees as individuals with personalities and quirks, at a time when other scientists were not trained to observe such specific details.",
      "\"Her perceptions of the emotions of chimpanzees was pathbreaking,\" he said, adding that Goodall was an \"honest chronicler\" of the species' behavior \u2014 both of the ways they cared for one another and of their fighting and killing.",
      "\"Her agenda was to have people understand chimpanzees in all their complexity,\" Seyfarth said.",
      "As Goodall's career progressed and she saw how habitat destruction and illegal trafficking threatened the survival of chimpanzees, she made conservation and animal welfare a focus of her work.",
      "As the Jane Goodall Institute, which she founded in 1977, put it, Goodall \u201cwent into the forest to study the remarkable lives of chimpanzees \u2014 and she came out of the forest to save them.\u201d",
      "Ingrid Newkirk, founder of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said in a statement that Goodall helped the organization \"end the confinement of chimpanzees locked in barren, solid metal chambers for experiments.\"",
      "Goodall was just 26 when she visited Tanzania for the first time to study chimpanzees. She began her career without scientific training, after Louis Leakey, a prominent Kenyan-British anthropologist, hired her to record her observations of chimpanzees. Goodall would later receive a doctoral degree from the University of Cambridge.",
      "In an interview on the podcast \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d this year, Goodall told host Alex Cooper that her first expedition was on a shoestring budget funded by a philanthropist.",
      "Goodall had six months of funding, and the first four months were fruitless as the primates were too skittish to allow her to get close enough for observation. But one of the animals finally adjusted to her presence long enough for her to make the breakthrough discovery that chimpanzees create and use tools.",
      "\u201cThe reason why this was so exciting was because, at that time, it was thought by Western science that only humans used and made tools. We were defined as man, the toolmaker,\u201d Goodall recalled. \u201cAnd so when I wrote to my mentor, Louis Leakey, he was just so excited.\u201d",
      "That discovery piqued the interest of \u2014 and funding from \u2014 National Geographic and ultimately changed the course of Goodall\u2019s career.",
      "As Goodall became a prominent figure, she used her celebrity to advance animal causes and public interest in science. She wrote dozens of books about her interactions with chimpanzees, including many children's books.",
      "Freymann, the primatologist, recalled dressing up as Goodall for Halloween in the fourth grade. Later, as a 19-year-old intern at the Jane Goodall Institute in Washington, D.C., she read through piles fan mail from children, she said.",
      "\"I'm a primatologist because I had a hero I could look up to,\" said Freymann, who is now 29. \"She encouraged my entire generation to go out and do it. ... She set the course of my entire life professionally and the values I believe in.\"",
      "CORRECTION (Oct. 1, 2025, 11:38 p.m. ET): Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article referred to primatologist Elodie Freymann as \u201che.\u201d Freymann is female."

      "More than 150 American doctors, nurses and other medical workers who volunteered in Gaza over the past nearly two years called on the Trump administration Wednesday to end its support for Israel's war in the besieged enclave.",
      "In a letter addressed to President Donald Trump and shared exclusively with NBC News, the 152 American health workers described their experiences and called on the administration to end the U.S.\u2019 \u201cmilitary, economic and diplomatic support\u201d for Israel\u2019s offensive.",
      "\u201cThis is the right thing to do, and we believe it is required under both American and international law,\u201d says the letter from doctors who have volunteered in Gaza with organizations including M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or Doctors Without Borders, MedGlobal and the International Medical Corps.",
      "Dr. Feroze Sidhwa, a trauma surgeon based in Stockton, California, who organized the letter, said in a phone interview: \u201cEverybody that goes over there is horrified by what they see. And you know, most of us know that it\u2019s mostly American weapons that are being used.\u201d",
      "According to health officials in the enclave, Israeli forces have killed more than 65,000 Palestinians since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage.",
      "The U.S. approved at least $17.9 billion in security assistance for Israeli military operations in Gaza and elsewhere from Oct. 7, 2023, through September 2024, according to estimates from Brown University\u2019s Costs of War Project.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very strange to know that your government is sending the weapons that you\u2019re pulling out of kids\u2019 faces,\u201d Sidhwa said, noting the U.S.\u2019 role as Israel\u2019s closest ally and biggest arms supplier.",
      "The letter, which was sent to Trump\u2019s office Wednesday by email and physically mailed the same day, comes two days after the president unveiled a peace plan alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he said could end the war in Gaza and lead to the release of hostages.",
      "Hamas has signaled it will respond to the peace plan soon. If the group, which has run Gaza since 2007, rejects it, Trump warned, Israel would have U.S. backing to \u201cfinish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas.\u201d",
      "Dr. Kathleen Gallagher, a general and acute care surgeon in Grand Forks, North Dakota, who signed the letter, left Gaza a few days ago after having spent more than three weeks there. Gallagher, an Army veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq who has also worked in Ukraine, said that what she witnessed in Gaza was \u201cfar and above the worst, just the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",
      "Nothing prepared her for \u201cjust the absolute scale of destruction\u201d and the \u201cscope of the displacement,\u201d she said. Malnutrition appeared widespread, while every day Nasser Hospital, where she spent most of time, was flooded with the wounded and the dead.",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza spiraled this past year under Israel\u2019s offensive and aid blockade, with the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger declaring famine in areas of the enclave\u2019s north in August.",
      "Gallagher said nearly half of the patients she treated were gunshot victims. She added almost all of them had been struck while seeking aid.",
      "Those shot were \u201cdisproportionately young males\u201d with injuries often including single shots to the head and \u201clots of very accurate neck shots.\u201d",
      "In one case, she said, a 6-month-old girl was brought to the facility after having been as her mother tried to get aid. The baby did not survive.",
      "Gallagher said around 45% of the patients she saw had suffered \u201cexplosive injuries.\u201d",
      "Dr. Thaer Ahmad, an emergency physician, who also signed the letter, said doctors and other medical workers spent the past nearly two years treating patients with a health care system under relentless attack \u2014 and with scarce supplies with limited aid coming in.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve tried to serve their people in just this absolutely heroic way, but they\u2019ve been targeted this entire time,\u201d he said in a phone interview.",
      "None of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals are fully functioning, with 14 providing partial services, according to World Health Organization data. Meanwhile, the wider health system, including ambulances and field hospitals, has been attacked more than 780 times, with more than 1,500 health workers killed, according to the United Nations.",
      "Israel says Hamas uses hospitals and medical centers for military activities, including as \u201ccommand and control\u201d hubs, opening them to attack. Hamas has denied doing so, while humanitarian groups and the U.N., have said Israel has not provided sufficient evidence to substantiate its claims.",
      "The letter\u2019s signers also said they had never seen \u201cany type of Palestinian militant activity\u201d in Gaza\u2019s hospitals or other health care facilities during their combined more than 460 weeks working within the health system. Sidhwa said he was aware of just one U.S. doctor having treated someone who appeared to be a combatant at one point but said that did not suggest activity within the hospital.",
      "Sidhwa, who also organized multiple letters to the Biden administration, said he was hopeful the voices of more than 150 American medical workers who have experienced Israel\u2019s offensive on the ground would have some impact on the Trump administration, despite Washington\u2019s stalwart support for Israel and its offensive.",
      "\u201cMost of the doctors that come back think it\u2019s traumatic,\u201d Sidhwa said. \u201cBut for me, it\u2019s not the death and the guts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really just knowing that we\u2019re responsible for it.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump's peace plan was met with cautious optimism Tuesday by leaders across the Middle East and the world, but others were more skeptical about the proposal \u2014 and whether it would be welcomed by Hamas.",
      "The plan was unveiled by Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after talks that appeared to exclude Hamas, with the militant group saying \u201cnot a single Palestinian\u201d had seen the plan before it was announced.",
      "Trump said Tuesday that Hamas had \"three or four days\" to respond to the plan, adding that there would be \"not much\" room for negotiation. If Hamas were to reject the deal, he told reporters as he departed the White House, he would let Israel \"go and do what they have to do.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Qatari Foreign Affairs Ministry said that mediators Qatar and Egypt delivered Trump\u2019s plan to Hamas on Monday in Doha and that a discussion would take place later Tuesday.",
      "As the world awaited Hamas' response, global powers lined up behind the U.S.-backed plan to end the Israeli assault and free hostages still held in the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "In a joint statement, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan welcomed the 20-point plan, calling Trump's efforts \"sincere.\"",
      "It also received support from Europe, where a number of countries had recently defied Washington to formally recognize Palestinian statehood. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron urged Hamas to agree to the plan, while Germany and the European Union itself offered public backing.",
      "Trump branded the moment a \u201chistoric day for peace\u201d \u2014 but he warned that if the militant group did not agree to the proposal, Israel would have U.S. backing to \u201cfinish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas.\u201d",
      "Ismail Al-Thawabta, head of Gaza's Hamas-run government media office, called the plan an \"attempt to impose a new form of guardianship\" on the besieged enclave. But Hamas said Tuesday that it would study the plan before providing its official response, The Associated Press news agency reported.",
      "The plan would require Hamas members to lay down their arms, a demand the group has previously rejected.",
      "The Palestinian Authority, which partially runs the occupied West Bank, welcomed the plan, praising Trump for his \"sincere and tireless efforts\" to \"end the war on Gaza\" and reiterating its commitment to making reforms that could pave the way for a future Palestinian state.",
      "Under the plan, Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza would end immediately once it\u2019s agreed by both sides, with all hostages, alive and dead, to be released within a 72-hour period. The plan says no one will be forced to leave Gaza.",
      "A pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood is outlined as a possibility \u2014 but not a guarantee.",
      "And hours after announcing the plan alongside Trump, Netanyahu vowed again to oppose a Palestinian state. \"Instead of Hamas isolating us, we turned the tables and isolated Hamas,\" Netanyahu said in a Hebrew video discussing his U.S. trip.",
      "Diana Buttu, a Palestinian lawyer and former adviser to Yasser Arafat\u2019s Palestinian Liberation Organization, said Palestinians and leaders across the Middle East had little choice but to accept the plan.",
      "She nonetheless criticized it as having \u201cnot a single guarantee\u201d for the people of Gaza, who would be overseen by an international security force and a transitional authority chaired by Trump.",
      "\"Because everybody wants to see an end to the genocide, you're going to see that so many people are going to welcome this plan,\"  Buttu told NBC News in a phone interview.",
      "But, she said, \"there\u2019s not a single guarantee that\u2019s being given to Palestinians, not one.\" Buttu added that she had little faith in the possibility that the plan if executed would lead to internationally recognized Palestinian statehood.",
      "In Gaza, weary Palestinians have long been desperate to see an end to Israel\u2019s deadly offensive in the enclave.",
      "\u201cLife is unbearable, there\u2019s nothing \u2014 no food, no drinks no clothes,\u201d Abdallah Qamar told the AP last week from famine-stricken Gaza City, where Israel has been carrying out a sweeping ground offensive.",
      "In Israel, the plan to end the assault is likely to be welcomed by many within a populace increasingly critical of the war. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of hostages, welcomed the plan.",
      "For Ilay David, whose brother Evyatar remains in captivity in Gaza and is believed to be alive, the plan offers a glimmer of hope.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m trying not to get my expectations too high. I try to protect my soul because in this very long journey it happened many, many times that we saw this maybe a resolution to this issue. And then boom, something collapses, something is messed up and everything goes much much back. I pray. I pray,\u201d he told NBC News in an interview.",
      "He added, \u201cTo see the support worldwide from side to side in Israel and abroad, maybe it is different.\u201d",
      "The proposal is unlikely to win favor, however, among the far-right members of Netanyahu's fragile government coalition upon whom his leadership relies.",
      "In a lengthy post on X on Tuesday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he believed Trump's plan would only \"end in tears,\" calling early celebrations \"absurd.\"",
      "On that, Buttu agreed, condemning the apparent lack of involvement of Palestinians in the bid to determine their future.",
      "\"They're deciding and talking about Palestinians, but never to Palestinians \u2014 and that's the part that is truly terrifying.\""

      "Five homes on North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks collapsed amid warnings of dangerous surf as a pair of hurricanes passed far off the U.S. East Coast, officials said Tuesday, and authorities in Bermuda said that the worst was yet to come.",
      "Hurricane Humberto was already affecting Bermuda with winds of around 25 mph, Phil Rogers, director of the Bermuda Weather Service, said in a briefing early Tuesday afternoon.",
      "But behind Humberto was Hurricane Imelda, which strengthened to a Category 1 storm Tuesday and was expected to bring hurricane conditions Wednesday night into Thursday, officials said.",
      "Of the two, Imelda is \u201cthe storm of greatest concern to us,\u201d said Michael Weeks, Bermuda\u2019s minister of national security.",
      "\u201cBermuda, I cannot overstate the seriousness of this threat,\u201d he said.",
      "The storm is to bring hurricane-force winds for four to six hours overnight Wednesday into Thursday, Weeks said.",
      "Neither Humberto nor Imelda hit the U.S., and they stayed out to sea. Imelda was centered east of Florida and was forecast to keep moving northeast toward Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center said.",
      "But the storms still created danger for the U.S. East Coast, bringing strong surf and rip currents, the hurricane center said.",
      "In Buxton on the Outer Banks, five homes \u2014 all unoccupied \u2014 collapsed Tuesday afternoon, Cape Hatteras National Seashore said on Facebook. The homes collapsed between 2 p.m. and 2:45 p.m., it said. There were no injuries reported.",
      "Two people died in Cuba due to Imelda, which earlier affected the eastern part of the island nation, Cuban Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said late Monday. Marrero said on X that the two people died in Santiago de Cuba province, but he didn\u2019t give any details.",
      "Hurricane Humberto, churning in open waters, was thought to cause Imelda to abruptly turn to the east-northeast, away from the Southeastern U.S. coast.",
      "\u201cThis is really what\u2019s going to be saving the United States from really seeing catastrophic rainfall,\u201d said Alex DaSilva, lead hurricane expert for AccuWeather, a private U.S. weather forecasting company.",
      "Because the two storms were so close, they are subject to each other\u2019s influence in a phenomenon called the Fujiwhara effect.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen that often to get two storms this close together \u2014 especially two strong ones,\u201d Andy Hazelton, a hurricane modeler and associate scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies at the University of Miami, said earlier this week.",
      "Officials in the Carolinas prepared for the effects of the storms on their shores.",
      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein declared a state of emergency even before Imelda formed, which allows for state aid, and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said authorities were pre-positioning search-and-rescue crews.",
      "Both hurricanes are expected to cause life-threatening swells on parts of the U.S. East Coast for the next few days, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said.",
      "In Florida, crews found a couple of turtle hatchlings that rough surf had tossed ashore.",
      "\u201cWe actually had two washbacks come in over the weekend,\u201d said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach. \u201cWe may get more as the day goes along.\u201d",
      "Imelda had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and was around 665 miles west-southwest of Bermuda around 5 p.m. Tuesday, the hurricane center said in a bulletin. It was moving east-northeast at 12 mph."

      "The agencies did not say exactly how many people were presented with the gifts, which a spokesperson for the New Zealand Intelligence Community described as \u201ca challenge coin display stand\u201d of which the pistols formed \u201cpart of the design.\u201d",
      "Inoperable weapons that can be modified or amended to be made operable are illegal to possess under New Zealand law. An additional permit, beyond a regular gun license, is required to possess a pistol.",

      "The embattled leader is set to tell his restive Labour Party that it is in a \u201cfight for the soul of our country\" in an address Tuesday at its annual conference in Liverpool.",
      "Starmer, 63, faces threats from all sides.",
      "The Reform U.K. party, led by Nigel Farage, a staunch ally and friend of President Donald Trump, is leading the polls. He has capitalized on discontent over the cost of living, which has risen amid concern over immigration.",
      "It is a familiar story across Europe, where mainstream centrists such as France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and Germany\u2019s Friedrich Merz are being outpolled by nationalists and populists on the hard right.",
      "Starmer\u2019s attempted fightback has been to reject Farage \u2014 whom he called \u201cracist\u201d this week \u2014 but also to deploy tougher talk on immigration himself.",
      "He is set to tell the party in Liverpool that it must make \u201cdecisions that will not always be comfortable for our party. Yet at the end of this hard road there will be a new country, a fairer country, a land of dignity and respect,\u201d according to a partial transcript the party released ahead of time.",
      "Starmer \"needs to stamp his authority on the party and show he has a political story to tell that they can rally round,\" said Anand Menon, director of the U.K. in a Changing Europe think tank and a professor at King's College London.",
      "Not only has that strategy so far failed to shift Starmer\u2019s dismal polling, but it has also triggered dismay from Labour\u2019s traditional left-of-center support base. It accuses him of abandoning Labour\u2019s foundational liberal values.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he turns it around by leaning into Reform party rhetoric, which presents migrants and asylum-seekers as the fundamental problem in Britain \u2014 they\u2019re not,\u201d said Scott Lucas, a politics professor at University College Dublin.",
      "\u201cBritain\u2019s fundamental problem is economic,\u201d Lucas told NBC News. And so the question for Starmer is: \u201cCan you return to Labor\u2019s focus on public services, on competence and on finding a way forward which relies more on consensus rather than division?\u201d he added.",
      "The Labour Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Starmer's negative polling and the criticism of his leadership.",
      "The world\u2019s sixth-largest economy is suffering from years of sluggish growth and stubborn inflation that is forecast to be the highest this year among the G-7, a club of Western nations that includes the United States and Canada.",
      "As in the United States, that has driven up prices for everyday goods, but real wages in Britain have stagnated since the global financial crisis of 2008. Subsequent budget cuts have left public services such as the National Heath Service crumbling in the face of rising demand.",
      "During last year's election, Starmer promised the British public that he would not raise taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d \u2014 including income tax. But economic headwinds have fueled speculation that he may be forced into a U-turn in November's annual budget. Starmer has already been forced into humiliating climbdowns on pensioners' winter fuel payments and welfare reform.",
      "He has also announced the introduction of digital ID cards \u2014 an attempt to clamp down on people working illegally that has been criticized by civil liberties groups \u2014 as well as formal recognition of Palestinian statehood, which has caused friction with Trump and whose critics say is too little, too late.",
      "Though Starmer is technically safe until 2029, the scheduled date of the next election, he could come under threat before then if his party decides his leadership has become too toxic. The Labour Party conference this week has been awash with rumors that Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester often described in British media as \u201cthe King of the North,\u201d could mount a leadership challenge.",
      "Burnham has cooled that talk, but even so, it has been a tumultuous year for Starmer\u2019s internal operation.",
      "During the election, he ran on a platform of decency and abiding by the rules, an antithesis to the scandal-plagued ruling Conservative Party.",
      "That narrative has been weakened by a series of ministerial resignations, culminating in that of Starmer\u2019s deputy, Angela Rayner, after it was revealed she underpaid property taxes.",
      "Starmer has also carried out a radical overhaul of his internal communications team in a bid to reverse his downward fortunes. On Tuesday, his press office said his speech would mark a \u201cfork in the road\u201d for the country.",
      "\u201cThe question is, fork-in-the-road moment for what?\u201d said Lucas, of University College Dublin. \u201cThere\u2019s a fork-in-the-road moment for Labour, at least in terms of where are we going to go with the question of immigration and a proper asylum system. Can Starmer show that he still has authority within the party when you\u2019ve got a rising hard right?\u201d"

      "\u201cI think we are very close,\u201d Trump said at the White House. But if Hamas fails to agree to the plan, he said, Israel could continue its campaign. \"Bibi, you'd have our full backing to do what you would have to do,\" he added.",
      "The 20-point U.S. plan to end the war begins with an immediate ceasefire and proposes that Hamas release all of the hostages within 72 hours in exchange for a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops with the aim of a permanent ceasefire, according to the White House.",
      "Hamas members who commit to peace and lay down their arms would be given amnesty, offering them a pathway to rejoin civilian life, while those who wish to leave Gaza would be offered safe passage, the White House said.",
      "Full humanitarian aid would resume, administered by the United Nations and its organizations, the Red Crescent and other groups. According to the plan, Gaza would be redeveloped \"for the benefit of the people of Gaza.\"",
      "\u201cI hope that we\u2019re going to have a deal for peace, and if Hamas rejects the deal, which is always possible, they\u2019re the only one left,\u201d Trump said. \u201cEveryone else has accepted it.\u201d",
      "Trump had sounded optimistic in an exclusive interview with NBC News on Sunday ahead of the crucial talks.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing very well. It looks like there is a really good chance for peace in the Middle East,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody is on board. Everybody.\u201d",
      "White House special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner have been closely involved in the process, along with Vice President JD Vance and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Trump told reporters.",
      "He also said he would chair a temporary transitional oversight body for Gaza, known as the Board of Peace, alongside former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and other high-profile participants.",
      "The Palestinian Authority said in a statement on Monday that it welcomed the plan and \"stresses the importance of partnership with the United States in achieving peace in the region,\" according to the Wafa news agency.",
      "Israel has faced mounting global isolation and outrage, with a host of Western powers embracing Palestinian statehood in defiance of the United States and its close ally while Israeli forces push ahead with a deadly assault on famine-stricken Gaza City."
