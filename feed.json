      "PARIS -- The Louvre in Paris reopened fully on Friday after staff voted to suspend a strike that had disrupted access to the world\u2019s most visited museum, management and unions said.",
      "The decision was taken during a general assembly of museum workers, who voted unanimously to pause the strike to allow the museum to welcome visitors, unions said in a statement. The walkout had led to a full closure earlier in the week and a partial reopening on Wednesday.",
      "Unions said the suspension followed five meetings with Culture Ministry officials but said progress remains insufficient, particularly on staffing levels, pay and long-term security plans. They also cited concerns over building deterioration and working conditions.",

    "story": [
      "The Brazilian film \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d is opening nationwide in U.S. theaters",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cThe Secret Agent,\u201d a Brazilian feature shortlisted for the Oscars, is all about ordinary people. It follows an unassuming scientist and widowed father who becomes a target of Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship in the 1970s \u2014 not because he is an activist or revolutionary, but because he stands up to a business owner with ties to the regime.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in danger simply for being who he is, for holding the values he holds,\u201d star Wagner Moura told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \u201cThat\u2019s how authoritarianism works everywhere.\u201d",
      "Directed by Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho, \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d has been hailed by critics as one of the year\u2019s best films and arrives amid a renewed international interest in Brazilian cinema. Expanding in U.S. theaters Friday, the film is backed by major wins at the Cannes Film Festival for both Mendon\u00e7a Filho (best director) and Moura (best actor).",
      "Earlier this month, the 2 1/2-hour thriller earned Golden Globe nominations for best drama, best non-English film and best actor in a drama.",
      "\u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d arrives at a strong moment for Brazilian cinema following the success of \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d which won this year\u2019s Oscar for best international feature and a Golden Globe for lead actor Fernanda Torres.",
      "In Brazil, expectations for \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d are high. Moura said the widespread enthusiasm around the film \u2014 and the public's engagement with Brazilian artists \u2014 has made him \u201cincredibly happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo country develops without culture, without identity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re watching a Brazilian film, seeing a part of Brazil and its history. That matters.\u201d",
      "Set in 1977, at the height of Brazil\u2019s dictatorship, \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d opens with a black-and-white montage of the era\u2019s national symbols, from movie classics to hit soap operas.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho anchors the story in a precise time and place: Carnival in Recife, the filmmaker's hometown in northeastern Brazil. As the center of his cinematic universe, the city is the set for confronting a country that still struggles to reckon with its past.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all consumed incredible things from so many places \u2014 from Akira Kurosawa in Japan to Elvis Presley in the American South,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a Filho said. \u201cI am Brazilian, and my film is Brazilian. If it\u2019s good, it will be universal.\u201d",
      "Living undercover and under the alias Marcelo, Armando spends his days scouring archives for clues about his mother\u2019s past and planning to flee the country with his young son. As his quiet quest unfolds, the streets outside explode with Carnival revelry \u2014 a festival so embedded in Brazilian life that even the police chief appears rumpled from the celebrations, confetti still clinging to his hair.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho blends political suspense with urban legends from the period, touching on themes that extend beyond the dictatorship itself, including corruption, state violence and institutional complicity.",
      "One pivotal sequence unfolds inside a movie theater, a nod to the director\u2019s lifelong cinephilia. As fictional audiences spill out of screenings of \u201cJaws\u201d and \u201cThe Omen,\u201d shaken by fictional threats, the country itself is living under real terror.",
      "Over the past decade, Brazilian cinema has increasingly revisited the military dictatorship, which ruled from 1964 to 1985. Alongside \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d filmmakers have returned to the period in works such as \u201cMarighella,\u201d directed by Moura, about the legendary guerrilla leader who took up arms against the regime.",
      "Many of these films were made or released in the past decade, amid the rise of Brazil\u2019s far right. Its most prominent figure was former President Jair Bolsonaro, a retired army captain who praised officers accused of torture and minimized state crimes committed during the dictatorship.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho is among the filmmakers who have taken on the task of confronting national memory.",
      "\u201cThe military is a trauma that was never truly examined,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018Move on, forget it.\u2019 A crust forms over it. The same thing happens to an entire nation.\u201d",

      "\u201cToday, I\u2019m much more optimistic about Brazil as a democracy,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a Filho said. \u201cFor the first time, we\u2019re holding military officers accountable \u2014 and sending to prison a president who did nothing but harm the country.\u201d",
      "Few stories in \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d are as striking as that of T\u00e2nia Maria, 78, who plays Dona Sebastiana.",
      "A Brazilian artisan, Maria lived an ordinary life until age 72, when she was cast as an extra in Mendon\u00e7a Filho\u2019s 2019 film \u201cBacurau.\u201d Since then, she has appeared in six films that have yet to be released.",
      "The director said he never forgot her presence \u2014 \u201ca birdlike bearing, a voice shaped by 60 years of cigarettes and a razor-sharp sense of humor.\u201d He later wrote the role of Dona Sebastiana specifically for her.",
      "The character, who shelters political fugitives including Armando, stands out. When she walks toward the camera in a flowered dress, cigarette in hand, the film briefly belongs to her.",
      "\u201cHer authenticity carries something of many women I\u2019ve known,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a Filho said. \u201cThere\u2019s something literary about her.\u201d",
      "Moura said he wasn't able to hide his awe at the actor\u2019s authenticity. He pointed to their first scene together, in which Dona Sebastiana shows Armando the apartment he is moving into.",
      "If viewers watch closely, he said, they will see that he is genuinely \u201clike a fool orbiting around her.\u201d",
      "Maria lives in a rural village of about 22,000 people in northeastern Rio Grande do Norte. There is no movie theater there. She says the only films she has ever seen are the ones she acted in.",
      "For Maria, the authenticity of her performance begins with Mendon\u00e7a Filho\u2019s script.",
      "\u201cFilming is wonderful, and Kleber Mendon\u00e7a\u2019s films feel like they\u2019re copying our lives,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cDona Sebastiana\u2019s life is my life. I\u2019ve always liked taking people in, and I\u2019ve always liked complaining.\u201d",
      "Since the film\u2019s release in Brazil, the seamstress-turned-actor has become a national sensation, appearing on morning shows and gaining thousands of followers.",
      "She is also hoping for Oscar recognition \u2014 for the film and, perhaps, for herself.",

      "Hollywood, it seems, has found God.",
      "But it\u2019s not just starry big-budget Netflix films or A24 indies that are grappling with religion and its place in entertainment. In recent years, there\u2019s been an explosion of films and television made from a confessional perspective that evangelize or portray a particular faith, often Christianity, that have performed particularly well with audiences.",
      "There are animated biblical films from Angel, like the upcoming musical \u201cDavid,\u201d which the company said has already exceeded $14 million in theatrical pre-sale tickets ahead of its release this Friday, to docudramas like Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Saints.\u201d While episodes from Season 2 are still being released, the first season of the Fox Nation series, which premiered last year, was the most watched on the platform.",
      "\u201cThere has been a revival, a revolution of sorts, of spirituality and faith content,\u201d proclaimed Traci Blackwell, head of targeted content for Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, at a recent Variety event in Beverly Hills for faith and spirituality in entertainment. Earlier this year, Amazon premiered the first season of its own biblical drama, \u201cHouse of David,\u201d and gained exclusive U.S. streaming rights to \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d a massively popular drama series about the life of Jesus.",
      "Historically some faith-based entertainment has performed well at the box office \u2014 Mel Gibson\u2019s 2004 epic \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d was notoriously the highest-grossing R-rated film in the U.S. and Canada for two decades. But faith-based hits have been few and far between for most of this century.",
      "\u201cHollywood has taken a lot of criticism by those in the faith community for not providing films that speak to them, that reflect their values,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s senior media analyst, emphasizing the box-office potential of faith-based films.",
      "Studios are realizing faith-based film and television is a worthwhile investment at least in part due to the success of \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d which Angel helped launch in 2017, even if it initially took time to see those results.",
      "\u201cIt was like pulling teeth to get people to watch it,\u201d recalled Angel CEO and co-founder Neal Harmon. \u201cPeople have this idea that faith means cheesy or preachy. And we had to break through that barrier.\u201d",
      "Once they did, it paid off. Since Fathom Entertainment began distributing \u201cThe Chosen\u201d theatrically in 2023, the series has grossed more than $116 million domestically.",
      "Though not a Christian company, Angel aims to distribute and market \u201cvalues-based entertainment\u201d that includes but is not limited to stories of faith. They\u2019ve released a host of religious films, with \u201cZero A.D.,\u201d a biblical epic about the Massacre of the Innocents recounted in the Gospel of Matthew, on the docket for 2026.",
      "Meanwhile, Lionsgate is set to premiere \u201cI Can Only Imagine 2\u201d in theaters February, a sequel to the 2018 biopic starring Dennis Quaid, which was one of the highest-grossing Christian films of all-time in the United States.",
      "Co-director Andrew Erwin said he noticed a \u201cmassive shift\u201d take place about five years ago, after years of disconnect between the demand for these kinds of films and Hollywood\u2019s willingness to make them.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, movie studios are really giving us a fair shake,\u201d he said, though he thinks the quality of the content was also a factor. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the knowledge of how to do the filmmaking side of things. And so, I think the storytelling has gotten a lot better.\u201d",

      "Tennessee Williams' early radio play, \u201cThe Strangers,\u201d is featured in The Strand this week",
      "NEW YORK -- Long before the rise of podcast dramas, listeners worldwide tuned in to the audio-only narratives of radio plays.",
      "Tom Stoppard and Arthur Miller were among the many playwrights who early in their careers completed brief pieces for radio, while such memorable dramas as Harold Pinter's \u201cA Slight Ache\u201d and Robert Bolt's \u201cA Man for All Seasons\u201d premiered as radio broadcasts. Radio work was often a way to bring in money and to refine the arts of plotting and dialogue.",
      "When Tennessee Williams was a student at the University of Iowa in the late 1930s, still referring to himself by his birth name, Tom Williams, he completed a rarely-heard gothic sketch for radio called \u201cThe Strangers.\u201d Williams' play appears this week in The Strand Magazine, which has previously published little-known works by Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and John Steinbeck among others.",
      "\u201cThe play incorporates all the theatrical elements of early radio horror,\u201d writes Strand managing editor Andrew Gulli, \u201ca storm, howling wind, shadows, a house perched over the sea, flickering candles, mysterious footsteps on the stairs, spectral beings \u2014 as well as early hints of the themes and devices Williams would return to in his most famous later works: isolation, fear, the shades of gray between imagination and reality, and a house haunted by memory and the private terrors of those who inhabit it.\u201d",
      "Blanche DuBois would famously invoke \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d in Williams' classic \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire.\u201d You could call this early work \u201cThe Horror of Strangers.\u201d His play is set in a columned New England manor on the Atlantic coast, a \u201cghostly\u201d home squinting under a lighthouse beam that casts a yellowish spell. The title refers to invisible demons who haunt two of the home's residents, Mr. Brighton and Mrs. Brighton.",
      "\u201cWe members of the human species are equipped with only five senses. Or six at the very most,\u201d Mr. Brighton declares early on. \u201cThe Strangers are creatures that might be perceptible to us if we had seven or eight or maybe nine senses. But as it is, they exist just outside our little sphere of contact with reality and so \u2026 what we know of them is very, very slight.\u201d",

Bak believes Williams was influenced by commercial considerations and by more personal forces.",
      "Horror stories were popular on radio in the late '30s, Bak says. Williams first thought of radio plays as an \u201cexercise,\u201d but he would eventually take them more seriously. While writing \u201cThe Strangers,\u201d he was already haunted by the mental health struggles of his sister, Rose, who would later inspire the fragile Laura Wingfield of \u201cThe Glass Menagerie.\u201d Williams would long explore the idea of madness, Bak says, and how we respond to people who seem to see things \u201cno one else can see.\u201d",

      "The ongoing strike at the Louvre has become a major test of the museum's management",
      "PARIS -- The ongoing strike at the Louvre is no longer just a labor dispute. It has become a test of how securely, credibly and competently the world\u2019s most visited museum is being run.",
      "Behind the walkout are not only frayed labor relations, but a building itself under strain, with crumbling parts of the aging former palace now deemed unsafe.",
      "At the heart of the crisis lies a deeper rupture: a $102 million jewel heist that exposed security failures at the core of the institution and transformed long-simmering staff grievances into a national reckoning with global resonance.",
      "Tensions were already rising when a wildcat June strike abruptly shut the museum, stranding visitors beneath I.M. Pei\u2019s glass pyramid. Weeks later, the Louvre announced the closure of offices and a public gallery because of weakened floor beams, deepening concern about neglect across the aging complex.",
      "The October daylight robbery, in which thieves stole crown jewels, intensified scrutiny from lawmakers and auditors and reframing workplace complaints as questions of institutional failure.",
      "Culture Ministry officials have tried to defuse the standoff by proposing to cancel a planned 2026 funding cut, hire additional guards and visitor services staff, and raise pay. Unions rejected the measures as inadequate, signaling that trust has frayed beyond quick fixes.",
      "On Monday, the CFDT union said that 400 workers at a meeting voted to strike over chronic understaffing, deteriorating buildings and management decisions. Workers on Wednesday voted to extend the action, forcing the Louvre to operate on a restricted footing.",
      "The museum partially reopened a limited \u201cmasterpiece route,\u201d granting access to the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d the Venus de Milo and a handful of galleries \u2014 a stopgap that allowed visitors inside while highlighting how far normal operations have slipped.",
      "Pressure has now shifted squarely onto Louvre President Laurence des Cars. The ministry has announced emergency anti-intrusion measures and appointed Philippe Jost, who oversaw the restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral, to help reorganize the museum. It's a step widely read as a sign that confidence in existing governance has been shaken.",
      "French senators were told last week that thieves who stole crown jewels valued at more than $100 million escaped the Louvre with barely 30 seconds to spare, a detail that crystallized the scale of the breakdown.",
      "A parliamentary inquiry described the Oct. 19 theft as one of the result of cascading failures. Only one of two cameras covering the break-in point was functioning, and security staff lacked enough screens to monitor footage in real time.",
      "When the alarm finally sounded, police were initially sent to the wrong location, investigators said, a delay that proved decisive.",
      "\u201cGive or take 30 seconds, guards or police could have intercepted them,\u201d said No\u00ebl Corbin, who led the inquiry.",

      "President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s \u201cNew Renaissance\u201d renovation plan, launched in early 2025 to modernize the Louvre and manage overcrowding, includes expanded entrances and major upgrades. Critics say it has moved too slowly and focused too heavily on headline projects. A court audit flagged considerable delays in deploying modern security equipment and found that only a fraction of allocated funds had been spent on safety.",
      "A proposal to give Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cMona Lisa\u201d a dedicated room with its own entrance was intended to ease crushing crowds. Instead, it has become a symbol of what workers see as misplaced priorities.",

      "Unions counter that the project highlights a fixation on blockbuster attractions while staffing shortages, infrastructure decay and security gaps persist. They argue that money earmarked for redesign would be better spent on repairs, surveillance upgrades and front-line staffing. Some also fear the move could open the door to tiered access or higher prices.",

      "Alex Warren's song \u201cOrdinary\u201d is, by many measures, a defining song of 2025",
      "New York -- It jolted the winter, came alive in the spring, dominated the summer and went three-times platinum in the fall. Alex Warren's bombastic ballad \u201cOrdinary\u201d is, by many measures, a defining song of 2025. It's also an unusual hit: slower than a traditional song of the summer, full of gloss, an ascendent hook and inoffensive, religious-adjacent lyricism.",
      "For those reasons, \u201cOrdinary\u201d has fast-tracked the 25-year-old singer/songwriter into mainstream musical fame, coming to a head in November when he earned his first Grammy nomination. The nomination for best new artist arrived just four months after the release of his debut album, \u201cYou\u2019ll Be Alright, Kid.\u201d",
      "\u201cI bawled in my wife's arms,\u201d he said of the moment he found out about the nomination. For those who didn't believe in his music career, he says, \u201cthe biggest justification ever was the nomination.\u201d",
      "Most know Warren for \u201cOrdinary,\u201d but fame is not new for him. Before the chart-topping hit, Warren made a name for himself as a social media prankster in the TikTok collective \u201cHype House.\u201d And while that past might seem at odds with his new public persona, Warren always exuded perspicacity, the result of a troubled childhood that separated him from his comedic cohort. His father died of cancer when he was 9, he says, and his mother of complications due to alcoholism. A period of homelessness followed in his teens, before the TikTok fame.",
      "Still, he's remained curious and playful. At The Associated Press headquarters in New York, he chatted with staff and made disarming, self-deprecating comments. An example: In preparation to see the singer Shawn Mendes later, he dosed himself in cologne. \u201cI need to smell as good as Shawn Mendes looks,\u201d he joked.",
      "Social media success doesn't always yield a creative career \u2014 consider Warren and the innovative Addison Rae, a fellow best new artist nominee, exceptions to the rule \u2014 but it did prime him for the life he leads now. \u201cEverything that I went through back then definitely allowed me to do this,\u201d he says.",
      "Growing up online \u2014 and having \u201cdifferent versions\u201d of himself presented on social media \u2014 has \u201cdefinitely allowed me to now be unequivocally myself,\u201d he says.",
      "Warren wrote \u201cOrdinary\u201d a year ago at a writing camp. He says he knew there was something special about the track \u2014 though he and his collaborators were mostly alone in that feeling. \u201cA lot of people were like, \u2018Oh it\u2019s a ballad, it\u2019s a love song ballad. That\u2019s not a single, that\u2019s a song on the album. That\u2019s a feature, you should give it to someone else,\u2019\u201d he recalls. But he pushed it on TikTok, and soon, it connected.",
      "\u201cThe TikToks got it to do 4 million streams in a day, which was crazy,\u201d he said. Then he performed it on Netflix's \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d He played it with Ed Sheeran,Jelly Roll, Luke Combs and the Jonas Brothers. It built to ubiquity.",

      "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Peter Arnett, who traveled the world covering wars from Vietnam to Iraq, has died",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.",
      "Arnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.",
      "\u201cPeter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation \u2014 intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,\u201d said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP\u2019s chief correspondent at the United Nations.",
      "As a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.",
      "While almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.",
      "\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.",
      "\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. \u201cThey are hitting the center of the city.\u201d",
      "It was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.",
      "In January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.",
      "\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,\u201d Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. \u201cHe sank to the ground at my feet.\u201d",
      "He would begin the fallen soldier\u2019s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"",
      "Arnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent.

      "Dabis, born and raised in the United States to Palestinian-Jordanian parents, said her passion and inspiration to become a filmmaker grew from a lack of authentic Arab and Palestinian representation in Western media. \u201cI became aware that I wanted to go into storytelling in order to tell our authentic stories, because I couldn\u2019t find us anywhere,\u201d she said.",
      "She said growing up in the U.S. offered better opportunities for a career in cinema than the Arab world, but the racism her family faced reinforced her desire to challenge harmful stereotypes. \u201cMy experience in the diaspora is really what compelled me to become a storyteller,\u201d she said.",
      "And she still struggled to be taken seriously, feeling pressure to adopt a more authoritative, even masculine tone to counter assumptions about women directors. \"There is this image of women filmmakers as overly emotional or unable to command a set,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of us felt we had to overcome these unfair ideas.\u201d",

That spark turned into a passion nurtured by school theater and later refined at the Toronto Film School.",

      "Duraie started her career at the bottom, taking on every role she could from production assistant, assistant director, producer, before directing her own films. \u201cI carried heavy equipment up mountains,\u201d she recalled. \u201cPeople told me, \u2018This isn\u2019t a woman\u2019s job,\u2019\u201d but that only pushed her further. \u201cI worked in everything in filmmaking. I wanted to learn it all.\u201d",
      "Duraie is known for tackling deeply personal and social issues, especially around mental health and the female experience. \u201cI love to work in the psychology of drama, and I want to tell stories about women \u2014 but break stereotypes too,\u201d she said.

      "LOS ANGELES -- Some of Rob and Michele Reiner's closest friends, including actors Billy Crystal, Albert Brooks, Martin Short and Larry David, have released a statement mourning the couple and praising their love of film and country.",
      "\u201cAbsorbing all he had learned from his father Carl and his mentor Norman Lear, Rob Reiner not only was a great comic actor, he became a master story teller. There is no other director who has his range. From comedy to drama to \u2018mockumentary\u2019 to documentary he was always at the top of his game. He charmed audiences. They trusted him. They lined up to see his films,\" the group said in a statement released first to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cHis comedic touch was beyond compare, his love of getting the music of the dialogue just right, and his sharpening of the edge of a drama was simply elegant,\u201d it said of Rob Reiner, whose films included \u201cA Few Good Men,\u201d \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally...\" and \u201cThe Princess Bride.\"",
      "The statement was released two days after Rob and Michele Reiner were found dead in their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Their son, Nick Reiner, was charged Tuesday with two counts of murder and is suspected of stabbing his parents to death.",
      "The joint statement came from some of Reiner's longtime collaborators and contemporaries, including Crystal, Brooks, Short, David and their spouses. The signatories included writer Alan Zweibel, composer and lyricist Marc Shaiman, director Barry Levinson and former U.S. Ambassador to Spain James Costos.",
      "\u201cFor the actors, he loved them. For the writers he made them better. His greatest gift was freedom. If you had an idea, he listened, he brought you into the process. They always felt they were working as a team. To be in his hands as a film maker was a privilege but that is only part of his legacy,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The Reiners were major Democratic contributors and champions of numerous political causes.",

Strong and determined, Michele and Rob Reiner devoted a great deal of their lives for the betterment of our fellow citizens... They were a special force together \u2014 dynamic, unselfish and inspiring,\u201d the statement said.",
      "\u201cWe were their friends, and we will miss them forever,\u201d it said, before concluding with a quote from one of Reiner's favorite films, the Christmastime classic \"It's a Wonderful Life.\"",
      "\u201c'Each man\u2019s life touches so many other lives, and when he isn\u2019t around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn\u2019t he?\u2019 You have no idea,\" the statement concludes.",
      "The deaths of the Reiners have stunned Hollywood, especially since their family embodied a gentle and comedic spirit.",
      "Their deaths drew tributes from numerous stars and political figures on Sunday and Monday, but many of those closest to the Reiners had yet to release statements.",

      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d will probably be a rewarding experience for fans of James Cameron's saga",
      "When I came down with a cold the day after I saw the third and latest \u201cAvatar\u201d film, \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d I half-wondered if I had picked it up on Pandora.",
      "The promise of Cameron\u2019s 3D trilogy has always been immersion: immersion in a science-fiction world, in technological wonder, in a maybe future of movies. \u201cAvatar\u201d is almost more a place to go than a movie to see.",
      "Still, it\u2019s now been two decades since Cameron set off on this blue-tinted quest. The sheen of newness is off, or at least less pronounced, with new technological advances to contend with. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is running with a behind-the-scenes video about how performance capture was used during the film\u2019s making. The implicit message is: No, this isn\u2019t AI.",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films, with their visual-effects wizardry and clunky revisionist Western storytelling, have always felt, most of all, like an immersion in a dream of James Cameron\u2019s. The idea of these movies, after all, first came to Cameron, he has said, in a bioluminescent vision decades ago. At their best, the \u201cAvatar\u201d movies have felt like an otherworldly stage for Cameron to juggle so many of the things \u2014 hulking weaponry, ecological wonder, foolhardy human arrogance \u2014 that have marked his movies.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d at well more than three hours, is our longest stay yet on Pandora and the one most likely to make you ponder why you came here, in the first place. These remain epics of craft and conviction. You can feel Cameron\u2019s deep devotion to the dynamics of his central characters, even when his interest outstrips our own.",
      "That\u2019s especially true in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d which, following the deep-sea, family-focused part two, \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d pivots to a new chapter of culture clash. It introduces a violent rival Na\u2019vi clan whose rageful leader, Varang (Oona Chaplin), partners with Stephen Lang\u2019s booming Col. Miles Quaritch and the human colonizers.",
      "For those who have closely followed the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga, I suspect \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will be a rewarding experience. Quaritch, Pandora\u2019s answer to Robert Duvall\u2019s Bill Kilgore in \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d remains a ferociously captivating character. And the introduction of Chaplin\u2019s Varang gives this installment an electricity that the previous two were missing.",
      "But for those whose trips to Pandora have made less of an impact, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is a bit like returning to a half-remembered vacation spot, only one where the local ponytail style is a little strange and everyone seems to have the waist of a supermodel.",
      "Time has only reinforced the sense that these films are hermetically sealed movie terrariums. They're like a $1 billion beta test that, for all their box-office success, have ultimately proven that all the design capabilities in the world can\u2019t conjure a story of meaningful impact. The often-remarked light cultural footprint left by the first two blockbusters only hints at why these movie seem to evaporate by the ending credits. It\u2019s the lack of inner life to any of the characters and the bland, screen-saver aesthetics. At this point in a trilogy, nine hours in, that hollowness makes \u201cFire and Ash\u201d feel like almost theoretical drama: more avatar than genuine article.",
      "These movies have had to work extremely hard, moment to moment, just to pass as believable. But almost every gesture, every movement and every bit of dialogue has had something unnatural about it. (The high frame rate is partially to blame.) That\u2019s made these uncanny movies a combination, in equal measure, of things you\u2019ve never seen before, and things you can\u2019t unsee.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d scripted by Cameron, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, picks up with the aftermath of the climatic battle of \u201cThe Way of Water.\u201d The Na\u2019vi and their seafaring allies, the Metkayina clan, are nursing their wounds and recovering the human weapons that sunk to the sea floor.",

      "When a rival clan called the Mangkwan or Ash People come to challenge the Na\u2019vi, those weapons represent an ethical quandary. Should they use such firepower in their own local battles? This is a more difficult question partially because the fire-mad Mangkwan are especially bloodthirsty, led by their slinky sorceress, Vanang (played with seductive sadism by Chaplin, granddaughter of Charlie).",
      "But their fight is only a piece of the larger war of \u201cFire and Ash.\u201d The focus of this third chapter (films four and five are said to be written but not greenlit) is interspecies coexistence. As human and Na\u2019vi lines continue to blur, the question becomes whether the human invaders will transform Pandora or if Pandora will transform them.",
      "That puts the focus on the three characters in various in-between states. First, there\u2019s Spider (Jack Champion), the human son of Quaritch who lives happily with the Na\u2019vi while breathing through a machine to survive the Pandora atmosphere. (Champion has the double misfortune of wearing a mask and looking downright puny next to the tall and slender natives.) But in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d he discovers he can breathe unfiltered, a development that prompts intense military interest in a potentially hugely profitable breakthrough in Pandora assimilation.",
      "There\u2019s also Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), the former human who has made a Na\u2019vi family with Neytiri (Zoe Salda\u00f1a). For Neytiri, the growing menace of human warfare causes her to doubt her bond with Jake. The prejudices of \u201cFire and Ash\u201d seep even into the home.",
      "Most interesting of the three, though, remains Quaritch. He may be violently trying to subjugate Pandora but he also obviously delights in his Na\u2019vi body and in his life on this distant moon. You can see him flinch when his commander, General Ardmore (Edie Falco), refers to their Mangkwan allies as \u201csavages.\u201d Meanwhile, Quaritch and Vanang hit it off like gangbusters.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got new eyes, colonel,\u201d one character tells Quaritch. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is open them.\u201d",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films have done plenty to open eyes over the past 16 years. To new cinematic horizons, to the boundlessness of Cameron's visions, to the Papyrus font. But the most endearing quality of \u201cAvatar\u201d is that Cameron believes so ardently in it. I might be caught up less in the goings on Pandora, but I'm kind of glad that he is. There are worse things than dreaming up a better world, with still a fighting chance.",
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d a 20th Century Studios release, opens in theaters Dec. 19. It's rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for intense sequences of violence and action, bloody images, some strong language, thematic elements and suggestive material. Running time: 195 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

    "summary": "Merriam-Webster&rsquo;s 2025 word of the year is &ldquo;slop.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "Merriam-Webster\u2019s 2025 word of the year is \u201cslop.\u201d",
      "Creepy, zany and demonstrably fake content is often called \u201cslop.\u201d The word's proliferation online, in part thanks to the widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence, landed it Merriam-Webster's 2025 word of the year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such an illustrative word,\" said Greg Barlow, Merriam-Webster's president, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it\u2019s something that people have found fascinating, annoying and a little bit ridiculous.\u201d",
      "\u201cSlop\u201d was first used in the 1700s to mean soft mud, but it evolved more generally to mean something of little value. The definition has since expanded to mean \"digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.\"",
      "In other words, \u201cyou know, absurd videos, weird advertising images, cheesy propaganda, fake news that looks real, junky AI-written digital books,\u201d Barlow said.",
      "AI video generators like Sora have wowed with their ability to quickly create realistic clips based merely on text prompts. But a flood of these images on social media, including clips depicting celebrities and deceased public figures, has raised worries about misinformation, deepfakes and copyright.",
      "Such content has existed online for years, but the tools are more accessible now \u2014 and used to political ends by, among other figures, the head of the Pentagon. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a manipulated image of a beloved cartoon turtle, reimagined as a grenade-wielding fighter, to defend U.S. military actions in Venezuela.",
      "The Canadian animated show \u201cFranklin\u201d teaches preschoolers about kindness, empathy and inclusivity \u2014 but in Hegseth's hands, its 6-year-old main character became a tool to promote violence.",
      "The word \u201cslop\u201d evokes unpleasant images of mud-caked pigs crowding around a dirty trough, or perhaps a bucket of steaming, fetid stew. Or AI amalgamations of algorithmic biases laden with offensive or nonsensical imagery.",
      "For some, the word induces dread.",
      "But to Barlow, it brings a sense of hope. The dictionary's president says the spike in searches for the word reflects that people have grown more aware of fake or shoddy content, and desire the inverse.",
      "\u201cThey want things that are real, they want things that are genuine,\" he said. \"It\u2019s almost a defiant word when it comes to AI. When it comes to replacing human creativity, sometimes AI actually doesn\u2019t seem so intelligent.\u201d",
      "To select the word of the year, the dictionary's editors review data about which words have risen in search results and usage. Then they come to a consensus about which word best reflects the span of the year.",
      "\u201cWe like to think that we are a mirror for people,\" Barlow said.",
      "Over the years, there are words that are consistently looked up, but they're filtered out as the dictionary's editors pick the one that best defines the year at hand.",
      "\u201cWords like \u2018ubiquitous,\u2019 \u2018paradigm,\u2019 \u2018albeit,\u2019 \u2018irregardless,\u2019 these are always top lookups because they\u2019re words that are on the edge of our lexicon,\" Barlow said. \u201c'Irregardless' is a word in the dictionary for one reason: It\u2019s used. It\u2019s been used for decades to mean \u2018regardless.\u2019\u201d",
      "The dictionary has selected one word every year since 2003 to capture and make sense of the current moment. Last year, shortly after the U.S. presidential election and amid the shifting national mood, Merriam-Webster chose the word \u201c polarization.\u201d",

      "The viral term exploded in popularity over the summer. It\u2019s an inside joke with an unclear meaning, driven by social media. It can be traced back to rapper Skrilla\u2019s 2024 song \u201cDoot Doot (6 7).\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's self-referential,\" Barlow said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the rage, but it\u2019s not a defining term.\u201d",
      "The \"performative male\" is online shorthand for a disingenuous guy who pretends to like things women like in order to earn their trust. There's also a spate of influencers who've been called performative for posting surface-level \u201c kindness content.\u201d The word is versatile, since it extends to stunts in national politics, grandstanding on social media and even the nature of the UN General Assembly.",
      "There's a long national history of partisan gerrymandering in the U.S. To retain Republican control of Congress, President Donald Trump has urged maps to be redrawn before the 2026 midterm elections. That's led to GOP moves in Texas and Indiana to draw districts to their advantage, as well as a counter effort in Democrat-led California.",
      "The definition of this popular internet phrase is \u201cto participate in normal activities in the real world especially as opposed to online experiences and interactions.\u201d It was a serious contender for Merriam-Webster's word of the year, since it's used to \u201cdescribe the aspiration for many people to take a break from their digital addiction,\u201d Barlow said.",
      "A conclave is the centuries-old election of a pope that derives its name from the Italian \u201ccon clave\u201d \u2014 meaning \u201cwith a key\u201d \u2014 to underscore that cardinals are sequestered until they find a winner.",
      "Some learned the meaning from the titular film in 2024. Others found out in real time when Pope Leo XIV became history\u2019s first American pope in May 2025. \u201cIt was so event specific, but the spike (in searches) was huge,\" Barlow said.",
      "Originally from Italian and Arabic for \u201cfree of charge,\u201d the word entered English centuries ago. The definition is \u201ca schedule of duties imposed by a government on imported or in some countries exported goods.\u201d",
      "Trump boasts that his tariffs protect American industries, lure factories to the U.S., raise money for the federal government and give him diplomatic leverage. But they've sparked a trade war and in reality account for less than 4% of federal revenue. The tariffs have also done little to dent the federal budget deficit \u2014 a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal 2025.",
      "Yes, you read that correctly. \u201cThe name of this lake delighted and baffled us when it started clogging the Top Lookups list on Merriam-Webster.com,\u201d the dictionary's editors said. In the Roblox game Spelling Bee!, the Massachusetts lake\u2019s name can be encountered in special modes. But in New England? It's known as Webster Lake.",

      "With \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d arriving Friday, it was a relatively quiet weekend in theaters. There were no major new releases, leaving holdovers \u201cZootopia 2\u201d and \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d to duke it out for the top spot.",
      "The edge went to \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d which has quickly amassed $1.14 billion in global ticket sales thanks significantly to its enormous success in China. There, it\u2019s grossed $502.4 million, making \u201cZootopia 2\u201d the biggest Hollywood hit in the country in years.",
      "The only other 2025 Hollywood title to surpass $1 billion worldwide was Disney\u2019s \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d ($1.04 billion). The highest grossing movie of the year, though, is the Chinese blockbuster \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d which collected nearly $2 billion just in China.",
      "In its second weekend of release, the Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions sequel \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d collected $15.4 million, a brutal drop of 70% from its above-expectations debut. Still, with a domestic total of $95.5 million, the $36 million production is a big win for Blumhouse, adding another horror franchise to its portfolio.",
      "The weekend\u2019s most notable new release was James L. Brook\u2019s \u201cElla McCay,\u201d his first directed film in 15 years. \u201cElla McCay\u201d earned a scant $2.1 million from 2,500 locations, making it one of the year\u2019s worst wide releases.",

Reviews (22% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were poor, and the kind of award-winning comic dramas movies that Brooks (\u201cTerms of Endearment,\u201d \u201cBroadcast News\u201d) has long specialized in today seldom find large audiences in theaters. \u201cElla McCay,\u201d featuring a supporting cast including Jamie Lee Curtis, Ayo Edebiri and Woody Harrelson, cost $35 million to make.",

      "So, remaining seated in a room full of teammates and coaches, the 6-foot-1, 313-pound tenor smoothly belted out Tevin Campbell's 1990s R&B hit, \u201cCan We Talk.\"",
      "\u201cI knew he could sing because he said he could, but then he sang in person \u2014 man, he has a beautiful voice,\u201d defensive tackle Harrison Phillips said.",

      "So much so, Briggs received a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of guys were more surprised with, one, the song I sang, and then how it actually sounded,\" a smiling Briggs said. \"They were like, \u2018Oh, that can\u2019t be coming from Juwon!'\"",
      "But an even bigger surprise for some of Briggs' teammates is that he's a one-man band who has learned how to play 12 instruments to varying degrees of competency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I always say, everybody\u2019s got something. I just happen to be a musical guy.\u201d",
      "That's putting it lightly.",
      "There's Briggs' exceptional voice, of course. But he also has played the recorder, piano, violin, viola, cello, stand-up bass, bass guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, saxophone, flute and harmonica, and still owns a few of them. Briggs has messed around with drums, too, but doesn\u2019t count that as part of his musical repertoire.",

      "The 24-year-old D-lineman wasn't even on the team until a few weeks before the regular season, when the seventh-round pick of Cleveland last year out of the University of Cincinnati was acquired by New York.

      "\u201cHe\u2019s a big man, he\u2019s strong,\u201d coach Aaron Glenn said. \"He\u2019s able to stop the run. He\u2019s been doing a good job of that, but what\u2019s been surprising \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t say surprising \u2014 but what he\u2019s had the tick up in is his ability to rush the passer also. So, we want to be able to utilize that.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that he\u2019s Mean Joe Greene or anything like that, but listen, he\u2019s been doing a really good job of being disruptive in the pass game.\u201d",

      "\u201cWith music, I\u2019d probably say it started from the womb,\u201d Briggs said with a laugh. \u201cI always say I kind of got the trickle-down effect. They\u2019ve all been singing, dancing, acting and playing sports since before I was even thought of, so I kind of just fell into a musical household.\"",

      "\u201cHe also raps,\u201d Phillips revealed of his teammate. \u201cHis singing voice and his rapping voice are two different buckets. I'm not artistic in any way, so major props to him on that.\u201d",
      "Football remains the focus for Briggs, who hopes he can play several more years. But he also knows other talents might help him shine long after his last snap.",
      "\u201cYou can always fall back on your voice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of them things that shouldn\u2019t go out on you like your legs.\u201d",

      "Missouri\u2019s top prosecutor says China is suing after the state pressed federal officials for help collecting on a roughly $25 billion court judgment related to the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Missouri's top prosecutor said China is suing after the state pressed federal officials for help collecting on a roughly $25 billion court judgment related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Attorney General Catherine Hanaway said Tuesday in a news release that China is demanding a public apology from the state in a complaint filed in the Intermediate People\u2019s Court of Wuhan. The Chinese government also is seeking compensation equivalent to $50.5 billion plus legal fees and the right to claim further compensation.",
      "\"This lawsuit is a stalling tactic and tells me that we have been on the right side of this issue all along,\u201d Hanaway said in the news release.",
      "At issue is a lawsuit Missouri filed alleging that China hoarded personal protective equipment during the early months of the pandemic, harming the state and its residents. A federal judge ruled for Missouri earlier this year after China declined to participate in the trial. It called the lawsuit \u201c very absurd \u201d when it was filed in 2020.",
      "Last month, Missouri escalated its efforts to collect, asking the U.S. State Department to formally notify China that the state intends to pursue assets with full or partial Chinese government ownership to satisfy the judgment.",
      "Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement Wednesday that he wasn\u2019t familiar with the specifics of the new case. But he said the earlier Missouri lawsuit was \u201ca purely politically motivated maneuver.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina firmly opposes it, will never accept it, and reserves the right to take strong countermeasures,\u201d Pengyu said.",
      "China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said earlier this year that its actions during the pandemic aren\u2019t subject to U.S. jurisdiction and it doesn\u2019t recognize the ruling.",
      "Some legal experts have cast doubt on whether Missouri can collect on the judgment, because federal law generally shields foreign nations from lawsuits in U.S. courts.",

      "Dec 15, 6:39 PM",
      "The case has taken an unusual path. U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh initially dismissed the lawsuit in 2022, saying Missouri couldn\u2019t sue China, its Communist Party and seven other government or scientific agencies. But an appeals court allowed one part of the lawsuit to proceed: the allegation that China hoarded personal protective equipment, such as respirator masks, medical gowns and gloves.",
      "After Chinese officials didn\u2019t respond, Limbaugh accepted Missouri\u2019s estimate of past and potential future damages of more than $8 billion, tripled it as federal law allows, and added 3.91% interest until it\u2019s collected.",
      "The lawsuit was originally filed by state Attorney General Eric Schmitt, an ally of President Donald Trump who subsequently won election to the U.S. Senate, and alleged that Chinese officials were to blame for the pandemic. It was carried on by Attorney General Andrew Bailey, another Trump ally who resigned in September to become co-deputy director of the FBI.",
      "Hanaway, a former U.S. attorney and Missouri House speaker, inherited the case when she was appointed state attorney general by Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe.",
      "The Associated Press wasn't immediately able to obtain its own copy of the Chinese-filed complaint. But a copy was linked to Hanaway's news release.",
      "The complaint accuses Missouri, as well as Schmitt and Bailey, of \u201cfabricating enormous disinformation, and spreading stigmatizing and discriminating slanders\u201d that have harmed China's reputation.",
      "Schmitt said he would wear the suit \u201clike a badge of honor\u201d and accused Chinese authorities of \u201cattempting to absolve themselves of all wrongdoing in the early days of the pandemic.\u201d",

      "For 10 minutes each evening, volunteers standing outside the hospital shine flashlights toward the pediatric rooms above, delivering a message of hope and joy. The kids return the sentiment with their own lights, which they shine toward those below.",
      "\u201cTo be stuck in the hospital and feel like the world is moving on without you outside feels a little bit isolating, a little lonely, feels like maybe you\u2019ve been forgotten in the hustle and bustle of the holiday season,\u201d said Amanda Lefkof, a child life specialist at Corewell.",
      "Among the children in the hospital is 4-year-old Zoe Hostetter, who is undergoing chemotherapy treatments. On a recent night, she shone her own flashlight toward the bundled-up well-wishers below with her grandfather, Tim Schuele, by her side.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a big group of people that they don\u2019t know, but they see the love being sent by the lights,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re here kind of by themselves or with just close family and that\u2019s it for days.\u201d",
      "On these nights, though, the children are far from alone.",
      "Kevin Barringer was among those flashing lights toward the windows one night last week. Barringer's son, Connor, spent two months at the hospital in 2020 recovering from a spinal injury, and they were on the receiving end of the lights.",
      "\u201cIt gets pretty dark up there for the kids and for parents as well,\u201d Kevin Barringer said. \u201cHaving people down here letting them up there know that there are people with them and sending all their light up that way, it means a lot.\u201d",

      "Severe foreign aid cuts imposed this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, along with funding reductions from other countries, shuttered thousands of schools and youth training centers in camps for Rohingya in Bangladesh and crippled child protection pr...",
      "UKHIYA, Bangladesh -- In moments when she is alone, when there is a break in the beatings from her husband, the girl cries for the school that was once her place of peace in a world that has otherwise offered her none.",
      "Ever since the military in her homeland of Myanmar killed her father in 2017, forcing her to flee to neighboring Bangladesh with her mother and little sisters, the school had protected Hasina from the predators who prowl her refugee camp, home to 1.2 million members of Myanmar\u2019s persecuted Rohingya minority.",
      "It had also protected her from being forced into marriage. And then one day in June, when Hasina was 16 years old, her teacher announced that the school\u2019s funding had been taken away. The school was closing. In a blink, Hasina\u2019s education was over, and so, too, was her childhood.",
      "With her learning opportunities gone, and her family worried that foreign aid cuts would make their fight for survival in the camps even more perilous, Hasina \u2014 along with hundreds of other girls under the age of 18 \u2014 was quickly married off. And, just like Hasina, many of the girls are now trapped in marriages with men who abuse them.",
      "\u201cI dreamed of being something, of working for the community,\u201d Hasina, now 17, says softly. The Associated Press is withholding her full name to protect her from retaliation by her husband. \u201cMy life is destroyed.\u201d",
      "The sudden and severe foreign aid cuts imposed this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, along with funding reductions from other countries, shuttered thousands of the camps\u2019 schools and youth training centers and crippled child protection programs. Beyond unwanted marriages, scores of children as young as 10 were forced into backbreaking manual labor, and girls as young as 12 forced into prostitution. With no safe space to play or learn, children were left to wander the labyrinthine camps, making them increasingly easy targets for kidnappers. And the young and desperate were picked off by traffickers who promised to restore what the children had lost: Hope.",
      "In a sweltering building not far from the cramped shelter where her husband tortures her, Hasina plays nervously with the strap of her pink mobile phone case, emblazoned with the words \u201cForever Young.\u201d",
      "She is still young, she says. But the aid cuts forced her into womanhood and into a nightmare. Not long after marrying her husband, she says, he isolated her from her family and began to beat and sexually abuse her. She daydreams daily of school, where she was a whiz at English and hoped to become a teacher. Now, she is confined largely to her shelter, cooking and cleaning and waiting with dread for the next beating.",
      "If she had any way to escape, she says, she would. But there is nowhere to go. She cannot return to Myanmar, where the military that killed thousands of Rohingya in 2017 during what the U.S. declared a genocide remains in charge of her homeland.",
      "Now, her husband is in charge of her future, though she no longer sees one.",
      "\u201cIf the school hadn\u2019t closed,\u201d she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be trapped in this life.\u201d",
      "Life has always been dangerous for the 600,000 children languishing in these chaotic, overcrowded camps, where a squalid jumble of bamboo and tarpaulin shelters are jammed onto landslide-prone hills. But Trump\u2019s decision in January to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development has made it even more so, the AP found in interviews with 37 children, family members, teachers, community leaders and aid workers.",
      "Violations against children in the camps have risen sharply this year, according to UNICEF, the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency. Between January and mid-November, reported cases of abduction and kidnapping more than quadrupled over the same time period last year, to 560 children. And there has been an eightfold increase in reports of armed groups\u2019 recruitment and use of children for training and support roles in the camps, with 817 children affected. Many members of the armed groups are battling a powerful ethnic militia across the border in Myanmar. The actual number of cases is likely higher due to underreporting, according to UNICEF, which lost 27% of its funding due to the U.S. aid cuts and subsequently shuttered nearly 2,800 schools.",
      "\u201cThe armed groups, with their roots in Myanmar, are operating in the camps, using the camps as a fertile ground for recruiting young people,\u201d says Patrick Halton, a child protection manager for UNICEF. \u201cObviously, if children are not in learning centers and not in multipurpose centers, then they\u2019re more vulnerable to this.\u201d",
      "Verified cases of child marriage, which the U.N. defines as the union of children under age 18, rose by 21% and verified child labor cases by 17% in the year to September, compared to the same time period last year. Those statistics are likely to be a significant undercount, says Halton.",
      "\u201cWith the funding cuts, we had to downscale a lot in terms of the education,\u201d Halton says. \u201cIt\u2019s meant that children have not necessarily had things to do, and we\u2019ve therefore seen this rise in children being married, children being in child labor.\u201d",
      "Though the U.S. spent just 1% of its budget on foreign aid, Trump dubbed USAID wasteful and shut it down, a move that has proven catastrophic for the world\u2019s most vulnerable. In Myanmar, the AP found the aid cuts have caused children to starve to death, despite U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s statement to Congress that \u201cNo one has died\u201d because of the dissolution of USAID. A study published in The Lancet journal in June said the U.S. funding cuts could result in more than 14 million deaths, including more than 4.5 million children under age 5, by 2030.",
      "In the Bangladesh camps, the U.S. \u2014 which has long been the biggest provider of aid to the predominantly Muslim Rohingya \u2014 slashed its funding by nearly half compared to last year. The overall Rohingya emergency response is only 50% funded for 2025, and aid agencies say next year is expected to be far worse.",
      "In a statement to the AP, the State Department said the U.S. has provided more than $168 million to the Rohingya since the beginning of Trump\u2019s term, although data from the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service show the U.S. contribution in 2025 is $156 million. Asked about the disparity, the State Department said the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service had not been recently updated and \u201cgenerally does not show the latest information on all U.S. funding.\u201d",
      "The department said it had \u201cadvanced burden sharing and improved efficiency\u201d in the Rohingya response, resulting in 11 countries increasing their funding by more than 10% year on year, collectively contributing $72 million.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration continues to pursue the diplomatic efforts to encourage additional countries to help shoulder the burden,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The department didn\u2019t respond to the AP\u2019s request for evidence that the U.S. had influenced other countries\u2019 funding decisions for the Rohingya response.",
      "When the schools shut down, hundreds of underage girls \u2014 some as young as 14 \u2014 were married off, says Showkutara, executive director of the Rohingya Women Association for Education and Development. Her network of contacts across the camps have also reported an increase in kidnapping and trafficking, as well as a huge surge in the prostitution of girls as young as 12 since the aid cuts.",
      "\u201cAfter the school closures, they had no space to play. ... That\u2019s why they\u2019re playing on the roads, far away from their blocks,\u201d says Showkutara, who goes by one name. \u201cThere are some groups who are targeting the children.\u201d",
      "While UNICEF managed to repurpose some of its remaining funding, enabling the agency to recently reopen most of its learning centers, scores of schools run by other aid groups are still shut, and thousands of children remain out of class. And aid workers are anticipating even steeper funding cuts next year, leaving the schools\u2019 futures uncertain. Save the Children has only secured a third of its funding target for life-saving services for 2026, meaning 20,000 children attending its schools are at risk of losing their education starting in January, says Golam Mostofa, the group\u2019s area director for Cox\u2019s Bazar, the closest city to the camps.",
      "Meanwhile, Showkutara says, the children locked out of learning by the initial closures are forever lost: Both metaphorically, in the case of girls like Hasina who were married off to men who will never let them return to school even if they reopen, and literally, in the case of children who vanished into the trafficking network.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d she says.",
      "The little boy sits slumped on a plastic stool under the punishing sun, his cheeks streaked with sweat, a cooler of freeze pops and other treats at his dirty feet. Ever since 10-year-old Mohammed Arfan\u2019s school closed, this is where he spends 10 hours a day, seven days a week, selling snacks and daydreaming of the small schoolroom where he once felt safe and loved.",
      "He had just finished his math lessons the day that his teacher told him the school\u2019s funding was gone. As he walked home, he and his friends began to cry.",
      "\u201cI thought that I would not see my friends anymore, and that I was losing my future,\u201d he says.",
      "With no lessons to occupy his time, and his parents worried about their seven children\u2019s survival, Arfan\u2019s mother told him he would need to work to help keep the family fed.",
      "He was terrified. If the camp\u2019s kidnappers or thieves targeted him while he was working, he knew he was too small to fight back.",

Then, hoisting the 15-kilogram (30-pound) cooler upon his bony shoulder, he walks another 30 minutes to the corner of the dusty road where he sets up shop among the garbage, rotting banana peels and swarms of flies. For his efforts, he takes home around 200 to 300 taka ($1.60 to $2.50) a day.",
      "There are boys like Arfan all over the camps, selling food they\u2019re desperate to eat and collecting trash in exchange for cash, shoulders slumped with exhaustion, skin seared by the sun.",
      "In a drainage ditch next to a row of stinking latrines, 13-year-old Rahamot Ullah wades up to his waist in water clouded with raw sewage, plucking from the muck discarded pieces of plastic. Five hours of rummaging through the waste will generally net him enough plastic to trade for around 50 taka (40 cents).",
      "His eye blazes with blood from the bamboo that pierced it 10 days earlier while slogging through the sewage. He began coming here soon after his school shut down, in the hopes he could collect enough trash to pay the 500 taka ($4) a month fee for private lessons. Many months, that fee has remained out of reach.",
      "He worries he will drown in the ditch. And he worries that his dreams of becoming a camp official or a teacher will never come true.",

      "The laughter that once filled Noor Zia\u2019s classroom has been replaced by tears. Nearly every day, she says, her former students stop by to see if the school has reopened, only to break down when told it has not.",
      "Zia often finds herself in tears, too. Before the aid cuts, she was the head teacher of 21 early learning centers that served 630 children aged 3-5. But the closures left her without a job, making it even harder for her to keep her family alive on the camp\u2019s meager rations.",
      "\u201cMy heart is still crying, because my family depends on this job,\u201d she says, sitting in the empty classroom, where the wall behind her is adorned with a drawing of the Myanmar flag \u2014 a country most of her students, born in the camps, have never seen.",
      "The funding cuts\u2019 pain goes beyond the school closures. Skills development programs that kept thousands of children occupied were also halted. Healthcare, nutrition and sanitation services have been reduced. In camps crawling with scabies and other diseases, the results of the reductions are clear on the children\u2019s scrawny bodies. Lesions line their slender limbs. The wet, rattling coughs of babies fill the fetid air. Atop a muddy hill, clusters of kids scratch ferociously at their heads, while a 4-year-old stoically plucks nits from her friend\u2019s scalp.",
      "Bangladesh has barred the Rohingya from leaving the camps to find work, so they are reliant upon humanitarian aid to survive. But the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program, which had counted the U.S. as its largest donor, says it only has enough funds to continue providing food rations through March.",
      "The prospect of a ration cut has terrified families. With no country offering the Rohingya large-scale resettlement, many have opted to make a run for it, with devastating results. Nearly a third of the 1,340 Rohingya who have fled Bangladesh by boat this year have died or gone missing en route, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.",
      "Noor Kaida, a 17-year-old whose dreams of becoming a doctor were dashed when she was married off after her school shut, says she has lost two young relatives to traffickers.

Other passengers on the girls\u2019 boats later told Kaida\u2019s family both girls were killed; one by drowning, and the other at the hands of a trafficker.",
      "\u201cIf the school wasn\u2019t closed, they wouldn\u2019t have had to take these risks,\u201d Kaida says. \u201cBecause of the funding cuts and the school closures, thousands of girls were scattered in different places and their lives have been ruined.\u201d",

      "\u201cBaba, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d Mohammed told his frantic father. \u201cI\u2019m on the big boat now. Pray for me.\u201d",
      "The call disconnected, and Mohib Ullah knew his worst nightmare had come true: Just like so many other children in recent months, his boy had been taken by traffickers. Ullah \u2014 who has no relation to Rahamot Ullah \u2014 called back again and again, but the phone was switched off.",
      "Mohammed \u2014 whose full name the AP is withholding for safety reasons \u2014 had been miserable since his school closed. The kindhearted boy who loved to read and learn, especially English, had long dreamed of becoming a teacher. When his education ended, he told his father through tears that his life was over. Ullah promised to try and find money for private school, but as a widower caring for four children, it was impossible.",
      "The teen hatched a plan, which he shared in secret with his big sister, Bibi: He would go with a trafficker to Malaysia, and find a future there. Bibi tried to talk him out of it; traffickers who take children on the long, dangerous journey generally detain the youngsters at the end until their parents pay a fee for their release. The children of parents who can\u2019t pay are often tortured, and sometimes killed. Bibi warned her brother that their father would never be able to afford the trafficker\u2019s payment.",
      "But Mohammed didn\u2019t care. \u201cIt\u2019s better to withstand two years of torture than stay here in a hopeless camp,\u201d he told his sister. \u201cIt\u2019s better to die if I can\u2019t continue learning.\u201d",
      "In a panic, Bibi shared her brother\u2019s plan with their father, who was horrified; he knew how deadly the journey to Malaysia can be. He ordered his son to stay put, and to stay patient. The schools will reopen someday, he assured Mohammed. But the teen was convinced they would not.",
      "And so, one morning in October, Mohammed left his family\u2019s shelter and never returned. Ullah scoured the camps and called relatives, searching for any trace of his son. He couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t eat. He has already lost another son, an 8-year-old who suddenly died on the anniversary of Ullah\u2019s wife\u2019s death, after crying all day about missing his mother and then saying he felt unwell. The prospect of losing one more child was unbearable.",
      "Mohammed\u2019s call came on Oct. 21. And then, for over six weeks, there was silence.",
      "On Dec. 6, Ullah\u2019s phone finally rang. It was Mohammed \u2014 still alive, but sick and sobbing. The traffickers were demanding 380,000 taka ($3,100) for his release \u2014 an astronomical sum that Ullah told Mohammed he did not have. But the terrified boy begged his father to try and find it.",
      "Ullah knew if couldn\u2019t, his son would likely be killed. And so he pleaded with anyone he could think of for any money they could spare. In the end, he collected just enough, and Mohammed was set free in Malaysia.",
      "Ullah does not know what will become of his boy, who is still so young and wandering around a country that is alien to him.",
      "\u201cIf he could have continued his studies, he could have been a teacher, he could have stayed near me,\u201d Ullah says, blinking back tears. \u201cNow he\u2019s left me and I can\u2019t see him. So I lost my dream, too.\u201d",
      "His voice cracks as he describes what was long one of his greatest joys: The sight of his son coming home from school, backpack slung across his shoulders.",
      "Now, the stacks of workbooks Mohammed once pored over sit in his bedroom, untouched. His brown sandals are propped against the wall, alongside the sparkly pink sneakers belonging to the sister who tried in vain to stop him.",
      "And, hanging from a piece of bamboo, gathering dust, is his backpack.",

      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul says she has reached a deal with state legislative leaders to approve a bill to give terminally ill people the legal ability to end their own lives with prescribed medication",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Wednesday that she has reached a deal with state legislative leaders to approve a bill to give terminally ill people the legal ability to end their own lives with prescribed medication.",
      "In an op-ed in the Albany Times Union, Hochul said she supports the proposal but has made an agreement with lawmakers to include \u201cguardrails\u201d in the measure before she signs it into law.",
      "Hochul, a Catholic, said she came to the decision after hearing from New Yorkers in the \u201cthroes of pain and suffering,\u201d as well as their children, while also considering opposition from \u201cindividuals of many faiths who believe that deliberately shortening one\u2019s life violates the sanctity of life.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was taught that God is merciful and compassionate, and so must we be,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis includes permitting a merciful option to those facing the unimaginable and searching for comfort in their final months in this life.\u201d",
      "A dozen other states and the District of Columbia allow medically assisted suicide, according to advocates. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed legislation Friday that will allow terminally ill residents of that state to choose to end their lives.",
      "New York\u2019s Medical Aid in Dying Act requires that a terminally ill person who is expected to die within six month make a written request for life-ending drugs. Two witnesses would have to sign the request to ensure that the patient is not being coerced. The request would then have to be approved by the person\u2019s attending physician as well as a consulting physician.",
      "The governor said the bill's sponsors and legislative leaders have agreed to add provisions to require confirmation from a medical doctor that the person \u201ctruly had less than six months to live,\u201d along with confirmation from a psychologist or psychiatrist that the patient is capable of making the decision and is not under duress.",

    "story": [
      "India\u2019s air-quality crisis is deepened by unreliable data",
      "NEW DELHI -- Recent remarks about pollution from two Indian officials have increased frustration among residents who say policymakers are unwilling to acknowledge the severity of India's air quality crisis.",
      "When Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav told Parliament earlier this month that India\u2019s capital, New Delhi, has seen 200 days with good air quality readings, pollution experts and opposition leaders said he chose a figure that overlooked the worst pollution months.",
      "A week later, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said the air quality index \u2014 a measure of air pollution \u2014 was similar to a temperature reading and could be dealt with by spraying water. Crowds jeered her at a subsequent public event, shouting \u201cAQI\u201d in reference to the city's poor air quality readings.",
      "Gupta had also greenlit a controversial cloud seeding program earlier this year, saying it could produce rain that would lower pollution \u2014 despite lack of evidence that the approach would work.",
      "Residents in New Delhi and surrounding areas engulfed in toxic smog over the last few months said these are just the latest examples of officials denying the severity of air quality problems.",
      "\u201cInstead of doing cloud seeding, I hope the government will wake up and take some real action,\u201d said Anita, a 73-year-old New Delhi resident who goes by only one name. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\"",
      "Environmentalists and data experts said India\u2019s air quality measurement standards are looser than in countries such as the United States, so moderate readings often mask dangerous pollution levels. India's government air quality standards are also less stringent than World Health Organization guidelines.",
      "Experts said these gaps can erode public trust, even as few residents fully grasp how harmful polluted air is.",
      "India\u2019s air quality is measured through a nationwide network of monitors and sensors, as well as satellite data.",
      "The monitors collect robust data, but there are too few of them, said Ronak Sutaria, CEO of Respirer Living, which builds machines and software for air quality monitoring. He said that the system falls short of letting citizens know how polluted the air in their neighborhoods really is.",
      "In 2019, India launched the National Clean Air Program, which set targets aiming to reduce pollution by up to 40% in 131 cities by 2026.",
      "The program has seen relative success, providing millions of dollars for monitors and water-spraying machines to reduce dust generated from vehicles plying the roads, construction activity and winds that blow desert sand into the cities.",
      "However, air pollution experts said the program has done little to reduce pollution from carbon-spewing industries or vehicle emissions, which are among the biggest sources of dirty air. Other sources include the burning of crop stubble on farms, use of wood and cow dung as cooking fuel and burning of garbage.",
      "A 2024 report by the Centre for Science and Environment, a New Delhi-based think tank, found that 64% of funds under the program went toward reducing dust and only 12% to reducing pollution from vehicles and less than 1% to bringing down industrial air pollution.",
      "\u201cWe are making huge investments in air quality monitoring. And so when we are expanding, then it also becomes an imperative that we should be focusing on the quality,\u201d said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the think tank.",
      "A study last year by the medical journal Lancet linked long-term exposure to polluted air to 1.5 million additional deaths every year in India, compared to a scenario where the country would have met WHO standards.",
      "Yet earlier this month, Prataprao Jadhav, India\u2019s junior health minister, said there is no conclusive data available in the country to establish a direct correlation of death or disease exclusively to air pollution.",
      "Shweta Narayan, a campaign lead at the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said that air pollution is still not taken seriously as a public health issue.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A former leading scientist at the National Institutes of Health sued the Trump administration Tuesday, saying she was illegally fired for warning that abrupt research cuts were endangering patients and public health.",
      "The NIH has cut billions of dollars in research projects since President Donald Trump took office in January, bypassing the usual scientific funding process. The cuts included clinical trials testing treatments for cancer, brain diseases and other health problems that a recent report said impacted over 74,000 people enrolled in the experiments.",
      "Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo is a well-known HIV expert who led NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Last spring, Marrazzo was put on administrative leave after she challenged NIH officials about the cuts. Among her objections were that some cuts would endanger clinical trial participants while others curtailing infectious disease and vaccine research would harm public health, according to Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit.",
      "In September, Marrazzo filed a complaint alleging whistleblower retaliation with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, and publicly shared her concerns. Weeks later she was fired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in Maryland that claims violations of whistleblower protections.",
      "In a statement issued by her lawyers, Marrazzo said the lawsuit \"is about protecting not just my right to expose abuse and fraud by our government but those rights for all federal employees, so we can safeguard essential public health priorities and the integrity of scientific research.\u201d",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a drug that boosts libido in women who report stress due to a low sex drive",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a much-debated drug aimed at boosting female libido, saying the once-a-day pill can now be taken by postmenopausal women up to 65 years old.",
      "The announcement Monday from the Food and Drug Administration broadens the drug's use to older women who have gone through menopause. The pill, Addyi, was first approved 10 years ago for premenopausal women who report emotional stress due to low sex drive.",
      "Addyi, marketed by Sprout Pharmaceuticals, was initially expected to become a blockbuster drug, filling an important niche in women's health. But the drug came with unpleasant side effects including dizziness and nausea, and it carries a safety warning about the dangers of combining it with alcohol.",
      "The boxed warning cautions that drinking while consuming the pill can cause dangerously low blood pressure and fainting. If patients have several drinks, the label recommends waiting a few hours before taking the drug, or skipping one dose.",
      "Sales of Addyi, which acts on brain chemicals that affect mood and appetite, fell short of Wall Street's initial expectations. In 2019, the FDA approved a second drug for low female libido, an on-demand injection that acts on a different set of neurological chemicals.",
      "Sprout CEO Cindy Eckert said in a statement the approval \u201creflects a decade of persistent work with the FDA to fundamentally change how women\u2019s sexual health is understood and prioritized.\u201d The company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, announced the FDA update in a press release Monday.",
      "The medical condition for a troublingly low sexual appetite, called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has been recognized since the 1990s and is thought to affect a significant portion of American women, according to surveys. After the blockbuster success of Viagra for men in the 1990s, drugmakers began pouring money into research and potential therapies for sexual dysfunction in women.",
      "But diagnosing the condition is complicated because of how many factors can affect libido, especially after menopause, when falling hormone levels trigger a number of biological changes and medical symptoms. Doctors are supposed to rule out a number of other issues, including relationship problems, medical conditions, depression and other mental disorders, before prescribing medication.",

      "California is hiring former senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials to help launch a public health initiative in response to the Trump administration's changes to health guidance",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Two former senior officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including one fired by the Trump administration, will join California as public health consultants, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday.",
      "Susan Monarez was fired as the CDC\u2019s director and Dr. Debra Houry resigned as the agency\u2019s chief medical officer and deputy director over disputes about changes at the agency. The two will work with California's public health department to help build trust in \u201cscience-driven decision-making,\u201d Newsom's office said.",
      "\u201cWe're not just wringing our hands right now \u2014 we're fighting back,\u201d Newsom said at a news conference. \u201cThis is a substantive response to what is not happening in Washington.\u201d",
      "California has increasingly positioned itself as a counterweight to federal health policy, and Newsom has amped up his criticisms of President Donald Trump and challenged the Republican's policies in court. The governor's final term ends in just over a year, and he's gearing up for a possible presidential run in 2028.",
      "California joined Washington and Oregon \u2014 two other states with Democratic governors \u2014 to launch an alliance in September to establish their own public health guidance and vaccine recommendations, as the Trump administration makes sweeping changes to vaccine and health policy.",
      "California state Sen. Tony Strickland, a Republican, said the initiative announced Monday is an example of Newsom prioritizing his national political ambitions over the state.",
      "\u201cCalifornia has serious problems, and we need serious solutions from a serious leader,\u201d Strickland said in a statement.",
      "The White House and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to emails seeking comment on the Monarez and Houry hirings.",
      "Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have repeated falsehoods about vaccines, and the administration has given health recommendations this year that experts say were not backed by science.",
      "Trump in September urged pregnant women not to take Tylenol, saying it could pose a risk of autism to their babies, remarks medical experts said were irresponsible. The CDC website was changed last month to contradict the longtime scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism. A federal vaccine advisory panel voted earlier this month to reverse decades-old guidance recommending that all U.S. babies get immunized against the liver infection hepatitis B on the day they're born. The vaccine is credited with preventing thousands of illnesses.",
      "Monarez, a former director of a federal biomedical research agency, was named acting director of the CDC in January. Trump later nominated her to serve as director. She was confirmed by the Senate in July, making her the first nonphysician to serve in the role. But she was fired by the Trump administration in August after less than a month in the post.",

      "Kennedy has said Monarez was fired after she told him she was untrustworthy. But Monarez said that was false in congressional testimony and that she was fired after refusing to endorse new vaccine recommendations that weren't backed by science.",
      "Monarez, in her new role, will advise California on advancing health technologies, state officials said at the news conference.",
      "\u201cCalifornia is leading the way to no longer sit on the sidelines and hope for a better future,\u201d Monarez said. \u201cCalifornia is investing and innovating now to build the public health systems that will protect lives, strengthen communities and create a future in which all Californians can thrive.\u201d",
      "Houry, who spent more than a decade at the CDC, was among a handful of top officials at the agency who resigned around the time Monarez was fired. Houry said in August she was concerned about the rise of vaccine misinformation during the Trump administration, as well as planned budget cuts, reorganization and firings at the CDC.",
      "Houry, who will serve as a regional and global public health adviser as part of the California initiative, said the effort will \u201cserve as a model for how states can lead together in an era of shifting federal priorities, constrained resources and evolving health threats.\u201d",

      "The warm scents of gingerbread and pine are holiday favorites, but experts warn they can affect indoor air quality",
      "The warm spices in gingerbread, the woodsy aroma of pine and fir trees, and the fruity tang of mulled wine are smells synonymous with the holiday season. Many people enjoy lighting candles, incense and fireplaces in their homes to evoke the moods associated with these festive fragrances.",
      "Burning scented products may create a cozy ambiance, and in the case of fireplaces, provide light and heat, but some experts want people to consider how doing so contributes to the quality of the air indoors. All flames release chemicals that may cause allergy-like symptoms or contribute to long-term respiratory problems if they are inhaled in sufficient quantities.",
      "However, people don't have to stop sitting by the hearth or get rid of products like perfumed candles and essential oil diffusers, said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of the pulmonary and critical care medicine division at John Hopkins University\u2019s medical school. Instead, she recommends taking precautions to control the pollutants in their homes.",
      "\u201cClean air is fragrance free,\u201d said McCormack, who has studied air quality and lung health for more than 20 years. \u201cIf having seasonal scents is part of your tradition or evokes feelings of nostalgia, maybe think about it in moderation.\u201d",
      "People in the Northern Hemisphere tend to spend more time indoors during the end-of-year holidays, when temperatures are colder. Indoor air can be significantly more polluted than outdoor air because pollutants get trapped inside and concentrated without proper ventilation or filtration, according to the American Lung Association.",
      "For example, active fireplaces and gas appliances release tiny airborne particles that can get into the lungs and chemicals like nitrogen dioxide, a major component of smog, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Cleaning products, air fresheners and candles also emit air pollutants at varying concentrations.",
      "The risk fragrances and other air pollutants may pose to respiratory health depends on the source, the length and intensity of a person\u2019s exposure, and individual health, McCormack said.",
      "It is also important to note that some pollutants have no smell, so unscented products still can affect indoor air quality, experts say.",
      "Polluted air affects everyone but not equally. Children, older adults, minority populations and people of low socioeconomic status are more likely to be affected by poor air quality because of either physiological vulnerabilities or higher exposure, according to the environmental agency.",
      "Children are more susceptible to air pollution because of their lung size, which means they get a greater dose of exposure relative to their body size, McCormack said. Pollutants inside the home also post a greater hazard to people with heart or lung conditions, including asthma, she said.",
      "Signs of respiratory irritation include coughing, shortness of breath, headaches, a runny nose and sneezing. Experts advise stopping use of pollutant-releasing products or immediately ventilating rooms if symptoms occur.",

      "Wilkowe said she leans toward candles made with soy-based waxes instead of petroleum-based paraffin. Experts note that all lit candles give off air pollutants regardless of what they are made of.",
      "Buying products with fewer ingredients, opening windows if the temperatures allow, and using air purifiers with HEPA filters are ways to reduce exposure to any pollutants from indoor fireplaces, appliances and candle displays, McCormack said. She also recommends switching on kitchen exhaust fans before starting a gas-powered stovetop and using the back burners so the vent can more easily suck up pollutants.",
      "Setting polite boundaries with guests who smoke cigarettes or other tobacco products is also a good idea, she said.",

      "After Sri Lanka struggled through one of the worst storms in its history, tea plantation workers are taking temporary refuge in government schools and temples as entire villages were buried in mud in the central highlands",
      "CRAIGHEAD ESTATE, Sri Lanka -- Arumugam Manikavalli, awakened by ferocious rain and rumbling earth, fled her home for the safety of a nearby temple on the tea estate where she works. That same November evening, tea worker Kumaran Elumugam's small home was crushed by a landslide, killing six family members.",
      "He survived only because he was away, at work, along with a daughter.",
      "\u201cMy wife, son-in-law, daughter, mother-in-law, two grandsons are all dead,\u201d Elumugam lamented. \u201cThe small one (granddaughter) is still under the mud.\u201d",
      "Elumugum and Manikavalli were among the fortunate to reach safety as heavy rains from Cyclone Ditwah led to floods and landslides across the South Asian island nation, killing more than 640 people and leaving more than a hundred missing. Multiple villages were submerged by landslides that left behind a rubble of cement, wood and roofing. In one area, the wreckage was dotted with clothing, schoolbooks, toys and a sports trophy.",
      "Among the hardest hit were the hilly regions in the island's center and the tea plantation workers who live there. Many occupied primitive, 150-year-old structures that were swept away in landslides and flooding. Social workers said these plantation workers, already living in extremely distressed conditions, are now in an even more desperate situation.",
      "Most tea plantation workers in Sri Lanka belong to the Malaiyaha Tamil ethnic group. Descendants of Tamil indentured laborers who were brought to work from southern India by British colonists more than 200 years ago, over 1 million people belong to this community, the fourth-largest ethnic group on the island.",
      "Sri Lanka grows some of the world's finest tea, bringing billions of dollars into the country. But most Tamils in the hill regions earn well below the minimum wage of 1,200 rupees ($4) per day, with little or no access to education, health care or good jobs.",
      "A report by the American Institute for Sri Lankan Studies said most tea plantation workers own no land or homes and are living in colonial-era working quarters barely bigger than 100 square feet but accommodating as many as eight family members. Multiple houses share bathrooms or have no sanitary facilities.",
      "Many of the tea plantations, on flatter ground, were unaffected by the cyclone while the workers' homes, which were closer to mountain slopes, were destroyed, said Melanie Gunathilaka, a Colombo-based climate activist and researcher.",
      "\u201cThe settlements were in much more dangerous areas,\" she said. \u201cThis shows the amount of value placed on the lives of these people.\u201d",
      "The Planters Association of Ceylon, the association for Sri Lanka's tea companies and estates, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The government said more than 100,000 houses were destroyed or damaged across Sri Lanka. It has promised compensation packages to rebuild houses or to find safer lands and build new houses.",
      "Sundaralingam Pradeep, Sri Lanka's deputy minister for plantations and community infrastructure, told The Associated Press that the government is negotiating with the tea companies to identify lands to build homes for all those affected by the disaster, including retirees still living in company line houses.",

      "Sri Lanka accounts for less than 1% of planet-warming gases in the atmosphere but is considered among nations most at risk from the extreme weather made worse by climate change.",
      "According to the United Nations, Sri Lanka loses more than $300 million every year from climate-triggered extreme weather. At least 750,000 people are affected every year by extreme weather and nearly 19 million of Sri Lanka's 23 million people live in low-lying, landslide-prone or other disaster-vulnerable areas.",
      "But building resilience is difficult. The country owes billions of dollars to the International Monetary Fund, other multilateral development banks, countries such as China, Japan and India and some private banks and private lenders. Sri Lanka is highly dependent on tourism, which was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Severe economic problems led to mass protests and the eventual ouster of the nation's established political elite.",
      "\u201cIn countries like Sri Lanka, disasters don\u2019t break the system. What disasters do is they expose the already broken systems,\u201d said Sandun Thudugala of the Colombo-based nonprofit Law and Society Trust.

      "Climate activist Gunathilaka said the country's debt burden has forced it to prioritize economic growth above everything else so they can repay on time.

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- The spread of famine has been averted in the Gaza Strip, but the situation remains critical with the entire Palestinian territory still facing starvation, the world's leading authority on food crises said Friday.",
      "The new report by The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, comes months after the group said famine was occurring in Gaza City and likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to humanitarian aid restrictions.",
      "There were \u201cnotable improvements\u201d in food security and nutrition following an October ceasefire and no famine has been detected, the report said. Still, the IPC warned that the situation remains \u201chighly fragile\u201d and the entire Gaza Strip is in danger of starvation with nearly 2,000 people facing catastrophic levels of hunger through April.",
      "In the worst-case scenario, including renewed conflict and a halt of aid, the whole Gaza Strip is at risk of famine. Needs remain immense, and sustained, expanded and unhindered aid is required, the IPC said.",
      "The Israeli military agency in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, known as COGAT, said Friday that it strongly rejected the findings.",
      "The agency adheres to the ceasefire and allows the agreed amount of aid to reach the strip, COGAT said, noting the aid quantities \u201csignificantly exceed the nutritional requirements of the population\u201d in Gaza according to accepted international methodologies, including the United Nations.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry said Friday that it also rejects the findings, saying the IPC\u2019s report doesn\u2019t reflect reality in Gaza and more than the required amount of aid was reaching the territory. The ministry said the IPC ignores the vast volume of aid entering Gaza, because the group relies primarily on data related to U.N. trucks, which account for only 20% of all aid trucks.",
      "The IPC said that the report totals include commercial and U.N. trucks and its information is based on U.N. and COGAT data.",
      "Israel\u2019s government has rejected the IPC's past findings, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling the previous report an \u201coutright lie.\u201d",
      "The report's findings come as the shaky U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas reaches a pivotal point as Phase 1 nears completion, with the remains of one hostage still in Gaza. The more challenging second phase has yet to be implemented and both sides have accused the other of violating the truce.",
      "The IPC in August confirmed the grim milestone of famine for the first time in the Middle East and warned it could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. More than 500,000 people in Gaza, about a quarter of its population, faced catastrophic levels of hunger, with many at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes, the August report said.",
      "Friday's report said that the spread of famine had been offset by a significant reduction in conflict, a proposed peace plan and improved access for humanitarian and commercial food deliveries.",
      "There is more food on the ground and people now have two meals daily, up from one meal each day in July. That situation \u201cis clearly a reversal of what had been one of the most dire situations where we were during the summer,\" Antoine Renard, the World Food Program\u2019s director for the Palestinian territories, told U.N. reporters in a video briefing from Gaza City Thursday.",

      "Displacement is one of the key drivers behind the food insecurity, with more than 70% of Gaza's population living in makeshift shelters and relying on assistance. Other factors such as poor hygiene and sanitation as well as restricted access to food are also exacerbating the hunger crisis, the IPC said.",
      "While humanitarian access has improved compared with previous analysis periods, that access fluctuates daily and is limited and uneven across the Gaza Strip, the IPC said.",
      "To prevent further loss of life, expanded humanitarian assistance including food, fuel, shelter and health care is urgently needed, according to the group's experts, who warned that over the next 12 months, more than 100,000 children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition and require treatment.",
      "Figures recently released by Israel\u2019s military suggest that it hasn't met the ceasefire stipulation of allowing 600 trucks of aid into Gaza each day, though Israel disputes that finding.

      "BETHLEHEM, West Bank -- At midnight on Christmas Eve, the words of the traditional hymn \u201cThe Night of Christmas\u201d will ring out in the tiny grotto in Bethlehem\u2019s Church of the Nativity, built on the site where Christians believe Jesus Christ was born.",
      "\u201cOn the night of Christmas, war is buried, On the night of Christmas, love is born,\u201d a local choir sings each year during the midnight service.

      "\u201cIt reminds us that no matter the difficulties, the darkness, there is always a light and that hope is always alive,\u201d said Joseph Hazboun, the conductor of the lay choir made up of local Catholics.",
      "For the past two years, as the war in Gaza dragged on, Christmas in Bethlehem has been a somber affair, without the traditional festivities and decorations and music. But this year, families are flocking again to Manger Square, signaling hope about the fragile ceasefire and providing a much-needed economic boost to Bethlehem.",

      "Even though Belarus has released dozens of prisoners, those who've been freed say the authoritarian government often delivers one final act of repression by confiscating their passports before deporting them",
      "TALLINN, Estonia -- The only official document human rights advocate Uladzimir Labkovich had with him when he was suddenly released from a Belarus prison, blindfolded and driven to neighboring Ukraine was a piece of paper with his name and mugshot on it.",
      "\u201cAfter four and half years of abuse in prison, I was thrown out of my own country without a passport or valid documents,\u201d Labkovich told The Associated Press by phone from Ukraine on Wednesday. \u201cThis is yet another dirty trick by the Belarusian authorities, who continue to make our lives difficult.\u201d",
      "Labkovich, 47, was one of 123 prisoners released by Belarus on Dec. 13 in exchange for the U.S. lifting some trade sanctions on the authoritarian government of President Alexander Lukashenko. All but nine were taken to Ukraine; the rest \u2014 including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski \u2014 were driven to Lithuania.",
      "A close ally of Russia, Lukashenko has ruled his nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for over three decades. Belarus has faced years of Western isolation and sanctions for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory in the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Recently, Lukashenko has sought better relations with the West, releasing hundreds of prisoners since July 2024.",
      "But in a final act of indignity and repression, the newly freed prisoners often are not told they are being deported without passports or other identity papers. They must rebuild their lives abroad, facing bureaucratic obstacles without any help from their homeland.",
      "Because he was blindfolded, Labkovich said he and others could only tell they were heading south. At least 18 prisoners taken to Ukraine \u2014 including Labkovich and Belarusian opposition figures Vitkar Babaryka and Maria Kolesnikova \u2014 had no documents with them, according to rights advocates. Germany has promised to provide shelter to Babaryka and Kolesnikova.",
      "\u201cI dream of hugging my three children and wife in (the Lithuanian capital) Vilnius, but instead I have to deal with absurd bureaucratic procedures,\u201d Labkovich said.",
      "Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled the country in 2020, told AP in written comments that the way the prisoners were taken out of Belarus was \u201ca forced deportation in violation of all international norms and regulations,\u201d adding it was inhumane treatment.",
      "\u201cEven after pardoning people, Lukashenko continues to retaliate against them,\u201d Tsikhanouskaya said. \u201cThey bar people from staying in the country, they forcibly drive them out of Belarus without documents in order to humiliate them even further.\u201d",
      "In September, Lukashenko pardoned more than 50 political prisoners who were taken to the Lithuanian border.",
      "One of them, prominent opposition activist Mikola Statkevich refused to leave Belarus. The 69-year-old, who called the government\u2019s actions a \u201cforced deportation,\u201d pushed his way out of the bus and stayed for several hours in the no-man\u2019s land between the borders before being taken away by Belarusian police and returned to prison.",
      "Fourteen others who had crossed into Lithuania from the September release didn't have passports. Freed activist Mikalai Dziadok said Belarusian security operatives tore up his passport in front of him. Freed journalist Ihar Losik said all of his papers \u2014 including diaries \u2014 were confiscated.",
      "\u201cMy passport was simply stolen. We came here (to Lithuania) \u2014 no one had passports. They took photos, all papers, the verdict, notebooks \u2014 they took everything,\u201d Losik said.",

Tens of thousands were arrested, with many brutally beaten, while hundreds of thousands fled abroad.",
      "Along with Bialiatski, Labkovich was accused of \u201cfinancing public unrest\u201d and helping those affected by the crackdown. Bialiatski was sentenced to 10 years in prison; Labkovich got seven.",

The view for those admiring the late Baroque masterpiece from the piazza above remains free.",
      "The tourist fee announced Friday is part of the Eternal City\u2019s efforts to manage tourist flows in a particularly congested part of town, improve the experience and offset the maintenance costs of preserving all of Rome\u2019s cultural heritage. Officials estimate it could net the city 6.5 million euros ($7.6 million) extra a year.",
      "The fee, which has been discussed and debated for more than a year, follows a similar ticketing system at Rome\u2019s Pantheon monument and the more complicated tourist day-tripper tax that the lagoon city of Venice imposed last year in a bid to ease overtourism and make the city more liveable for residents.",

      "The pay package pads Musk's current fortune of $679 billion.",
      "Elon Musk, already the world's richest man, scored another huge windfall Friday when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018 as an incentive for its CEO to steer the automaker to new heights.",
      "Besides padding Musk's current fortune of $679 billion, the restoration of the 2018 pay package vindicates his long-held belief that the Delaware legal system had overstepped its bounds in January 2024 when Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick rescinded the compensation in a case brought by a disgruntled Tesla shareholder.",
      "Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday.",
      "McCormick's ruling so incensed Musk that it spurred him to spurn Delaware and reincorporate Tesla in Texas. That decision also caused Tesla's board to scramble for ways to keep its CEO happy, including a successful effort to persuade the company's shareholders to reaffirm the pay package, which was valued at $44.9 billion at the time of the second vote 18 months ago.",
      "With Musk still signaling discontent, Tesla upped the ante again this year by crafting another pay package that could pay him $1 trillion if he can lead the automaker down a road during the next decade that lifts the company's market value from its current $1.6 trillion to $8.5 trillion. Shareholders approved that pay package last month, to Musk's delight.",
      "That may sound like a difficult task, but it also appeared like a long shot for Musk to hit all the targets to qualify for the payout that was dangled in the 2018 package. At that time, Tesla was still struggling to expand its production of electric vehicles and burning through cash.",

      "But based on evidence that included Musk's testimony during a 2022 trial, McCormick ruled the pay package had been crafted by a board that was too cozy and beholden to the hard-charging Musk.",
      "In its 49-page ruling, the Delaware Supreme Court cited a variety of errors in McCormick's 2024 decision and declared the 2018 pay package should be restored. It also awarded Tesla $1 in nominal damages.",

      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- To tax tips or not? That is a question that will confront lawmakers in states across the U.S. as they convene for work next year.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is urging states to follow its lead by enacting a slew of new tax breaks for individuals and businesses, including deductions for tips and overtime wages, automobile loans and business equipment.",
      "In some states, the new federal tax breaks will automatically apply to state income taxes unless legislatures opt out. But in many other states, where tax laws are written differently, the new tax breaks won't appear on state tax forms unless legislatures opt in.",
      "In states that don't conform to the federal tax changes, workers who receive tips or overtime \u2014 for example \u2014 will pay no federal tax on those earnings but could still owe state taxes on them.",
      "States that embrace all of Trump's tax cuts could provide hundreds of millions of dollars of annual savings to certain residents and businesses. But that could financially strain states, which are being hit with higher costs because of new Medicaid and SNAP food aid requirements that also are included in the big bill Trump signed.",
      "Most states begin their annual legislative sessions in January. To retroactively change tax breaks for 2025, lawmakers would need to act quickly so tax forms could updated before people begin filing them. States also could apply the changes to their 2026 taxes, a decision requiring less haste.",
      "So far, only a few states have taken votes on whether to adopt the tax breaks.",
      "\u201cStates in general are approaching this skeptically,\" said Carl Davis, research director at the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.",
      "A bill Trump signed on July 4 contains about $4.5 trillion of federal tax cuts over 10 years.",
      "It creates temporary tax deductions for tips, overtime and loan interest on new vehicles assembled in the U.S. It boosts a tax deduction for older adults. And it temporarily raises cap on state and local tax deductions from $10,000 to $40,000, among other things. The law also provides numerous tax breaks to businesses, including the ability to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research.",
      "Forty-one states levy individual income taxes on wages and salaries. Forty-four states charge corporate income taxes.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this month called on those states \u201cto immediately conform\u201d to the federal tax cuts and accused some Democratic-led states that haven't done so of engaging in \"political obstructionism.\u201d Though Bessent didn't mention it, many Republican-led states also have not decided whether to implement the tax deductions.",
      "\u201cBy denying their residents access to these important tax cuts, these governors and legislators are forcing hardworking Americans to shoulder higher state tax burdens, robbing them of the relief they deserve and exacerbating the financial squeeze on low- and middle-income households,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "But some tax analysts contend there's more for states to consider. The tax break on tips, for example, could apply to nearly 70 occupation fields under a proposed rule from the Internal Revenue Service. But that would still exclude numerous low-wage workers, said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the nonprofit Tax Foundation.",

      "\u201cLawmakers need to consider whether these are worth the cost,\u201d Walczak said.",
      "Because of the way state tax laws are written, the federal tax breaks for tips and overtime wages would have carried over to just seven states \u2014 Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon and South Carolina. But Colorado opted out of the state tax break for overtime shortly before the federal law was enacted.",
      "Michigan this fall became first \u2014 and, so far, only \u2014 state to opt into the tax breaks for tips and overtime wages, effective in 2026. The overtime tax exemption is projected to cost the state nearly $113 million and the tips tax break about $45 million during its current budget year, according to the state treasury department.",
      "Michigan lawmakers offset that by decoupling from five federal corporate tax changes the state's treasury estimated would have reduced Michigan tax revenues by $540 million this budget year.",
      "Republican state Rep. Ann Bollin, chair of the Michigan House Appropriations Committee, said the state could not afford to embrace all the tax cuts while still investing in better roads, public safety and education.",
      "\u201cThe best path forward is to have more money in people\u2019s pockets and have less regulation \u2014 and this kind of moved in that direction,\u201d she said.",
      "Arizona could be among the next states to act. Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs has called upon lawmakers to adopt the tax breaks for tips, overtime, seniors and vehicle loans, and follow the federal government by also increasing the state's standard deduction for individual income taxpayers. Republican state House leaders said they stand ready to pass the tax cuts when their session begins Jan. 12.",
      "In addition to Michigan, lawmakers in Delaware, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have passed measures to block some or all of the corporate tax cuts from taking effect in their states.",
      "A new Illinois law decoupling from a portion of the corporate tax changes could save the state nearly $250 million, said Democratic state Sen. Elgie Sims, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He said that could help ensure continued funding for schools, health care and vital services.",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, an outspoken Democratic opponent of Trump, also cited budget concerns for rejecting the corporate tax cut provision. He said states already stand to lose money because of other provisions in Trump's big bill, such as a requirement to cover more of the costs of running the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.",
      "\u201cThe decoupling is an effort to try to hold back the onslaught from the federal government to make sure that we can support programs like the one we\u2019re announcing today,\u201d Pritzker told reporters at a December event publicizing a grant to address homelessness in central Illinois.",

      "Drug prices for patients in the U.S. can depend on a number of factors.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump announced Friday that nine drugmakers have agreed to lower the cost of their prescription drugs in the U.S.",
      "Pharmaceutical companies Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi will now rein in Medicaid drug prices to match what they charged in other developed countries.",
      "As part of the deal, new drugs made by those companies will also be charged at the so-called \u201cmost-favored-nation\u201d pricing across the country on any newly launched medications for all, including commercial and cash pay markets as well as Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "Drug prices for patients in the U.S. can depend on a number of factors, including the competition a treatment faces and insurance coverage. Most people have coverage through work, the individual insurance market or government programs like Medicaid and Medicare, which shield them from much of the cost.",
      "Patients in Medicaid, the state and federally funded program for people with low incomes, already pay a nominal co-payment of a few dollars to fill their prescriptions, but lower prices could help state budgets that fund the programs.",
      "Lower drug prices also will help patients who have no insurance coverage and little leverage to negotiate better deals on what they pay. But even steep discounts of 50% found through the administration\u2019s website could still leave patients paying hundreds of dollars a month for some prescriptions.",
      "William Padula, a pharmaceutical and health economics professor at USC, said Medicaid already has the most favorable drug rates which in some cases will be close to what the \u201cmost-favored-nation\u201d price is so it remains to be seen what other impacts it could have, such as more research and development.",
      "\u201cIt can\u2019t be bad. I don\u2019t see much downside but it\u2019s hard to judge what the upside is,\u201d Padula said.",
      "And while it is significant that Trump was able to get big drugmakers to the table to negotiate lower prices, it will take years to gage how effective this initiative is in terms of more people obtaining more of the medicines they need.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good for their stock and it\u2019s good for their future\u201d research and development, Padula said of the pharmaceutical companies. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly influential but will all this add up to a major effect? Nothing really matters here unless our health gets better as a country.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials said the drugmakers will also sell pharmacy-ready medicines on the TrumpRx platform, which is set to launch in January and will allow people to buy drugs directly from manufacturers.",

      "The New Jersey-based Bristol Myers Squibb further announced that it will be giving for free to the Medicaid program its signature blood thinner prescribed to reduce the risk of blood clots and stroke. Known as Eliquis, it is the company\u2019s top prescribed drug as well as being one of Medicaid\u2019s most widely-used medicines.",
      "Padula said the donations \u2014 which encompass some of the world\u2019s most critical medicines \u2014 are a significant step toward health equity and an acknowledgement that the drugmakers can afford to seek profits elsewhere in their operations. Eliquis already has been one of the most profitable drugs ever made.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a thoughtful health equity move that they can afford given that it\u2019s been such a blockbuster,\u201d Padula said of the Eliquis donation.",
      "Other major drugmakers including Pfizer, AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly struck similar deals with the Trump administration earlier this year.",
      "Though individual terms were not disclosed, the administration has now negotiated lower drug prices with 14 companies since Trump publicly sent letters to executives at 17 pharmaceutical companies about the issue, noting that U.S. prices for brand-name drugs can be up to three times higher than averages elsewhere.",
      "Trump said he effectively threatened the pharmaceutical companies with 10% tariffs to get them to \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d",

      "A nearly 100-year-old bridge over the Mississippi River between Iowa and Wisconsin is scheduled to be imploded Friday, an unusual spectacle that will make way for a modern replacement.",
      "The Mississippi River Bridge, also known as the Black Hawk Bridge, was completed in 1931. It connects Lansing, Iowa, to Wisconsin. The landmark stands out for its unique cantilever design \u2014 a center arch and two tower-like trusses.",
      "\u201cIt carries a lot of sentimental value to, I mean, literally tens of thousands of people,\u201d Lansing Mayor Michael Verdon said.",
      "The bridge, which closed in October, was the only one for about 30 miles (48 kilometers) in each direction and carried about 2,100 vehicles per day. Drivers can now use a ferry service while a new crossing is under construction. The new $140 million replacement is expected to be in service in 2027.",
      "Though it\u2019s beloved, the narrow bridge made for a harrowing experience when two large trucks met, Verdon said. Barges sometimes struck the bridge because of the river geography and configuration of the bridge piers.",
      "Officials are expecting a large crowd to witness the implosion, he said. A live video will be available online.",
      "The center span will be imploded first, followed by the eastern section later in the day. The western section will disassembled in the future because parts of the bridge extend over homes and the railroad.",

      "BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- As the number of skilled tradespeople dwindles in the United States, Walmart is trying to build up its own workforce to keep conveyor belts moving, refrigerated grocery cases cold, and drains and parking lots flowing.",
      "The nation\u2019s largest retailer and private employer revamped its training program last year to increase the pipeline of maintenance technicians who do everything from repair equipment to electrical work at Walmart's distribution centers and stores \u2014 jobs that have become increasingly difficult to fill because of a shrinking labor pool.",
      "The shortage has opened opportunities for people like Liz Cardenas, 24, who started at Walmart in May 2023 as an automation equipment operator at a distribution center in Lancaster, Texas, making sure boxes were securely taped and went through a conveyer belt upright. Today, she is responsible for fixing conveyor belts and other equipment when they break at distribution centers.",
      "Cardenas, who nearly doubled her hourly pay to $43.50 per hour, said she plans to pursue more training, which will mean an even higher salary and more responsibility. It also means financial freedom.",
      "\u201cI was able to move out of my parents\u2019 house,\u201d she said. \u201cI have my own apartment. I was able to get a car, and and I\u2019m able to give more to my 401(k).\u201d",
      "A surge of retirements, along with a slowdown in immigration that began during the pandemic but now is accelerating with President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive deportations, are among the main factors behind labor shortages that bedevil some employers, analysts say.",
      "But in skilled trades, the problem is even more acute. Consulting firm McKinsey analyzed 12 types of trade job categories, including maintenance technicians, welders, and carpenters, and predicted an estimated imbalance of 20 job openings for every one net new employee from 2022 to 2032.",
      "McKinsey noted \u201cthe extraordinary rate of churn\u201d could cost companies more than $5.3 billion every year in talent acquisition and training costs alone.",
      "The shortages are happening as some companies are also laying off workers amid rising operational costs from new tariffs, shifting consumer spending and increased spending on artificial intelligence.",
      "Business Roundtable, a lobbying group of CEOs from roughly 150 companies representing millions of employees nationwide, launched in June a new initiative to address worker shortages in skilled trades, including maintenance technicians. The initiative, co-championed by home improvement retailer Lowe\u2019s, entails working with elementary, middle and high schools to raise awareness.",
      "\u201cWhile technology continues to evolve, it cannot replace plumbers, electricians, construction workers, maintenance and repair pros, or other tradespeople,\u201d said Marvin Ellison, chairman and CEO of Lowe\u2019s.",

Separately, its charitable arm has invested $43 million since 2023 to 60 organizations including technical colleges and non-profit groups to help recruit and train skilled tradespeople like maintenance technicians and plumbers.",
      "Mervin Jebaraj of the University of Arkansas\u2019s Walton College of Business in Fayetteville, Arkansas, noted these programs will help ease the shortages, but they won\u2019t eliminate the gap, particularly given Trump\u2019s clampdown on immigration.",
      "\u201cFor as long as somebody physically needs to fix this, the shortage will persist, even though on the margins it\u2019ll mitigate some of the shortage,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough people.\u201d",
      "Walmart CEO Doug McMillon recently told The Associated Press he believes part of the reason for the shortages is \u201clack of awareness.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think most Americans probably don\u2019t know what a tech makes that helps take care of our stores and clubs and that we can help them learn how to be a tech,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we have a need to get the word out so that people know there are some great jobs.\u201d",
      "Walmart revamped its training program in the spring of 2024, focusing on its own workers with a tuition-free training initiative in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. This year, it added new training sites in Vincennes, Indiana, and Jacksonville, Florida. The initiative combines hands-on instruction and classroom learning in fields like heating, ventilation, air conditioning, electrical work, and general maintenance.",
      "As of mid-November, almost 400 employees had graduated from the program, Walmart said. With its first class of 108 associates who completed the Dallas/Fort Worth pilot program, every graduate secured a technician role, putting them on a path to earn an average of $32 per hour. Walmart said its goal is to put 4,000 workers through the training program by 2030.",
      "R.J. Zanes, vice president of facility services for the U.S. divisions of Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club, said Walmart was able to attract workers from all over the country with different backgrounds, including employees running cash registers.",
      "Maintenance technician roles are crucial to keeping Walmart's operations running smoothly, but especially so during the holiday season. For example, if a refrigeration system goes down within a Walmart store, it could cost up to $300,000 to $400,000 worth of lost product, according to Zanes.",
      "\"We\u2019ve got to stay out in front of that,\" he said. \u201cWe have to ensure that we\u2019ve got the right skills there to do preventative maintenance, and when we do have a breakdown, to make sure that we get it back up as fast as possible to minimize that cost of downtime.\"",

      "The 0.25 percentage point hike took the BOJ's benchmark short-term rate to 0.75%, its highest level since September 1995. It will raise costs for mortgages and other loans, but also boost yields on savings deposits.",
      "\u201cIt is highly likely that wages and prices will continue to rise moderately,\u201d BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda told reporters. \u201cRisks to the economy have diminished, but we must remain vigilant.\u201d",
      "Inflation has long remained above the BOJ's target of about 2%. It was 3% in November, excluding volatile fresh food costs.",
      "The 0.75% rate is still low by most standards, but the BOJ has kept that rate near or below zero for years, trying to pull the economy out of a deflationary funk. Since the pandemic, most other central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, have raised rates to counter spiking inflation and then begun cutting them to help their slowing economies recover momentum.",
      "Japan\u2019s own economy contracted at a 2.3% annual rate in the last quarter, but improved business sentiment and price pressures have led the BOJ to relent and raise rates. Here are some things to know about its decision.",
      "Since Japan's economic bubble burst in the early 1990s, the central bank has kept borrowing costs low to encourage more spending by businesses and consumers.",
      "Lower interest rates have also helped the central bank manage the country's massive national debt, which amounts to nearly triple the size of the economy.",
      "As Japan\u2019s population has aged and begun declining, its economy has slowed and that led to deflation, or falling prices due to weak demand. Even with cheap credit, investment has lagged, stunting economic growth.",
      "In early 2013, the central bank launched what was dubbed a \u201cbig bazooka\u201d of monetary easing, cutting interest rates and purchasing government bonds and other securities to help channel more money into the economy. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the benchmark interest rate was at minus 0.1%. The BOJ only began raising it in 2024, the first hike in 17 years, after inflation stabilized above its target of about 2%.",
      "The Japanese yen has weakened against the U.S. dollar and many other major currencies. So Japanese consumers and companies pay more now for imported food, fuel and other items needed to keep the world's fourth largest economy running.",
      "The strong appetite for investing in dollar-denominated shares of companies linked to the artificial intelligence boom has also pulled money out of the yen and into dollars.",
      "So inflation has risen faster than wages, squeezing household budgets and raising costs for businesses.",

      "\u201cThe BOJ\u2019s stance towards rate hikes reflects the fact that inflation is becoming entrenched,\" Kei Fujimoto, a senior economist at SuMi Trust, said in a commentary. \u201cIf drivers such as a further depreciation of the yen accelerate inflation going forward, it is possible that the pace of rate hikes will also increase accordingly.\u201d",
      "The planned rate hike was reported by Japanese media ahead of time, giving investors a head start on adjusting their portfolios.",
      "Initially, the yen weakened after Friday's rate hike, as the dollar rose to 157 yen, nearly twice its level in 2012 and near its highest level this year.",
      "Still, even small changes in interest rates can have a big impact. Analysts have forecast that higher rates in Japan may undermine an investment strategy known as the \u201ccarry trade.\u201d That involves investors borrowing cheaply in yen and then using that money to invest in higher paying assets elsewhere.",
      "Carry trades are lucrative when stocks and other investments are climbing, but losses can snowball if many traders face pressure to sell stocks or other assets all at once.",
      "Higher rates in Japan may also crimp demand for other assets, including cryptocurrencies. Last week, expectations about the rate hike caused the price of bitcoin, for example, to drop below $86,000. It had bolted to record highs near $125,000 in early October. Bitcoin was trading at about $88,000 early Friday.",
      "Judging the timing and scale of changes to interest rates and other monetary policies is the biggest challenge for central banks, given the time it takes for such moves to ripple throughout the real economy and financial markets.",
      "Like the Federal Reserve, Japan's central bank struggles to balance the need to boost business activity and create jobs with the imperative of containing inflation.",
      "The BOJ held off on raising rates earlier given uncertainties over how U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs might hit automakers and other exporters. A deal setting U.S. duties on imports from Japan at 15%, down from the earlier plan for a 25% rate, has helped ease those concerns.",
      "Ueda, the BOJ governor, noted that with inflation at about 3%, real interest rates remain in negative territory.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cblockade\u201d of sanctioned oil tankers off Venezuela\u2019s coast is raising new concerns about the legality of his military campaign in Latin America",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cblockade\u201d of sanctioned oil tankers off Venezuela\u2019s coast is raising new questions about the legality of his military campaign in Latin America, while fueling concerns that the U.S. could be edging closer to war.",
      "The Trump administration says its blockade is narrowly tailored and not targeting civilians, which would be an illegal act of war. But some experts say seizing sanctioned oil tied to leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro could provoke a military response from Venezuela, engaging American forces in a new level of conflict that goes beyond their attacks on alleged drug boats.",
      "\u201cMy biggest fear is this is exactly how wars start and how conflicts escalate out of control,\u201d said Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cAnd there are no adults in the room with this administration, nor is there consultation with Congress. So I\u2019m very worried.\u201d",
      "Claire Finkelstein, a professor of national security law at the University of Pennsylvania, said the use of such an aggressive tactic without congressional authority stretches the bounds of international law and increasingly looks like a veiled attempt to trigger a Venezuelan response.",
      "\u201cThe concern is that we are bootstrapping our way into armed conflict,\u201d Finkelstein said. \u201cWe\u2019re upping the ante in order to try to get them to engage in an act of aggression that would then justify an act of self-defense on our part.\u201d",
      "Trump has used the word \u201cblockade\u201d to describe his latest tactic in an escalating pressure campaign against Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. and now has been accused of using oil profits to fund drug trafficking. While Trump said it only applies to vessels facing U.S. economic penalties, the move has sparked outrage among Democrats and mostly shrugs, if not cheers, from Republicans.",
      "Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said Trump going after sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela is no different from targeting Iranian oil.",
      "\u201cJust like with the Iranian shadow tankers, I have no problem with that,\u201d McCaul said. \u201cThey\u2019re circumventing sanctions.\u201d",
      "The president has declared the U.S. is in \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug cartels in an effort to reduce the flow of drugs to American communities. U.S. forces have attacked 28 alleged drug-smuggling boats and killed at least 104 people since early September. Trump has repeatedly promised that land strikes are next, while linking Maduro to the cartels.",
      "The campaign has drawn scrutiny in Congress, particularly after it was revealed that U.S. forces killed two survivors of a boat attack with a follow-up strike. But Republicans so far have repeatedly declined to require congressional authorization for further military action in the region, blocking Democrats' war powers resolutions.",
      "Sen. Roger Wicker, Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee, has essentially ended his panel\u2019s investigation into the Sept. 2 strike, saying Thursday that the entire campaign is being conducted \u201con sound legal advice.\u201d",
      "Trump announced the blockade Tuesday, about a week after U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker off Venezuela\u2019s coast. The South American country has the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves and relies heavily on the revenue to support its economy.",
      "The U.S. has been imposing sanctions on Venezuela since 2005 over concerns about corruption as well as criminal and anti-democratic activities. The first Trump administration expanded the penalties to oil, prompting Maduro\u2019s government to rely on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains.",
      "The state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA, has been largely locked out of global oil markets by U.S. sanctions. It sells most of its exports at a steep discount on the black market in China.",
      "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Guerra, Maduro's son and a lawmaker, on Thursday decried Trump\u2019s latest tactic and vowed to work with the private sector to limit any impact on the country\u2019s oil-dependent economy. He acknowledged that it won\u2019t be an easy task.",
      "\u201cWe value peace and dialogue, but the reality right now is that we are being threatened by the most powerful army in the world, and that\u2019s not something to be taken lightly,\u201d Maduro Guerra said.",

      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how the U.S. planned to enact Trump's order. But the Navy has 11 ships in the region and a wide complement of aircraft that can monitor marine traffic coming in and out of Venezuela.",
      "Trump may be using the term \u201cblockade,\u201d but the Pentagon says officials prefer \u201cquarantine.\"",
      "A defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to outline internal reasoning about the policy, said a blockade, under international law, constitutes an act of war requiring formal declaration and enforcement against all incoming and outgoing traffic. A quarantine, however, is a selective, preventive security measure that targets specific, illegal activity.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he was unsure of the legality of Trump's blockade.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re blockading apparently the oil industry, not the entire country,\u201d said Smith, who represents parts of western Washington state. \u201cHow does that change things? I got to talk to some lawyers, but in general, a blockade is an act of war.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has a long history of leveraging naval sieges to pressure lesser powers, especially in the 19th century era of \u201cgunboat diplomacy,\u201d sometimes provoking them into taking action that triggers an even greater American response.",
      "But in recent decades, as the architecture of international law has developed, successive U.S. administrations have been careful not to use such maritime shows of force because they are seen as punishing civilians \u2014 an illegal act of aggression outside of wartime.",
      "During the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, President John F. Kennedy famously called his naval cordon to counter a real threat \u2014 weapons shipments from the Soviet Union \u2014 a \u201cquarantine\u201d not a blockade.",
      "Mark Nevitt, an Emory University law professor and former Navy judge advocate general, said there is a legal basis for the U.S. to board and seize an already-sanctioned ship that is deemed to be stateless or is claiming two states.",
      "But a blockade, he said, is a \u201cwartime naval operation and maneuver\u201d designed to block the access of vessels and aircraft of an enemy state.",
      "\u201cI think the blockade is predicated on a false legal pretense that we are at war with narcoterrorists,\u201d he said.",
      "Nevitt added: \u201cThis seems to be almost like a junior varsity blockade, where they\u2019re trying to assert a wartime legal tool, a blockade, but only doing it selectively.\u201d",
      "Geoffrey Corn, a Texas Tech law professor who previously served as the Army\u2019s senior adviser for law-of-war issues and has been critical of the Trump administration\u2019s boat strikes, said he was not convinced the blockade was intended to ratchet up the conflict with Venezuela.",
      "Instead, he suggested it could be aimed at escalating the pressure on Maduro to give up power or encouraging his supporters to back away from him.",
      "\u201cYou can look at it through the lens of, is this an administration trying to create a pretext for a broader conflict?\u201d Corn said. \u201cOr you can look at it as part of an overall campaign of pressuring the Maduro regime to step aside.\u201d",

      "The proposed $85 billion merger of the Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads has lost the support of two of their biggest unions that represent more than half the workers because they are worried the deal would increase safety risks, lead to hig...",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads has lost the support of two of their biggest unions that represent more than half the workers because they are worried the deal would increase safety risks, lead to higher shipping rates and consumer prices and cause significant disruptions.",
      "The unions' decision they plan to announce Wednesday will make the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division two of the most prominent critics of the deal to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. They join the American Chemistry Council, an assortment of agricultural groups and competing railroad BNSF in raising concerns that this combination would hurt competition.",
      "But the deal has picked up the support of the nation's largest rail union that represents conductors and hundreds of individual shippers as well as an Oval Office endorsement from President Donald Trump. The U.S. Surface Transportation Board will begin weighing the opinions of all those stakeholders to determine whether the merger is in the public interest once the railroads file their formal application, which is expected later this week.",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena has argued that creating a railroad that stretches from coast to coast would be good for the economy because it would be able to deliver shipments more quickly without handing them off between railroads in the middle of the country and it could better compete against trucking. But the presidents of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division unions \u2014 which are both affiliated with the Teamsters \u2014 said that after months of meetings with Vena and other executives they have serious doubts about the potential benefits, and they said the promises Vena made to preserve jobs for all current employees aren't detailed enough to be counted on.",
      "\u201cThis proposed monopoly will end up costing businesses more and those costs will be passed on to consumers,\u201d Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen National President Mark Wallace said. \"We believe this transcontinental railroad will make shipping by rail less attractive as the merged carrier passes off rail lines that serve small towns, factories and farms to short line railroads while running miles-long slow-moving trains on the main line. For rail customers it will be a choice between \u2019Hell or the highway.' \u201d",
      "The unions say they are worried that safety could deteriorate after a merger because Norfolk Southern has made some strides over the past two and a half years since the disastrous East Palestine, Ohio, derailment.",
      "Vena and Norfolk Southern CEO Mark George have said they are optimistic the merger will get approved because they believe it will be good for the country, their customers and rail workers. Shareholders of both railroads overwhelmingly support it.",
      "The Surface Transportation Board plans to review the deal under the tough new standard it adopted in 2001 after a series of disastrous rail mergers in the 1990s that led to delays of weeks or even months for some shipments. These untested rules require any merger of the six largest railroads to be in the public interest and show that it will enhance competition. When the Surface Transportation Board approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades two years ago it used a less stringent standard allowing Canadian Pacific's $31 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern.",
      "Transportation expert and DePaul University Professor Joe Schwieterman said many people have been raising concerns about the Union Pacific merger because of its scope and the likelihood that it could trigger another merger and leave companies with only two American railroads to deal with. But everyone wants to examine the details in the merger application closely, he said.",

      "A merged Union Pacific would likely control more than 40% of the nation's freight.",
      "BNSF's Chief of Staff Zak Andersen said his railroad, which is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, is convinced this merger would be bad for competition and only lead to higher rates and fewer options for shippers.",

Instead, they believe the railroads should continue to find ways to cooperate to deliver shipments more quickly, which can be done without all the complications of a merger. Still, CSX decided to replace its CEO this fall with an executive who has a background leading companies through major mergers.",

      "The Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, but when it cuts its short-term rate that can signal lower inflation or slower economic growth ahead, which can drive investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Even so, Fed rate cuts don\u2019t always translate into lower mortgage rates. That\u2019s what happened in the fall of 2024 after the central bank cut its main rate for the first time in more than four years. Instead of falling, mortgage rates marched higher, eventually cresting above 7% in January this year. At that time, the 10-year Treasury yield was climbing toward 5%.",

Jim Hunt, a towering figure in North Carolina politics in the late 20th century who helped leaders from both major parties strive for public education reform, died Thursday at the age of 88, his daughter Lt. Gov. Rachel Hunt announced.",
      "Hunt, whose career provided a prototype for the modern \"education governor,\" served an unprecedented 16 years as governor as the state received the rewards and stings of shifting from textiles and tobacco to a high-tech economy.",
      "Rachel Hunt\u2019s office said that her father died peacefully Thursday at his Wilson County home.",
      "\u201cHe devoted his life to serving the people of North Carolina, guided by a belief that public service should expand opportunity, strengthen communities, and always put people first,\u201d Rachel Hunt said in a news release that also referenced \u201cmy beloved daddy and hero.\u201d",
      "Considered a business-oriented progressive, Hunt was a giant in state government and influential in the national education reform movement of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. He was first elected governor in 1976 and, after a constitutional change, became the first North Carolina governor elected to successive four-year terms.",
      "Following an epic U.S. Senate campaign loss to Republican icon Jesse Helms in 1984, Hunt's political career resumed eight years later with a third term at the Executive Mansion, followed by reelection in 1996.",
      "Hunt remained active in Democratic politics after leaving office in 2001, particularly as he watched prot\u00e9g\u00e9s such as former Gov. Roy Cooper and the late U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan achieve higher office. He campaigned for President Barack Obama in 2012 and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Cooper in 2016.",
      "\u201cI can think of no one who shaped North Carolina\u2019s recent successes as much as Governor Jim Hunt,\" current Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said Thursday. And Cooper called Hunt the \u201cgreatest Governor in North Carolina history.\u201d",
      "Even entering his 80s, Hunt urged Republicans in charge of the legislature to fund \u201cbig things\u201d for public education, rather than pass more income tax cuts.",
      "\u201cI'm proud of what we've done together,\u201d Hunt said in a May 2017 interview. \u201cBut I'm far from satisfied about where we are and determined to keep doing my little bit, I guess, to help us keep changing things and improving things in North Carolina. And I know you do it mainly through education.\u201d",
      "Hunt concentrated relentlessly on public schools, talking about the connection between education achievement and competing in the world economy. In the 1970s, while lieutenant governor, he worked with Republican Gov. Jim Holshouser to make North Carolina the first state with full-day kindergarten.",
      "In the 1980s, he helped create the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and pressed for standardized testing for public school students nationwide so that states could compare themselves.",
      "Returning as governor in the 1990s, he championed the Smart Start early childhood initiative, viewed as a national model to prepare children for school, and higher teacher pay. And after the end of his career in office, The Hunt Institute began training up and coming political stars nationwide about public education policy.",

Roy Barnes said in a 2009 interview. \u201cWe will feel the effect of Jim Hunt\u2019s leadership for generations to come.\u201d",
      "Hunt was an unabashed lobbyist for his programs and initiatives, often making late-night phone calls to lawmakers to persuade them. If that failed, he would enlist key constituents in a legislator\u2019s district to bombard with them calls all weekend.",
      "\u201cHe really had a way of pushing you to do things you never thought you could do,\u201d said Gary Pearce, a longtime Hunt staffer and later biographer. \u201cHe made you feel like that you were genuinely making the world a better place.\u201d",
      "James Baxter Hunt Jr. was born May 16, 1937, in Greensboro, North Carolina. He grew up on the family\u2019s tobacco and dairy farm in Wilson County. After law school graduation, Hunt, his wife, Carolyn, and their young children lived in Nepal for two years while working for the Ford Foundation.",
      "Hunt rose quickly in Democratic politics, serving as president of the state\u2019s Young Democrats in 1968 and getting elected lieutenant governor four years later.",
      "In a controversial move during his first term as governor, Hunt commuted the sentences of nine Black men and one white woman convicted of the 1971 firebombing of a Wilmington grocery store during days of violence that included the shooting of a Black teenager by police. Key witnesses in the case had recanted their testimony. Full pardons for the \u201cWilmington 10\u201d didn\u2019t come until 2012.",
      "His second four-year term closed with his political battle with Helms, the conservative firebrand known as \u201cSenator No\u201d for his opposition to civil rights, gay rights, abortion and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Hunt lost as Helms\u2019 campaign blistered him with ads portraying Hunt as a flip-flopper on the issues.",
      "A defeated Hunt returned to practicing law but remained in public life. His comeback to state politics in the early 1990s helped delay a growing Republican tide in North Carolina politics.",
      "Even GOP leaders begrudgingly were impressed with Hunt\u2019s ability to tack with changing political winds. In the mid-1990s, he called a special legislative session to get tough on crime and proposed tax cuts larger than what Republicans initially offered.",
      "Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a former state House speaker in the 2010s, called Hunt on Thursday \u201cone of the most consequential public servants in North Carolina\u2019s history.\u201d",

      "GLOUCESTER, England -- Waiting in the wings on opening night of \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d Michael Edwards felt the nerve-wracking jitters he experienced four decades earlier staring through thick glasses down a perilously steep ski jump.",
      "The athlete-turned-performer better known as \u201cEddie the Eagle\u201d was no stranger to fear, but this was different: he was about to face a theater packed with children.",
      "In ski jumping, he might break his neck; here he only risked tripping over his lines and failing to win laughs.",
      "Edwards has added acting to the bustling business of being Eddie the Eagle, feathering his nest and stretching his celebrity far longer than his brief flight as Britain\u2019s first Olympic ski jumper won him fame despite finishing last in the 1988 Calgary Games.",
      "There is almost nothing he hasn't done since he entered the spotlight. He has recorded songs, danced on ice, dressed twice as a chicken (eagle suits are scarce), been interviewed in an Amsterdam brothel, filmed car and spectacle commercials, and spoken for hours at a time about what he knows best: how he landed here.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always very, very grateful that I got christened Eddie The Eagle and it\u2019s amazing that I\u2019m talking about it 38 years later,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that I encourage other people to get out there, get off their bum and go for their dream.\u201d",
      "It didn't appear early on that Edwards was headed for fame.",
      "He grew up \u2014 and still lives \u2014 on the edge of the Cotswolds, in western England where snow is rare and the hills would never be mistaken for mountains. His father expected his son to follow him into plastering \u2014 as he did after his father and grandfather.",
      "But an adolescent Edwards had different designs after a school trip to the Italian Alps sparked a passion for skiing. He became a fixture at Gloucester Ski Centre, where a bristly plastic surface shorter than three football fields offers year-round skiing.",
      "He became a good downhiller, but didn't make the British ski team for the 1984 Sarajevo Olympics. Undeterred, he set his sights higher after realizing Britain had no ski jumpers.",
      "Edwards went to Lake Placid, New York, where he rummaged for skis and gear, including a helmet with no strap that he secured with string and oversized boots he padded out with five pairs of socks.",
      "At 22, he was learning what the world\u2019s best jumpers began mastering as children.",
      "\u201cIt was like a crash course. And, yeah, I did take huge risks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I finished ski jumping, I was just as scared to do my last jump as I was to do my first. You never get used to it.\u201d",
      "Short on cash and lacking sponsors, he scrounged food from trash bins, slept in barns, a car and even a mental hospital in Finland \u2014 not to mention medical hospitals.",
      "\"It would be easier to name the bones I haven\u2019t broken,\" he quipped.",
      "He fractured his skull twice \u2014 while wearing a helmet \u2014 broke his jaw, smashed his collarbone in five places, broke three ribs and damaged a kidney and a knee. It didn't stop him.",
      "He worked up to bigger jumps and competed internationally. Despite efforts by British sports federations to prevent him competing, he eventually jumped far enough to represent Great Britain at the Olympics.",
      "Edwards arrived in Calgary to a sign welcoming \u201cEddie the Eagle\u201d \u2014 unaware it was for him.",
      "Reporters loved his enthusiastic underdog determination and physical appearance. He was hefty by ski jumping standards, had a lantern jaw, wispy moustache and eyes that bulged behind thick lenses in his pink-rimmed aviator-style glasses.",
      "Few outside the ski jumping world remember the winner, \u201cFlying Finn\u201d Matti Nyk\u00e4nen, who soared over 120 meters and swept all events.",
      "The most famous remains the man who finished last \u2014 19 meters behind his nearest competitor, but setting a new British record of 71 meters (77 yards).",

      "The Los Angeles Angels have settled a lawsuit over the drug overdose death of pitcher Tyler Skaggs",
      "SANTA ANA, Calif. -- The Los Angeles Angels reached a confidential settlement Friday with the family of late pitcher Tyler Skaggs after a lengthy trial that detailed drug use by players.",
      "The two-month trial centered on whether the Angels bore responsibility for Skaggs' 2019 overdose death on a team trip in Dallas after he'd been given a counterfeit oxycodone pill laced with fentanyl by the team's then-communications director, Eric Kay. The last-minute settlement was reached as jurors were nearing the end of their deliberations, they said.",
      "The jury had concluded the Angels were negligent and had moved on to determining what percentage of responsibility the team shared for Skaggs\u2019 death, said juror Jasson Thach.",
      "\u201cThe repeated negligence of the Angels was really it,\u201d Thach said, adding the group had been estimating damages at between $60 million and $100 million.",
      "The trial drew outfielder Mike Trout, Angels president John Carpino and other employees to the stand, as well as relatives of Skaggs and Kay. The employees told the court how players drank and partied on the team plane and paid Kay for clubhouse stunts including taking a fastball to the leg.",
      "Skaggs\u2019 widow, Carli, and his parents said in their lawsuit that the MLB team knew or should have known Kay was a drug addict and dealing painkillers to players.",
      "\u201cTomorrow is the first day of the rest of their lives after six years of living with this,\u201d Rusty Hardin, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told reporters.",
      "The Angels contended that team officials would have gotten Skaggs help if they had known he was taking drugs.",
      "\u201cThe death of Tyler Skaggs remains a tragedy, and this trial sheds light on the dangers of opioid use and the devastating effects it can have,\u201d the team said in a statement Friday.",
      "In 2019, the 27-year-old left-handed pitcher was found dead in the suburban Dallas hotel room where he was staying as the Angels were supposed to open a four-game series against the Texas Rangers. A coroner\u2019s report said the player choked to death on his vomit, and a toxic mix of alcohol, fentanyl and oxycodone was found in his system.",
      "Kay, a longtime Angels employee, was convicted in 2022 of providing Skaggs with the pill and sentenced to 22 years in prison. His criminal trial in Texas included testimony from five MLB players who said they received oxycodone from Kay at various times from 2017 to 2019.",

      "During the civil trial in California, more than 40 witnesses testified about drug use and baseball, including how much money Skaggs was poised to make had he lived. They described how Kay got players massage appointments, tee times and even prescription medication and was found with plastic bags filled with pills at his home and later hospitalized for a drug overdose. Kay was sent on the Texas road trip shortly after returning to work from rehab, they said.",
      "Witnesses also described how Skaggs struggled with painkillers earlier in his career and chopped up and snorted a pill the day he died.",
      "Skaggs had been a regular in the Angels\u2019 starting rotation since late 2016 and struggled with injuries repeatedly. He previously played for the Arizona Diamondbacks.",
      "Jurors began deliberations this week. Late Wednesday, they sent out a question for the court asking whether they got to assign punitive damages. They didn't work on Thursday and resumed deliberations Friday morning.",
      "Upon releasing the jurors, Orange County Superior Court Judge H. Shaina Colover thanked them for their diligence. \u201cThat is why this matter was able to be resolved today,\u201d she said.",
      "Several jurors said they were heading into what many felt would be a tough issue \u2014 determining percentages of responsibility among Skaggs, Kay and the team. About a third of the group tended to side with plaintiffs, a third with the team and a third was in the middle in answering the 26-question verdict form, said Thach.",
      "Juror Deborah Song said she was relieved the case settled after spending the last two months in court.",
      "\u201cI am so happy because that way I don\u2019t have to put a number on somebody\u2019s life,\u201d Song said.",

      "Animals that navigate extreme conditions and environments have evolved to sleep in extreme ways",
      "Every animal with a brain needs sleep \u2014 and even a few without a brain do, too. Humans sleep, birds sleep, whales sleep and even jellyfish sleep.",
      "Sleep is universal \u201ceven though it\u2019s actually very risky,\u201d said Paul-Antoine Libourel, a researcher at the Neuroscience Research Center of Lyon in France.",
      "When animals nod off, they're most vulnerable to sneaky predators. But despite the risks, the need for sleep is so strong that no creature can skip it altogether, even when it's highly inconvenient.",
      "Animals that navigate extreme conditions and environments have evolved to sleep in extreme ways \u2014 for example, stealing seconds at a time during around-the-clock parenting, getting winks on the wing during long migrations and even dozing while swimming.",
      "For a long time, scientists could only make educated guesses about when wild animals were sleeping, observing when they lay still and closed their eyes. But in recent years, tiny trackers and helmets that measure brain waves \u2014 miniaturized versions of equipment in human sleep labs \u2014 have allowed researchers to glimpse for the first time the varied and sometimes spectacular ways that wild animals snooze.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re finding that sleep is really flexible in response to ecological demands,\u201d said Niels Rattenborg, an animal sleep research specialist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence in Germany.",
      "Call it the emerging science of \u201cextreme sleep.\u201d",
      "Take chinstrap penguins in Antarctica that Libourel studies.",
      "These penguins mate for life and share parenting duties \u2014 with one bird babysitting the egg or tiny gray fluffy chick to keep it warm and safe while the other swims off to fish for a family meal. Then they switch roles \u2014 keeping up this nonstop labor for weeks.",
      "Penguin parents face a common challenge: getting enough sleep while keeping a close eye on their newborns.",
      "They survive by taking thousands of catnaps a day \u2014 each averaging just 4 seconds long.",
      "These short \u201cmicrosleeps,\" as Korea Polar Research Institute biologist Won Young Lee calls them, appear to be enough to allow penguin parents to carry out their caregiving duties for weeks within their crowded, noisy colonies.",
      "When a clumsy neighbor passes by or predatory seabirds are near, the penguin parent blinks to alert attention and soon dozes off again, its chin nodding against its chest, like a drowsy driver.",
      "The naps add up. Each penguin sleeps for a total of 11 hours per day, as scientists found by measuring the brain activity of 14 adults over 11 days on Antarctica's King George Island.",
      "To remain mostly alert, yet also sneak in sufficient winks, the penguins have evolved an enviable ability to function on extremely fractured sleep \u2014 at least during the breeding season.",
      "Researchers can now see when either hemisphere of the brain \u2014 or both at once \u2014 are asleep.",
      "Poets, sailors and birdwatchers have long wondered whether birds that fly for months at a time actually get any winks on the wing.",

      "In some cases, the answer is yes \u2014 as scientists discovered when they attached devices that measure brain-wave activity to the heads of large seabirds nesting in the Galapagos Islands called great frigatebirds.",
      "While flying, frigatebirds can sleep with one half of the brain at a time. The other half remains semialert so that one eye is still watching for obstacles in their flight path.",
      "This allows the birds to soar for weeks at a time, without touching land or water, which would damage their delicate, non-water repellent feathers.",
      "Frigatebirds can't do tricky maneuvers \u2014 flapping, foraging or diving \u2014 with just one half of their brain. When they dive for prey, they must be fully awake. But in flight, they have evolved to sleep when gliding and circling upward on massive drafts of warm rising air that keep them aloft with minimal effort.",
      "Back at the nest in trees or bushes, frigatebirds change up their nap routine \u2014 they are more likely to sleep with their whole brain at once and for much longer bouts. This suggests their in-flight sleeping is a specific adaptation for extended flying, Rattenborg said.",
      "A few other animals have similar sleeping hacks. Dolphins can sleep with one half of the brain at a time while swimming. Some other birds, including swifts and albatrosses, can sleep in flight, scientists say.",
      "Frigatebirds can fly 255 miles (410 kilometers) a day for more than 40 days, before touching land, other researchers found \u2014 a feat that wouldn\u2019t be possible without being able to sleep on the wing.",
      "On land, life is easy for a 5,000-pound (2,268-kilogram) northern elephant seal. But at sea, sleep is dangerous \u2014 sharks and killer whales that prey on seals are lurking.",
      "These seals go on extended foraging trips, for up to eight months, repeatedly diving to depths of several hundred feet (meters) to catch fish, squid, rays and other sea snacks.",
      "Each deep dive may last around 30 minutes. And for around a third of that time, the seals may be asleep, as research led by Jessica Kendall-Bar of Scripps Institution of Oceanography revealed.",
      "Kendall-Bar's team devised a neoprene headcap similar to a swimming cap with equipment to detect motion and seal brain activity during dives, and retrieved the caps with logged data when seals returned to beaches in Northern California.",
      "The 13 female seals studied tended to sleep during the deepest portions of their dives, when they were below the depths that predators usually patrol.",
      "That sleep consisted of both slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. During REM, or rapid eye movement sleep, the seals were temporarily paralyzed \u2014 just like humans during this deep-sleep stage \u2014 and their dive motion changed. Instead of a controlled downward glide motion, they sometimes turned upside down and spun in what the researchers called a \u201csleep spiral\u201d during REM sleep.",
      "In the span of 24 hours, the seals at sea slept for around two hours total. (Back on the beach, they averaged around 10 hours.)",
      "Scientists are still learning about all the reasons we sleep \u2014 and just how much we really need.",
      "It's unlikely that any tired human can try these extreme animal sleep hacks. But learning more about how varied napping may be in the wild shows the flexibility of some species. Nature has evolved to make shut-eye possible in even the most precarious situations.",

      "The team led by researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory challenged the decade-long assumption of a buried global ocean at Titan after taking a fresh look at observations made years ago by NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft around Saturn.",
      "They stress that no one has found any signs of life at Titan, the solar system\u2019s second largest moon spanning 3,200 miles (5,150 kilometers) and brimming with lakes of liquid methane on its frosty surface.",
      "But with the latest findings suggesting a slushy, near-melting environment, \u201cthere is strong justification for continued optimism regarding the potential for extraterrestrial life,\u201d said the University of Washington\u2019s Baptiste Journaux, who took part in the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "As to what form of life that might be, possibly strictly microscopic, \u201cnature has repeatedly demonstrated far greater creativity than the most imaginative scientists,\" he said in an email.",
      "JPL\u2019s Flavio Petricca, the lead author, said Titan\u2019s ocean may have frozen in the past and is currently melting, or its hydrosphere might be evolving toward complete freezing.",
      "Computer models suggest these layers of ice, slush and water extend to a depth of more than 340 miles (550 kilometers). The outer ice shell is thought to be about 100 miles (170 kilometers) deep, covering layers of slush and pools of water that could go down another 250 miles (400 kilometers). This water could be as warm as 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).",
      "Because Titan is tidally locked, the same side of the moon faces Saturn all the time, just like our own moon and Earth. Saturn\u2019s gravitational pull is so intense that it deforms the moon\u2019s surface, creating bulges as high as 30 feet (10 meters) when the two bodies are closest.",
      "Through improved data processing, Petricca and his team managed to measure the timing between the peak gravitational tug and the rising of Titan\u2019s surface. If the moon held a wet ocean, the effect would be immediate, Petricca said, but a 15-hour gap was detected, indicating an interior of slushy ice with pockets of liquid water. Computer modeling of Titan\u2019s orientation in space supported their theory.",

      "Fernando Moreno has been waiting for a kidney transplant for about two years",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Fernando Moreno has been on dialysis for about two years, enduring an \u201cunbearable\u201d wait for a new kidney to save his life. His limited world of social contacts has meant that his hopes have hinged on inching up the national waiting list for a transplant.",
      "That was until earlier this year, when the Philadelphia hospital where he receives treatment connected him with a promising pilot project that has paired him with \u201cangel advocates\u201d \u2014 Good Samaritan strangers scattered around the country who leverage their own social media contacts to share his story.",
      "So far, the Great Social Experiment, as it was named by its founder, Los Angeles filmmaker David Krissman, hasn't found the Vineland, New Jersey, truck driver a living kidney donor. But there are encouraging early signs the angel advocate approach is working, and there's no question it has given Moreno new optimism.",
      "\u201cThis process is great,\u201d said Moreno, 50, whose own father died of kidney failure at 65. \u201cI'm just hoping there will be somebody out there that\u2019s willing to take a chance.\u201d",
      "Moreno is part of a pilot program with 15 patients that began in May at three Pennsylvania hospitals. It's testing whether motivated, volunteer strangers can help improve the chances of finding a life-saving match for a new kidney \u2014 particularly for people with limited social networks.",
      "\u201cWe know how this has always been done, and we're trying to put that on steroids and really get them the help that they need,\u201d Krissman said. \u201cMost patients are too sick to do this on their own \u2014 many don't have the skills to do it on their own.\u201d",
      "The Gift of Life Donor Program, which serves as the organ procurement network for eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, is supporting the pilot program with a grant of more than $100,000 from its foundation.",
      "So far, two of the five patients in the program through Temple University Hospital have found kidney donors, and one is preparing for surgery, according to Ryan Ihlenfeldt, the hospital\u2019s director of clinical transplant services. One of the five patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Harrisburg has also undergone a transplant.",
      "The approach Krissman has developed is something new, said Richard Hasz Jr., Gift of Life's chief executive, and may help identify the types of messages that attract and motivate potential live kidney donors.",
      "\u201cThis is the first of its kind that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Hasz said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, I think, the foundation was so interested in doing it -- studying it and hopefully publishing it \u2014 so we can create that blueprint, if you will, for the future.\u201d",
      "Gift of Life agreed to fund a broader test and helped Krissman identify five patients each at Temple, UPMC-Harrisburg and Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.",
      "Hasz said the pilot program's approach combines social media outreach with Krissman\u2019s storytelling talents and aggressive efforts to mobilize the patients\u2019 own connections.",
      "\u201cWe know that patients who are waiting don\u2019t always have the energy or the resources to do this themselves,\u201d Hasz said.",
      "There have been other ways for patients to set up \u201c microsites \u201d where they can tell their stories and seek a donor match. But the pilot program currently underway in Pennsylvania aims to connect patients with a wide universe of potential donors and produce videos and other ways to spread their message.",
      "Krissman's bout with an illness about two decades ago inspired him to tackle the sticky challenge of increasing live kidney donations. He was debilitated for more than a year before medication helped him recover, explaining, \u201cIt gave me my life back. And I never forgot what it's like to be chronically sick.\u201d",
      "After producing a podcast on kidney transplantation, Krissman recruited four patients through Facebook who were waiting for kidneys. He was able to help two of them. A second effort, a pilot program with three patients in North Carolina that ended last year, helped match all three with living donors.",

      "Some 90,000 people in the United States are on a list for a kidney transplant, and most of the roughly 28,000 kidneys that were transplanted last year came from deceased donors. Living kidney donations are hard to come by \u2014 about 6,400 were transplanted last year. Thousands die each year waiting for an organ transplant in the United States.",
      "Living kidney donations can be a better match, reducing the risk of organ rejection. They allow for surgery to be planned for a time that is optimal for the donor, the recipient and the transplant team. And, the foundation says, living donor kidneys, on average, last longer than kidneys from deceased donors.",
      "The National Kidney Foundation says living donors must be at least 18 years old, although some transplant centers set the minimum age at 21. Potential donors get screened for health problems and can be ruled out if they have uncontrolled high blood pressure, diabetes or cancer, or if they are smokers.",
      "Many living donors make \u201cdirected donations\u201d to specify who will get their kidney. Nondirected donations are made anonymously to a patient.",
      "Francis Beaumier, a 38-year-old information technology worker from Green Bay, Wisconsin, came into contact with the angel advocate program after being a double living donor \u2014 a kidney and part of his liver.",
      "He sees the program as \u201ca great little way for everyone to make a small difference.\u201d",
      "Another angel advocate, Holly Armstrong, was also a living donor. She hopes her efforts will plant a seed.",
      "\u201cSome people might just keep scrolling,\u201d said Armstrong, who lives in Lake Wiley, South Carolina. \u201cBut there might be someone like me, where they stop scrolling and say, \u2018This boy needs a kidney.\u2019\u201d",
      "A study released last year found that people who volunteer to donate a kidney are at a lower risk of death from the operation than doctors had previously thought. Tracking 30 years of living kidney donations, researchers found fewer than 1 in every 10,000 donors died within three months of the surgery. Newer and safer surgical techniques were credited for dropping the risk from 3 deaths per 10,000 living donors.",
      "Temple serves a large cohort of poorer patients who can have difficulty understanding health issues and who suffer from uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes, Ihlenfeldt, who works there, said.",
      "\u201cWhat David\u2019s trying to do is coalesce a network of support around these patients who are sharing the story for them,\u201d Ihlenfeldt said.",
      "At a kickoff event in a Harrisburg meeting room for kidney patient Ahmad Collins, a couple dozen friends and family listened with rapt attention as Krissman went over the game plan, answering questions and describing the transplant process.",

      "His mind was on the strangers who might decide to pitch in.",
      "\u201cThey can be a superhero, so to speak,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThey can have the opportunity to save somebody's life, and not too many times in life do you have that opportunity.\u201d",

I found it was quite effective at stopping me from opening two of my favorite time-wasters, Reddit and Instagram, though I ended up spending more time on other apps like Facebook. To block all apps, you'll have to shell out for a subscription \u2014 $6 a month or $50 annually.",

      "Meteor showers happen when space rocks hit Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds and burn up, gaining fiery tails \u2014 the end of a \u201cshooting star.\u201d Random meteors are visible from Earth on any given clear night, but more predictable meteor showers happen yearly when Earth passes through streams of cosmic leftovers from comets or asteroids.",
      "The Ursids peak Sunday night into Monday morning and will be visible until Dec. 26 from the Northern Hemisphere. Skygazers usually see five to 10 meteors per hour during the height and there's a possibility for outbursts of up to 25 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society.",

      "A congressional report says China is exploiting partnerships with U.S. researchers to provide the Chinese military with access to sensitive nuclear technology and other innovations with economic and national security applications",
      "WASHINGTON -- China is exploiting partnerships with U.S. researchers funded by the Department of Energy to provide the Chinese military with access to sensitive nuclear technology and other innovations with economic and national security applications, according to a congressional report published Wednesday.",
      "The authors of the report say the U.S. must do more to protect high-tech research and ensure that the results of taxpayer-funded work don't end up benefiting Beijing. They recommended several changes to better protect scientific research in the U.S., including new policies for the Department of Energy to use when deciding whether to fund work that involves Chinese partnerships.",
      "The investigation is part of a congressional push to raise a firewall blocking U.S. research from boosting China's military buildup when the two countries are locked in a tech and arms rivalry that will shape the future global order.",
      "Investigators from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce identified more than 4,300 academic papers published between June 2023 and June of this year that involved collaborations between DOE-funded scientists and Chinese researchers. About half of the papers involved Chinese researchers affiliated with China's military or industrial base.",
      "Particularly concerning, investigators found that federal funds went to research collaborations with Chinese state-owned laboratories and universities that work directly for China\u2019s military, including some listed in a Pentagon database of Chinese military companies with operations in the U.S. The report also detailed collaborations between U.S. researchers and groups blamed for cyberattacks as well as human rights abuses in China.",
      "The Energy Department routinely funds advanced research into nuclear energy and the development and disposal of nuclear weaponry, along with a long list of other high-tech fields like quantum computing, materials science and physics. It doles out hundreds of millions of dollars each year for research. The department oversees 17 national laboratories that have led the development in many technologies.",
      "The report followed a number of congressional investigations into federally funded research involving Chinese scientists and researchers. Last year, a report released by Republicans found that partnerships between U.S. and Chinese universities over the past decade had allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to help Beijing develop critical technology that could help strengthen its military. Another investigation this year revealed that the Pentagon in a recent two-year period funded hundreds of projects in collaboration with Chinese entities linked to China's defense industry.",
      "The Energy Department has failed for decades to take steps to ensure the research it funds doesn't benefit China, the report's authors found. They made several recommendations to tighten the rules, including a new standardized approach to assessing the national security risks of research, as well as requirements that the department share information about research ties with China with other U.S. government agencies to make it easier to spot problems.",

      "Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the select committee, said in a statement that the \u201cinvestigation reveals a deeply alarming problem: The Department of Energy failed to ensure the security of its research and it put American taxpayers on the hook for funding the military rise of our nation\u2019s foremost adversary.\u201d",

      "The legislation cleared the House but failed to advance to become part of the annual sweeping defense policy bill. It was met with strong opposition from scientists and researchers, who argued that the measures were too broad and could chill collaboration and undermine America's competitive edge in science and technology.",
      "In an October letter, a group of more than 750 faculty members and senior staffers from American universities told congressional leaders overseeing the armed services that the U.S. is in a global competition for talent.

    "story": [
      "Myanmar\u2019s military leadership has vowed to crack down on cyberscam centers, starting with the notorious KK Park",
      "It looked like a turning point in the global fight against scams. Myanmar\u2019s military leadership, under growing international pressure, vowed to wipe out the industrial-scale cyberscam centers that have taken root in the country. They started by raiding and then bombing KK Park \u2014 a notorious compound that has become a symbol of impunity in the battle against one of the most lucrative criminal industries in the world.",
      "It\u2019s too early to say whether KK Park will be abandoned, repurposed or rebuilt over time. But even if KK Park were to close, it\u2019s just one of around 30 scam compounds along Myanmar\u2019s border with Thailand \u2014 one indication that the crackdown may not turn out to be as deep or long-lasting as Myanmar\u2019s military rulers would like it to appear.",
      "The Associated Press found that at least two scam compounds in the area continued to use Starlink to get online even after SpaceX announced it had cut off service. And there are other signs the scam industry is adapting fast: The physical damage to KK Park sent thousands of workers scattering to other scam companies in Myanmar and abroad, interviews with current and former scam center workers show. Telegram is popping with job ads for newly displaced workers. And work has continued uninterrupted at other scam centers in Myanmar, where people trafficked from around the world still wait to be rescued.",
      "\u201cEven if you destroy buildings, if you haven\u2019t arrested the heads of the transnational syndicates behind this, seized their wealth and put them in jail, it\u2019s not a real crackdown yet,\u201d said Jay Kritiya, the coordinator of the Civil Society Network for Human Trafficking Victim Assistance.",
      "Myanmar state media announced the raid on KK Park on Oct. 20, which was followed by a weekslong demolition campaign. In November, Myanmar\u2019s military rulers pledged to \u201ceradicate scam activities from their roots.\u201d State media broadcast images of wreckage and soldiers standing with dozens of seized Starlink terminals. They then went after Shwe Kokko, another notorious compound that\u2019s been in the crosshairs of U.S. authorities. SpaceX announced it cut off access to more than 2,500 Starlink units in Myanmar, where they have been widely used by scammers to get online. And Meta said this month it had taken down 2,000 Facebook accounts used by scammers in Myanmar.",
      "It looked as if growing American pressure on foreign scam centers through sanctions, prosecutions and a new, high-level Scam Center Strike Force, was having swift impact as Myanmar prepares for national elections, which have been widely criticized as a sham effort to legitimize the army\u2019s 2021 seizure of power.",
      "Myanmar has said the demolition at KK Park \u2014 and raids at additional scam sites \u2014 are meant to ensure that criminal activity never returns. This month the government created a high-level task force to enact what it calls a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy against scams. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar on Dec. 15 devoted five full pages to coverage of a press conference showcasing what it described as the government\u2019s aggressive efforts to stop fraud, and characterized cyberscams as the work of foreign criminal networks that have taken root in lawless borderlands controlled by insurgents.",
      "Government officials said that by Dec. 13, 413 buildings in KK Park had been \u201cdemolished\u201d and the remaining 222 would be cleared as well. Detailed visual analysis of the first wave of demolition, which the government says is complete, shows that 31 structures were flattened. At least 78 more were partially damaged, according to the Center for Information Resilience (CIR), a London-based nonprofit focused on exposing human rights violations.",
      "More than half the buildings were damaged by heavy machinery, which often left roofs, ceilings and layers between floors intact, said Guy Fusfus, an investigator at Myanmar Witness, a CIR project. \u201cThere may be an intention to reconstruct and reuse these buildings,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "New satellite imagery shows that most buildings in KK Park appeared wholly or partially intact on Dec. 4, even as demolition had spread to other sections of the compound. Once home to thousands of workers, many victims of human trafficking, the streets of KK Park appeared empty. Where all those people went \u2014 and what that portends for the future of a criminal industry the FBI says cost Americans more than $16 billion last year \u2014 remain open questions.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just breaking windows and moving on. You can\u2019t come in and restart operations here at the same scale as before,\u201d said Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the International Justice Mission, a Washington, D.C.-based NGO, who reviewed satellite images of the damage. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know if that activity is just going to be displaced to other locations.\u201d",
      "Myanmar\u2019s track record of lasting enforcement is poor. Raids in response to Chinese pressure earlier this year failed to contain the growth of scam compounds, according to C4ADS, a U.S.-based nonprofit that takes a data-driven approach to conflict analysis. Over 7,000 scam center workers were released as part of that purge, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, but the scams kept on running.",
      "C4ADS examined satellite imagery of 21 known scam compounds in Myawaddy Township and found that 14 of them \u2014 including KK Park \u2014 had shown construction or expansion since January. Some solar panels also appeared \u2014 a step toward energy independence that could blunt the impact of crackdowns from neighboring Thailand, which has occasionally cut off power.",
      "\u201cThis continued growth of scam compounds is emblematic of the junta\u2019s inability to rein in the industry within Myanmar,\u201d said Michael Di Girolamo, a C4ADS analyst focused on cybercrime.",
      "Analysts say that some of the same people who led the raid on KK Park have profited from scams over the years. KK Park, like most scam compounds along the Thai border, operates under the protection of the Karen Border Guard Force \u2014 also known as the Karen National Army \u2014 an armed militia made up of ethnic Karen people who live in eastern Myanmar that is affiliated with the Myanmar military, according to U.S. and European government sanctions notices.",
      "Jason Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, said the action at KK Park was a way for Myanmar\u2019s military leadership to relieve pressure, primarily from the U.S. and China, and continue to host highly lucrative criminal activity. \u201cThere\u2019s no real political will to crack down,\u201d he said.",
      "A month after KK Park was raided, another scam center fell, far from the glare of government propaganda. On Nov. 21, forces of the Karen National Union, a rebel group opposed to Myanmar\u2019s military leadership, stormed a scam compound called Shunda Park in an area controlled by a pro-government militia.",
      "\u201cThis looks much more like a real crackdown on crime,\u201d Tower said.",
      "While Myanmar state television broadcast images of a steamroller crushing rows of scammers\u2019 computers, the Karen National Union gathered 604 mobile phones, bank cards, computers and other evidence from Shunda and handed them over to Thai authorities for investigation.",

      "Authorities are searching for a suspect in the killing of Nuno F.G. Loureiro, a prominent physics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was shot at his home near Boston. Loureiro, a married 47-year-old from Portugal, was shot Monday night and died Tuesday at a local hospital.",
      "Authorities have not disclosed a possible motive, and no suspects were in custody as of Wednesday morning, the Norfolk District Attorney\u2019s Office said.",
      "The shooting in Brookline, Massachusetts, comes days after a deadly attack at another prestigious school in the region, Brown University, where police also haven't identified the suspect who killed two students and wounded nine others. The FBI said it knows of no connection between the two crimes.",
      "Loureiro joined MIT in 2016 and was named last year to lead the school\u2019s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, one of its largest laboratories. The center has around 250 researchers working across seven buildings and focuses on advancing clean energy technology and other research.",
      "The professor grew up in Viseu in central Portugal, studied in Lisbon and earned a doctorate in London, according to the university. Before moving to MIT, he worked at a nuclear fusion research institute in Lisbon.",
      "Loureiro studied the behavior of plasma and worked to explain the physics behind astronomical phenomena such as solar flares. His research, according to his obituary on MIT\u2019s news site, \u201cinvolved the design of fusion devices that could harness the energy of fusing plasmas, bringing the dream of clean, near-limitless fusion power closer to reality.\u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- California regulators are threatening to suspend Tesla's license to sell its electric cars in the state early next year unless the automaker tones down its marketing tactics for its self-driving features after a judge concluded the Elon Musk-led company has been misleading consumers about the technology's capabilities.",
      "The potential 30-day blackout of Tesla's California sales is the primary punishment being recommended to the state's Department of Motor Vehicles in a decision released late Tuesday. The ruling by Administrative Law Judge Juliet Cox determined that Tesla had for years engaged in deceptive marketing practices by using the terms \u201cAutopilot\u201d and \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d to promote the autonomous technology available in many of its cars.",
      "After presiding over five days of hearings held in Oakland, California in July, Cox also recommended suspending Tesla's license to manufacture cars at its plant in Fremont, California. But California regulators aren't going to impose that part of the judge's proposed penalty.",
      "Tesla will have a 90-day window to make changes that more clearly convey the limits of its self-driving technology to avoid having its California sales license suspended. After California regulators filed its action against Tesla in 2023, the Austin, Texas, company already made one significant change by putting in wording that made it clear its Full Self-Driving package still required supervision by a human driver while it's deployed.",
      "\u201cTesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue \u2014 steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve,\" said Steve Gordon, the director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles.",
      "Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.",
      "The automaker has already been plagued by a global downturn in demand that began during a backlash to Musk's high-profile role overseeing cuts in the U.S. government budget overseeing the Department of Government that President Donald Trump created in his administration. Increased competition and an older lineup of vehicles also weighed on Tesla sales, although the company did revamp its Model Y, the world\u2019s bestselling vehicle, and unveil less-expensive versions of the Model Y and Model X.",

      "Although Musk left Washington after a falling out with Trump, the fallout has continued to weigh on Tesla's auto sales, which had decreased by 9% from 2024 through the first nine months of this year.",
      "Despite the slump and the threatened sales suspension in California, Tesla's stock price touched an all-time high $495.28 during Wednesday's early trading before backtracking later to fall below $470. Despite that reversal, Tesla's shares are still worth slightly more than they were before Musk's ill-fated stint in the Trump administration \u2014 a \u201csomewhat successful\u201d assignment he recently said he wouldn't take on again.",
      "The performance of Tesla's stock against the backdrop of eroding auto sales reflects the increasing emphasis that investors are placing on Musk's efforts to develop artificial intelligence technology to implant into humanoid robots and a fleet of self-driving Teslas that will operate as robotaxis across the U.S.",
      "Musk has been promising Tesla's self-driving technology would fulfill his robotaxi vision for years without delivering on the promise, but the company finally began testing the concept in Austin earlier this year, albeit with a human supervisor in the car to take over if something went awry. Just a few days ago, Musk disclosed Tesla had started tests of its robotaxis without a safety monitor in the vehicle.",
      "California regulators are far from the first critic to accuse Tesla of exaggerating the capabilities of its self-driving technology in a potentially dangerous manner. The company has steadfastly insisted that information contained in its vehicle's owner's manual on its website have made it clear that its self-driving technology still requires human supervision, even while releasing a 2020 video depicting one of its cars purportedly driving on its own. The video, cited as evidence against Tesla in the decision recommending a suspension of the company's California sales license, remained on its website for nearly four years.",
      "Tesla has been targeted in a variety of lawsuits alleging its mischaracterizations about self-driving technology have lulled humans into a false of security that have resulted in lethal accidents. The company has settled or prevailed in several cases, but earlier this year a Miami jury held Tesla partly responsible for a lethal crash in Florida that occurred while Autopilot was deployed and ordered the automaker to pay more than $240 million in damages.",

      "India\u2019s Parliament has approved new legislation to open the civil nuclear power sector to private companies",
      "NEW DELHI -- India\u2019s Parliament approved new legislation Thursday that enables opening the tightly controlled civil nuclear power sector to private companies.",
      "The government termed it a major policy shift to speed up clean energy expansion while the opposition political parties argued that it dilutes safety and liability safeguards.",
      "The lower house of parliament passed the legislation Wednesday and the upper house on Thursday. It now needs the assent from the Indian president, which is a formality, to come into force.",
      "The move carries global significance as India seeks to position itself as a major player in the next wave of nuclear energy, including with small modular reactors at a time many nations are reassessing nuclear power to meet climate targets and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.",
      "Supporters argue the legislation marks a decisive break from decades of state dominance in nuclear energy while critics say it opens the door to risks, mainly health hazards, that could have long term consequences.",
      "\u201cIt marks a momentous milestone for India and signals capable private sector players that the country is open for business in the nuclear energy space,\u201d said Karthik Ganesan, director of strategic partnerships at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a think tank.",
      "Junior Minister Jitendra Singh, who oversees the department of atomic energy, told lawmakers that the bill \u2014 which has been dubbed Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India \u2014 seeks to modernize India\u2019s nuclear framework in line with technological, economic and energy realities. It also retains and strengthens core safety, security and regulatory safeguards.",
      "\u201cIndia\u2019s role in geopolitics is increasing. And if we have to be a global player effectively, we have to live up to global benchmarks, follow global parameters and adopt global strategies,\u201d Singh said in the lower house, adding that the legislation was necessary to address the country\u2019s growing energy needs.",
      "India wants more nuclear power and has pledged over $2 billion in recent months toward research and allied activities. Nuclear power is a way to make electricity that doesn\u2019t emit planet-warming gases, although it does create radioactive waste.",
      "India is one of the world\u2019s biggest emitters of planet-heating gases and over 75% of its power is still generated by burning fossil fuels, mostly coal. India wants to install 100 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2047 \u2014 enough to power nearly 60 million Indian homes a year.",
      "Energy experts say that for the world to move away from carbon-polluting fuels like coal, oil and gas, sources like nuclear that don\u2019t rely on the sun and the wind \u2014 which aren\u2019t always available \u2014 are needed. But some are skeptical about India\u2019s ambitions as the country\u2019s nuclear sector is still very small, and negative public perceptions about the industry remain.",

    "story": [
      "In an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, tiny corals born in a laboratory are slowly growing under the eye of conservationists",
      "BAYAHIBE, Dominican Republic -- Oxygen tank strapped to his back, Michael del Rosario moves his fins delicately as he glides along an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, proudly showing off the \u201ccoral babies\u201d growing on metal structures that look like large spiders. The conservationist enthusiastically points a finger to trace around the largest corals, just starting to reveal their vibrant colors.",
      "Del Rosario helped plant these tiny animals in the nursery after they were conceived in an assisted reproduction laboratory run by the marine conservation organization Fundemar. In a process something like in vitro fertilization, coral egg and sperm are joined to form a new individual.",
      "It's a technique that's gaining momentum in the Caribbean to counter the drastic loss of corals due to climate change, which is killing them by heating up oceans and making it more difficult for those that survive to reproduce naturally.",
      "\u201cWe live on an island. We depend entirely on coral reefs, and seeing them all disappear is really depressing,\u201d del Rosario said once back on the surface, his words flowing like bubbles underwater. \u201cBut seeing our coral babies growing, alive, in the sea gives us hope, which is what we were losing.\u201d",
      "The state of corals around the Dominican Republic, as in the rest of the world, is not encouraging. Fundemar\u2019s latest monitoring last year found that 70% of the Dominican Republic\u2019s reefs have less than 5% coral coverage. Healthy colonies are so far apart that the probability of one coral\u2019s eggs meeting another\u2019s sperm during the spawning season is decreasing.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why assisted reproduction programs are so important now, because what used to be normal in coral reefs is probably no longer possible for many species,\u201d biologist Andreina Valdez, operations manager at Fundemar, said at the organization\u2019s new marine research center. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we come in to help a little bit.\u201d",
      "Though many people may think corals are plants, they are animals. They spawn once a year, a few days after the full moon and at dusk, when they release millions of eggs and sperm in a spectacle that turns the sea around them into a kind of Milky Way. Fundemar monitors spawning periods, collects eggs and sperm, performs assisted fertilization in the laboratory, and cares for the larvae until they are strong enough to be taken to the reef.",
      "In the laboratory, Ariel \u00c1lvarez examines one of the star-shaped pieces on which the corals are growing through a microscope. They're so tiny they can hardly be seen with the naked eye. \u00c1lvarez switches off the lights, turns on an ultraviolet light, and the coral\u2019s rounded, fractal shapes appear through a camera on the microscope projected onto a screen.",
      "One research center room holds dozens of fish tanks, each with hundreds of tiny corals awaiting return to the reef. Del Rosario said the lab produces more than 2.5 million coral embryos per year. Only 1% will survive in the ocean, yet that figure is better than the rate with natural fertilization on these degraded reefs now, he said.",
      "In the past, Fundemar and other conservation organizations focused on asexual reproduction. That meant cutting a small piece of healthy coral and transplanting it to another location so that a new one would grow. The method can produce corals faster than assisted fertilization.",
      "The problem, Andreina Valdez said, is that it clones the same individual, meaning all those coral share the same disease vulnerabilities. In contrast, assisted sexual reproduction creates genetically different individuals, reducing the chance that a single illness could strike them all down.",
      "Australia pioneered assisted coral fertilization. It's expanding in the Caribbean, with leading projects at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the Carmabi Foundation in Cura\u00e7ao, and it's being adopted in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Jamaica, Valdez said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t conserve something if you don\u2019t have it. So (these programs) are helping to expand the population that\u2019s out there,\u201d said Mark Eakin, corresponding secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired chief of the Coral Reef Watch program of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "But the world must still tackle \u201cthe 800-pound gorilla of climate change,\u201d Eakin said, or a lot of the restoration work \u201cis just going to be wiped out.\u201d",
      "Burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal produces greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, driving up temperatures both on Earth\u2019s surface and in its seas. Oceans are warming at twice the rate of 20 years ago, according to UNESCO\u2019s most recent State of the Ocean Report last year.",
      "And that's devastating for corals. Rising heat causes them to feel sick and expel the algae that live in their tissue and provide them both their striking colors and their food. The process is known as bleaching because it exposes the coral's white skeleton. The corals may survive, but they are weakened and vulnerable to disease and death if temperatures don't drop.",

      "Del Rosario said there's still time to halt the decline of the reefs.",

    "summary": "The DOJ on Friday began publicly releasing what an official said would be \"several hundred thousand\" documents from its Epstein files.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department said the files would not be fully released Friday.",
      "Documents in the rolling release of the Justice Department's files on Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0have yet to\u00a0show evidence of\u00a0wrongdoing on the part of famous, powerful men, against the expectations of many of those who pushed for the files' release.",
      "The DOJ said the files, which included a trove of photographs and court records, would not be fully released on Friday, despite a law mandating doing so, due to the vetting process required to protect Epstein's victims.",
      "Democratic lawmakers pushed back on the partial nature of the release, which included minimal references to President Donald Trump. Critics of Trump have speculated about the degree to which the president, who had a friendship with Epstein until they had a falling out\u00a0around 2004, appears in the Epstein files, while Trump has accused several well-known Democrats of having ties to the disgraced financier.",
      "Democrat California Rep. Ro Khanna, a co-author of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, posted a video on X explaining why the DOJ release \"does not comply\" with the law.",
      "\"Our law requires them to explain redactions. There is not a single explanation,\" Khanna said.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, in an interview with ABC News on Friday, said there has been \"no effort\" to redact Trump's name from the release and that\u00a0every document that mentions Trump will be released in the coming weeks, \"assuming it's consistent with the law.\"",
      "First complaint to FBI was made years before probe",
      "Among the new pieces of information released Friday was a\u00a0complaint to the FBI about Epstein that was filed years before he was first investigated for child sex abuse.",
      "The document appears to be first known report to federal law enforcement that Epstein was involved in child sexual exploitation: a September 1996 complaint filed with the FBI's Miami office accusing Epstein of participating in \"child pornography,\" more than eight years before the first law enforcement investigation into Epstein was launched.",
      "The complainant, Maria Farmer, said that she was a professional artist and took pictures of her younger sisters, age 12 and 16, for personal use, and alleged that Epstein stole the photos and negatives, and that he may have \"sold the photos to potential buyers.\"",
      "The complaint says Epstein also requested that she \"take photos of young girls at swimming pools\" and that Epstein threatened her and said he would \"burn her house down\" if she told anyone about the photos.",
      "Farmer, whose name was redacted from the documents, confirmed to ABC News\u00a0Friday\u00a0that she was the complainant. In an interview in 2019, Farmer told ABC News that she had gone to the FBI in 1996 after first reporting Epstein's behavior to police in New York.\u00a0Earlier this year, Farmer filed a complaint against the federal government alleging that the FBI had failed to follow up on her complaint, with \"wide-ranging consequences.\" Until Friday, she had never seen the 2006 report that was released by the DOJ.",
      "Speaking to ABC News by phone following the materials' release, she said, \"I'm just really grateful. I'm finally able to be vindicated. I feel redeemed.\"",
      "\"And I'm slightly shocked that they've released anything. I didn't expect it,\" Farmer said.",
      "Brad Edwards, an attorney who has represented over 200 alleged victims of Epstein in civil litigation, had harsh words for the government's first disclosure from the Epstein files, contending that documents critical to understanding the government's handling of Epstein investigations were not yet produced.",
      "\"Where is Marie Villafa\u00f1a's prosecution memo and draft indictment?\" Edwards said in a message to ABC News late Friday.\u00a0 Villafa\u00f1a -- the federal prosecutor who led the investigation of Epstein for the U.S. attorney's office in Miami -- had prepared an 83-page memo and a 60-count draft indictment of Epstein in May of 2007, but it was never filed and never made public because her superiors opted to negotiate a deal with Epstein rather than pursue the indictment.\u00a0 Those documents prepared by Villafa\u00f1a -- which could shed light on the government's decisions to forgo prosecution -- was not found in Friday' disclosure by the DOJ, according to a review of the files by ABC News.",
      "\"There's no excuse that it has not been released,\" Edwards said.",
      "Edwards also said that when he saw that Farmer's 1996 FBI complaint was included in the disclosure, he was angered -- because so many years had gone by while Farmer, her attorneys and journalists relentlessly pursued the documentation to prove she had reported Epstein all those years ago.",
      "\"Every single person who has known about Maria Farmer's complaint and pretended like it did not exist or refused to provide it in response to FOIA requests, or made it seem like she was mistaken or had never reported it, should be investigated and punished. And, honestly, Maria should be compensated for the way the government has behaved toward her for this many years. The fact that she made that report does not even show up in the [Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility] report at all,\" Edwards said, referring to a 2020 internal DOJ investigation of the government's handling of Epstein investigations.",
      "\"It is mind blowing that this many changing-of-the-guard government actors would conceal a single document as powerful as Maria's complaint of child pornography against Epstein,\" Edwards said.",
      "Clinton camp pushes back",
      "The initial release of the files contained numerous photos of Epstein traveling with Bill Clinton, including pictures of Clinton lounging in a jacuzzi and one of him swimming with Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "The images were released without any context or background information and sparked a backlash from Clinton's camp.",
      "\"The White House hasn't been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday only to protect Bill Clinton,\" Clinton's spokesperson Angel Urena said Friday. \"They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton.\"",
      "\"Everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Flight logs from Epstein's private jets made public during civil litigation against Epstein showed that Clinton and his entourage had taken four international sojourns in 2002 and 2003 on Epstein's Boeing 727 to locations including Bangkok, Brunei, Rwanda, Russia, China and elsewhere.",
      "Maxwell, who's currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and grooming the underage girls whom Epstein sexually abused, was listed as a passenger on each of those trips, identified in the flight logs by the initials \"GM.\"",

Clinton's last known trip on Epstein's plane was in November 2003, according to the logs. The first reports that Epstein was under investigation in Florida for alleged sexual exploitation of minors surfaced in 2005.",
      "\"President Clinton knows nothing of about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to,\" Urena said in an earlier statement.",
      "Other new photos and redacted material released",
      "Friday's release includes thousands of newly released photos, some of which are graphic and heavily redacted with black boxes over faces and body parts. Notations on some redacted images indicate that they were not scanned due to their being child sexual abuse material.",
      "The release also appears to contain images from Epstein's 50th birthday party\u00a0in January 2003, many of which contain images of other people who are obscured by black boxes.",
      "Hundreds of photos taken during what appears to be a 2019 FBI search of Epstein's palatial townhouse in New York City show lavishly-appointed living quarters -- complete with chandeliers, multiple bedrooms, a home gym and a taxidermy tiger -- and a room where the central piece of furniture appears to be a massage table.",
      "Images depicting the exterior of the home show the metal initials \"J E\" mounted on the stone doorway. The outside wooden door has been damaged.",
      "On the walls of the massage table room are photos and paintings of nude women; on the shelves are bottles of lotion, Astroglide and other lubricant. A small side table holds a corded phone right next to the massage table.",
      "Other images show rows of framed photographs and photo albums on top of a large desk, as well as a drawer. Some of them show well-known figures, such as a previously released photo of Donald Trump, Melania Trump, Epstein and Maxwell, as well as one previously released of Epstein and Steve Bannon taking a selfie in the mirror, this time framed on a shelf. Others show women posing and smiling in bathing suits. Others, such as a photo of what appear to be two young females wearing matching outfits and with their arms around Epstein, have their faces blacked out.",
      "Images of opened closets in the home show an array of coats and robes. There are also some images that show opened drawers containing what appear to be sexual paraphernalia. Other images show additional items laid out, including condoms and several costumes that appear to resemble schoolgirl uniforms. One costume says \"Baby\" and \"Cry\" across two front pockets.",
      "Among the files are also hundreds of pages of thumbnail photographs, along with images of accompanying CD and DVD discs. \u00a0Some include labels of locations such as \"AFRICA SEPT.02\", \"ALHAMBRA SPAIN 03\" or events such as \"JE 50TH BD\" or \"LSJ XMAS 05\". \u00a0Many of the photos include Epstein and Maxwell both individually and together. \u00a0Entire pages of photos are blacked out.\u00a0There are also documents that say \"CSAM NOT SCANNED\" indicating that those images were withheld from disclosure by the DOJ because they contained potential child sex abuse material.",
      "Later Friday night, the DOJ released an additional batch of records containing images of various boxed-up items of evidence seized during the investigations of Epstein and Maxwell.\u00a0Among the images is one of several manilla folders and envelopes laid out -- one of which is labeled in black marker, \"Maxwell Security Footage.\" The context of what footage is contained in that evidence is unclear.",
      "Other images include numerous photos of hard drives, thumbnails, CDs and boxed-up materials.",
      "There is also an image of a green folding massage table wrapped in a sheer plastic cover, resembling the one that would later be set up in front of the jury during the Maxwell trial proceedings.",
      "In addition to newly released materials, the documents include many files that had previously been released, including documents from more than 50 civil and criminal cases involving Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "The release also includes the full, 354-page text of the 1999 edition of the book \"Massage for Dummies.\"",
      "The DOJ faced a Friday deadline for the release of all remaining Epstein files after Congress last month passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act\u00a0following the blowback\u00a0the administration received\u00a0seeking the release of the materials.",
      "Blanche, in his interview with ABC News, said that the release of the files will continue beyond the Friday deadline due to the department's obligations to the victims.",
      "\"The law is very specific that the Department of Justice is required to make sure that we protect victims,\" he said. \"And as recently as Wednesday, we learned of additional victim names, and so we've received over 1,200 names of victims and their family members since we started this process. And so there's an established precedent that in a situation like this where it's in essence impossible for us to comply with the law today, that we that we comply with the law consistent with the law.\"",
      "The Justice Department and FBI announced in July that they would be releasing no additional Epstein files, after several top officials -- including Patel and outgoing FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino -- had, prior to joining the administration, accused the government of shielding information regarding the Epstein case.",
      "The Senate subsequently voted to approved the Epstein transparency bill passed by the House, after which President Donald Trump signed it into law.",
      "Epstein owned two private islands in the Virgin Islands and large properties in New York City, New Mexico and Palm Beach, Florida, where he came under investigation for allegedly luring minor girls to his seaside home for massages that turned sexual. He served 13 months of an 18-month sentence for sex crimes charges after reaching a controversial non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. attorney's office in Miami.",
      "In 2019, prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York indicted Epstein on charges that he \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations,\" using cash payments to recruit a \"vast network of underage victims,\" some of whom were as young as 14 years old.",
      "Epstein died by suicide\u00a0in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial.",

      "In a dusty corral ringed by posts as thick as telephone polls, the orphan elephants of the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya are fed their lunch: goat's milk, which wildlife caretakers say is a suitable substitute to elephant's milk",
      "RETETI ELEPHANT SANCTUARY, Kenya -- We stood at the edge of a dusty corral baked by the equatorial sun and ringed by chest-high posts as thick as telephone poles. On some posts, workers had perched plastic jugs of goat's milk, each holding a couple of liters and equipped with red nipples the size of a man\u2019s finger.",
      "Across the corral, a young elephant ambled into view, head bobbing, trunk curling, ears flapping, trundling along as fast as its tree-trunk legs could carry it. Another followed, then a steady stream, bumping and jostling, kicking up orange dust \u2014 a joyful stampede of 2,000-pound toddlers.",
      "It was feeding time for the orphan elephants of Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya.",
      "The keepers tipped the jugs into the elephants\u2019 hungry mouths while sing-chanting a traditional lyric that praises them for being good eaters. Each jug was drained in seconds. Some elephants managed to wrap their trunk around a jug and gulp down lunch on their own.",
      "We were about halfway through a two-week trip through Kenya organized by a fledgling nonprofit that contributes a share of its revenue to local development in the country. The trek combined a traditional safari with chances to meet the Kenyan people who are working to preserve the wildlife. And, unexpected and most compelling, we saw how tourism and wildlife conservation are improving the lives of Indigenous people.",
      "Reteti, run by the Samburu tribe, rescues young elephants that villagers notice have become separated from their families. A threshold problem was how to feed the orphans; manufactured formula was costly and nutritionally unsuitable. The answer was in the omnipresent goat herds in rural Kenya. Goat's milk, it turned out, was a suitable substitute for elephant's milk, wildlife caretakers at Reteti said.",
      "More than 1,200 Samburu women sell nearly 700 liters (185 gallons) of milk from their goat herds to Reteti each day. Along with enabling them to buy better clothing and food, that gives them some financial independence from their husbands \u2014 a break from tradition.",
      "Reteti also employs about 100 Samburu people and says it is the only elephant sanctuary in Africa entirely run by Indigenous people.",
      "\u201cWe can say that elephants are the keystone of the entire economy,\u201d said Dorothy Lowakutuk, a Samburu woman and elephant keeper who has become a spokesperson for the sanctuary.",
      "Uplift Travel, which organized the safari, was founded with the intent to provide support to communities in Kenya, particularly with projects that help women and girls. Kim Schneider, a Michigan-based travel writer, created the group with a partner in philanthropy, Tanja Wittrock, after they discovered how a little money could have a huge impact on quality of life.",
      "\u201cI set out with a heart for travel and a heart for helping people, and this has married the two,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cSafari\u201d is Swahili for \u201cjourney,\u201d and almost all of the overland drives qualified. A trip of 100 miles (160 kilometers) could take most of the day, traversing two-lane highways clogged with slow-moving semitrailers or backroads whose gullies and piano-size potholes tested the brawny, seven-passenger Toyota Land Cruisers at every turn.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Defenders of a Wisconsin judge found guilty of felony obstruction for helping a Mexican immigrant evade federal officers raised alarms Friday about judicial independence and said they hope the conviction will be overturned on appeal.",
      "A jury found Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan guilty on Thursday night after a four-day trial and six hours of deliberation. The jury found her not guilty of a misdemeanor concealment charge. No sentencing date had been set as of Friday morning. She could be sentenced to a maximum five years in prison.",
      "The verdict was a victory for President Donald Trump, whose administration filed the charges against Dugan and touted her arrest earlier this year, posting photos of her being led away in handcuffs.",
      "U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche praised the verdict on X, saying nobody is above the law, even judges.",
      "The case inflamed tensions over Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, with his administration branding Dugan an activist judge and Democrats countering that the administration is trying to make an example of Dugan to blunt judicial opposition to the operation.",
      "U.S. Attorney Brad Schimel, a former Republican Wisconsin attorney general and judge, denied the case was political and urged people to accept the verdict peacefully.",
      "\u201cSome have sought to make this about a larger political battle,\u201d Schimel said. \u201cWhile this case is serious for all involved, it is ultimately about a single day, a single bad day, in a public courthouse. The defendant is certainly not evil. Nor is she a martyr for some greater cause.\u201d",
      "Dugan's defense attorney told the jury in closing arguments that the \u201ctop levels of government\u201d were involved in bringing charges against Dugan. But prosecutors argued Dugan put her personal beliefs above the law.",

      "The Department of Justice has published thousands of its files related to Jeffrey Epstein",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday published thousands of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a release long anticipated for its potential to reveal new details about the late sex offender and his connections to powerful people.",
      "But it was clear soon after the release that it would fall far short of those expectations. The partial release angered Democrats who accused the Trump administration of trying to hide information. The Justice Department said it would continue releasing documents in the weeks ahead.",
      "The file dump \u2014 dominated by photographs, but also including call logs, court records and other documents, many with redactions \u2014 comes after politicians and the public waged a massive campaign for transparency about the government's investigations into the wealthy financier.",
      "President Donald Trump, who was friends with Epstein for years before the two had a falling-out, tried for months to keep the records sealed. Though he hasn\u2019t been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, he has argued there is nothing to see in the files and the public should focus on other issues.",
      "On Nov. 19, relenting to political pressure from his fellow Republicans, he signed a bill mandating the release of most of the Justice Department\u2019s files on Epstein within 30 days. The White House said Friday\u2019s release of the files shows how the administration is the \u201cmost transparent in history.\u201d",
      "Here are some takeaways about the Justice Department's initial Epstein file release:",
      "The law signed by Trump last month set Friday as the deadline for the Justice Department to release most of its files about Epstein.",
      "Ahead of the release, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News he expected several hundred thousand files to be released Friday, along with several hundred thousand more to come later.",
      "But the number of files that actually landed on the Justice Department's website seemed to be a thin slice of the total number expected. Blanche acknowledged in a letter to Congress that the production of files was incomplete. The department said it expected to complete its production of Epstein documents by the end of the year.",
      "Among the documents made public are around 4,000 files \u2014 mostly photographs \u2014 under a subset the Justice Department described as \u201cDOJ Disclosures.\" The vast majority of the photographs were taken by the FBI during searches of Epstein\u2019s homes in New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
      "Also included were images of envelopes, folders and boxes containing investigative materials from various probes related to Epstein. Many records are redacted and anything containing a victim\u2019s personally identifiable information, including materials depicting sexual and physical abuse, isn\u2019t authorized for release.",
      "Various other files released by the Justice Department on Friday include court records, public records and disclosures to House committees. At least some of that material has already circulated in the public domain after years of court action and investigations.",
      "Many of the most discussed photos from the files show the former Democratic president. Clinton has acknowledged that he traveled on Epstein's private jet but said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier's crimes.",
      "Some of the photos show Clinton on a private plane, including one with a woman seated next to him with her arm around him. Her face is redacted from the photo.",
      "Another photo shows him in a pool with British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been convicted of luring young girls to Epstein so he could molest them, and with another person whose face is redacted. One shows him with the late pop star Michael Jackson, singer Diana Ross and a woman whose face is redacted.",

      "Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and the mere inclusion of someone\u2019s name or images in files from the investigation does not imply otherwise.",
      "To some exploring the records released Friday, the most interesting parts were which high-profile figures appeared scarcely \u2014 or not at all.",
      "For example, Trump is minimally referenced in the files, and the small number of photos that do show him appear to have been in the public domain for decades. The president made no reference to the initial records release during a rally Friday night in North Carolina.",

      "Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had introduced what is known as a discharge petition, which eventually led to the congressional vote that forced the release of the Epstein files. On Friday, both took to social media to criticize the partial release.",
      "Massie wrote that it \u201cgrossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.\u201d Khanna called the release so far \u201cdisappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're going to push for the actual documents,\u201d he said.",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said that by disregarding the deadline, the administration was denying justice to Epstein's victims. He added he was \u201cexploring all avenues and legal tools to get justice for the victims and transparency for the American people.\u201d",
      "If Democratic lawmakers so choose, they could go to court to force the Justice Department to comply with the law, but that would almost certainly be a lengthy process that plays out while the department releases more files.",
      "Separately, the House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena for the Epstein files. That could give Congress another avenue to force the release of more information to the committee, but it would require Republicans to join them in contempt-of-Congress proceedings against a Republican administration.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A Northern California city whose police department came under national scrutiny after it was revealed that some officers shared racist and sexist texts, used excessive force and falsified records has reached a settlement agreement to implement a series of reforms, officials announced Friday.",
      "The City of Antioch, in the San Francisco Bay Area, will enhance police training programs, establish an independent review board to handle complaints and implement a warning system to identify problem officers, according to an agreement that settles a civil rights lawsuit filed in 2023.",
      "\u201cThis agreement allows the Antioch Police Department to start with a clean slate and oversee officers' conduct and make sure they are compliant with new standards,\u201d said John Burris, who filed the complaint in federal court on behalf of residents who said they were targeted by Antioch police officers.",
      "Earlier this year, 23 people who were part of the lawsuit reached a $4.6 million settlement with Antioch for monetary damages, Burris said. The city in January announced it would hire a consultant to update its policies, procedures and training on various topics as part of an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "\u201cA lot of the bad apples are gone, in jail, retired or left on their own, and there is a new command staff that seems committed to bring about change,\u201d Burris said.",
      "Antioch City Manager Bessie Marie Scott said in a statement that the settlement agreement reinforces work already underway and \u201censures sustainable transparency measures and updates core policies to modernize how APD continues to provide constitutional policing services to the residents of Antioch.\"",
      "The Federal Bureau of Investigation and county prosecutors in March 2022 launched an investigation into police officers in Antioch and Pittsburg, a neighboring city, over a broad range of offenses. As part of the investigation, officials released racist and obscenity-laden text messages shared by 45 Antioch police officers that shocked the community.",

      "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said in a statement Wednesday that historians and conservators working on its behalf partnered with the tribe and the state to carefully remove and clean the 2,500-pound (1,134-kilogram) rock. The process involved saws, chisels and eventually soap and water to remove years of lichen growth from the petroglyphs.",
      "For Brad Parry, the tribe\u2019s vice chair, it was emotional seeing the rock returned to the rugged hillside to rejoin other petroglyph-covered rocks. He said it's a spiritual place where Shoshone ancestors would gather to camp and hunt.",

      "NEW YORK -- Luigi Mangione\u2019s lawyers contend that Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s decision to seek the death penalty against him in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was tainted by her prior work as a lobbyist at a firm that represented the insurer\u2019s parent company.",
      "Bondi was a partner at Ballard Partners before leading the Justice Department\u2019s charge to turn Mangione\u2019s federal prosecution into a capital case, creating a \u201cprofound conflict of interest\u201d that violated his due process rights, his lawyers wrote in a court filing late Friday. They want prosecutors barred from seeking the death penalty and some charges thrown out. A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "By involving herself in the death penalty decision and making public statements suggesting that Mangione deserves execution, Bondi broke a vow she made before taking office in February that she would follow ethical regulations and bow out of matters pertaining to Ballard clients for a year, Mangione\u2019s lawyers said.",
      "They argued Bondi has continued to profit from her work for Ballard \u2014 and, indirectly, from its work for UnitedHealth Group \u2014 through a profit-sharing arrangement with the lobbying firm and a defined contribution plan it administers.",
      "The \u201cvery person\u201d empowered to seek Mangione\u2019s death \"has a financial stake in the case she is prosecuting,\u201d his lawyers wrote. Her conflict of interest \u201cshould have caused her to recuse herself from making any decisions on this case,\u201d they added.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left for the Justice Department and Ballard Partners.",
      "Bondi announced in April that she was directing Manhattan federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty, declaring even before Mangione was formally indicted that capital punishment was warranted for a \u201cpremeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.\u201d",
      "Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4, 2024, as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for UnitedHealth Group\u2019s annual investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police say \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.",
      "Mangione, 27, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, was arrested five days later at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of Manhattan. He has pleaded not guilty to federal and state murder charges. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison. Neither trial has been scheduled.",
      "Friday\u2019s filing put the focus back on Mangione\u2019s federal case a day after a marathon pretrial hearing ended in his fight to bar prosecutors in his state case from using certain evidence found during his arrest, such as a gun that police said matched the one used to kill Thompson and a notebook in which he purportedly described his intent to \u201cwack\u201d a health insurance executive. A ruling isn't expected until May.",
      "Mangione\u2019s defense team, led by the husband-and-wife duo of Karen Friedman-Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo, zeroed in on Bondi\u2019s past lobbying work as they seek to convince U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett to rule out capital punishment, throw out some charges and exclude the same evidence they want suppressed from the state case.",

      "In a court filing last month, federal prosecutors argued that \u201cpretrial publicity, even when intense, is not itself a constitutional defect.\u201d",
      "Rather than dismissing the case outright or barring the government from seeking the death penalty, prosecutors argued, the defense\u2019s concerns can best be alleviated by carefully questioning prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case and ensuring Mangione\u2019s rights are respected at trial.",
      "\u201cWhat the defendant recasts as a constitutional crisis is merely a repackaging of arguments\u201d rejected in previous cases, prosecutors said. \u201cNone warrants dismissal of the indictment or categorical preclusion of a congressionally authorized punishment.\u201d",
      "Mangione\u2019s lawyers said they want to investigate Bondi\u2019s ties to Ballard and the firm\u2019s relationship with UnitedHealth Group and will ask for various materials, including details of Bondi\u2019s compensation from the firm, any direction she's given Justice Department employees regarding the case or UnitedHealthcare, and sworn testimony from \u201call individuals with personal knowledge of the relevant matters.\"",

      "A Northern California school district near the state's border with Nevada is caught up in a dispute over the states' differing policies on the participation of transgender athletes",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A Lake Tahoe school district is caught between California and Nevada's competing policies on transgender student athletes, a dispute that's poised to reorder where the district's students compete.",
      "High schools in California's Tahoe-Truckee Unified School District, set in a mountainous, snow-prone area near the border with Nevada, have for decades competed in the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association, or NIAA. That has allowed sports teams to avoid making frequent and potentially hazardous trips in poor winter weather to competitions farther to the west, district officials say.",
      "But the Nevada association voted in April to require students in sex-segregated sports programs to play on teams that align with their sex assigned at birth \u2014 a departure from a previous approach allowing individual schools to set their own standards. The move raised questions for how the Tahoe-Truckee district would remain in the Nevada association while following California law, which says students can play on teams consistent with their gender identity.",
      "Now, California's Department of Education is requiring the district to join the California Interscholastic Federation, or CIF, by the start of next school year.",
      "District Superintendent Kerstin Kramer said at a school board meeting this week the demand puts the district in a difficult position.",
      "\u201cNo matter which authority we\u2019re complying with we are leaving students behind,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we have been stuck.\u201d",
      "There are currently no known transgender student athletes competing in high school sports in Tahoe-Truckee Unified, district officials told the education department in a letter. But a former student filed a complaint with the state in June after the board decided to stick with Nevada athletics, Kramer said.",
      "The dispute comes amid a nationwide battle over the rights of transgender youth in which states have restricted transgender girls from participating on girls sports teams, barred gender-affirming surgeries for minors and required parents to be notified if a child changes their pronouns at school. At least 24 states have laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions. Some of the policies have been blocked in court.",
      "Meanwhile, California is fighting the Trump administration in court over transgender athlete policies. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in February aimed at banning transgender women and girls from participating in female athletics. The U.S. Justice Department also sued the California Department of Education in July, alleging its policy allowing transgender girls to compete on girls sports teams violates federal law.",
      "And Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has signedlaws aimed at protecting trans youth, shocked party allies in March when he raised questions on his podcast about the fairness of trans women and girls competing against other female athletes. His office did not comment on the Tahoe-Truckee Unified case, but said Newsom \u201crejects the right wing\u2019s cynical attempt to weaponize this debate as an excuse to vilify individual kids.\u201d",
      "The state education department said in a statement that all California districts must follow the law regardless of which state's athletic association they join.",

      "But Beth Curtis, a civil rights attorney whose children attended schools in Tahoe-Truckee Unified, said the district should fight NIAA from implementing its trans student athlete policy as violating the Nevada Constitution.",
      "The district has drafted a plan to transition to the California federation by the 2028-2029 school year after state officials ordered it to take action. It's awaiting the education department's response.",
      "Curtis doesn't think the state will allow the district to delay joining CIF, the California federation, another two years, noting the education department is vigorously defending its law against the Trump administration: \"They\u2019re not going to fight to uphold the law and say to you at the same time, \u2018Okay, you can ignore it for two years.\u2019\u201d",
      "Tahoe-Truckee Unified's two high schools with athletic programs, which are located about 6,000 feet (1,800 meters) in elevation, compete against both California and Nevada teams in nearby mountain towns \u2014 and others more distant and closer to sea level. If the district moves to the California federation, Tahoe-Truckee Unified teams may have to travel more often in bad weather across a risky mountain pass \u2014 about 7,000 feet (2,100 meters) in elevation above a lake \u2014 to reach schools farther from state lines.",
      "Coleville High School, a small California school in the Eastern Sierra near the Nevada border, has also long been a member of the Nevada association, said Heidi Torix, superintendent of the Eastern Sierra Unified School District. The school abides by California law regarding transgender athletes, Torix said.",
      "The school has not been similarly ordered by California to switch where it competes. The California Department of Education did not respond to requests for comment on whether it's warned any other districts not in the California federation about possible noncompliance with state policy.",
      "State Assemblymember Heather Hadwick, a Republican representing a large region of northern California bordering Nevada, said Tahoe-Truckee Unified shouldn't be forced to join the CIF.",
      "\u201cI urge California Department of Education and state officials to fully consider the real-world consequences of this decision\u2014not in theory, but on the ground\u2014where weather, geography, and safety matter,\u201d Hadwick said.",

      "The decision is a technical step in a long-running case, but it touches on the effects of a series of high-profile firings under President Donald Trump. The justices let stand a ruling that raised questions about the Trump administration's handling of the federal workforce, though they also signaled that lower courts should move cautiously.",

      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- More than a decade ago, a frenzied 5-day search for the Boston Marathon bombers left some lessons in its aftermath.",
      "One was that increasingly pervasive surveillance technology could help catch the culprits. Another was that amateur online sleuths on Reddit could not.",
      "But the intense search this week for a suspect in a Brown University shooting that killed two students and wounded nine other people turned the tables on those expectations.",
      "Sweeping surveillance, now found in doorbells, cars and a vast network of vehicle-tracking cameras, did eventually help track down the whereabouts of Claudio Neves Valente, the 48-year-old former Brown graduate student investigators believe was responsible for the Dec. 13 shooting and another killing two days later of an MIT professor in Brookline, Massachusetts.",
      "But the latest artificial intelligence-powered surveillance was of little use in the early search for a gunman who walked away from the Brown campus after the shooting and slipped unnoticed into the surrounding neighborhoods of Providence, Rhode Island. He evaded detection for days, using a hard-to-trace phone, avoiding facial recognition software by obscuring his face with a medical-type mask and switching the license plates on his rental cars.",

      "The Reddit tipster known only as John is \u201cno less than a hero,\u201d Providence Mayor Brett Smiley wrote Friday to FBI Director Kash Patel, asking for the entirety of the FBI's $50,000 award for information leading investigators to the suspect.",
      "Strangers have invited him to Christmas dinner and suggested he get a \u201ckey to the city and free coffee and doughnuts for life,\u201d according to fellow contributors to Reddit's Providence forum.",

      "Up until that point, the police affidavit says officials had not connected a vehicle to the possible shooter.",
      "That detail led them to get more video of a Nissan Sentra sedan with Florida plates and enabled Providence police officers to tap into a network of more than 70 street cameras operated around the city by surveillance company Flock Safety.",
      "The affidavit says John gave investigators additional critical details: he encountered Neves Valente in the bathroom of the engineering building just hours before the attack, where John noted the suspect's clothing was \u201cinappropriate and inadequate for the weather.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department faces a Friday deadline to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender and wealthy financier known for his connections to some of the world\u2019s most influential people, including Donald Trump, who as president had tried to keep the files sealed.",
      "The records could contain the most detailed look yet at nearly two decades worth of government investigations into Epstein\u2019s sexual abuse of young women and underage girls.",
      "Their release has long been demanded by a public hungry to learn whether any of Epstein\u2019s rich and powerful associates knew about \u2014 or participated in \u2014 the abuse. Epstein\u2019s accusers have also long sought answers about why federal authorities shut down their initial investigation into the allegations in 2008.",
      "Bowing to political pressure from fellow Republicans, Trump on Nov. 19 signed a bill giving the Justice Department 30 days to release most of its files and communications related to Epstein, including information about the investigation into Epstein's death in a federal jail.",

      "The law\u2019s passage was a remarkable display of bipartisanship that overcame months of opposition from Trump and Republican leadership.",
      "That law allows for redactions about the victims or ongoing investigations but makes clear no records shall be withheld or redacted due to \u201cembarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Nov. 14 that she had ordered a top federal prosecutor to investigate Epstein\u2019s ties to Trump\u2019s political foes, including former President Bill Clinton. Bondi acted after Trump pressed for such an inquiry, though he did not explain what supposed crimes he wanted the Justice Department to investigate. None of the men Trump mentioned in a social media post demanding the investigation has been accused of sexual misconduct by any of Epstein\u2019s victims.",
      "In July, Trump dismissed some of his own supporters as \u201cweaklings\u201d for falling for \u201cthe Jeffrey Epstein hoax.\u201d But both Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., failed to prevent the legislation from coming to a vote.",

      "Police in Palm Beach, Florida, began investigating Epstein in 2005 after the family of a 14-year-old girl reported she had been molested at his mansion. The FBI joined the investigation, and authorities gathered testimony from multiple underage girls who said they had been hired to give Epstein sexual massages.",
      "Ultimately, though, prosecutors gave Epstein a deal that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution. He pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges involving someone under age 18 and was sentenced to 18 months in jail.",
      "Epstein\u2019s accusers then spent years in civil litigation trying to get that plea deal set aside. One of those women, Virginia Giuffre, accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters, starting at age 17, with numerous other men, including billionaires, famous academics, U.S. politicians and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, then known as Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is weighing in on Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas peace efforts and defending the Trump administration\u2019s increasing military pressure on Venezuela during a rare, end-of-year news conference",
      "WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Marco Rubio weighed in on Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas peace efforts and defended the Trump administration\u2019s increasing military pressure on Venezuela during a rare, end-of-year news conference Friday.",
      "In a freewheeling, more than hourlong meeting with reporters, Rubio also defended President Donald Trump's radical overhaul in foreign assistance and detailed the administration's work to reach a humanitarian ceasefire in Sudan in time for the new year.",
      "Rubio\u2019s appearance in the State Department briefing room comes as key meetings on Gaza and Russia-Ukraine are set to be held in Miami on Friday and Saturday after a tumultuous year in U.S. foreign policy. Rubio has assumed the additional role of national security adviser and emerged as a staunch defender of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d priorities on issues ranging from visa restrictions to a shakeup of the State Department bureaucracy.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a senator, I represented the state of Florida,\u201d he said. Now, \u201cmy job is to implement the president\u2019s foreign policy \u2014 provide advice, provide counsel, provide ideas, provide for opportunities and ways in which his foreign policy can be implemented.\"",
      "The news conference is taking place just hours before Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff meets with senior officials from Egypt, Turkey and Qatar to discuss the next phase of the Republican president's Gaza ceasefire plan, progress on which has moved slowly since it was announced in October.",
      "Witkoff and other U.S. officials, including Trump son-in-law and informal adviser Jared Kushner, have been pushing to get the Gaza plan implemented by setting up a \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d that will oversee the territory after two years of war and create an international stabilization force that would police the area.",
      "On Saturday, Witkoff, Kushner and Rubio, who will be at his home in Florida for the holidays, are to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin's adviser Kirill Dmitriev in Miami to go over the latest iteration of a U.S.-proposed plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "\"There\u2019s no peace deal unless Ukraine agrees to it. But there\u2019s also no peace deal unless Russia agrees to it,\u201d Rubio said. \u2033So our job is not to force anything on anyone. It is to try to figure out if we can nudge both sides to a common place.\u201d",
      "The U.S. proposal has been through numerous versions with Trump seesawing back and forth between offering support and encouragement for Ukraine and then seemingly sympathizing with Putin's hard-line stances by pushing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to agree to territorial concessions. Kyiv has rejected that concession in return for security guarantees intended to protect Ukraine from future Russian incursions.",
      "On Venezuela, Rubio has been a leading proponent of military operations against suspected drug-running vessels that have been targeted by the Pentagon in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean since early September. The Trump administration's actions have ramped up pressure on leftist Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has been charged with narco-terrorism in the U.S.",
      "In an interview with NBC News on Friday, Trump would not rule out a war with Venezuela. But Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have publicly maintained that the current operations are directed at \u201cnarco-terrorists\u201d trying to smuggle deadly drugs into the United States. Maduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.",

      "\u201cWe have a regime that\u2019s illegitimate, that cooperates with Iran, that cooperates with Hezbollah, that cooperates with narco-trafficking and narco-terrorist organizations,\u201d Rubio said, \u201cincluding not just protecting their shipments and allowing them to operate with impunity, but also allows some of them to control territory.\u201d",
      "Rubio's news conference comes just two days after the Trump administration announced a massive $11 billion package of arms sales to Taiwan, a move that infuriated Beijing, which has vowed to retake the island by force if necessary.",
      "Trump has veered between conciliatory and aggressive messages to China since returning to the Oval Office in January, hitting Chinese imports with major tariffs but at the same time offering to ease commercial pressure on Beijing in conversations with China's President Xi Jinping. The Trump administration, though, has consistently decried China's increasingly aggressive posture toward Taiwan and its smaller neighbors in disputes over the South China Sea.",
      "Since taking over the State Department, Rubio has moved swiftly to implement Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, helping dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development and reducing the size of the diplomatic corps through a significant reorganization. Previous administrations have distributed billions of dollars in foreign assistance over the past five decades through USAID.",
      "Critics have said the decision to eliminate USAID and slash foreign aid spending has cost lives overseas, although Rubio and others have denied this, pointing to ongoing disaster relief operations in the Philippines, the Caribbean and elsewhere, along with new global health compacts being signed with countries that previously had programs run by USAID.",
      "\u201cWe have a limited amount of money that can be dedicated to foreign aid and humanitarian assistance,\" Rubio said. \u201cAnd that has to be applied in a way that furthers our national interest.\u201d",

      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee issued his pardon after friends and civic leaders of the Grammy-nominated musician joined in an outpouring of support.",
      "He has said a pardon would make it easier for him to travel internationally for concert tours and to perform Christian missionary work without requiring burdensome paperwork.",
      "He was one of 33 people to receive pardons Thursday from Lee, who for years has issued clemency decisions around the Christmas season. Lee said Jelly Roll's application underwent the same monthslong thorough review as other applicants. The state parole board gave a nonbinding, unanimous recommendation for Jelly Roll's pardon in April.",
      "\"His story is remarkable, and it's a redemptive, powerful story, which is what you look for and what you hope for,\" Lee told reporters, adding he hopes to meet Jelly Roll for the first time soon.",

      "He told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" he wrote hundreds of songs while in jail.",
      "Unlike recent high-profile federal pardons, which let people off the hook for prison, a pardon in Tennessee serves as a statement of forgiveness for someone who has already completed a prison sentence and been released. Pardons offer a path to get certain civil rights restored, such as the right to vote, although there are some limitations under state law, and the governor can specify the terms.",

      "In making his case to the parole board, Jelly Roll said he first fell in love with songwriting while in custody, stating it began as a therapeutic passion project that \"would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable.\"",
      "Beyond his sold-out shows, he's brought his story to the Senate, where he testified in January 2024 about the dangers of fentanyl, describing his drug-dealing younger self as \"the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about.\"",
      "\"I was a part of the problem,\" he told lawmakers at the time. \"I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Jelly Roll's most serious convictions include a robbery at age 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two armed accomplices steal $350 from people in a home in 2002. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were arrested right away. Jelly Roll was unarmed, and was sentenced to one year in prison plus probation.",
      "In another run-in 2008, police found marijuana and crack cocaine in his car, leading to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "Friends and civic leaders backed the pardon application, citing Jelly Roll's transformation.",
      "Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who runs Nashville's jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino cited Jelly Roll's donations from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks the state's five-year timeline for eligibility after his sentence expired. Prominent Nashville attorney David Raybin represents Jelly Roll in the pardon case.",
      "Lee's office said no one was pardoned Thursday who had a homicide or a sex-related conviction, or for any crime committed as an adult against a minor.",

    "story": [
      "Gloria Gaynor's\u00a0\"I Will Survive\" has been a motivational anthem for nearly five\u00a0decades \u2013 but it didn't just serve as inspiration for millions of fans. Gaynor told \"CBS Mornings\" the song gave her hope during one of the most difficult periods of her life.",
      "After a fall on stage in 1978 at New York's Beacon Theatre, Gaynor suffered a serious spinal injury and spent months in recovery. Many thought her career was over, but during that painful healing, she recorded what would become a smash hit, \"I Will Survive.\"",
      "\"I was living that song\"",
      "The song won a Grammy for best disco recording in 1980 \u2013 the only time that category existed. In 2016, it was inducted into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry for its cultural significance. Now, Gaynor is a 2025 Kennedy Center honoree for her lifetime artistic achievements.",
      "The track was supposed to be a B-side, but Gaynor immediately knew it was a winner. When she was recording it, standing in a back brace, she felt a deep connection to the music",
      "\"[I was] hoping I'd survive, you know, this trauma that I was going through, hoping that I survived the fact that my mother had just passed away a few years prior. Yeah, I was living that song and I was certain that I wouldn't be the only one,\" she said.",
      "The song became her anthem \u2013 and the world's \u2013 with over 200 covers in more than 20 different languages. And, of course, it sparked several trends on social media.",
      "Just a girl from Jersey",
      "Before becoming the \"queen of disco,\" Gaynor was just a girl from Newark, New Jersey. Her talent went unnoticed until a neighbor heard her sing and she was called up to the stage at a club one night to perform.",
      "She eventually worked the nightclub circuit. Her big break came from a meeting with legendary record executive Clive Davis, who helped propel her to the center of disco. Her 1975 debut album, \"Never Can Say Goodbye,\" was one of the first disco albums to top the charts, cracking the top 25 on the Billboard 200.",
      "Early in her career, Gaynor said she was singing R&B but decided she really wanted to give people music to dance to.",
      "\"I remember that discotheques were very, very new. There were just a couple and what they were was cabaret clubs where they'd just taken away the chairs,\" she recalled.",
      "Her profile continued to grow as she toured the world. As disco faded in the 1980s, Gaynor kept performing around the world. Years later, she found a new purpose through faith and gospel music. Her 2019 album, \"Testimony,\" earned her a Grammy, proving her voice still inspires.",
      "Lessons for new artists",
      "Now, nearly 50 years after her rise to fame, Gaynor is honored with one of the nation's highest distinctions: the Kennedy Center Honor.",
      "\"I got a phone call from my manager and I was ecstatic,\" said Gaynor as she learned about the award. \"It was incredible to even think about being accepted as one who deserved that.\"",
      "Gaynor is now parting her wisdom to new artists. Her top takeaway: Don't set out to seek rewards.",
      "\" I would say to them, be about doing the best you can with what God gave you,\" she said. \"All of that stuff is extra.\u00a0 I didn't strive to get a Grammy. I strive to do the best song I could do at that time.\u00a0 I strive to touch people's hearts. I strive to uplift, encourage, and power people And so, be about that.\"",

    "summary": "Sylvester Stallone reflects on his iconic roles as Rocky Balboa and John Rambo, his rough upbringing, and the legacy he hopes to leave in a touching \"CBS Mornings\" interview.",
    "story": [
      "Before he was two-time world heavyweight boxing champion Rocky Balboa, he was just little Sylvester \"Sly\" Stallone with the unusually deep voice.",
      "His voice and slurred speech were the result of an injury during childbirth that also caused facial drooping \u2014 a condition for which he was relentlessly bullied. And life at home wasn't much easier. When his parents divorced in 1957, when he was 11, he moved in with his father, who he says was emotionally and physically abusive.",
      "\"It's hard to navigate because you're going to catch it, especially when you're a bit rebellious like me. You're going to get a beating. After a while, you learn to just expect it,\" Stallone told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King during an interview inside his Florida home.",
      "He found solace in the silver screen.",
      "\"I worshipped escapism,\" explained Stallone, especially mythical heroes like Hercules.",
      "Stallone's \"Rocky\" road to success",
      "In his early 20s, he moved to New York City to pursue his dreams, teaching himself to write after struggling as a young actor. In 1975, he wrote a film that would change everything: \"Rocky.\"",
      "At the time, the studio didn't want Stallone to star in his own film, but he insisted. It was a gamble that paid off \u2014 \"Rocky\" went on to win three Academy Awards, including best picture. What should have been one of the happiest nights of his life was also one of the saddest.",
      "\"I mean, it's a volcanic moment, and then it was very sad,\" said Stallone, choking up.",
      "Stallone's parents didn't attend the Oscars as his guests when he was nominated for the award in 1977.",
      "\"You want people that you love that denied you, now you're here, you're at the Oscars, and they don't want to go,\" he continued. \"You realize that, at that moment, that you're never ever going to come to terms with this. And it's like, what more do you need? Really, what f\u2014ing more do you need to do to say, 'I'm here.'\"",
      "For Stallone, it was a valuable lesson.",
      "\"Parents should really wise up. Kids are the same as soft clay. They really are. You mold them, and you dent them, and you hurt them, or you drop them off the table, and they're not the same shape anymore,\" he said. \"I still walk around with it. And I wish I couldn't. And I pray, and I do everything, but it's always there.\"",
      "Stallone, who was recently named a 2025 Kennedy Center honoree, hopes his story can help inspire others to pursue their dreams against all odds.",
      "He told King about his hopes for his legacy: \"I really want to be a symbol for how an average person, really an average person, can overcome overwhelming odds.\"",
      "Stallone clarifies his cinematic origin story",
      "Though \"Rocky\" is frequently described as a sports drama, Stallone disagrees \u2014 and wants to set the record straight.",
      "\"The toughest thing about Rocky, and even to this day, I bristle when I hear it's a sports movie. It's not. It's a love story,\" he said. \"It starts with love.\"",
      "According to Stallone, the real triumph of \"Rocky\" is the evolving love between Rocky and Adrian, portrayed by Talia Shire. The film, he said, \"will rise and fall on love, not fights.\"",
      "From commercial highs to comeback hits",
      "Following the success of \"Rocky,\" Stallone co-wrote and starred in another blockbuster, \"Rambo.\" He played John Rambo, who he refers to as his alter ego.",
      "\"He's my father,\" he explained. \"100%. That's all I had to do was clone him, but the difference is Rambo is sad. Rambo is a disenfranchised child, he was a child of America. And America asked him to do a chore, he did the chore, and he was \u2013 it rejected him.\"",
      "After two hit franchises early in his career, he endured a series of box office flops.",
      "\"It was more than a drought. It was about eight years of spiderwebs on the phone,\" he recalled, admitting he was \"crumbling\" at the time.",
      "Everything changed when Rocky Balboa made a comeback in 2006. And then the work kept on coming. He's currently filming Season 4 of his hit Paramount+ show \"Tulsa King.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner, the son of a comedy giant who became one himself with movies such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026\" and \"This is Spinal Tap,\" is being remembered for his iconic contributions to entertainment following the shocking news of his death.",
      "Reiner, 78, and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead Sunday at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, in what police called an \"apparent homicide.\" Their son Nick Reiner was arrested on murder charges.",
      "\"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time,\" their family said in a statement obtained by Variety and other outlets.",
      "Robert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947. As a young man, he set out to follow in his father's footsteps into entertainment. He studied at the University of California, Los Angeles film school and, in the 1960s, began appearing in small parts in various television shows.",
      "Reiner grew up thinking his father, Carl Reiner, didn't understand him or find him funny. But the younger Reiner would in many ways emulate his career, working both in front of and behind the camera.",
      "\"My father thought, 'Oh, my God, this poor kid is worried about being in the shadow of a famous father,'\" Reiner told \u00a0\"60 Minutes\"\u00a0earlier this year, recalling the temptation to change his name. \"And he says, 'What do you want to change your name to?' And I said, 'Carl.' I just wanted to be like him.\"",
      "He added, \"Norman Lear was the first person that got me. I mean, I was playing jacks with his daughter. Norman says to my dad, 'You know, this kid is really funny.' And I think my dad said, 'What? That kid?' That kid? He's ... sullen, he sits quiet. He doesn't-- you know, he's not funny.'\"",
      "After starting out as a writer for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" Reiner's breakthrough came when he was, at age 23, cast by producer and family friend Norman Lear in \"All in the Family\" as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic. Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that he thought the show would only last 13 weeks \u2014 but it went on to air for eight years, five of them as the top show in the country.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant,\" he told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2010. \"There's no way that this is going to fly on American television.\"",
      "Reiner was five times nominated for an Emmy for his performance on the show, winning in 1974 and 1978. In Lear, Reiner also found a mentor. He called him \"a second father.\"",
      "Lear, who\u00a0died in 2023 at age 101, reciprocated the feeling. The Lear family said in a statement Sunday night that he \"often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary.\"",
      "It was during the end of Reiner's stint on the show that he came up with the idea for his first film: the largely improvised 1984 cult classic \"This is Spinal Tap,\" which lovingly spoofed a fictional British rock band. The sequel, \"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,\" was released this fall.",
      "\"Well, people would say, 'I can't believe your first movie would be improvised, there'd be no script. And that's scary.' And, to me, it was the opposite. I wasn't scared,\" he told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The film kicked off a four-year stretch that resulted in a trio of American classics \u2014 \"Stand By Me\" (1986), \"The Princess Bride\" (1987) and \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\" (1989)\u00a0 \u2014 all of them among the most often quoted movies of the 20th century.",
      "Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that \"Stand by Me,\" his 1986 film adaptation of the Stephen King novella \"The Body,\" was in many ways based on his relationship with his father.",
      "\"I'm writing this scene, I'm crying. I actually cry. When I was making it I knew that he loved me and he did understand me, but as a little boy that's what I felt,\" he said.",
      "The movie, about four boys who go looking for the dead body of a missing boy, became a coming-of-age classic, making breakthroughs of its young cast, particularly River Phoenix. One of those co-stars, Jerry O'Connell, spoke to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday and described the news as \"just surreal.\"",
      "\"Rob was like a father to me,\" O'Connell said. \"Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner. Everything I have.\"",
      "With his stock rising, Reiner devoted himself to adapting William Goldman's \"The Princess Bride,\" a 1973 book Reiner had loved since his father gave him a copy as a gift. Everyone from Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut to Robert Redford had considered adapting Goldman's book, but it ultimately fell to Reiner (from Goldman's own script) to capture the unique comic tone of \"The Princess Bride.\" But only once he had Goldman's blessing.",
      "\"At the door he greeted me and he said, 'This is my baby. I want this on my tombstone. This is my favorite thing I've ever written in my life. What are you going to do with it?'\" Reiner recalled in a Television Academy interview. \"And we sat down with him and started going through what I thought should be done with the film.\"",
      "Though only a modest success in theaters, the movie \u2014 starring Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Robin Wright \u2014 would grow in stature over the years, leading to countless impressions of Inigo Montoya's vow of revenge and the risky nature of land wars in Asia.",
      "For the next four decades, Reiner, a warm and gregarious presence on screen and an outspoken liberal advocate off it, remained a constant fixture in Hollywood. The production company he co-founded, Castle Rock Entertainment, launched an enviable string of hits, including \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" By the turn of the century, its success rate had fallen considerably, but Reiner revived it earlier this decade. This fall, Reiner and Castle Rock released the long-in-coming sequel\u00a0\"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.\"",
      "\"What are we, crazy to do another one? It's crazy,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" about the sequel. \"The bar is just way too high.\"",
      "All the while, Reiner was one of the film industry's most passionate Democrat activists, regularly hosting fundraisers and campaigning for liberal issues. He was co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which challenged in court California's ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. He also chaired the campaign for Prop 10, a California initiative to fund early childhood development services with a tax on tobacco products. Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump.",
      "That ran in the family, too. Reiner's father opposed the Communist hunt of McCarthyism in the 1950s and his mother, Estelle Reiner, a singer and actor, protested the Vietnam War.",
      "\"If you're a nepo baby, doors will open,\" Reiner told The Guardian in 2024. \"But you have to deliver. If you don't deliver, the door will close just as fast as it opened.\"",
      "Reiner was married to Penny Marshall, the actor and filmmaker, for 10 years beginning in 1971. Like Reiner, Marshall experienced sitcom fame with \"Laverne & Shirley,\" but found a more lasting legacy behind the camera. Marshall\u00a0died in 2018.",
      "After their divorce, Reiner, at a lunch with Nora Ephron, suggested a comedy about dating. In writing what became \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\", Ephron and Reiner charted a relationship between a man and a woman \u2014 memorably played in the film by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan \u2014 over the course of 12 years.",
      "Along the way, the movie's ending changed, as did some of the film's indelible moments. The famous line, \"I'll have what she's having,\" said after witnessing Ryan's fake orgasm at Katz's Delicatessen, was a suggestion by Crystal \u2014 delivered by none other than Reiner's mother, Estelle.",
      "\"I'm pounding the table, 'Yes! Yes! Yes!' And I'm realizing I'm having an orgasm in front of my mother, you know? There's my mother over there,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The movie's happy ending also had some real-life basis. Reiner said he changed it after meeting Singer, a photographer, on the set of the film. They married In 1989, and had three children together: Nick, Jake and Romy.",
      "Reiner's subsequent films included another King adaptation, \"Misery\" (1990) and a pair of Aaron Sorkin-penned dramas: the military courtroom tale \"A Few Good Men\" (1992) and 1995's \"The American President.\"",
      "By the late '90s, Reiner's films (1996's \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" 2007's \"The Bucket List\") no longer had the same success rate. But he remained a frequent actor, often memorably enlivening films like \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993) and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013). In 2023, he directed the documentary \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.\"",
      "In the interview with \"60 Minutes\" this year, Reiner said he never had any idea if his films would work.",
      "\"If I like it, then I say, 'Well, at least I like it,'\" Reiner said. \"Hopefully somebody else is gonna like it.\"",

      "Stephen King said he was \"horrified and saddened\" by the news of the Reiners' deaths in a post shared on X. Reiner's coming-of-age drama \"Stand by Me\" was based on King's novella \"The Body,\" and he also went on to direct the 1990 screen adaptation of the author's thriller \"Misery,\" both of which won acclaim.",

    "story": [
      "Anthony Geary, who rose to fame in the 1970s and '80s as half the daytime TV super couple Luke and Laura on \"General Hospital,\" has died. He was 78.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Anthony Geary, whose portrayal of Luke Spencer helped define General Hospital and daytime television,\" ABC said in a statement confirming his death.",
      "Geary died Sunday in Amsterdam of complications from a surgical procedure three days prior.",
      "\"The entire 'General Hospital' family is heartbroken over the news of Tony Geary's passing,\" Frank Valentini, executive producer of the ABC show, said in a statement Monday. \"Tony was a brilliant actor and set the bar that we continue to strive for.\"",
      "In a career spanning more than 40 years, Geary earned eight Daytime Emmy awards as Luke Spencer after joining the soap in 1978. Luke's pairing with Genie Francis' Laura Webber Baldwin (as she was known at the time) propelled the two onto magazine covers and into the cultural mainstream.",
      "The 1981 wedding of Luke and Laura was a pop culture phenomenon done in two parts, drawing guest appearances that included Elizabeth Taylor. A record 30 million viewers watched.",
      "\"He was a powerhouse as an actor. Shoulder to shoulder with the greats. No star burned brighter than Tony Geary. He was one of a kind. As an artist, he was filled with a passion for the truth, no matter how blunt, or even a little rude it might be, but always hilariously funny,\" Francis said in a statement.",
      "In addition to his role as Luke, Geary had numerous TV and stage credits, including stints on other soaps: \"The Young and the Restless\" and \"Bright Promise.\" Geary played Luke on and off until 2015, though he returned for a cameo in 2017.",
      "He lived a quiet life with husband Claudio Gama in Amsterdam.",
      "In a 1993 interview, Geary spoke of the many highs and lows of playing Luke.",
      "\"I felt like I had to be Luke 24 hours a day or people would be disappointed,\" he said at the time. \"As far as I'm concerned, they are mythic creatures. They come from two sides of the universe together and have a mutual connection, which is basically lust and appreciation for individuality. They love the eccentricity in each other.\"",
      "Geary's Luke began as a small-time hitman recruited to dismantle the relationship of Laura and her first husband, Scotty Baldwin. Their story arc turned darker when Luke sexually assaulted Laura. The assault led to a redemption trail for Luke, who evolved into a hero and even served as mayor of the show's small town, Port Charles.",
      "\"He was not created to be a heroic character,\" Geary told ABC's \"Nightline\" in 2015. \"He was created to be an anti-hero, and I have treasured the anti-side of the hero and pushed it for a long time. ... He's not a white hat or a black hat, he's all shades of grey. And that has been the saving grace of playing him all these years.\"",
      "Geary was born to Mormon parents in Coalville, Utah. He was discovered while attending the University of Utah and performing on stage. He joined a touring company of \"The Subject Was Roses,\" which brought him to Los Angeles.",
      "Over the years, he appeared frequently in stage productions alongside his screen work.",
      "Geary's first appearance on TV was as Tom Whalom on an episode of \"Room 222.\" He went on to appear in \"All in the Family,\" \"The Partridge Family,\" \"The Mod Squad,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"The Streets of San Francisco\" and \"Barnaby Jones.\"",

      "Rob Reiner was known for decades as a Hollywood luminary, finding early success as a sitcom star before going on to become one of the most prominent directors in the industry.

      "Pelosi's post highlighted Reiner's deep history of activism in California, referencing his efforts to help secure marriage equality and a program supporting early childhood development in the state.",
      "\"Personally, Rob cared deeply about people and demonstrated that in his civic activities \u2014 whether by supporting the First 5 initiative or fighting against Prop 8 in California,\" Pelosi wrote, adding that he was also \"a champion for the First Amendment and the creative rights of artists.\"",
      "Reiner led the campaign to pass California's First 5 initiative in 1998. Also known as the California Children and Families Initiative, it's \"dedicated to improving the lives of California's young children and their families through a comprehensive system of education, health services, childcare, and other crucial programs,\" according to its mission statement. Funding for the initiative comes from a statewide tax on tobacco. Reiner chaired the organization from 1999 to 2006.",
      "Later, Reiner joined the board of directors at the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a nonprofit organization that brought a crucial federal court challenge against Proposition 8, California's now-defunct 2008 ban on same-sex marriage. He and his wife were among the organization's founding board members, and Michele Reiner went on to serve as its treasurer. They were driving forces in its successful effort to pursue legal protection for marriage equality in California and several other states, before the Supreme Court finally upheld it nationwide.",
      "Reiner was also an environmental advocate. He founded an environmental campaign in the early 2000s to protect California's Ahmanson Ranch as a state park and wildlife preserve, and prevent it from becoming a site for real estate development, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "Reiner lent his support to the campaigns of numerous Democratic candidates, including Al Gore during the 2000 presidential election and Hillary Clinton's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton\u00a0said\u00a0in a post on X that Rob and Michele Reiner \"inspired and uplifted millions through their work on film and television. And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defense of inclusive democracy, setting an example for us all to follow. Hillary and I will always be grateful for their friendship, unfailing kindness, and support.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden praised the Reiners' \"extraordinary contributions\" and wrote, \"We take solace in knowing their work will live on for generations to come.\"",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom both shared their appreciation of Reiner's political achievements in their state. Newsom described Reiner as a \"big-hearted genius\" with \"boundless empathy,\" who \"made California a better place through his good works.\" Bass called Reiner's death \"is a devastating loss\" for Los Angeles and the nation.",
      "\"Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,\" Bass wrote, adding that, as an activist, \"he always used his gifts in service of others.\"",
      "Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump, which drew the ire of the president. In social media posts and comments at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump accused Reiner of \"Trump derangement syndrome\" and said, \"I wasn't a fan of his at all.\" The president's comments were condemned by a number of Republicans as well as Democrats.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "He was the son of comedy royalty, but as he was growing up, Rob Reiner (March 6, 1947-Dec. 14, 2025) thought it was normal to be in a house with so much laughter, surrounded by some of the 20th century's greatest comic minds, from Mel Brooks and Woody Allen to Neil Simon: \"I was aware how funny things were, but I didn't think there was anything unusual about it,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2010, \"until I went over to my friend Paul Schindler's house, where I realized things weren't as funny over there. They were a little funnier at my house.\"",
      "His father, Carl, was a second banana to Sid Caesar, straight man to Brooks' \"2,000-Year-Old Man,\" and director of such films as \"The Jerk\" and \"All of Me.\" Rob continued in the family tradition, writing for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" before being cast in one of the most influential sitcoms ever, Norman Lear's \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Reiner starred as Michael Stivic, the outspoken liberal son-in-law of the bigoted conservative Archie Bunker, who bestowed upon him a memorable nickname: Meathead.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant. There's no way that this is going to fly on American television,\" Reiner said. Actually, it went stratospheric, becoming the top-rated comedy and winning 22 Emmys (including two for Reiner) during its nine seasons.",
      "When the show ended its run, Reiner turned to directing, with \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a \"mockumentary\" about England's loudest rock band. He followed with the romantic comedy \"The Sure Thing,\" the coming-of-age story \"Stand by Me\" (a Stephen King adaptation), and the fairy tale-like \"The Princess Bride.\"",
      "In 1989's \"When Harry Met Sally,\" Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan play friends who eventually realize they are right for each other \u2014 but not until after Ryan's Sally demonstrates, in a restaurant, how to fake an orgasm. In a cameo, Reiner's mom, Estelle, gave the scene its peerless punchline: \"I'll have what she's having.\"",
      "\"I basically tell the same love story over and over,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"Essentially what it is, the girl in the story is always much more emotionally mature. The boy is always running around like an idiot trying to catch up, trying to figure out what's going on. \u2026 I mean, that's my story. I mean, basically, you know, my wife made me a person.\"",
      "He directed Kathy Bates to a best actress Oscar in \"Misery,\" and earned a best picture nomination for \"A Few Good Men.\" His other films included \"The American President,\" \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" \"Rumor Has It\u2026,\" \"The Bucket List,\" \"And So It Goes,\" \"LBJ,\" and \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life,\" a documentary about comedian and childhood friend Albert Brooks.",
      "Meanwhile, his production company, Castle Rock, was behind such films and TV programs as \"City Slickers,\" \"Honeymoon in Vegas,\" \"Mr. Saturday Night,\" \"In the Line of Fire,\" \"Malice,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Dolores Claiborne,\" \"Before Sunrise,\" \"Lone Star,\" \"Waiting for Guffman,\" \"The Green Mile,\" \"Michael Clayton,\" and \"Seinfeld.\"",
      "\"I make movies about people that live on Earth,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \u00a0\"Nobody gets exploded, nobody is running around chasing anything. Basically, they're people in rooms talking.\"",
      "An activist and vocal proponent for progressive causes, Reiner supported early childhood education and legalizing same-sex marriage, and raised funds for Democratic candidates.",
      "But he may be best remembered as \"Meathead.\" \"On almost a daily basis somebody will call me that,\" he said. \"I love that, because \u2014 you know, I've such a great experience with the show. I'm so proud of it and I have often said no matter what I do in life, I could win the Nobel Prize, the headline would read, 'Meathead wins the Nobel.'\""

      "Netflix leaders doubled down Monday on their intention to acquire part of Warner Bros. Discovery, while also looking to alleviate concerns in Hollywood about the blockbuster deal's potential impact on the movie business.",
      "In a regulatory filing, Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos pledged that the streaming giant would continue to release movies to theaters.",
      "\"We haven't prioritized theatrical in the past because that wasn't our business at Netflix,\" the pair said in a letter addressed to Netflix employees, highlighting the company's strategic pivot. \"When this deal closes, we will be in that business.\"",
      "\"We're strengthening one of Hollywood's most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production,\" they added.",
      "Peters and Sarandos also expressed optimism that Netflix's proposed $83 billion purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV and film assets will win government regulatory approval. Warner is home to the storied movie studio that created hits like \"Barbie\" and popular franchises such as \"The Hobbit\" and \"Harry Potter.\"",
      "The letter comes as Netflix faces a competing bid from Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News), which on December 8 launched a hostile bid to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery for roughly $108 billion. Unlike Netflix, Paramount is also offering to buy Warner's cable brands, which include CNN, Discovery Channel, HBO, TBS and TNT.",
      "Netflix declined further comment.",
      "The company's offer has drawn criticism from lawmakers including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, who said in a statement earlier this month that a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal would \"create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market.\"",

    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are bracing for higher health costs in 2026, as subsidies that help them pay for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire on December 31.",
      "Experts warn\u00a0that a failure in Congress to extend the tax credits could be financially devastating for individual policyholders, while also raising health care costs as a whole. Roughly 22 million Americans receive the ACA subsidies, which were created in 2021 to lower households' monthly premiums.",
      "New\u00a0data from investment adviser SmartAsset projects how much people around the U.S. with an ACA plan would have paid on average for coverage in 2025 if they hadn't received the enhanced subsidies. As the analysis shows, monthly premiums for the government health insurance would've been hundreds of dollars higher.",
      "In Mississippi, where around 11% of residents are enrolled in an ACA plan, participants would have seen their average monthly premiums jump from $41 to $605, a 1,376% increase, SmartAsset found. In West Virginia, enrollees' premiums would have risen an average of 1,058%.",
      "A spokesperson for SmartAsset said the analysis captures 2025 costs, but noted the data amounts to a \"close approximation\" of how much more people with ACA coverage could expect to pay next year without the tax credits.",
      "SmartAsset used public records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' 2025 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period to calculate the average cost of ACA plans.",
      "The exact price hikes people could see next will depend on a range of factors, including their insurance plan, age, household income, health status and where they live, according to a spokesperson from KFF. The health policy group estimates that annual out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for the 22 million ACA enrollees who rely on the subsidies.",
      "What is the status of the ACA tax credits?",
      "The tax credits are set to lapse at the end of the year. Democratic lawmakers have pushed for an extension\u00a0but lack enough support in the Republican-led Congress. And while the House passed a health care bill this week that includes several policies favored by Republicans, it excludes an extension of the tax credits and faces hurdles in the Senate.",
      "Both chambers of Congress have left Washington until early next year, making it all but certain that the tax credits will expire on December 31. But four GOP members this week signed a Democratic measure to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years, teeing up a final vote early next year.",
      "If Congress fails to solve the tax credit issue, some enrollees will qualify for a smaller subsidy, while others could lose eligibility completely, according to KFF.",
      "With sharply higher ACA costs on the horizon, the Congressional Budget Office estimates\u00a0that about 4 million people could drop their health insurance altogether. Experts say that could lead to higher costs for people with other types of health insurance because hospitals will have\u00a0to provide more uncompensated care for those lacking coverage.",
      "\"Hospitals can only reconcile that by raising their prices for everybody,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News last week.",

      "People who understand AI and, equally important, who are adept at explaining how it works in simple terms, will find themselves in demand, Seamans predicted.

      "President Trump on Friday announced new agreements with nine pharmaceutical manufacturers aimed at reducing certain prescription drug prices.",
      "\"Starting next year, American drug prices will come down fast and furious and will soon be the lowest in the developed world,\" Mr.\u00a0 Trump said Friday at the White House.",
      "Under the deal, the nine manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts, a policy that requires the prices to match those paid by patients in other developed nations. The nine companies will also offer medicines \"at a deep discount off the list price\" to Americans through TrumpRx, according to the White House. The Trump administration plans to offer tariff exemptions to the drugmakers for three years in exchange for the MFN pricing commitments.",
      "According to a White House fact sheet, the drugs that will be covered include treatments for chronic conditions, including type two diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus and certain cancers.",
      "Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Genentech, Gilead Science, GSK, Merck, Novartis, and Sanofi will sell drugs on TrumpRx, the administration's discount drug pricing program. TrumpRx \u2014 which the administration has said will launch early next year \u2014 will not sell drugs directly, but instead will direct consumers to lower prices elsewhere.",
      "Senior administration officials said that roughly 30-40% of Medicaid drug prices are currently higher than what patients in other wealthy nations pay, mostly Europeans, and that the prices of those drugs will drop.",
      "The president has previously announced agreements with AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer. The White House said it has made MFN deals with 14 of the 17 biggest drug manufacturers in the world. The three drugmakers that were not part of the announcement are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron, but the president said that deals involving the remaining three could be announced at another time.",
      "\"[The policy] affects every American so that they have the dignity to access the same medical innovations that our tax dollars helped develop,\" a White House official said. \"This is about healthcare fairness.\"",
      "But questions remain about how the president's deals with drugmakers will work \u2014 and who will feel the difference at the pharmacy counter. Most-favored-nation pricing could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, experts say, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "Medicaid recipients are \"starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out to CBS News after the president announced the Pfizer deal.",
      "The White House said the new agreement represents more than $150 billion in new investment commitments in manufacturing and research and development in the U.S.",
      "In addition to the drugmakers' commitment to MFN and TrumpRx, several drugmakers' will be donating active pharmaceutical ingredients to the Strategic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve, an initiative designed to stockpile critical raw materials and drug components in order to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign drug manufacturing during disruptions like pandemics.",
      "\"This is the president's answer to pharmaceutical vulnerability, such that when the disaster strikes, whether it's natural catastrophe, pandemic or a national security emergency, America will be ready,\" a senior administration official said.",
      "Officials said the administration expects to see \"major reductions in Medicaid prices\" as it aims to match the prices of several Medicaid drugs with MFN levels.",
      "\"Medicaid has prices that are much higher than what other European nations pay,\" a senior administration official said. \"Americans should not pay more than other developed nations.\"",
      "But injectable drugs and infusion medications will not be available on TrumpRx because the White House has concluded these drugs must be administered by health care providers and should not be on a direct-to-consumer platform.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:13:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Economists had expected CPI to rise at an annual rate of 3% last month.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.7% in November, cooler than economists had forecast and a sign that price pressures may be easing.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 3% on an annual basis last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. In the most recent inflation reading, from September, the CPI rate rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "November's cooler inflation data comes after prices had inched higher throughout much of the year, with economists pointing to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "The CPI tracks the changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, providing a snapshot of price changes on everyday items such as food and apparel.",
      "So-called core inflation, or CPI data that excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.6% over the past 12 months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 3% increase for that measure.",
      "Food prices rose 2.6% on an annual basis in November, down from 3.1% in September.",
      "Thursday's report provides the first glimpse of recent inflation data since late October, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released September CPI data.",
      "Data collection was disrupted due to the government shutdown, which delayed the September and November CPI reports. The Labor Department on Thursday said it didn't collect October data due to the shutdown, but said it was able to retroactively acquire some non-survey data for the month.",
      "What economists are saying",
      "Wall Street analysts cautioned that the November inflation figures may be distorted by the government shutdown, which disrupted data collection. The December CPI report should offer a clearer signal of whether the latest reading is a one-off or evidence that price pressures are truly easing, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's possible that this does reflect a genuine drop off in inflationary pressures, but such a sudden stop, particularly in the more-persistent services components like rent or shelter is very unusual, at least outside of a recession,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Bernard Yaros, lead economist at Oxford Economics, also said some \"caution is warranted\" in interpreting the November inflation data, given the housing component was unusually weak in the prior two months.",
      "Some analysts said the softer-than-expected inflation reading paves the way for an interest rate cut in January. That helped boost the three major stock indices, which all traded higher Thursday morning after the release of the CPI data. Interest rate traders now place the likelihood of a January rate cut at around 27%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.",
      "However, given gaps in the data, the Fed may put more weight on the December CPI release, which will be issued before the central bank's next interest rate decision in January, according to Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The Fed will instead focus on the December CPI released in mid-January, just two weeks before its next meeting, as a more accurate bellwether for inflation,\" he said in an email.",
      "New York Federal Reserve President John Williams told\u00a0CNBC on Friday that data distortions likely pushed the CPI reading down by \"probably a tenth or so.\"",
      "What it means for Americans' wallets",
      "Food prices are cooling, although certain grocery items remain expensive. Coffee has climbed 18.8% from a year ago, and ground beef has risen 14.9%.",
      "Some retailers have gradually passed along the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers, fueling concerns about higher prices. Still, tariff-driven inflation has been milder than many feared, Garrett Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said in an email ahead of the CPI release.",
      "In some cases, companies have absorbed the added costs rather than raising prices, while others stockpiled goods ahead of the tariffs, helping blunt price increases.",
      "In November, President Trump cut tariffs on a slate of products that the U.S. typically imports, including bananas and coffee, as his administration sought to address consumer frustrations over\u00a0affordability.",
      "While inflation is expected to ease next year, Americans could continue to face cost pressures, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon.",
      "\"I don't think Americans should brace for surging inflation, but I do think there is a growing risk of a persistent affordability crisis,\" he told CBS News earlier this month. \"Given prices are rising at a faster clip than they normally would, and income trends are slowing.\"",

    "summary": "Millions of people with an Affordable Care Act health plan face a massive jump in premiums next year \u2014 this chart shows just how much.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are bracing for higher health costs in 2026, as subsidies that help them pay for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire on December 31.",
      "Experts warn\u00a0that a failure in Congress to extend the tax credits could be financially devastating for individual policyholders, while also raising health care costs as a whole. Roughly 22 million Americans receive the ACA subsidies, which were created in 2021 to lower households' monthly premiums.",
      "New\u00a0data from investment adviser SmartAsset projects how much people around the U.S. with an ACA plan would have paid on average for coverage in 2025 if they hadn't received the enhanced subsidies. As the analysis shows, monthly premiums for the government health insurance would've been hundreds of dollars higher.",
      "In Mississippi, where around 11% of residents are enrolled in an ACA plan, participants would have seen their average monthly premiums jump from $41 to $605, a 1,376% increase, SmartAsset found. In West Virginia, enrollees' premiums would have risen an average of 1,058%.",
      "A spokesperson for SmartAsset said the analysis captures 2025 costs, but noted the data amounts to a \"close approximation\" of how much more people with ACA coverage could expect to pay next year without the tax credits.",
      "SmartAsset used public records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' 2025 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period to calculate the average cost of ACA plans.",
      "The exact price hikes people could see next will depend on a range of factors, including their insurance plan, age, household income, health status and where they live, according to a spokesperson from KFF. The health policy group estimates that annual out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for the 22 million ACA enrollees who rely on the subsidies.",
      "What is the status of the ACA tax credits?",
      "The tax credits are set to lapse at the end of the year. Democratic lawmakers have pushed for an extension\u00a0but lack enough support in the Republican-led Congress. And while the House passed a health care bill this week that includes several policies favored by Republicans, it excludes an extension of the tax credits and faces hurdles in the Senate.",
      "Both chambers of Congress have left Washington until early next year, making it all but certain that the tax credits will expire on December 31. But four GOP members this week signed a Democratic measure to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years, teeing up a final vote early next year.",
      "If Congress fails to solve the tax credit issue, some enrollees will qualify for a smaller subsidy, while others could lose eligibility completely, according to KFF.",
      "With sharply higher ACA costs on the horizon, the Congressional Budget Office estimates\u00a0that about 4 million people could drop their health insurance altogether. Experts say that could lead to higher costs for people with other types of health insurance because hospitals will have\u00a0to provide more uncompensated care for those lacking coverage.",
      "\"Hospitals can only reconcile that by raising their prices for everybody,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News last week.",

    "story": [
      "A bankruptcy judge blocked an attempt by a nursing home chain's primary investor to shield himself from settlement payments and liability in lawsuits alleging hundreds of patient injuries and deaths, encouraging those pursuing millions in damages.",
      "Genesis HealthCare, once the nation's largest nursing home chain, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy in July with a proposal to protect its controlling investor, Joel Landau, from legal liability. In court papers, Genesis had originally estimated all its settled and pending cases \u2014 which it said numbered nearly a thousand \u2014 would cost $259 million to resolve.",
      "KFF Health News reported this month that in the years before filing for bankruptcy, Genesis had settled at least 155 patient injury and death lawsuits with provisions that allowed it to delay paying, sometimes for more than a year. As a result, when Genesis filed for bankruptcy in July, it still owed $41 million out of the $58 million promised in those settlements with families of current or former residents, according to the bankruptcy and case records KFF Health News reviewed.",
      "In hearings Wednesday and last week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, Judge Stacey G.C. Jernigan said she would not approve a sale of the company's assets that included legal releases from liability for Landau and a private equity associate, David Gefner. Landau, who was seeking to purchase the assets through another company he controlled, did not attend the bankruptcy hearings or respond to a subpoena, lawyers said in court.",
      "\"I'm very encouraged that someone is watching and paying attention to this,\" said Erin Pearson, whose father, James Sanderson, died in 2018 after spending less than a month in a Genesis facility in Albuquerque. \"And the guy who owns the most shares, not only did he not show up but doesn't just get to move things around and rebuy\" the nursing homes.",
      "According to Pearson's lawsuit, filed in 2019, Sanderson developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis while at the facility but was not sent to the hospital for more than a week.",
      "Genesis did not pay Pearson the $500,000 it agreed to in a settlement, according to Pearson's claim filed in bankruptcy court. \"I don't know if I'll ever see that settlement, but I would like to be hopeful,\" Pearson said in an interview Dec. 17.",
      "Genesis, Landau, Gefner, and their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a public statement last week, David Harrington, the executive chairman of Genesis' board of directors, praised Landau and his company's investment in Genesis for helping it avoid bankruptcy in 2021. That \"lifeline,\" he said, enabled Genesis to transform into a \"nimble, market-based model dedicated to prioritizing resident and patient care.\"",
      "Ian Norris, who represents 19 clients with lawsuits against Genesis \u2014 including four who have not been paid their settlements \u2014 said the judge's ruling was \"a huge win for all those who were confronting the possibility that they would not be able to recover the settlements that were promised to them by Genesis prior to the bankruptcy.\"",
      "According to Genesis' bankruptcy filings, the company owes more than $1.6 billion in unpaid claims that are not secured by liens, including claims not only from former residents and their families but also from a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; and Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia, which are owed provider taxes. Daniel Simon, a lawyer representing Genesis' owners, said in court on Dec. 17 that $155 million would be available from the proceeds of the sale for these creditors under a bid for the nursing home assets from a new company controlled by Landau and Gefner.",
      "Genesis last month held an auction for its assets and announced that Landau's bid was the best, but the U.S. Trustee's Office and creditors objected, saying Genesis had unfairly excluded one group from bidding and downplayed the value of another group's bid that would have provided more money to creditors. Jernigan said there were too many irregularities in the auction for her to approve it and ordered it be redone under the watch of the U.S. Trustee's Office.",
      "\"I am aware that there is huge concern about Mr. Landau, and he is not here,\" Jernigan said last week. \"There is no way I can approve these releases without him on the witness stand and me being convinced of his good faith.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who along with two Senate colleagues filed an amicus brief questioning the fairness of the auction, said in a media statement: \"A private equity company tried to abuse the bankruptcy system to slither out of paying what they owe to neglected seniors in its nursing homes. This is a textbook case of why we need to get private equity out of health care altogether, and this decision is a good step forward in the fight to deliver relief for the victims of Genesis.\"",
      "In the Dec. 17 hearing, representatives of the company controlled by Landau and Gefner said they would bid again for the remains of Genesis without the promise of liability releases. The auction is expected to occur in January. Simon, the lawyer for Genesis, said at the hearing that the judge's ruling \"has humbled us.\"",
      "Lawyers for former and current Genesis residents said they hope to sue Landau and other parties that controlled the company and led it into bankruptcy. John Anthony, a Tampa attorney who represents 341 claimants, said, \"The victims believe that Mr. Landau richly deserves his day in court, so he can explain to a jury of his peers how he has apparently gotten so rich running all these supposedly insolvent facilities into the ground.\"",

The sports betting company announced Friday it is debuting DraftKings Predictions, a mobile app and web product that will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.",
      "\"Along with our operational footprint, marketing and analytics infrastructure and advanced in-house technology, we believe we are uniquely positioned to lead this space over the long term,\" Corey Gottlieb, chief product officer of DraftKings, said in a statement.",

      "Some prediction market platforms lacking a license for sports wagering have faced pushback from state regulators. Event contracts traded on markets are regulated differently from sports bets, which are illegal in certain states.",
      "Others have criticized the move by prediction markets to facilitate speculation on sports.

    "summary": "TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok has signed a deal to sell its U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Axios was first to report the deal.",
      "Under a law passed last year, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must either sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law set a January 2025 deadline, but President Trump has extended it several times, most recently until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order paving the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "At the time, a senior White House official said that under the proposed deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Axios reported Thursday that Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will collectively own 45% of the U.S. entity. Almost one-third of the new entity will be owned by current ByteDance investors, according to Axios.",
      "When reached by CBS News Thursday, an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said in September, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during a call in September. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege. Instead, customers whose orders were late or incomplete only received a small credit to use on a future order.",

      "Additionally, Instacart charged consumers for Instacart+ subscriptions, which offer perks like free or low-cost delivery, without their consent, the FTC said.",

This settlement allows us to move forward and remain focused on delivering value for our customers, shoppers, and retail and brand partners in the communities we serve,\" an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement.",

      "Some small business owners say they are facing their own affordability crisis because of higher tariff, health insurance and energy costs.",
      "Shirley Modlin, who owns 3D Design and Manufacturing in Powhatan, Virginia, told CBS News that rising operational expenses are making it tough for her to offer raises and health insurance for her 10 workers.",
      "Modlin, whose company makes metal parts for the automotive, pharmaceutical, beverage and other industries, said uncertainty over where U.S. tariff rates will settle makes it hard to forecast her costs.",
      "\"It's the end of the year and my employees are expecting some kind of raise, but I don't know how much I can give them because I don't know what kind of impact the tariffs are going to continue to have on me,\" Modlin told CBS News.",
      "\"I feel like I am in a balancing act, and if I don't raise prices and my costs are going up, that squeezes my margins harder,\" she added.",
      "U.S. importers currently face an average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, the highest level since the 1930s, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "Small business importers paid roughly $25,000 more per month on average due to the Trump administration's tariffs between April and September, compared to the same period in 2024, according to a\u00a0new analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP), a nonpartisan policy research institute.",
      "\"What should be a season of giving has become a season of paying for America's 36 million small businesses,\" Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said at a press conference on Tuesday held by the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. \"They are paying more for affordable health care, more for electricity and more for just about everything, thanks to Trump's tariffs.\"",
      "The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the legality\u00a0of Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs soon. If they are struck down, however, he has other tools he can employ to implement similar levies, according to legal experts.",
      "Who's to blame?",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship blamed small businesses' challenges on Democrats.",
      "\"Four years of Democrat control of Washington created a historic affordability crisis for small businesses as inflation soared and an unprecedented $1.8 trillion in new regulations were created,\" the spokesperson told CBS News. \"In just 11 months, Republicans have begun to undo the damage by passing the largest tax cut in history to complement the $907 billion regulatory rollback being undertaken by the Trump administration.",
      "\"The results speak for themselves as we just witnessed a record number of holiday shoppers, core inflation fell to the lowest level in five years, and hardworking Americans' real wages will increase by $1,000,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Spokespersons for the White House and Small Business Administration didn't respond to a request for comment on the affordability concerns cited by some small businesses.",
      "Another major concern for Modlin and her workers is that enhanced tax credits for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are set to expire at the end of 2025, which experts have said would sharply drive up premiums for more than 20 million Americans.",
      "An October CAP\u00a0analysis found that 4.4 million small business owners and self-employed Americans will see their health insurance costs rise by an average of $1,500 if the ACA subsidies are allowed to expire.",
      "In 2024, Modlin offered employees a $350 monthly stipend to help offset health plan costs. Now, she said she's trying to decide whether to increase that monthly payment or offer raises. She can't afford to do both, said Modlin, expressing concern about losing some of her machinists to larger competitors.",
      "\"I've interviewed job candidates who have said they need a better health insurance benefit,\" she said. \"The rest of our benefits are good, but I just can't keep up with the cost of insurance.\"",
      "Julie Robbins, CEO of Earthquaker Devices, an Akron, Ohio-based maker of guitar pedals and other musical effects products, said the 35-person company's costs have soared about 30% this year because of the sharply higher U.S. tariffs on imports.",
      "She and her husband, with whom she runs the business, purchase thousands of components sourced from more than a dozen countries to manufacture pedals in Ohio. The company has paid an additional $60,000 in tariffs this year, a figure that could rise to at least $180,000 in 2026, Robbins said at the Senate small business event held earlier this week.",
      "Robbins said Earthquaker plans to modestly hike its prices starting in January, noting that the company's suppliers have lifted their own prices. She acknowledges that such increases could scare away some customers.",
      "\"You can't calculate how demand will suffer from a price rise, so we try to avoid that whenever possible,\" Robbins told CBS News.",
      "In November, 34% of small businesses raised their average selling prices, an unusually sharp jump from previous months, according to Bank of America analysts, citing recent data from the National Federation of Independent Business.",
      "\"This suggests businesses are passing on tariff and inflation-related costs\" to consumers,\u00a0Bank of America said in a report.",

    "summary": "Wall Street analysts expect another strong year in stocks in 2026, propelled by continued AI sector gains and additional Fed interest-rate cuts.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. stock market scaled new heights in 2025, as investors largely tuned out concerns about the Trump administration's sharply higher tariffs and shrugged off fears of a financial market bubble among artificial intelligence companies.",
      "The S&P 500 stock index is up roughly 15% this year through Dec. 17\u2014 a strong performance, although lower than the heady 23% jump posted by the broad-based index in 2024. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 13% per year over the last decade, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott.",
      "The Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.",
      "The key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an\u00a0AI bubble\u00a0percolate?",
      "\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"",
      "Other forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.",
      "J.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.",
      "What will drive stocks in 2026?",
      "Several catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.",
      "\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the securities firm said in a market forecast. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"",
      "The AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.",
      "Another area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers.",
      "Growth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.",
      "\"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it,\" he said.",
      "Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.",
      "Another tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.",
      "\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.",
      "Still, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.",
      "Is my money safe?",
      "The biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.",
      "AI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with\u00a0earnings growth\u00a0from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.",
      "\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.",
      "Amid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.",
      "In its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.",
      "Crisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped. The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.",
      "\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"",
      "Still, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.",
      "\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Instacart customers may be surprised to discover they are unwittingly paying more for the same items sold by some of America's major retail chains than their fellow shoppers.",
      "A months-long investigation by the nonprofit organizations Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative found that identical grocery items on Instacart could differ in price by as much as 23% from one customer to the next.",
      "That's due to the platform's algorithmic pricing experiments, which place different price tags on identical products without revealing the discrepancies directly to shoppers, the report found. The AI model, which Instacart started implementing in 2022, sets grocery prices at some large retail chains that partner with the San Francisco-based delivery company, the groups added.",
      "Variations in pricing for identical products are particularly acute in online shopping, given that customers don't have the same reference points as in physical stores, said Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData.",
      "\"You sit in front of your phone or your browser, you're shown the price, and you don't know what everyone else was shown,\" he said.",
      "Justin Brookman, director of digital marketplace policy for Consumer Reports, agreed. \"Traditionally, we haven't had to worry about this sort of thing. We would go to the supermarket and pay what was on the shelf,\" he told CBS News. \"Now, I think people are going to be worried: Am I getting ripped off?\"",
      "Instacart's AI-driven pricing technology has caught the attention of the Federal Trade Commission, which is now probing the company over its use of the tool, according to\u00a0Reuters.",
      "\"The Federal Trade Commission has a longstanding policy of not commenting on any potential or ongoing investigations,\" \u00a0the FTC said in a statement. \"But, like so many Americans, we are disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practices.\"",
      "Report finds major price discrepancies",
      "Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative based their findings on data gathered from online shopping sessions, in which hundreds of volunteers shopped on Instacart for identical baskets of goods from Safeway and Target.",
      "Of the 437 participants, every single one was exposed to algorithmic price experiments, according to the report. The investigation also found evidence of price experimentation at Albertsons, Costco, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market.",
      "According to Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, Instacart has framed price differences between customers as \"negligible.\" However, the scope of the price experiments is \"far broader and more costly to some consumers than has been publicly acknowledged,\" the organizations said in the report.",
      "The investigation found that some products had as many as five different price points, with variations ranging from as little as 7 cents to $2.56 per item. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins differed by as much as 23%.",
      "All told, the price variations could cost families $1,200 a year, based on how much Instacart says the typical household of four spends on groceries, the report found.",
      "Some products were unscathed by the price experiments. For example, at the Seattle Safeway, volunteers did not observe any price variations for items such as Premium brand saltine crackers, Heinz ketchup and Barilla farfalle pasta.",
      "Safeway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Instacart told CBS News in a statement that 10 of its retailer partners are using pricing experiments, but did not specify which ones.",
      "\"Just as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners \u2014 ones that already apply markups \u2014 do the same online via Instacart,\" a spokesperson said in an email. \"These limited, short-term and randomized tests help retail partners learn what matters most to consumers and how to keep essential items affordable.\"",
      "Customers were also shown different \"original\" prices, making some savings appear larger, the report found, a concept known as \"fictitious pricing.\"\u00a0Amazon was sued this October\u00a0for allegedly using this tactic during its summer Prime Day sale.",
      "The rise of AI pricing models",
      "Dynamic pricing, which sets consumer prices based on demand, has long been part of the e-commerce landscape. However, while it's a common tactic in certain industries like travel, where supply is fixed, consumers may be surprised to see it cropping up in the grocery space, Saunders said.",
      "\"In retail, especially grocery retail, people expect the price to be the price,\" he said. \"They don't expect [it] to yo-yo up and down.\"",
      "Another issue, as the report points out, is that consumers often have no clue that they may be paying more for the same item. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\u00a0Act prevents \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" including \"misleading cost or price claims.\" However, Saunders said he doesn't believe companies are legally obligated to tell customers that they are part of pricing experiments.",
      "\"Instacart shoppers we spoke to say they were unaware that they were participants in active Instacart pricing experiments and view the practice as manipulative and unfair,\" the report says.",
      "One example of dynamic pricing is surveillance pricing, a tactic employed by companies that involves using a shopper's behavior and personal data to make price evaluations, according to the FTC. Saunders said surveillance pricing has been supercharged by artificial intelligence, which can assess vast amounts of data at rapid speeds to determine price levels.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that it does not use personal, demographic or user-level behavioral data to set prices.",
      "As pricing models like Instacart's become more sophisticated, Brookman said he's concerned about what it could mean for consumers.",
      "\"I'm worried companies are going to use these sorts of algorithmic pricing models to charge us the maximum amount we're willing to pay, which is good for their profits, but not so good for [our wallets],\" he said.",

      "Trump Media's strategic shift",
      "For Trump Media, the merger represents another strategic shift, given its 2021 launch as a business focusing on the conservative-leaning social media space.",
      "More recently, the company has pivoted beyond its roots as a tech business. Earlier this year, Trump Media struck a deal to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency, and it has also rolled out investment funds with \"America-first\" strategies.",
      "The merger with TAE represents a continuation of Trump Media's \"America first\" principles, former California lawmaker Devin Nunes, now chief executive of Trump Media, said in a Thursday conference call with investors.",
      "\"Fusion power will lower energy prices, bolster our national defense and secure the energy needed to guarantee America's dominance of AI technology,\" Nunes said on the call.",
      "He added, \"This combination positions the combined company to help lead the global AI revolution and kickstart an American energy renaissance.\"",
      "After the merger closes next year, the company will \"quickly seek approvals to site and build the company's first utility-scale power plant,\" Nunes said. \"We expect siting to commence by year-end 2026, sending us on the path to build future plants expected to be 350 megawatt to 500 megawatt.\"",
      "AI power needs",
      "With tech companies building AI data centers across the U.S., their need for power is \"growing exponentially,\" according to a report earlier this year from Deloitte. Power demand for AI data centers could grow more than thirtyfold by 2035, up to 123 gigawatts from 4 gigawatts last year, the consulting firm noted.",
      "The combination represents \"a major play on creating the first public nuclear fusion company in the U.S.,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a report. TAE's investors include Google, Chevron and Goldman Sachs, he noted.",
      "TAE has \"safely built and operated five fusion reactors and importantly proven major energy and fusion breakthroughs over the years... putting TAE at the top of the mountain in the fusion global scene in our view,\" Ives said.",
      "Fusion power will prove to be \"the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s,\" Nunes said in a statement.",
      "Nunes will serve as co-CEO of the new company with TAE Technologies CEO Michl Binderbauer, according to a\u00a0statement\u00a0from the two companies Thursday.",

    "summary": "Negative views of the nation's economy persist as 2025 draws to a close.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans are feeling the pinch this holiday season.",
      "Most feel it's at least somewhat difficult to afford the things they're buying for the holidays. Some are pulling back on gifts, entertainment and travel, particularly those among the majority who say items cost more now than they did last year.",
      "Holiday spending also spotlights the long-standing differences in Americans' financial situations. Those who report their financial situation as good, who tend to have higher incomes, say affording the holidays is easier. But even they say things are costing more.",
      "In all, the season often brings feelings of gratitude and happiness, but finances can factor into sentiments, too: those who say it is hard to afford things are more apt to say the season also brings stress.",
      "With holiday travel coming, many do feel they're getting relief on gas prices. More say they are going down more than going up \u2014 the first time we've seen that this year.",
      "Relatively few Americans say they will be buying more gifts, entertainment or airline tickets or food and drinks this holiday season, compared to recent years. Those who say it will be difficult to afford items this year are especially likely to say they will be scaling back on these things.",
      "The people who are keeping purchases steady or buying more this year tend to be those who say their financial situation is good.",
      "Feelings about the holiday season",
      "Overall, the holiday season evokes more positive feelings than negative ones, with many saying they are happy and grateful.",
      "But those who are having difficulty affording holiday expenses are especially likely to report feeling stressed, too.",
      "Looking back on 2025",
      "Views of the economy have been low for years, and 2025 continued that trend. But beneath those sentiments, the year also showed a consistent split between those who feel their finances are good and bad \u2014 the former generally having higher incomes and saying the stock market matters to their finances, the latter having lower incomes and being more impacted by prices and inflation.",
      "On personal finances, about half of the country continues to say their financial situation is good, while about half say it is bad, which has been the case throughout the year.",
      "Looking back, overall, for those whose financial situation changed over the year, more said it got worse rather than better.\u00a0 But those who did feel their situation improved were also more likely to be those with higher incomes.",
      "The year ends with most Americans voicing larger concerns about inflation that have persisted for years. Throughout 2025, about three-quarters said their incomes were not keeping pace with inflation. Views of the overall economy remain low.",
      "The public's evaluations of the U.S. job market specifically remain net negative. This comes as the latest government data shows somewhat of a mixed bag: more jobs were added in November than economists expected, but the unemployment rate ticked up to its highest level since September 2021.",
      "Among the bright spots, on balance, more Americans rate the condition of the stock market as good than rate it as bad, and that's particularly so among those for whom the market's performance matters a lot to their finances.",
      "More Americans now say the price of gas in their area is coming down than say it's going up \u2014 a reversal from what we saw this fall and over the year.",
      "Throughout the year, like today, Americans have had a collectively mixed outlook looking forward. Just over half of Americans expect a slowing economy or one in recession. While others expect a growing economy or one that holds steady.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,267 U.S. adults interviewed between December 15-17, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "summary": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board told its shareholders that Paramount Skydance's offer \"provides inadequate value\" for the business.",
    "story": [
      "Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday urged shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid, arguing that it created \"significant risks and costs\" for the company and that Netflix's prior offer provides better value.",
      "The move follows competing bids for Warner Bros. Discovery, whose storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series. Netflix agreed on December 5 to buy a part of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, while Paramount Skydance followed on December 8 with an all-cash offer for the entirety of the media conglomerate.",
      "In making the bid for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison described it as a \"superior all-cash offer.\" Ellison said that its bid, combining the assets of Warner Bros. Discovery with Paramount Skydance (the parent of CBS News), would face an easier path through the government regulatory process.",
      "Paramount is offering $30 a share for the entire company, while Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros.'s HBO as well as its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television, for $27.75 a share.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's stock traded on Wednesday at $28.30 a share.",
      "Paramount Skydance on Wednesday said that it is sticking with its $30 per share offer, expressing confidence that the bid offers \"superior value\" to Netflix's bid.",
      "Paramount Skydance added that it believes a merger with Warner Bros. Discovery provides \"a faster, more certain path to completion than the Netflix transaction.\"",
      "\"I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders, who clearly understand the benefits of our offer,\" Ellison said in a statement. \"We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers and the creative industries.\"",
      "Why Warner Bros. Discovery prefers Netflix",
      "In recommending that shareholders reject Paramount Skydance's bid, Warner Bros. Discovery said its board concluded the two offers pose an equal regulatory risk. Warner Bros. Discovery also said its analysis found that Netflix's offer, which includes cash and Netflix stock, is superior.",
      "It also raised concerns about Paramount Skydance's $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which Warner Bros. Discovery said \"there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind.\" David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person, with a net worth of $243 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's recommendation comes shortly after one of Paramount Skydance's financial partners in the deal, Affinity Partners, said it had dropped out of the hostile bid. Affinity is the private equity firm founded by President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.",
      "An Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that, while it continued to believe in the \"strong strategic rationale\" for Paramount Skydance's offer, it had decided to pull back because \"the dynamics of the investment have changed significantly since we initially became involved in October.\"",
      "In a letter sent to shareholders, Warner Bros. Discovery's board said it believed Netflix's finances are also in better shape, with a stronger credit rating and a larger market capitalization.",
      "\"The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet,\" the letter stated.",
      "Paramount Skydance's credit rating is \"at or only a notch above 'junk' status from the two leading rating agencies,\" while its market valuation stands at $15 billion, Warner Bros. Discovery added.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery also expressed concern about Paramount Skydance's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its offer.",
      "\"The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change,\" its shareholder letter stated. \"As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time.\"",
      "While Wednesday's letter to shareholders means Paramount's is not the offer favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide to tender their shares in favor of Paramount's offer for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery and TNT.",

    "summary": "Americans lose hundreds of millions of dollars each year in travel-related fraud, according to the Joint Economic Committee. Here's how to avoid getting burned.",
    "story": [
      "Lawmakers are warning travelers to beware of a range of scams that tend to proliferate during the holiday season, including phishing schemes involving phony websites, as well as criminals who impersonate airlines and hotels.",
      "Online travel fraud has surged, accounting for $1 trillion in global financial losses in 2024, according to the Joint Economic Committee (JEC), which issued the warning on Wednesday. For example, such scams can lead to consumers paying for fake trips or booking accommodations that look nothing like how they are pictured online.",
      "\"While the winter holidays are one of the busiest travel seasons of the year, they're also one of the busiest seasons for scammers impersonating airlines, hotels and rental platforms,\" U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan, the panel's ranking member, said in a statement. \"As millions of Americans prepare to travel to see their loved ones over the next few weeks, everyone should also prepare to protect themselves against rampant travel scams.\"",
      "The JEC, a bipartisan group of House and Senate lawmakers that advises Congress on economic issues, also called on the Federal Trade Commission to indicate what steps it is taking alongside U.S. technology companies to protect consumers from overseas scam networks. Organized foreign criminals stole $10 billion from Americans in 2024, up 66% from the prior year.",
      "In a letter, the panel pressed the FTC to detail how it is working with social media sites, dating platforms, financial technology companies and other actors to disrupt travel fraud. Lawmakers also requested details on how much money the FTC has allocated to protect Americans from overseas fraud.",
      "The panel's Democratic minority cited data from travel and payment firms showing a sharp rise in online fraud around the holidays.",
      "Travel fraud is among the most common types of criminal activity, according to the\u00a0FTC, which said it accounted for $274 million in U.S. consumer losses in 2024. Research from the Mastercard Economics Institute has found that\u00a0fraud spikes by up to 28%\u00a0during peak travel seasons.",
      "Common travel scams",
      "Criminals employ a range of tactics to extract payment details or other personal information from travelers. One common ploy is to send a text message claiming that a person's flight has been canceled, according to the JEC.",
      "\"These texts, which appear to come from major airlines, direct customers to a fake number or link to rebook their travel,\" warned the panel, which advises people to verify any schedule changes with their airline.",
      "Scammers may also pose as legitimate business representatives in replying to travelers' social media posts about flight delays or other travel headaches. In addition, fraudsters are known to pay to appear in online search results, advertising phony customer service numbers that lead directly to a scammer.",
      "How to avoid getting burned",
      "The JEC advised travelers always to consult official company websites or apps when seeking information, and not to click on links sent by text or email directing them to a website. Consumers should also be leery of online ads, sponsored search results or links posted on social media, the lawmakers warned.",
      "If a travel company is unfamiliar, meanwhile, the panel advises travelers to check sites like the Better Business Bureau, where other customers can post reviews and complaints. Clues indicating a possible scam include misspelled or extra words in a website address.",
      "Consumers should also beware vendors that describe accommodations as luxurious, but don't provide details such as a hotel's name or location, the JEC said. If a company does not list its cancellation or refund policy, or requests payment in cryptocurrency, that could also be suspicious, according to the committee.",

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday unveiled the new website for the Trump Accounts program, a tax-deferred investment vehicle for American children. He also announced a new Trump Accounts partner, billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio.",
      "At a briefing on the program, Bessent projected that the $1,000 deposited into a Trump Account by the government when a child is born would grow to over $600,000 by retirement age, assuming that the historic growth rate continues. For families who invest $5,000 each year in the accounts, that sum would grow to $1 million, he added.",
      "Parents may sign up their children by making an election on a new IRS form \u2014 Form 4547 \u2014 when they file their taxes. A financial institution will receive the child's funds and activate the account. Trump accounts are to be invested in an authorized investment, like mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Children who are U.S. citizens born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028 are eligible to receive the $1,000 government contribution into their accounts. Children under 18 who have a Social Security number can receive up to $5,000 each year from parents, guardians or others in their account.",
      "Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, is contributing $75 million as part of a 50-state push for businesses and philanthropic organizations to donate in each state. Dalio will \"boost funding for Trump accounts for kids across Connecticut,\" Bessent said.",

The person is then invited to \"cancel\" the order by connecting with a live customer service representative, who asks for credit card, Social Security number and other personal data.",
      "YouMail, which makes technology to block robocalls and scam texts, has been tracking calls associated with the so-called phishing campaign in cooperation with the FCC.",
      "\"It's too easy to get tricked when you feel pressure to act right away to address a problem that might cost you money,\" YouMail CEO Alex Quilici told CBS News in an email, noting that the scam targets tens of millions of U.S. consumers.",

We have detected a pre-authorized purchase of $919.45 for a PlayStation 5 and 3D headset, recently placed through a Walmart account registered to your name and phone number. If you did not authorize this purchase, press 1 to speak with a Walmart representative immediately.\"",
      "According to YouMail data, the bad actors have used more than 50 aliases as part of the ongoing robocall scam. They relied mainly on male names like David, Brandon, Michael and Paul earlier in the campaign, before swapping them for more female aliases in the second half of this year, such as Olivia, Jessica and Naomi.",
      "The scam first surfaced as early as 2023, and Quilici said it has expanded since then. \"Most campaigns start at low volume before they ramp,\" he said.",

      "Employers across the U.S. added 64,000 jobs in November, beating economists' forecasts, new government data\u00a0shows, even as new October figures revealed a loss of 105,000 jobs, a sign the labor market remains under pressure.",
      "The unemployment rate in November rose to 4.6%, the highest level since September 2021.",
      "The November employment report offers a fresh picture of the labor market after a six-week blackout in official data caused by the recent\u00a0government shutdown. The data suggests that employers in industries ranging from manufacturing to hospitality are hitting the pause button on hiring amid concerns about economic growth and tariff costs, some economists noted.",
      "\"Businesses are not hiring as they adjust to tariffs, uncertain conditions and AI. The result is about 700,000 more unemployed Americans than there were a year ago,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 40,000 jobs in November, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The Labor Department on Tuesday also released partial employment data from October, which shows a loss of 105,000 jobs that month.",
      "The drag on October employment was driven by a steep loss in the federal workforce, which shed 162,000 jobs that month. The decline is due to a wave of deferred resignations starting to show up in the payroll data, according to Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.",
      "Job growth for August and September was also revised down by a collective 33,000.",
      "The government's official employment data for October and November had been delayed due to the 43-day government shutdown, which ended in last month.",
      "In the absence of federal data, economists at the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street had been monitoring alternative sources, which have signaled ongoing headwinds in the labor market. For instance, ADP earlier this month said private-sector employers in the U.S. cut 32,000 jobs in November, while outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas has tracked more than 1.1 million layoffs so far this year.",
      "Economic uncertainty has led workers to stay put and employers to pull back on hiring, creating a difficult situation for job seekers, especially those early in their careers.",
      "The labor market is slowly cooling, Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John C. Williams said in a\u00a0speech\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"I should emphasize that this has been an ongoing, gradual process, without signs of a sharp rise in layoffs or other indications of rapid deterioration,\" Williams said. But, he added, \"Job growth has been anemic.\"",
      "What it means",
      "The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% in November \u2014 the highest since September 2021 \u2014 as more people entered the labor force to look for jobs, according to Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge.",
      "While the numbers offer a glimpse into the labor market during the government shutdown, experts say investors and government officials will likely view the data with some skepticism, given questions about the accuracy and completeness of data collection following the shutdown.",
      "Indeed, the Federal Reserve may not place much emphasis on the November numbers at its January rate-setting meeting because of the data disruption, said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory,\" he said in an email.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0said the central bank would likely view the October and November data with a \"somewhat skeptical eye,\" given the data may be distorted.",
      "The larger-than-expected rise in the unemployment rate could, however, raise concerns within the Fed, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist of Principal Asset Management, in an email.",
      "The central bank\u00a0lowered interest rates\u00a0by 0.25 percentage points for the third consecutive time last week,\u00a0citing\u00a0the rise in the downside risks to employment.",

    "summary": "The proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads, which would create the first U.S. transcontinental railroad, has lost the support of two major unions.",
    "story": [
      "The proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads has lost the support of two of their biggest unions that represent more than half their workers because they're worried the deal would increase safety risks, lead to higher shipping rates and consumer prices and cause significant disruptions.",
      "The unions' decision, which they plan to announce Wednesday, will make the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division two of the most prominent critics of the deal to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. They join the American Chemistry Council, an assortment of agricultural groups, and competing railroad BNSF in raising concerns that this combination would hurt competition.",
      "But the deal has picked up the support of the nation's largest rail union that represents conductors and hundreds of individual shippers as well as an Oval Office endorsement from President Trump.",
      "The U.S. Surface Transportation Board will begin weighing the opinions of all those stakeholders to determine whether the merger is in the public interest once the railroads file their formal application, which is expected later this week.",
      "Unions finding fault",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena has argued that creating a railroad that stretches from coast to coast would be good for the economy because it would be able to deliver shipments more quickly without handing them off between railroads in the middle of the country and that it could better compete against trucking. But the presidents of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division unions \u2014 which are both affiliated with the Teamsters \u2014 said that after months of meetings with Vena and other executives, they have serious doubts about the potential benefits, and they said the promises Vena made to preserve jobs of all current employees aren't detailed enough to be counted on.",
      "\"This proposed monopoly will end up costing businesses more and those costs will be passed on to consumers,\" Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen National President Mark Wallace said. \"We believe this transcontinental railroad will make shipping by rail less attractive as the merged carrier passes off rail lines that serve small towns, factories and farms to short line railroads while running miles-long slow-moving trains on the main line. For rail customers it will be a choice between 'Hell or the highway.'\"",
      "The unions say they're worried that safety could deteriorate after a merger because Norfolk Southern has made some strides in the two and a half years since the disastrous East Palestine, Ohio, derailment.",
      "Vena and Norfolk Southern CEO Mark George have said they're optimistic the merger will get approved because they believe it will be good for the country, their customers and rail workers. Over 99% of shareholders of both lines voted in favor of the combination last month.",
      "The Surface Transportation Board plans to review the deal under the tough new standard it adopted in 2001 after a series of disastrous rail mergers in the 1990s that led to delays of weeks or even months for some shipments. These untested rules require any merger of the six largest railroads to be in the public interest and show that it will enhance competition. When the Surface Transportation Board approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades two years ago, it used a less stringent standard allowing Canadian Pacific's $31 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern.",
      "Outside views mixed",
      "Transportation expert and DePaul University Professor Joe Schwieterman said many people have been raising concerns about the Union Pacific merger because of its scope and the likelihood that it could trigger another merger and leave companies with only two American railroads to deal with. But everyone wants to examine the details in the merger application closely, he said.",
      "Currently, Norfolk Southern and CSX serve the eastern U.S. while Union Pacific and BNSF serve the west, and the two major Canadian rails compete where they can with their tracks crossing Canada and extending down into the United States and Mexico.",
      "\"This merger is like nothing we've seen before. It's creating a railroad of such enormous scope that it's somewhat of a paradigm shift,\" Schwieterman said.",
      "A merged Union Pacific would likely control more than 40% of the nation's freight.",
      "BNSF's Chief of Staff Zak Andersen said his railroad, which is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, is convinced this merger would be bad for competition and only lead to higher rates and fewer options for shippers.",
      "\"No customer is asking for this. This is strictly a Wall Street play for shareholders,\" Andersen said.",
      "Earlier this fall, Buffett and CPKC's CEO both said they weren't interested in any kind of rail merger right now. Instead, they believe the railroads should continue to find ways to cooperate to deliver shipments more quickly, which can be done without all the complications of a merger. Still, CSX decided to replace its CEO this fall with an executive who has a background leading companies through major mergers.",

    "summary": "FIFA slashed the price of some World Cup tickets following a worldwide backlash, with some final seats available for $60.",
    "story": [
      "FIFA slashed the price of some World Cup tickets for teams' most loyal fans following a global backlash and some will get $60 seats for the final instead of being asked to pay $4,185.",
      "FIFA said Tuesday that $60 tickets will be made available for every game at the tournament in North America, going to the national federations whose teams are playing. Those federations decide how to distribute them to loyal fans who have attended previous games at home and on the road.",
      "The number of $60 tickets for each game is likely to be in the hundreds, rather than thousands, in what FIFA is now calling a \"Supporter Entry Tier\" price category.",
      "FIFA did not specify exactly why it so dramatically changed strategy, but said the lower prices are \"designed to further support travelling fans following their national teams across the tournament.\"",
      "The World Cup in North America will be the first edition that features 48 teams \u2014 up from 32 \u2014 and is expected to earn FIFA at least $10 billion in revenue. Teams will play in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",
      "But fans worldwide reacted with shock and anger last week on seeing FIFA's ticketing plans that gave participating teams no tickets in the lowest-priced category.",
      "The cheapest prices ranged from $120 to $265 for group-stage games that did not involve the three co-hosting countries.",
      "FIFA had set those prices despite the co-hosts having pledged eight years ago \u2014 when they were bidding for the tournament \u2014 that hundreds of thousands of $21 tickets would be made available.",
      "Criticism from fans, especially in Europe, had been increasing for several months over plans for \"dynamic pricing\" plus extra fees on a FIFA-run resale platform \u2014 both features which are common in the U.S. entertainment industry but not to soccer fans worldwide.",
      "Fan anger intensified last week when it became clear loyal supporters would have no access to the cheapest category tickets and that fans who wanted to reserve a ticket for all of their team's potential games \u2014 through the final \u2014 would not get refunded until after the tournament.",
      "In another climbdown Tuesday, FIFA said it would waive its administrative fees when refunds are made after the July 19 final.",
      "The 12 four-team groups that make up the World Cup\u00a0draw were selected earlier in December. The United States will play in Group D, along with Paraguay, Australia and the winner of UEFA playoff C. The teams there are Turkey, Romania, Slovakia, and Kosovo. The playoff games will be decided in March 2026.",
      "The World Cup games will begin on June 11, with a game between Mexico and South Africa in Mexico City and South Korea playing the winner of UEFA playoff D in Guadalajara. The World Cup final will be held in New Jersey on July 19.",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 07:25:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department released thousands of new photos and records on Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, but at least 550 pages in the documents are fully redacted.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department released thousands of new records on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, but at least 550 pages in the documents are fully redacted, CBS News has found.",
      "The newly released files included photos of several prominent people in Epstein's orbit, images from his homes and investigative records that detail disturbing allegations against the late sex offender. But the heavy redactions in many of the records have drawn criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, as the department defends its handling of the files.",
      "One series of three consecutive documents \u2014 totaling 255 pages \u2014 is entirely redacted, with each page covered by a black box. A fourth 119-page document labeled \"Grand Jury-NY\" is also entirely redacted. It's unclear what proceedings it stemmed from, but the document listed immediately before it is a transcript in which a prosecutor asks a grand jury in 2020 to consider evidence for a superseding indictment of Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "At least 180 blacked-out pages appear in files that are mostly but not entirely redacted. In some cases, a cover page, a photo of a folder or something else that isn't fully redacted precedes several pages that are entirely obscured by a black box.",
      "In other cases, the redactions were more sparing. For example, a 96-page police report on a Florida investigation into Epstein in the mid-2000s redacts the names of victims and other details, but leaves many other details in.",
      "And some of the thousands of photos included in Friday's release are partially redacted, with some people's faces obscured by boxes. Photos that include former President Bill Clinton, pop star Michael Jackson and other notable people have partial redactions (though Clinton and Jackson themselves are fully visible).",
      "Why was the DOJ allowed to redact Epstein files?",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress last month, requires the Justice Department to release the files in its possession related to Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "Redactions are allowed for a handful of reasons, including to protect survivors' personal information and to leave out violent photos and child sexual abuse material. Documents can also be withheld in a \"narrowly tailored and temporary\" manner if their release would \"jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\"",
      "Some of Friday's redactions appear to black out the names of survivors, but it's not clear in every case why information was blacked out. The government is required to give Congress a list of redactions within 15 days.",
      "The law explicitly forbids the government from withholding records due to the risk of \"embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\" The Justice Department said on X that no politicians' names were redacted from the files.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a letter to Congress earlier Friday that a team of more than 200 Justice Department lawyers scoured the documents in search of survivors' names and other things that needed to be redacted. He said the department is still going through the files and will release more of them on a \"rolling basis,\" though the law required them to be released by Friday.",
      "Blanche's letter also said \"additional lawyers of review\" were necessary when reviewing grand jury transcripts. Judges in New York and Florida have given the government permission to release grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell's cases, but the judge overseeing the Maxwell case required the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan to \"personally certify\" that none of the documents contain victims' personal information.",
      "Democrats criticize the redactions in Epstein files",
      "Some lawmakers have blasted the Justice Department for the redactions and for acknowledging that some documents will be released later.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who helped lead the effort to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act, argued that Friday's document release wasn't in compliance with their law.",
      "Khanna called it an \"incomplete release with too many redactions\" in a video posted to X. He said he's \"exploring all options,\" including impeachment or referrals for prosecution. Massie said the release \"grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said: \"Simply releasing a mountain of blacked out pages violates the spirit of transparency and the letter of the law. For example, all 119 pages of one document were completely blacked out. We need answers as to why.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on the criticism.",
      "The Justice Department has defended its handling of the files. Blanche told Fox News Digital: \"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law \u2014 full stop.\"",
      "\"Democrat administrations in the past have refused to provide full details of the Jeffrey Epstein saga,\" Blanche said in his letter to lawmakers. \"But President Trump, Attorney General Bondi, and FBI Director Patel are committed to providing full transparency consistent with the law.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 00:14:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik's decision to drop out came after President Trump signaled he would not make an endorsement in the race at this stage.",
    "story": [
      "Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik dropped out of the New York governor's race Friday, concluding that a potentially fractious GOP primary could hurt Republicans' chances in an uphill statewide contest, as President Trump signaled he would not make an endorsement at this stage.",
      "Stefanik pointed to the risks in a statement to supporters, writing: \"While we would have overwhelmingly won this primary, it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York.\"",
      "Stefanik's political future is now unclear, as she said she is not planning to run for re-election in Congress. Stefanik, considered a rising MAGA leader, was initially set to leave Congress after Mr. Trump picked her in November 2024 for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, before her nomination was pulled by the administration in March over concerns about a narrowing Republican majority in the House.",
      "Two sources confirmed to CBS News that Stefanik spoke directly with President Trump on Thursday to discuss her decision to leave the gubernatorial race. Their conversation was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Mr. Trump later issued a statement following her announcement applauding Stefanik, calling her \"a fantastic person and Congresswoman from New York State\" and describing her as \"a tremendous talent.\" He said she would have \"great success\" in whatever she chooses next and signaled his continued support.",
      "A Republican member of Congress with direct knowledge of the race told CBS News they believed Stefanik ultimately concluded that a contested Republican primary would be difficult and potentially damaging, even if she were likely to win. The other major candidate is Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, another Trump ally.",
      "Under New York GOP rules, candidates must secure at least 25% of the weighted vote at the state party's February convention to qualify for the June primary ballot, or otherwise submit nominating petitions.",
      "While Stefanik was believed to have early support representing well above that threshold \u2014 possibly more than 75% of the weighted vote due to early endorsements from local party officials \u2014 New York Republicans told CBS News that a challenge from Blakeman still risked becoming a prolonged intraparty fight.",
      "The eventual nominee is expected to face off against incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul. New York hasn't elected a Republican governor since 2002, though Hochul won her 2022 race by a single-digit margin of\u00a0 6.4 percentage points, which spurred renewed interest among Republicans who viewed the result as a sign of potential Democratic vulnerability.",
      "\"My gut tells me this is not the right political time,\" Stefanik told New York Magazine in an interview on Friday. \"This is not the sort of array of things lining up \u2014 which is so difficult in New York, which is incredibly difficult in a picture-perfect year\u2013let alone with a primary and everything else.\"",
      "\"We viewed it as a waste of resources,\" she said, also citing family considerations. \"I have a 4-year old son, and that is a priority for our family.\"",
      "A senior House Republican official also said Stefanik was frustrated that Mr. Trump declined to endorse her early and effectively clear the field for her, a move that Stefanik allies believed could have avoided a divisive primary.",
      "Mr. Trump did call Blakeman after he entered the race, according to sources familiar with the phone call. He told the county executive that he did not like seeing \"good Republicans\" face each other in an electoral battle.",
      "Asked about the race on Dec. 10, the president repeatedly emphasized his reluctance to publicly intervene, stressing his personal relationships with both candidates and concern about collateral damage from a contested primary.",
      "\"First of all, he's a friend. She's a friend,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. \"These are two great people running. In a way, I hate to see them running against each other. I hope they're not going to be damaging each other.\"",
      "Mr. Trump went on to praise both candidates, saying, \"Elise is fantastic, and Bruce is. They're two fantastic people, and I always hate it when two very good friends of mine are running.\"",
      "Pointing to the state GOP convention, Trump said, \"I think you'll know pretty much at the end of February what's going to happen. And I'll probably have to, you know, do what I want to do.\"",
      "\"We have two very talented people. Either one should win against the Democrats,\" he added.",
      "After Stefanik announced she would end her campaign, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised her record, calling her \"an incredible advocate\" for her Upstate New York district and \"a true friend\" to Mr. Trump. Leavitt, who previously worked for Stefanik as a top adviser, added that she is \"a great leader, and an even better person.\"",
      "Stefanik, a member of House Republican leadership and one of Trump's closest allies in Congress, had been viewed by New York Republicans as a formidable contender given her national profile and fundraising strength \u2014 over $12 million raised.",
      "But she faced an uphill battle in deep-blue New York, with a recent Siena College poll showing Hochul with a double-digit lead versus both Republicans at this stage of the race.",

      "F-15 fighter jets, A-10 Thunderbolts \u2014 known as \"Warthogs\" \u2014 and Apache attack helicopters were used to target ISIS positions in Syria on Friday, U.S. officials told CBS News. F-16 fighter jets from Jordan were also involved in the operation.",
      "U.S. Central Command described the operation as a \"massive strike\" and indicated that it was retaliatory in a post on X. In a follow-up post, U.S. Central Command said it used \"more than 100 precision munitions targeting known ISIS infrastructure and weapons sites.\"",
      "President Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth attended the dignified transfer at Dover Air Force Base earlier this week for the two soldiers killed, Sgt. William Howard and Sgt. Edgar Torres Tovar, both of the Iowa National Guard, and the interpreter, Ayad Mansoor Sakat.",
      "The three individuals were killed when, according to the Pentagon, a lone ISIS gunman ambushed them while they were supporting a key leader in Palmyra, Syria. Three other members of the Iowa National Guard were wounded in the attack.",
      "Mr. Trump vowed \"very serious retaliation\" in a TruthSocial post after the attack, and Hegseth also vowed to \"avenge these fallen Americans with overwhelming force.\"",
      "Hegseth announced in a post Friday on X that U.S. forces have begun \"Operation Hawkeye Strike\" in Syria \"to eliminate ISIS fighters, infrastructure, and weapons sites in direct response to the attack on U.S. forces.\"",
      "\"Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies,\" Hegseth continued. \"Lots of them. And we will continue.\"",
      "Speaking Friday night during remarks in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, Mr. Trump said he \"ordered a massive strike on the terrorists that killed our three great patriots last week.\" The strikes were \"very successful,\" and \"we hit every site flawlessly,\" the president said.",

      "Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik said Friday she is suspending her campaign for governor of New York and will not seek reelection to Congress.",
      "In a statement, Stefanik \u2014 who had just entered the race about seven weeks ago \u2014 said in a social media post that \"while we would have overwhelmingly won this primary, it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York.\"",
      "Stefanik also indicated that the decision was made with her family in mind.",
      "\"While many know me as Congresswoman, my most important title is Mom,\" she added. \"I believe that being a parent is life's greatest gift and greatest responsibility. I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don't further focus on my young son's safety, growth, and happiness - particularly at his tender age.\"",
      "Stefanik has been a frequent critic of Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who will be running for reelection.",
      "Ryan Radulovacki, a spokesperson for Hochul, told CBS News New York in a statement that Stefanik had \"finally acknowledged reality: If you run against Governor Kathy Hochul, you are going to lose.\"",
      "Hochul had previously called Stefanik President Trump's \"number one cheerleader in Congress and his right-hand woman in his war on New York.\"",
      "State GOP chair pivots to Bruce Blakeman",
      "The bombshell announcement comes less than two weeks after fellow Republican and Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman said he intended to challenge Stefanik in the upcoming gubernatorial primary.",
      "At the time, a spokesperson for Stefanik blasted Blakeman for entering the race.",
      "\"Bruce Blakeman is an early Christmas present to Kathy Hochul as he works to blow Republicans' best chance to win,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Now, the state Republican party chair is pivoting to support Blakeman's bid.",
      "\"Elise Stefanik will remain a leader in our party and a powerful voice for our principles. We respect her decision and thank her for her efforts,\" New York GOP chair Ed Cox said in a statement. \"Bruce Blakeman has my endorsement and I urge our State Committee and party leaders to join me.\"",
      "In a statement Friday, Blakeman thanked Stefanik for her \"outstanding service\" to the people of New York and to all Americans.",
      "\"Throughout her time in public office, Congresswoman Stefanik has been a strong voice for common-sense values, national security, and economic opportunity, and her leadership has earned the respect of people across our state and our country,\" the statement said, in part. \"I wish Congresswoman Stefanik nothing but success as she pursues her priorities and continues her service to our nation.\"",
      "Stefanik had initially launched her campaign for governor in early November with an army of support, including 34 Assemblymember endorsements, 12 state senators, and former Gov. George Pataki.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 20:36:38 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department has disclosed thousands of files and photos related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, following years of pressure from lawmakers and abuse survivors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department disclosed thousands of files and photos related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, following years of pressure from lawmakers and abuse survivors for more transparency into the government's investigations into the disgraced financier.",
      "The records were released in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed last month and required the government to release virtually all Epstein-related files within 30 days.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said more files will be released \"over the next couple of weeks,\" even though the law required the documents to be disclosed by Friday. He later told lawmakers that the Justice Department needed more time to pore through the records and redact victims' names.",
      "Congressional Democrats have accused the Justice Department of failing to comply with the law, arguing the documents are too heavily redacted and should have been released in full on Friday.",
      "Where to find the Epstein files",
      "The files that were disclosed Friday under the Epstein Files Transparency Act are available on the Justice Department's website, broken into five different data sets. The total number of files is roughly 3,900, nearly all of which are PDFs.",
      "CBS News is also uploading the records to a searchable database, which is available here, though many of the files are photos, not text documents.",
      "Here are the Justice Department's records:",
      "Data Set 1Data Set 2Data Set 3Data Set 4Data Set 5",
      "Data Set 1",
      "Data Set 2",
      "Data Set 3",
      "Data Set 4",
      "Data Set 5",
      "What's in the new Epstein files?",
      "Thousands of the files are images, including photos that were seemingly taken in Epstein's mansion in Manhattan or his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Those include photos of his bedroom in New York, his risque wall art and a taxidermied tiger.",
      "Many photos show Epstein socializing with his convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Former President Bill Clinton also appears in several of the images \u2014 in some cases, the former president is posing with celebrities like Michael Jackson and Mick Jagger. A spokesperson has acknowledged that Clinton traveled with Epstein on several occasions, but says he was not aware of Epstein's crimes, and accused the Justice Department of trying to scapegoat Clinton on Friday.",
      "Some of the photos are redacted \u2014 in certain cases, they show Epstein posing with people whose faces are obscured.",
      "There are also a number of investigative documents, some of which have heavy redactions. In a few cases, documents are almost entirely redacted.",
      "Why were some of the Epstein files redacted?",
      "The law that requires the Justice Department to release the files only allows redactions under narrow circumstances, including to take out Epstein survivors' personal information, violent images or child sexual abuse material. The government is also allowed to temporarily withhold records that \"would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\"",
      "Records cannot be withheld solely because they would cause \"embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\"",
      "Some redactions in the documents released Friday appeared to omit victims' names, but the exact reasons for every redaction are unclear. The law also requires the department to give Congress a list of its redactions within 15 days.",
      "What was Epstein investigated for and charged with?",
      "The files that were released Friday are expected to stem from the litany of investigations surrounding Epstein and Maxwell, stretching back at least 20 years.",
      "Allegations about Epstein's conduct appeared to emerge on the government's radar as early as the 1990s, when survivor Maria Farmer says she reported to the FBI that Epstein had abused her. In a lawsuit, she has accused the government of failing to look into her allegations.",
      "Epstein was investigated by local police in Florida and federal prosecutors starting in the mid-2000s. That probe ended with a controversial 2007 deal in which federal prosecutors in Miami agreed not to charge him, in exchange for a guilty plea on prostitution charges in state court.",
      "More than a decade later, Epstein was charged in New York federal court with abusing and trafficking dozens of underage girls. Maxwell was charged with sex trafficking conspiracy the following year, and was convicted at trial and sentenced to 20 years in prison.",
      "Files from several other probes could be made public. The government has investigated the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019, officially ruled a suicide. And it has investigated Miami prosecutors' decision to cut a non-prosecution deal.",
      "Why the Epstein files are being released now",
      "The files are being released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Congress passed and President Trump signed into law in November. The legislation gave the attorney general 30 days to publicly release documents related to Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, the government's investigations into both and internal records about the cases.",
      "The legislation was the result of years of pressure from Epstein and Maxwell's survivors, who pushed lawmakers for more transparency about how the government handled both of their cases. Epstein's death fueled conspiracy theories about his connections to high-powered figures in government and the business world.",
      "The calls for transparency reached new heights over the summer. The Justice Department conducted a review of the Epstein files in the government's possession, and concluded that there was no \"client list\" or evidence that he had blackmailed prominent figures. The findings infuriated many of the president's supporters who had been calling for the release of the Epstein files for years, and opened the door for a bipartisan push to unveil the records.",
      "California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat, was the lead sponsor of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. He introduced the bill in July, and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky filed a discharge petition aimed at forcing a vote on the measure. The push was delayed by opposition from House Speaker Mike Johnson and the government shutdown in the fall. But in November, the petition received the final signature required to bring the bill up for a vote.",
      "It passed the House by a vote of 427 to 1 and the Senate unanimously approved it. President Trump signed it into law on Nov. 19, despite spending months pressuring Republicans to oppose it, starting the clock on the 30-day deadline.",
      "In the wake of Congress' passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, three separate judges approved Justice Department requests to unseal grand jury transcripts from investigations into Maxwell and Epstein. One of those rulings stemmed from grand jury proceedings in South Florida in 2005 and 2007. Epstein ultimately escaped federal charges there and instead agreed to plead guilty to state prostitution charges.",
      "The other two court orders came from judges in New York, where Epstein and Maxwell were charged in 2019 and 2020, respectively.",
      "When will the next group of Epstein files be released?",
      "It's unclear. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News earlier Friday that the department would release more files \"over the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "\"We are looking at every single piece of paper that we are going to produce making sure every victim \u2014 their name, their identity, their story, to the extent that it needs to be protected \u2014 is completely protected,\" Blanche said.",
      "That timeline does not comply with the law, which required the release of all eligible files by Dec. 19. The department's office of public affairs said before Friday's release that the \"initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"",
      "Blanche's comments, and the department's failure to release all of the files, angered many Democrats who have harshly criticized the administration for its handling of the documents. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, accused the Trump administration of violating the law and suggested they could take legal action.",
      "\"Donald Trump and the Department of Justice are now violating federal law as they continue covering up the facts and the evidence about Jeffrey Epstein's decades-long, billion-dollar, international sex trafficking ring,\" Raskin and Garcia said in a joint statement. \"For months, Pam Bondi has denied survivors the transparency and accountability they have demanded and deserve and has defied the Oversight Committee's subpoena. The Department of Justice is now making clear it intends to defy Congress itself, even as it gives star treatment to Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.\"",
      "Raskin and Garcia said they are \"examining all legal options\" given Blanche's earlier admission.",
      "\"The survivors of this nightmare deserve justice, the co-conspirators must be held accountable, and the American people deserve complete transparency from DOJ,\" they said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department said Friday it will appeal a pair of decisions tossing out the criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the prosecutor who secured the indictments against them, was unlawfully appointed to her role as interim U.S. attorney.",
      "The appeal was expected, as the White House and Attorney Pam Bondi had indicated that the Trump administration would ask the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to review last month's rulings from U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie. But it comes as Halligan and Justice Department lawyers have so far twice failed to secure a new indictment against James.",
      "Halligan's name is on the notices of appeal, and she is listed\u00a0as \"United States attorney and special attorney.\"",
      "Currie ruled that Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney violated federal law and the Constitution's Appointments Clause and ordered the criminal charges brought against Comey and James to be dismissed.",
      "\"I conclude that all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey's indictment, constitute unlawful exercises of executive power and must be set aside,\" Currie wrote in her\u00a0opinion in the Comey case, a line that she repeated in her\u00a0ruling in the James case.",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who was a member of President Trump's defense team in the since-ended criminal case stemming from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents. She was tapped by Attorney General Pam Bondi to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in eastern Virginia in September.",
      "Soon after Halligan temporarily took the helm of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, she secured indictments against Comey and James. Comey was charged with two counts stemming from testimony he gave to Congress in September 2020 and pleaded not guilty. He was indicted just days before the statute of limitations for the offenses was set to expire.",
      "James faced charges of bank fraud and pleaded not guilty.",
      "Since Currie ordered the cases against Comey and James to be tossed out, Halligan has attempted to secure a new indictment against James. But grand juries in Norfolk and Alexandria, Virginia, have each\u00a0separately refused to indict James again.",
      "It's unclear whether Halligan has sought to re-indict Comey, though Currie suggested in her November decision that prosecutors could not seek a new indictment in his case because the statute of limitations expired at the end of September. Additionally, a separate federal judge in Washington, D.C., blocked the Justice Department from accessing material it seized from one of Comey's friends more than five years ago, which Halligan had relied on when she presented the case against Comey to a grand jury in September.",
      "Comey and James had also moved to have the criminal charges against them tossed out on the grounds that their respective prosecutions were vindictive and selective. Judges overseeing their cases had not yet ruled on those bids, however, when their cases were dismissed.",

    "summary": "Nine drug manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts in exchange for tariff exemptions.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday announced new agreements with nine pharmaceutical manufacturers aimed at reducing certain prescription drug prices.",
      "\"Starting next year, American drug prices will come down fast and furious and will soon be the lowest in the developed world,\" Mr.\u00a0 Trump said Friday at the White House.",
      "Under the deal, the nine manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts, a policy that requires the prices to match those paid by patients in other developed nations. The nine companies will also offer medicines \"at a deep discount off the list price\" to Americans through TrumpRx, according to the White House. The Trump administration plans to offer tariff exemptions to the drugmakers for three years in exchange for the MFN pricing commitments.",
      "According to a White House fact sheet, the drugs that will be covered include treatments for chronic conditions, including type two diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus and certain cancers.",
      "Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Genentech, Gilead Science, GSK, Merck, Novartis, and Sanofi will sell drugs on TrumpRx, the administration's discount drug pricing program. TrumpRx \u2014 which the administration has said will launch early next year \u2014 will not sell drugs directly, but instead will direct consumers to lower prices elsewhere.",
      "Senior administration officials said that roughly 30-40% of Medicaid drug prices are currently higher than what patients in other wealthy nations pay, mostly Europeans, and that the prices of those drugs will drop.",
      "The president has previously announced agreements with AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer. The White House said it has made MFN deals with 14 of the 17 biggest drug manufacturers in the world. The three drugmakers that were not part of the announcement are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron, but the president said that deals involving the remaining three could be announced at another time.",
      "\"[The policy] affects every American so that they have the dignity to access the same medical innovations that our tax dollars helped develop,\" a White House official said. \"This is about healthcare fairness.\"",
      "But questions remain about how the president's deals with drugmakers will work \u2014 and who will feel the difference at the pharmacy counter. Most-favored-nation pricing could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, experts say, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "Medicaid recipients are \"starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out to CBS News after the president announced the Pfizer deal.",
      "The White House said the new agreement represents more than $150 billion in new investment commitments in manufacturing and research and development in the U.S.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The latest deluge of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, released by the Justice Department, adds to a huge trove of documents and photos that have already been made public.",
    "story": [
      "As the public begins to sort through the deluge of files related to Jeffrey Epstein released by the Department of Justice on Friday, some of the material might seem familiar.",
      "That's because there's been a steady stream of material made public from various investigations into the deceased sex offender during the last year, some of which undoubtedly overlaps with the voluminous Justice Department release mandated by federal legislation passed in November.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act gave Attorney General Pam Bondi until Dec. 19 to make public all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials in possession of the Justice Department, the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices (with some personal information redacted to protect victims).",
      "Some of that material \u2014 tens of thousands of pages \u2014 has already been released by a House committee that subpoenaed the Justice Department and Epstein's estate. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have indicated they're still expecting even more documents to be produced by Epstein's estate in the future, as well as material from banking institutions he did business with. They've pledged to release more documents as they come in.",
      "Among other things, the documents released so far include emails and text messages showing that Epstein continued to court the rich and famous right up until his 2019 arrest.",
      "Here is an overview of documents already disclosed to the public:",
      "Dec. 18, 2025:\u00a0Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a batch of 68 photos from a trove of about 95,000 the committee obtained from Epstein's estate. Among them were photos of passages from \"Lolita\" written on a woman's body; a picture of a Ukrainian passport, with details blacked out; and text messages about 18-year-old from Russia.",
      "Dec. 12, 2025: Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released another selection of photos from Epstein's estate.The photos include snapshots of prominent figures like President Trump, former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, filmmaker Woody Allen and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The photos do not implicate any of those pictured in Epstein's crimes.",
      "Dec. 4, 2025: Democrats on the Oversight Committee released 73 photos and four videos of Epstein's estate on the 72-acre island known as Little St. James that he owned in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Epstein allegedly exploited underage girls for sex at the island, and he had stakes in businesses in the U.S. territory.",
      "Nov. 12, 2025: The House Oversight Committee released 20,000 records from Epstein's estate, including scores of emails. The disgraced financier often referenced Mr. Trump, writing of the president at one point: \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.\" Other messages showed him bantering with influential Harvard professor and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and attempting to reconnect with Bill Gates. None of those men have been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Oct. 30, 2025: Buckingham Palace announced that it was stripping the king's younger brother of his titles, relegating Prince Andrew to his civilian name, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. The announcement came weeks after news outlets in the United Kingdom revealed a 2011 email in which Andrew told Epstein, \"we are in this together.\" The former prince has been accused of sexually assaulting a young Virginia Giuffre, who said she was trafficked by Epstein; Andrew settled Giuffre's lawsuit but denied wrongdoing.",
      "Sept. 8, 2025: House Oversight released a tranche from Epstein's estate, including a 2003 birthday note to Epstein that appeared to be signed by Mr. Trump. The letter, written inside a drawing of what appears to be the form of a woman, ends with, \"A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday \u2014 and may every day be another wonderful secret. Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "The president denied penning the message, and Republicans accused Democrats of cherry-picking documents.",
      "Sept. 2, 2025: The panel released more than 33,000 pages of files from the Justice Department, including court documents, flight records, and a video of Epstein's cell block from before his death that includes a minute missing from earlier videos. Many of the documents were already in the public domain. Democratic lawmakers said just 3% of the pages were new. Those disclosures included logs of flights on Epstein's plane from 2000 to 2014 that were kept by Customs and Border Protection, according to Democrats.",
      "Aug. 22, 2025: The Justice Department released a transcript and audio recording of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's interview with convicted Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for involvement in trafficking. Maxwell said Mr. Trump \"was always very cordial and very kind to me.\" She said Mr. Trump and Epstein \"seemed friendly,\" but she \"only ever saw them in social settings.\" She said she \"never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way.\"",
      "Feb. 27, 2025: The White House gave a group of 15 conservative influencers binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" Several influencers said the binders contained little new info.",
      "Prior to 2025: Other documents, including contacts, schedules, flight logs and depositions, were made public previously, often as part of Epstein and Maxwell's criminal cases and in connection with civil lawsuits filed by survivors.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Kennedy Center's Board of Trustees voted to rename the performing arts institution the Trump-Kennedy Center, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.",
      "\"I have just been informed that the highly respected Board of the Kennedy Center, some of the most successful people from all parts of the world, have just voted unanimously to rename the Kennedy Center to the Trump-Kennedy Center, because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building. Not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation,\" Leavitt wrote on X.",
      "Roma Daravi, the Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, confirmed the vote by the board to name the performing arts institution The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.",
      "\"The unanimous vote recognizes that the current Chairman saved the institution from financial ruin and physical destruction,\" Daravi said in a statement. \"The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America's cultural center for generations to come.\"",

He removed Democratic-appointed members of its board and installed his allies and administration officials to the panel. The board also consists of local and federal officials, as well as members of the House and Senate from both parties. Trustees serve six-year terms.",
      "Richard Grenell, who worked in the first Trump administration, serves as the Kennedy Center's president. The board in February selected Mr. Trump to serve as its chairman.",
      "Among the members appointed by the president are White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and second lady Usha Vance.",

      "\"We're saving the building. We saved the building,\" he said. \"Now it's very solid, very strong.\"",
      "Rep. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat who serves on the Board of Trustees, disputed that the vote to rename the Kennedy Center was unanimous, as Leavitt said. She wrote on X\u00a0that she \"was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this move. Also for the record, this was not on the agenda.\"",
      "\"Clearly the Congress has a say in this,\" she said in a video shared to X. \"This center, The Kennedy Center, was created by the Congress. I think it's important for us to know that this is just another attempt to evade the law and not let the people have a say.\"",
      "Kennedy's niece, Maria Shriver, blasted the move in a lengthy social media post, writing that it was \"beyond comprehension that this sitting president has sought to rename this great memorial dedicated to President Kennedy. It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy's name is acceptable. It is not.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move.",
      "\"Beyond using the Kennedy Center to reward his friends and political allies, President Trump is now attempting to affix his name to yet another public institution without legal authority,\" Schumer and several other Democrats who serve as ex officio board members said in a statement. \"This whole process displays the corruption that permeates the entire Trump Administration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had pledged to make \"a lot of changes\" to the Kennedy Center, \"including the seats, the decor, pretty much everything.\"",
      "The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was established by Congress as the national center for performing arts and a living memorial to the late President John F.

The Kennedy Center Honors, which Mr. Trump hosted, will\u00a0air on CBS television stations and\u00a0Paramount+\u00a0on Tuesday.",
      "The law establishing the Kennedy Center restricts \"additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials\" to be designated or installed.",

    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors unveiled charges Thursday against another six people, accusing them of defrauding public assistance programs in Minnesota \u2014 including two men they allege traveled to the state for that express purpose.",
      "The latest indictments add fuel to a scandal that has now led to charges against\u00a0more than 90 people who have been accused, and in many cases convicted, of bilking hundreds of millions of dollars from the Midwestern state, putting Gov. Tim Walz's administration in the hot seat and drawing attacks from President Trump.",
      "Thursday's charges focus on housing assistance and autism services. And the pandemic-era food aid fraud case that set off the scandal is still brewing.",
      "Minnesota is far from the only state that has grappled with allegations of public assistance fraud, especially scams targeting pandemic aid funds. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said Minnesota faces a particularly large problem, pointing to 14 different Medicaid programs that the state has flagged for \"significant fraud problems.\" He suggested total losses could reach into the billions.",
      "\"The fraud is not small. It isn't isolated. The magnitude cannot be overstated,\" Thompson said at a press conference Thursday. \"What we see in Minnesota is not a handful of bad actors committing crimes. It's a staggering, industrial-scale fraud.\"",
      "Walz, whose administration has faced scrutiny for its handling of the issue, has vowed to crack down. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has sharply criticized Minnesota \u2014 and he's lashed out at the state's large Somali-American community as most, but not all, of the defendants are of Somali descent.",
      "Here's what to know about the new charges and the wider scandal:",
      "Pennsylvania natives accused of \"fraud tourism\" in housing program",
      "An alleged fraud scheme involving a now-defunct housing stabilization program in Minnesota expanded Thursday, as federal prosecutors charged five new people with wire fraud \u2014 including two Philadelphia men who allegedly traveled from halfway across the country because they heard the state programs presented \"a good opportunity to make money.\"",
      "The program in question was launched in 2020 to help seniors and people with disabilities find, apply for, move into and stay in housing. Offered as a benefit in Minnesota's Medicaid plan, it was recognized at the time as the nation's first program of its kind. State officials shut it down earlier this year, however, after finding \"large-scale fraud.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors have said in the past that the program was vulnerable to fraud because of its \"low barriers to entry\" and light recordkeeping rules.",
      "In court papers, prosecutors claim the two Pennsylvanians signed up as providers for the program despite no clear ties to the state. The two men allegedly submitted some $3.5 million in claims, often sending in \"fake and inflated bills,\" the indictment alleges.",
      "Thompson said the state \"has become a magnet for fraud, so much so that we have developed a fraud tourism industry.\"",
      "A third defendant was charged with fraudulently claiming $1.4 million. Prosecutors say he flew to Amsterdam shortly after he was subpoenaed by federal authorities last month, and he has not returned to the U.S. since then. And two other new defendants were accused of submitting around $750,000 in fraudulent claims for the program.",
      "The Justice Department charged eight other people with allegedly defrauding the same program in September. Six of those defendants have pleaded not guilty, and two pleaded guilty.",
      "New charges in alleged autism services fraud scheme",
      "Charges were also unsealed Thursday in an alleged fraud scheme that hit a second state program, one that provides services to children with autism.",
      "Prosecutors allege that the new defendant in this case raked in millions from Medicaid reimbursements, many of which were inflated or for services that weren't provided.",
      "In court papers, the Justice Department alleged the defendant's company claimed to offer one-on-one behavioral therapy to children with autism, but actually employed \"unqualified\" 18- and 19-year-olds. He allegedly recruited parents within Minnesota's Somali community to sign up for the program, helped to get their kids qualified for autism services and, in some cases, paid kickbacks to the parents.",
      "Federal officials charged a different person with defrauding Minnesota's autism program in September, leveling similar allegations. That defendant pleaded guilty on Thursday.",
      "As with the housing stabilization program, claims in the autism program have grown rapidly in recent years, according to court papers unsealed by the government on Thursday.",
      "CBS News has reached out to attorneys for the six defendants who were charged Thursday for comment.",
      "Feds tease another possible fraud case",
      "The Justice Department unsealed a search warrant Thursday for a Minnesota business that participated in yet another state Medicaid-funded program, which offers health and safety assistance at home for adults with disabilities.",
      "The business and its owners have not been criminally charged. CBS News has reached out to the business for comment.",
      "In an affidavit attached to the search warrant, an FBI agent claimed there was a \"massive scheme to defraud\" the state's Integrated Community Supports program, which he said has faced an \"explosion in fly-by-night operators\" since it was created in 2021. State officials flagged similar concerns about the program earlier this year, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported.",
      "Thompson said Thursday that instead of giving day-to-day help to clients, some providers \"simply obtained apartments or condos \u2026 and then just put them in there and started billing,\" sometimes to the tune of hundreds of dollars a day.",
      "Scandal started with Feeding Our Future fraud case",
      "The largest known COVID-era fraud scheme \u2014 and the first one to fall into the federal government's crosshairs \u2014 targeted programs that offered food to needy children.",
      "The Minnesota-based nonprofit Feeding Our Future was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program by falsely claiming to distribute millions of meals during the pandemic. More than 75 people have been charged; at least 56 have pleaded guilty and seven have been convicted, including the group's leader. Prosecutors have put the losses at almost $250 million.",
      "Here's how prosecutors allege\u00a0it worked: Feeding Our Future recruited hundreds of local groups and businesses to run distribution sites and submitted reimbursement claims for the meals. The Minnesota Department of Education then paid out the claims using federal dollars. But many of those claims were falsified, with phony invoices and attendance rosters filled with fake children's names.",
      "Feeding Our Future collected millions in administrative fees and raked in kickbacks from the operators of its local sites, according to an indictment against founder Aimee Bock, who was convicted this year of wire fraud and several other charges. Dozens of site operators who worked with Feeding Our Future or other sponsors have also been charged, many of whom have been convicted or pleaded guilty.",
      "Bock has long denied any wrongdoing. Her attorney has said she plans to appeal.",
      "Some of the defendants who ran distribution sites spent the taxpayer money on lavish personal expenses like lakefront property, luxury cars, jewelry, first-class plane tickets and a rented private villa in the Maldives, according to documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "The scheme was part of a wave of pandemic fraud nationwide. Prosecutors say the Feeding Our Future defendants took advantage of a COVID-era expansion of the child nutrition program.",
      "State auditors have faulted the Minnesota Department of Education for its handling of the situation, too. Minnesota's Office of Legislative Auditor said last year the state agency \"created opportunities for fraud\" by missing warning signs and failing to address complaints.",
      "The report also claimed the agency was stymied by Feeding Our Future's history of accusing the state of racial discrimination when officials started taking a closer look at the group. The organization's founder is White, but most of those charged in the scheme are of Somali descent, and the group said in a 2020 lawsuit against the state that it primarily served minority communities.",
      "State officials spotted early signs of fraud before the COVID-19 pandemic began, but faced pressure from Feeding Our Future to stop asking questions, CBS News previously reported. An attorney for Bock denied that she pressured state officials.",
      "Trump weighs in \u2014 and links it to Somalia",
      "Mr. Trump has ripped Minnesota over the controversy, calling the state a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\" and claiming Somali immigrants have \"ripped off that state.\"",
      "He has lashed out at Somali people in often-incendiary terms, calling them \"garbage\" and claiming they \"contribute nothing.\" Frequent targets of his ire include Walz and Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who was born in Somalia and came to the U.S. as a teenager.",
      "Walz and Omar, in turn, have denounced the president for his rhetoric, which the governor called \"vile, racist lies and slander towards our fellow Minnesotans.\"",
      "Roughly 76,000 people of Somali descent lived in Minnesota last year, 52% of whom were born in the U.S. and 42% of whom were naturalized citizens, according to Census Bureau data.",
      "Immigration authorities launched a crackdown in early December in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, and Mr. Trump has said he will revoke deportation protections for potentially hundreds of Somali migrants in Minnesota.",
      "The fraud scandal itself has also drawn attention from the Trump administration. The U.S. Treasury says it is investigating whether Minnesota tax money went to the Somali terror group al Shabaab, following allegations in the conservative magazine City Journal. But multiple federal investigators told CBS News Minnesota's Jonah Kaplan that there is no evidence taxpayer dollars were funneled to al Shabaab.",
      "\"The vast majority of the money that these folks made went to spending on luxury items for themselves,\" said Andy Luger, the former U.S. attorney who led the office which prosecuted these frauds from 2022 until January. \"There was never any evidence that this money went to fund terrorism nor was there any evidence that was the intent of the 70 people we indicted.\"",
      "A 2019 report by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor said it was \"unable to substantiate\" allegations that funding from one program was going to terrorist groups, though the report didn't rule it out, saying it's \"possible\" that state funds may have found their way to terrorists.",
      "Walz's handling of fraud scandal under scrutiny",
      "Republicans at the state and national level have criticized Walz for years, accusing him and other state officials of being slow to act on warning signs of fraud. Walz has led Minnesota since 2019, but he gained national prominence after serving as the Democratic nominee for vice president last year.",
      "Earlier this month, the GOP-led House Oversight Committee opened an investigation into alleged fraud in Minnesota state programs, requesting documents from Walz.",
      "Walz has long defended the state's handling of the situation. He said in 2022 that officials caught the Feeding Our Future scheme early on, but couldn't take further action due to an order from a judge and a request from the FBI not to do anything that could harm its investigation.",
      "The governor said last week that he will \"take responsibility\" for the mistakes that led to theft of taxpayer dollars. But he added that the \"guardrails were taken off\" by the federal government during the pandemic, and \"the guidance was to move the money.\"",
      "Walz launched a new fraud prevention program on Dec. 12, led by a former FBI agent. He applauded the new federal charges on Thursday.",
      "\"This is exactly the type of strong action we need from prosecutors to ensure fraudsters are put behind bars,\" Walz said in a statement. \"We will not tolerate fraud, and we will continue to work with federal partners to ensure fraud is stopped and fraudsters are caught.\"",
      "James Clark, inspector general of the Minnesota Department of Human Services, said in a statement Thursday the agency \"has been moving more aggressively than ever to suspend payments where we see evidence of fraud.\" He also urged federal officials to share information with the agency, which oversees many of the programs that were hit by fraud allegations.",
      "\"If there is evidence of Medicaid fraud, the state should be given the information so DHS can slam the door shut on payments to those individuals and businesses,\" Clark said.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 10:40:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem says the Trump administration will pause the diversity visa lottery program, which she said was used by Brown University shooting suspect Claudio Manuel Neves Valente.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced late Thursday that the Trump administration will pause the diversity visa lottery program, which she said was used eight years ago by the now-deceased man accused of killing two Brown University students and an MIT professor.",
      "\"This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,\" Noem said on X. \"At President Trump's direction, I am immediately directing USCIS to pause the DV1 program to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.\"",
      "Noem said the suspected shooter, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, entered the United States through the program in 2017 and was issued a green card.",
      "What is the diversity visa program?",
      "Launched in the 1990s, the program offers 50,000 visas per year to people from countries with relatively low rates of immigration to the U.S., with recipients selected at random using a lottery. Every year, tens of millions of people vie for visas through the program.",
      "In order to qualify for a diversity visa, applicants must have at least a high school education or two years of work experience in a field that requires training. They are also required to undergo vetting and an interview before getting a visa.",
      "The program was created by Congress, and it's not clear under what legal mechanism Noem can order a pause. Most visas issued through the lottery are overseen by the State Department, though a small number are processed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \u2014 which is part of DHS \u2014 for applicants already in the U.S.",
      "Criticism from Trump administration",
      "President Trump is a longstanding critic of the diversity visa lottery program, arguing it could pose security risks and isn't sufficiently merit-based, like employment-based visas. He pushed to end it early in his first term, after a man who had received a diversity visa killed eight people in a truck-ramming attack in New York City. Supporters of the visas say recipients are vetted and argue the program is good for the U.S. economy and the country's image abroad.",
      "The first Trump administration suspended the program in 2020, part of a\u00a0broader set of restrictions\u00a0on legal immigration that cited the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Former President Joe Biden\u00a0reversed that policy\u00a0in 2021.",
      "Shooting suspect in the U.S.",
      "Neves Valente, 48, was a Portuguese national whose last known residence was in Miami, officials said in a press conference late Thursday.",
      "More than a decade before getting a diversity visa, Neves Valente was admitted to the U.S. on a student visa in 2000 to attend graduate school at Brown University, according to a local police affidavit that was attached to his arrest warrant. Brown's president says he studied at the Ivy League school for a few months starting in the fall of 2000, but he took a leave of absence in the spring of 2001 and formally withdrew two years later.",
      "Authorities said Neves Valente was found dead by suicide in a storage unit in New Hampshire late Thursday, ending a days-long investigation following a shooting at Brown that killed two students and wounded nine over the weekend. Authorities say he is also believed to be responsible for the deadly shooting of an MIT professor in suburban Boston two days after the shooting at Brown.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 10:37:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Jack Smith, who oversaw two investigations into President Trump, appeared before the House Judiciary Committee for a closed-door deposition Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawyers for former special counsel Jack Smith reiterated their call for Smith to appear publicly before lawmakers to answer questions about his investigations into President Trump after he testified privately earlier in the week.",
      "Smith appeared before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday for a closed-door deposition and answered questions for roughly nine hours, his lawyers, Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski, said in a letter to the panel's chairman, Jim Jordan, that was obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"Mr. Smith welcomed this opportunity and hopes that it will serve to correct the many mischaracterizations about the work of the Special Counsel's Office,\" they wrote in the letter, dated Thursday.",
      "Breuer and Koski urged Jordan, an Ohio Republican, to promptly release the full videotape of the deposition and said \"doing so will ensure that the American people can hear the facts directly from Mr. Smith, rather than through second-hand accounts.\" Koski and Breuer also reiterated their request for Smith to address lawmakers in an \"open and public hearing.\"",
      "\"During the investigation of President Trump, Mr. Smith steadfastly followed Justice Department policies, observed all legal requirements, and took actions based on the facts and the law. He stands by his decisions,\" they wrote to Jordan.",
      "Politico first reported the letter from Smith's lawyers to Jordan. Two former special counsels, Robert Mueller and Robert Hur, have each testified in open forums about their respective investigations. Mueller\u00a0examined Russian interference\u00a0in the 2016 election, and Hur\u00a0probed former President Joe Biden's handling\u00a0of sensitive government documents.",
      "Smith was tapped as special counsel during the Biden administration to take over the Justice Department's investigations into Mr. Trump's alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents and his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Mr. Trump faced a total of more than 40 charges in both of those cases, though they ended after he won a second term in the White House.",
      "Now, with Republicans in control of Congress, they have begun investigating the prosecutions. Smith had offered in October to voluntarily answer questions in an open hearing before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, but Jordan issued a subpoena to the former special counsel demanding Smith's testimony at a closed-door deposition.",
      "In his opening statement to lawmakers, which was obtained by CBS News, Smith defended the prosecutions of Mr. TRump and said he made decisions \"without regard to President Trump's political association, activities, beliefs, or candidacy in the 2024 presidential election.\"",
      "He said his investigation into Mr. Trump's alleged efforts to hold onto power after the 2020 election developed \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the president engaged in a scheme to overturn the results of the last presidential contest. As to the case involving the president's handling of documents marked classified, Smith told lawmakers that his investigation \"developed powerful evidence that showed President Trump willfully retained highly classified documents after he left office in January 2021, storing them at his social club, including in a bathroom and a ballroom where events and gatherings took place.\"",
      "Smith also defended investigative steps taken by his team, which included obtaining phone records of nine sitting GOP members of Congress as part of his probe related to the 2020 election. The data was for several days during the week of Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Mr. Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol building in an effort to keep Congress from certifying the election results.",
      "The former special counsel said the records were \"lawfully subpoenaed\" and relevant to his investigation.",
      "\"January 6 was an attack on the structure of our democracy in which over 100 heroic law enforcement officers were assaulted. Over 160 individuals later pled guilty to assaulting police officers that day,\" Smith told the Judiciary Committee. \"Exploiting that violence, President Trump and his associates tried to call Members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election. I didn't choose those Members; President Trump did.\"",
      "On his first day back in the White House, the president issued sweeping pardons to roughly 1,500 defendants who had been convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6 attack.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-vaccine-memo-uproar/",
    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 05:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A memo from Dr. Vinay Prasad\u200b, the head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, may signal an effort to to rewrite the rules governing the U.S. vaccine system.",
    "story": [
      "Six days after a senior FDA official sent a sweeping internal email claiming that COVID vaccines had caused the deaths of \"at least 10 children,\" 12 former FDA commissioners released an extraordinary warning in the Dec. 3 New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "They wrote that the claims and policy changes in the memo from Dr. Vinay Prasad, the head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, pose \"a threat to evidence-based vaccine policy and public health security\" and break sharply from long-standing scientific norms.",
      "What is unfolding inside the Food and Drug Administration is not a narrow dispute over COVID vaccines. It is an attempt, according to critics and vaccine scientists, to rewrite the rules governing the entire U.S. vaccine system \u2014 how risks are weighed, how benefits are proved, and how quickly lifesaving shots reach the public. Former agency leaders warn that if these changes take hold, the consequences could be lasting: fewer vaccines, slower updates, weakened public trust, and more preventable outbreaks.",
      "Prasad made clear he sees the moment as corrective. \"Never again will the US FDA commissioner have to himself find deaths in children for staff to identify it,\" he wrote, telling employees the agency's mission, and its \"worldview,\" would change.",
      "Prasad's email reopened old arguments about COVID vaccines, using what is generally considered weak and misleading science in the peer-reviewed research community. He claimed that FDA staff had found \"at least 10\" deaths in children that happened \"after and because of\" COVID vaccination, using reports from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.",
      "The VAERS system is notoriously crowdsourced, meaning anyone can contribute, and scientists say it serves only as a clearinghouse for reports. For example, a person could file a report saying that after getting a flu shot, their hair turned purple. Though that report would remain in the database until it was reviewed, it cannot prove the cause of medical events. But Prasad argued that the true number of deaths was likely higher because many cases go unreported.",
      "On Substack, Inside Medicine reported Dec. 11 that Prasad used incomplete information and that a Dec. 5 internal FDA memo set the pediatric death toll from COVID shots somewhere between zero and seven. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard wrote, \"The FDA's investigation into deaths caused by Covid vaccines is still ongoing and there's no final count yet of those deaths.\"",
      "Prasad also accused the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of downplaying the risk of heart inflammation, called myocarditis, in young men; criticized the agency for approving shots for teenagers; and suggested that school and workplace vaccine mandates may have \"harmed more children than we saved,\" adding that \"we do not know if we saved lives on balance.\"",
      "By comparison, more than 2,100 American children died of COVID itself since the pandemic began, the CDC reported.",
      "Based on his erroneous and misleading claims about COVID vaccines, Prasad proposed a major overhaul of how vaccines are approved. He said the FDA should stop relying on immune markers to establish the efficacy of shots, such as antibody levels, and instead require large placebo-controlled randomized trials that track hospitalizations and deaths before approving most new vaccines.",
      "Many immunologists and vaccine experts say it's unethical to test vaccines known to be effective against disease with a control group that would receive a placebo, exposing them to infection.",
      "\"There is a rock-solid principle in bioethics that it is unethical to test any drug or vaccine against a placebo if it is known to be safe and effective. The reason is that such placebo-controlled trials would effectively deny patients access to a vaccine that could prevent a dangerous infectious disease,\" said Dr. Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University.",
      "Prasad called the current flu vaccine system an \"evidence-based catastrophe,\" questioned the approval of vaccines for pregnant women based on immune response alone, and raised concerns about giving multiple vaccines at once. He told staff to rewrite FDA guidelines to match his new \"worldview\" and said anyone who disagreed with his \"core principles\" should resign.",
      "The former FDA leaders expressed alarm in the NEJM article. They said Prasad is exploiting public frustration over the federal response to COVID to spark doubt about the entire childhood vaccine system, which could undo decades of success in protecting children from deadly diseases.",
      "\"This is really different. And it's really dangerous. And people will be hurt, particularly by the vaccine decisions,\" former FDA commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in an interview. He also warned that Prasad's proposed policies \u2014 which he noted echo positions on vaccines held by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist \u2014 could shake the entire vaccine market.",
      "\"The goal of RFK seems to be to make it impossible for vaccines to be available in the U.S.,\" he said. If the proposals advance, he added,\"it won't be a viable business.\"",
      "Hilliard pushed back sharply on those concerns, writing: \"The American people deserve evidence-based science. Dr. Prasad's email lays out a philosophical framework that points us toward that higher standard. We will soon release documents laying out that framework and data confirming how the COVID vaccine resulted in children's deaths that previous leadership failed to properly investigate.\"",
      "For generations, the childhood vaccine program has depended on clear rules, strong safety systems, and public trust. Experts say Prasad's ideas, based on claims they argue are not supported by real evidence, could make it much harder to test, approve, and deliver vaccines to families.",
      "Fueling parental doubt",
      "Prasad's memo indicates he considers VAERS reports as proof that vaccines caused children's deaths. The system, though, is designed to be only an \"early warning system\" for potential safety issues with vaccines that can be investigated further.",
      "\"VAERS signals should never be taken as proof of true vaccine risks without careful, confirmatory studies,\" said Dr. Katherine Yih, an epidemiologist and longtime investigator with the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a CDC program.",
      "Doing so, scientists say, directly feeds public fear at a time when many parents are already unsure whom to trust.",
      "\"Causation requires converging evidence, not just one report or coincidence,\" said Dr. Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.",
      "Prasad's framework, however, treats uncertainty as a reason to halt development entirely.",
      "Experts fear this doubt won't stay limited to COVID vaccines. Once parents start to question the FDA's honesty, they may begin doubting long-standing vaccines for measles, polio, or whooping cough \u2014 shots that have protected children for decades.",
      "\"Science must be transparent,\" Gostin said. If families believe the FDA is misusing data or silencing experts, confidence in the entire vaccine system can collapse, he said. \"There's a public narrative that people have lost trust in science, but that's not true. The vast majority want the FDA to make decisions based on the best scientific evidence. Once they believe that the agency is marginalizing scientists and cherry-picking evidence, their trust will plummet.\"",
      "Delicate vaccine pipeline",
      "Prasad's new framework will likely make it far harder for companies to produce or update vaccines. The 12 former FDA commissioners warned that requiring clinical trials for all new or updated shots would slow vaccine improvements and leave people unprotected. His plan, they wrote, \"would impede the ability to update vaccines in a timely fashion, especially for respiratory viruses.\"",
      "For fast-changing viruses like flu and COVID, this could be disastrous. There's simply not enough time to run full clinical trials every time a virus mutates.",
      "There are also major business effects. Vaccine development is costly, and companies may decide the U.S. is no longer worth the risk. If companies slow down or leave the market, families could face shortages, fewer innovations, and fewer protections for their kids.",
      "Rising fear, falling standards, and under strain",
      "Science depends on open and public debate. Prasad's memo warned his employees against it. In addition to demanding that FDA staff members who disagree with him resign, he said their disputes should stay private and called leaks \"unethical\" and \"illegal.\"",
      "Susan Ellenberg, a former director of the FDA's Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, warned that Prasad risks destroying the process that makes science credible. \"If disagreement is treated as disloyalty, you lose the only mechanism that keeps science honest,\" she said.",
      "Without strong internal debate, safety reviews become weaker. \"You lose the checks and balances that make vaccine safety science credible,\" said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who served on the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Network during the COVID pandemic.",

      "Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was acquitted on a count of concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor.",
      "Dugan was arrested in April and pleaded not guilty to both charges. She attempted multiple times to dismiss the case against her on the grounds that she was acting within the scope of her official duties as a state court judge and therefore was entitled to judicial immunity, but those attempts were denied.",

That order is colloquially known as the \"travel ban.\"",
      "It was one of several immigration restrictions the administration announced in the wake of the Thanksgiving week shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., an attack allegedly carried out by an Afghan national. The administration also suspended all decisions for asylum cases handled by USCIS and the processing of all immigration and visa requests by Afghans.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump expanded that \"travel ban\" proclamation to include 20 additional nations, fully barring immigrants and travelers from 5 new countries and partially restricting the entry of people from another 15 nations.",

It will also impact those hailing from Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The last set of countries face partial restrictions under the latest proclamation.",
      "Previously, the suspension of immigration cases applied to nationals of Afghanistan, Burundi, Chad, Cuba, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Laos, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Yemen and Venezuela. In his latest proclamation, Mr. Trump imposed a full entry ban on citizens of Laos and Sierra Leone, which previously faced partial restrictions.",
      "In a statement posed on social media late Thursday, USCIS Director Joseph Edlow appeared to reference the expansion.",
      "\"USCIS is conducting a comprehensive review of anyone from anywhere who poses a threat to the U.S., including those identified in the President's latest proclamation to restore law and order in our nation's immigration system,\" Edlow wrote.",
      "Taken together, Mr. Trump's latest \"travel ban\" decree affects nationals of over 60% of the countries in Africa and roughly 20% of all nations across the globe.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to reschedule marijuana to a lower drug classification, one of the most significant changes to drug policy in decades.",
      "\"Today I'm pleased to announce that I will be signing an executive order to reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III controlled substance, with legitimate medical uses,\" Mr. Trump said in a ceremony in the Oval Office on Thursday, flanked by medical professionals. \"We have people begging for me to do this. People who are in great pain.\"",
      "He added: \"I think I probably have received more phone calls on this, on doing what we're doing \u2014 I don't think I received any calls on the other side of it.\"",

      "The DEA uses Schedule III for substances \"with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.\" Other Schedule III drugs include Tylenol with codeine, testosterone, anabolic steroids and ketamine.",
      "\"For decades, this action has been requested by American patients suffering from extreme pain, incurable diseases, aggressive cancers, seizure disorders, neurological problems and more,\" the president said.",
      "Moving the drug to a lower schedule does not change the fact that it remains illegal for recreational use at the federal level. But it could open the door to more research into marijuana and expanded medical uses. It might also lower the tax burden for state-licensed marijuana dispensaries in the dozens of states that have legalized the drug, since federal law bars businesses that sell Schedule I substances from taking some tax deductions.",
      "\"Rescheduling will help accelerate research, reduce stigma, attract new investment, and ease some of the tax burdens that have held the industry back. The next transformation will happen when interstate commerce barriers between states are removed,\" said Vince C. Ning, the co-CEO and co-founder of cannabis wholesale platform Nabis.",
      "\"We will have answers very soon. This will allow us to study this issue and to answer these questions for the American people,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the White House.",
      "The president said during his campaign last year that he believes marijuana should instead be a Schedule III drug.",
      "The Biden-era Department of Health and Human Services also recommended bumping marijuana down to Schedule III. The Justice Department, the DEA's parent agency, proposed a rule to reschedule marijuana last year, but the process became mired in over a year of legal and administrative wrangling, leaving the drug in Schedule I status.",
      "Marijuana has been deemed a Schedule I drug since the classification system was created in 1970. In recent years, however, most states have approved the drug for certain medical uses, and 24 states have legalized the drug recreationally. These state policies technically clash with federal law, but the federal government has opted against cracking down on cannabis businesses that are licensed by states.",
      "Some members of both parties have backed looser federal marijuana regulations, often pointing to potential medical benefits \u2014 and polling that shows Americans are increasingly supportive of legalizing medical or recreational uses of the drug.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Mr. Trump said he planned to vote yes on an unsuccessful Florida ballot measure to legalize marijuana recreationally in the state. The measure drew just under 56% of the vote, falling short of the 60% needed to pass.",
      "\"I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use. We must also implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults, to safe, tested product,\" the president wrote on Truth Social last year.",
      "But some lawmakers remain wary. A group of 22 Republican senators wrote an open letter to Mr. Trump on Wednesday urging him to leave marijuana in the Schedule I category, pointing to health concerns along with worries about intoxicated driving and worker absenteeism.",
      "\"We cannot reindustrialize America if we encourage marijuana use,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In light of the documented dangers of marijuana, facilitating the growth of the marijuana industry is at odds with growing our economy and encouraging healthy lifestyles for Americans.\"",
      "A group of nine House Republicans penned a letter over the summer urging Attorney General Pam Bondi not to shift marijuana to a lower schedule, arguing \"there is no adequate science or data\" to support the change.",
      "\"Marijuana, while different than heroin, still has the potential for abuse and has no scientifically proven medical value,\" the letter states. \"Therefore, rescheduling marijuana would not only be objectively wrong, but it would also imply to our children that marijuana is safe. That couldn't be further from the truth.\"",

    "summary": "TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok has signed a deal to sell its U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Axios was first to report the deal.",
      "Under a law passed last year, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must either sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law set a January 2025 deadline, but President Trump has extended it several times, most recently until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order paving the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "At the time, a senior White House official said that under the proposed deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Axios reported Thursday that Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will collectively own 45% of the U.S. entity. Almost one-third of the new entity will be owned by current ByteDance investors, according to Axios.",
      "When reached by CBS News Thursday, an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said in September, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during a call in September. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

    "summary": "House Democrats called for GOP leaders to hold a last-minute vote on extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Democrats called on GOP leaders to hold a last-minute vote on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits on Thursday as lawmakers are poised to head home for the holidays without addressing the expiring subsidies.",
      "\"We're demanding a vote today on extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits today \u2014 not tomorrow, not next week, not next month \u2014 today,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.",
      "Around 22 million Americans who purchase their health insurance through Affordable Care Act exchanges face a steep premium increase in the new year with the expiration of the enhanced tax credits on Dec. 31. And despite weeks of debate on Capitol Hill over the issue, which was at the center of the shutdown fight that ended last month, lawmakers have been unable to reach a resolution.",
      "Speaking alongside House Democrats on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday morning, Jeffries and his leadership team cited his discharge petition, which reached the 218-signature threshold needed to force a vote on the tax credits a day earlier. Four moderate Republicans signed onto the petition\u00a0Wednesday after days of back and forth on the GOP health care strategy, breaking with their party leadership to back the measure.",
      "\"We have the votes, we have the momentum,\" Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said. \"We have the American people on our side. Let's not waste another second.\"",
      "But even with the success of the petition, a vote on extending the ACA tax credits isn't expected until the chamber reconvenes in January, since seven legislative days must elapse before a discharge motion can be brought to the floor. House Speaker Mike Johnson called it a \"rule that cannot be broken.\"",
      "\"That's the rule,\" Johnson said Wednesday. \"There's no way around that.\"",
      "Still, Democrats urged Johnson to act sooner. \"Under no circumstances should the House of Representatives adjourn until we successfully extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits for tens of millions of Americans,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Johnson does have the authority to move the process along. Last month, when another small group of Republicans broke with their leaders to sign onto a discharge petition to force the Justice Department to release the Epstein files, Johnson moved quickly to hold a vote on the underlying bill.",
      "But the speaker indicated that Republicans don't intend to address the health care issue until the new year. Johnson told reporters Wednesday that the measure will be considered during the first week of January upon the House's return, calling it \"inevitable.\" He added that Republicans plan to hold additional votes on their health care policies when they return.",
      "\"We'll be back in January to do much more of this,\" Johnson said.",
      "House GOP leaders canceled votes for Friday after the chamber on Wednesday approved a health care bill that Republicans say would lower health insurance premiums for Americans, but does not include an extension of the expiring ACA tax credits.",
      "Jeffries was asked Thursday afternoon whether he would consider supporting other bipartisan proposals to extend the credits with reforms, if the three-year extension makes it out of the House but fails in the Senate.",
      "\"The House has to work its will first,\" he replied. \"Once the House works its will \u2014 which should be taking place today, tomorrow, before the end of the year, but at least as early as when we get back in January \u2014 then we'll send the bill over to the Senate. And we'll see what the senators decide to do. We're not giving up this fight.\"",
      "Though imminent action appears out of the question, the movement on the discharge petition seemed to add momentum to a bipartisan effort to reach a health care compromise. After a meeting between so-called \"problem solvers\" in both the House and Senate on Wednesday, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed optimism about a solution.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, told CBS News that the discharge petition in the House \"gives momentum to the bipartisan work that we've been trying to advance on the Senate side.\" She said she expects health care discussions will continue between both chambers over the holiday break. And the discharge petition could serve as a vehicle for an extension of the tax credits with some reforms, should moderate lawmakers reach a compromise.",
      "In the upper chamber, senators rejected a clean three-year extension of the enhanced ACA tax credits just last week. But a number of Republicans have expressed interest in extending the credits, as long as some reforms are made to the program.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on Senate Majority Leader John Thune Wednesday to bring up the extension if it passes the House.",
      "Schumer noted that every Democrat voted for a three-year extension last week. He added that if the measure passes the House, \"we hope Thune would put it on the floor and let it pass.\"",
      "Thune was noncommittal about whether the Senate would take up a bill to extend the ACA subsidies for three years if it passes the House, noting Wednesday morning to reporters that he didn't expect a vote this week.",
      "Last month, the Senate quickly approved a bill to force the release of the Epstein files after a discharge petition prompted a vote in the House. But Thune told reporters that the Epstein and health care issues are \"very different,\" predicting that while the Epstein measure had near unanimous support in the lower chamber, the health care vote would likely be a partisan one.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump reiterated his support for sending funds \"directly to the people\" to buy their own health care on Thursday, suggesting that the change could implemented rapidly to address health care costs.",
      "On the rising premiums that millions of Americans face in the new year with the expiration of the ACA tax credits, the president said \"they will skyrocket because it was never any good.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-kash-patel-erica-knight/",
    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 16:16:50 -0500",
    "summary": "An FBI media adviser has emerged as one of Kash Patel's fiercest public defenders and promoters of the bureau under his leadership.",
    "story": [
      "FBI Director Kash Patel was enduring yet another round of negative headlines in October about his frequent use of the FBI's private jet \u2013 this time to see his girlfriend sing the national anthem at a freestyle wrestling event in State College, Pennsylvania.",
      "An FBI spokesman pushed back on the criticism, citing federal regulations requiring the FBI director to fly on government aircraft. But the most passionate retort came from a little-known FBI media adviser who has emerged as one of Patel's fiercest public defenders and promoters of the FBI under his leadership.",
      "\"Shaming a woman the Director has happily dated for nearly three years is pathetic and, frankly, disgusting,\" Erica Knight wrote on X. \"Hot take \u2013 when someone's arrested 28,000 violent criminals and taken millions in drugs off the streets, maybe we can also support their happiness.\"",
      "It was a heartfelt but strikingly personal response from a law enforcement agency known for its buttoned-up communications style. But Knight is not the typical government spokeswoman. She's Patel's friend and longtime personal publicist, hired earlier this year to help shake up the bureau's communications strategy. She's also amplified the director's public messaging and touted what the FBI leadership sees as its successes.",
      "In one testament to their friendship, shortly after he was sworn in as FBI director, Patel posted a picture of himself in the Oval Office with Knight and wrote on X: \"I have been truly blessed to have the best captain and teammate @_ericaKnight \u2013 she has been there since day 1, without her I would not be in this position today. She is the best publicist in America, an absolute force.\"",
      "Glowing public testimonials like this have left some current and former FBI agents questioning Knight's taxpayer-funded role, especially since the FBI already has a sprawling media department.",
      "Those questions have surfaced amid growing concerns inside the agency. Two bureau sources tell CBS News that they believe Patel is using public resources in ways that push the boundaries of traditionally accepted FBI practice. Beyond the trips to visit his girlfriend, Patel has used FBI aircraft to go to sporting events \u2014 a golf outing in Scotland with friends and a trip to a private hunting reserve in Texas owned by the family of a GOP donor.",
      "He's also been slammed by critics for assigning FBI SWAT agents to protect his girlfriend, country music performer Alexis Wilkins, at taxpayer expense. (Wilkins has said she has been the target of multiple death threats since Patel became FBI director.)",
      "FBI officials say Patel reimburses the government for his personal flights and point out that federal regulations require him to use government aircraft for both personal and official travel. Nevertheless, Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, recently announced a probe into Patel's use of public resources and is demanding he turn over documents related to the trips.",
      "Now, Raskin tells CBS News, he has questions about Patel's PR arrangement with Knight. Raskin has called on the FBI to disclose how much she is being paid.",
      "\"Why should an FBI Director have to hire a taxpayer-funded PR fixer to spin away public criticism,\" Raskin said in an email to CBS News. \"And if there's nothing to hide, then the bureau should have no problem releasing Ms. Knight's contract, showing exactly how much the American taxpayers are paying for her crisis PR services.\"",
      "FBI officials vigorously push back against the criticism, maintaining that Knight's job is not about tending to Patel's personal PR. Rather, they say she works closely in tandem with the Office of Public Affairs to promote the bureau's broader mission. In an interview with CBS News, a senior FBI official who asked not to be named called the notion that she serves only the director \"entirely false.\"",
      "\"She is not a PR representative for the director,\" the official said. \"She does specific work related to FBI communications.\"",
      "Still, a number of news outlets, including the New Yorker, CNN, Scripps News and Fox News, identified Knight in their reports as Patel's spokesperson or his adviser.",
      "Inside the agency, speculation about how much she's being paid has been widespread. Typically, such contracts are public, but the agency declined a request from CBS News for details of Knight's compensation, and Knight, in an interview, also declined to disclose information about her salary.",
      "\"The FBI absolutely needs to be more forward-leaning and transparent in terms of its communications,\" said Chris O'Leary, a former senior FBI agent. \"But Patel appears to be putting the spotlight on himself, rather than on the institution \u2013 at taxpayer expense.\"",
      "Federal salaries are typically public information. Knight, who works from outside of Washington, is not a federal employee but rather a contractor \u2013 an arrangement that makes it harder to determine her actual compensation. Her direct employer is Xpect Solutions, a technology and security services firm. The FBI has been a long-time customer of Xpect Solutions, and sources familiar with the arrangement say Knight's salary is paid to the company out of the FBI Office of Public Affairs budget. Xpect Solutions did not respond to a request for comment about Knight's employment.",
      "Ben Williamson, the FBI's assistant director for public affairs, told CBS News that Knight's contract with the FBI is \"entirely consistent with procurement rules and ethical guidelines, and any suggestion otherwise from CBS or elsewhere says more about their lack of basic research than it does anything else.\"",
      "Williamson said he and Knight, who reports both to him and Patel, speak daily. He described her as \"a valuable member of our press and communications office and one of the best operatives I've worked with in a decade.\"",
      "Patel met Knight after he left the first Trump administration in 2021 \u2013 the two were introduced by a mutual friend, according to a source familiar with the relationship. Knight was a publicist and crisis communications specialist with a growing client list; and Patel was on a mission to raise his profile.",
      "With Knight's help, Patel flooded the media with cable news and podcast appearances, lucrative speeches and book events, all aimed at cheering on the MAGA agenda and defending Donald Trump.",
      "The effort helped put him on the short list for FBI director, and when he was selected to the post, Knight came along.",
      "Since joining the government PR team, Knight has become a relentless champion of her client, touting the FBI's law-and-order accomplishments (\"President Trump's administration and Director Patel's FBI are dismantling the cartels and crushing the fentanyl crisis,\" she posted on X last month).",
      "In some ways, the role is not new \u2013 the FBI has long had a vast PR operation \u2014 one FBI source said there are well over 150\u00a0 staff in the bureau's office of public affairs, with 60 or so working out of headquarters in Washington and the rest in the bureau's 56 field offices. J. Edgar Hoover's vaunted publicity machine occupied a whole wing of bureau headquarters.",
      "For his part, Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, Marine and federal prosecutor, had little time for mingling with reporters and had no social media presence.",
      "James Comey, according to one of his advisers, believed more public engagement was critical to restoring trust in the FBI. Comey hired a law professor and friend, Daniel Richman, as a special government employee who worked on multiple projects for Comey, among them, interacting occasionally with reporters on sensitive investigations.",
      "Patel's immediate predecessor as FBI director, Christopher Wray, was so reticent about putting himself in the spotlight that agents often grumbled that he wasn't aggressive enough in defending the bureau. One close adviser alleged that he regularly admonished agents, \"Be a workhorse, not a show horse.\"",
      "Knight, in an interview, said the FBI's more aggressive public PR strategy aligns with Patel's avowed efforts to be a disruptor at the hidebound agency.",
      "\"Kash and [co-Deputy Director] Dan [Bongiono] were not hired to do business as usual,\" Knight said in an interview. \"They wanted to change the way things were done, help make the American people safe, and restore trust in the FBI. I don't think you can do that without communicating.\"",
      "Those who have interacted with her say Knight is skilled at cultivating relationships with reporters covering Patel. She has a reputation for being responsive to their questions and providing accurate information, even as she pushes for more favorable coverage of Patel.",
      "Her close relationship and direct access to Patel allow her to channel his views or get his personal reaction to the stories they're working on. One reporter called her \"the Kash whisperer.\"",
      "Knight, according to sources familiar with her role, works with Williamson to draft statements under Patel's name, and his talking points for interviews and his posts on X, where he remains a prolific poster.",
      "Knight has represented other clients in the MAGA world, too.",
      "\"Erica is a powerhouse,\" said Alina Habba, who until recently had been serving as acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, but stepped down after a federal appeals court ruled that she was unlawfully appointed. Habba hired Knight when she was serving as a private defense lawyer for Donald Trump. Even before Patel completes his first year in the job, supporters and critics say it is hard to dispute the notion that he has been a disruptor, for better or worse.",
      "Patel's supporters say he's dragging the FBI into a new media age, one dominated by social media. And for that, Erica Knight has been there for every step \u2014 and every social media post.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-investigating-sexual-harassment-landlords-female-tenants/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department is suing more than a dozen landlords on allegations of sexual harassment, a problem one top department official called \"traumatic for the victims\" and \"inappropriate and illegal.\"",
    "story": [
      "In a crowded neighborhood of duplexes, small apartments and one-story bungalows near a liquor store and pizza shop, William Asper serves as a landlord for nearly two dozen properties.",
      "The Detroit suburb of Westland, Michigan, 10 minutes north of the Detroit Metropolitan Airport, is where Asper helps manage some weathered rental properties, many of which were built in the early 1970s and are more affordable to low-income families in this working-class region, according to federal records published by the Justice Department.",
      "Amid surging housing costs, rent in the neighborhood is more affordable, including for families who use federal subsidies and have no other options for housing.",
      "The Justice Department has alleged Asper tried to take advantage of the needs of his tenants, leveraging his position to seek sexual favors. The agency said Asper threatened to withhold repairs or evict tenants who did not comply.",
      "In a court filing in Michigan earlier this month, the Justice Department alleged Asper told one tenant in 2019 \"that there were 'different ways' she could pay rent.\" The government's attorneys also said he \"touched the tenant without her consent, regularly pulling her hair, grabbing her buttocks and kissing her head.\" And they alleged he \"regularly pulled his penis out of his pants in front of the tenant while at her home, often times while her young son was in the room.\"",
      "In their court documents, Justice Department lawyers also alleged that in 2018, Asper told a \"female tenant that he was lonely, wanted someone to spend time with him, and asked if she would go to a hotel with him. Asper allegedly \"told the female tenant that if she did not engage in sexual relations with him, he would give her a 24-hour eviction notice.\"",
      "The allegations appeared in a civil lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Asper, arguing he violated the federal Fair Housing Act. His civil case is pending in the Eastern District of Michigan federal court, and his formal response to the allegations has not yet been posted.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Asper said the accusations are false.",
      "\"I offer low-income housing and people want to blame the landlord or make excuses why they couldn't pay the rent,\" Asper said. \"These women wanted to do more/be my 'girlfriend', side chick and that was not going to happen.\"",
      "Asper isn't the only landlord facing such claims. It is one of at least 52 federal civil lawsuits alleging sexual harassment and misconduct against landlords since 2017.",
      "\"It's traumatic for the victims,\" said Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant U.S. attorney general for civil rights. \"People may not believe them. And they may have been the victim multiple times.\"",
      "The Justice Department's Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative, which seeks to combat these types of cases, was launched in the first year of the first Trump administration in 2017. Dhillon's team continues to pursue the cases. Several former Justice Department attorneys, including appointees of both the Biden and Trump Administrations, have lauded the program and its work since 2017.",
      "There are 14 federal sexual harassment civil cases pending across the United States, including Asper's case in Michigan.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Dhillon said the filings of these suits can serve as a deterrent to future harassment and abuse. She said the legal challenges \"made all the women in that property feel like they've been seen and heard.\"",
      "Dhillon said the Fair Housing Act, which passed in 1968 amid the sweeping changes of the Civil Rights era, prohibits any kind of quid pro quo involving sex, sexual acts or sexual harassment, either for renting, continuing to rent or obtaining repairs.",
      "\"Every American deserves to feel safe and know this sexual harassment is inappropriate and illegal,\" Dhillon said.",
      "A CBS News review of some of the dozens of recently filed Justice Department cases shows parallels to the accusations against Asper.",
      "In a separate legal challenge filed against a central New York landlord in 2018, the Justice Department alleged the harassment spanned three decades. The Oswego man is accused of \"Demanding that female tenants engage in, or pressuring them to engage in, sexual intercourse, oral sex, or other sexual acts with him in order to obtain or keep rental housing.\"",
      "In a 2017 Justice Department complaint filed in federal court in Kansas, a Wichita-area landlord is accused of entering a female tenant's apartment \"unannounced\" and \"touching her body while she slept in her bed.\" The landlord is also accused of \"Conditioning tangible housing benefits, including forgiving or reducing rent, on engaging in sexual conduct.\"",
      "And in a legal challenge initially filed in Minnesota in 2020, the feds alleged a landlord offered to overlook or excuse unpaid rent and utilities in exchange for sex acts. The landlord was also accused of \"Expressing a preference for renting to single female tenants.\"",
      "The legal challenges filed by the Justice Department can help secure civil penalties against landlords and damages for victims. A CBS News review of Justice Department records showed the agency has recovered approximately $1.5 million since January.",
      "And in the New York, Kansas and Minnesota cases, the Justice Department struck written agreements with the landlords that, among other things, required them to hire independent property managers so they would no longer need to come into contact with tenants themselves.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Fair Housing Alliance, a civil rights group that advocates for tenants and combats discrimination, said instances of sexual harassment by landlords are likely more pervasive than current statistics indicate.",
      "\"Sexual harassment in housing is one of the most underreported instances of housing discrimination, given that the victims often fear facing retaliation or eviction if they file a complaint,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, which handles Fair Housing Act sex harassment probes, has experienced a purge of veteran employees this year, amid a Trump-ordered downsizing of the federal government \u2014 led by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 and the Trump Administration's dramatic shifts in some of the office's priorities.",
      "Justice Connection, a newly formed organization that supports ousted or resigning Justice Department prosecutors, estimated nearly 75% of career attorneys in the division have departed this year.",
      "Dhillon said the unit that handles the housing cases has been less impacted by the changes and cuts. She told CBS News, \"I don't think we're losing people in that section, and people are pretty happy with the type of work we're doing.\" Dhillon said the Civil Rights section has hired approximately 50 people this year, amid the larger turnover in the agency.",
      "Some tenants have filed their own individual federal civil lawsuits alleging sex harassment in violation of the Fair Housing Act.",
      "In one case, an Alabama woman filed a complaint in federal court alleging a series of personal harms. Her suit alleged \"emotional distress, including humiliation and mental anguish\" from a landlord who \"offered to reduce her rent in exchange for sex.\" The lawsuit alleged: \"When [she] refused his sexual advances, he raised her rent.\"",
      "Housing advocates said low-income renters are particularly vulnerable to harassment, under fear that they could lose their housing if they reject a landlord's unlawful advances.",
      "The Justice Department's posted guidance on its protections of the Fair Housing Act says that \"women, particularly those who are poor, and with limited housing options, often have little recourse but to tolerate the humiliation and degradation of sexual harassment or risk having their families and themselves removed from their homes. The Department's enforcement program is aimed at landlords who create an untenable living environment by demanding sexual favors from tenants or by creating a sexually hostile environment for them.\"",
      "The National Fair Housing Alliance spokesperson told CBS News: \"Each investigation\u2014and especially every resolution\u2014sends a clear message that this egregious conduct, which targets the most vulnerable, will not be tolerated. Home should be a safe place, and these actions ensure that promise is upheld.\"",
      "Justice Connection, an organization of former Justice Department employees, told CBS News it estimates the agency's housing unit has lost nearly half of its staff this year.",

      "Any of its operations deemed \"vital,\" such as weather research, will be moved \"to another entity or location,\" he said.",
      "\"This facility is one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,\" Vought said.",
      "The National Science Foundation will be breaking up the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. This facility is one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country. A comprehensive review is underway & any vital activities such as weather\u2026",
      "The plan was first\u00a0reported\u00a0by USA Today. It said moves to dismantle NCAR will begin immediately.",
      "Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished NCAR scholar,\u00a0told The Washington Post breaking up the laboratory would result in a major loss of scientific research.",
      "Trenberth, an honorary academic in physics at New Zealand's University of Auckland, said the center was crucial to the search for advanced climate science discoveries.",
      "Antonio Busalacchi, the president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, which oversees NCAR, told the Post that, \"Any plans to dismantle NSF NCAR would set back our nation's ability to predict, prepare for, and respond to severe weather and other natural disasters.\"",
      "The White House noted that NCAR's budget\u00a0more than doubled\u00a0from the 1980s to the 1990s and called it \"the premier research stronghold for left-wing climate lunacy,\" pointing to examples of its research on wind turbines and air pollution.",
      "Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement on Tuesday that he hadn't been briefed on the plans by White House officials, but said, \"If true, public safety is at risk and science is being attacked.\"",
      "He said part of the NCAR's work provides data on severe weather events \"that help our country save lives and property, and prevent devastation for families.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:25:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of yards of dinosaur tracks with toes and claws have been found in the Italian Alps in a region that will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "\"This set of dinosaur footprints is one of the largest collections in all of Europe, in the whole world,\" Attilio Fontana, head of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, said during a news conference.",
      "The tracks, which are over 200 million years old, were discovered in the Stelvio National Park, in an area between the towns of Bormio and Livigno, which host part of the Games.",
      "Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera first spotted the imprints in September in an almost vertical rocky slope.",
      "Some measured up to 16 inches in diameter.",
      "The collection \"extends for hundreds of meters and also represents a series of animal behaviors, because in addition to seeing animals walking together, there are also places where these animals meet,\" Fontana said.",
      "Della Ferrera called in paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso from Milan's Natural History Museum, who assembled a team of Italian experts to study the site.",
      "The museum released multiple images of the footprints uncovered in the so-called valley of dinosaurs\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"It's an immense scientific heritage,\" Dal Sasso said in the region's press release.",
      "\"The parallel walks are clear evidence of herds moving in synchrony, and there are also traces of more complex behaviors, such as groups of animals gathered in a circle, perhaps for defense.\"",
      "\"Impressions of the toes and even the claws\"",
      "The tracks, currently covered by snow and off the beaten track, are preserved in Upper Triassic dolomitic rocks, dating back approximately 210 million years.",
      "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
      "That suggests they belong to prosauropods, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads, which are considered the ancestors of the large sauropods of the Jurassic period like the Brontosaurus, the experts said.",
      "Prosauropods had sharp claws, and adults could reach up to 33 feet in length.",
      "There may also be tracks of predatory dinosaurs and archosaurs, the ancestors of crocodiles, the press release said.",
      "The prints are on an almost-vertical slope due to the formation of the Alpine chain.",
      "But when the dinosaurs walked through the area, it was formed of tidal flats that stretched for hundreds of miles, and the environment was tropical.",
      "\"The tracks were made when the sediments were still soft and saturated with water, on the broad tidal flats surrounding the Tethys Ocean,\" ichnologist Fabio Massimo Petti said, referring to a prehistoric ocean.",
      "\"The plasticity of those very fine calcareous muds, now transformed into rock, has in areas preserved truly remarkable anatomical details, such as impressions of the toes and even the claws,\" he said.",
      "The footprints were then covered by sediments which protected them, but with the uplift of the Alps and the erosion of the mountainside, they have been brought back into view.",
      "\"As the layers containing the tracks are diverse and overlapping, we have a unique opportunity to study the evolution of animals and their environment over time,\" geologist Fabrizio Berra said. \"Like reading the pages of a stone book.\"",
      "Other recent dinosaur track discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "Earlier this month, paleontologists in Bolivia said they found and meticulously documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "In March,\u00a0scientists in England\u00a0discovered a 650-foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some\u00a0200 dinosaur footprints\u00a0dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

He flew again in September 2024 on the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight.",
      "Isaacman also became the first private citizen to\u00a0carry out a spacewalk.",

      "The Trump administration wants to send a manned U.S. mission to the moon\u00a0as soon as possible to outpace similar plans by China.",
      "During his second confirmation hearing in December, Isaacman pledged he would ensure the success of the Artemis lunar exploration program that began in 2017, during the first Trump administration.",
      "\"America will return to the moon before our great rival, and we will establish an enduring presence to understand and realize the scientific, economic and national security value on the lunar surface,\" Isaacman said.",
      "He also stressed the need to beat China in the space race, saying, \"We are in a great competition with a rival that has the will and means to challenge American exceptionalism across multiple domains, including in the high ground of space.\"",
      "NASA's Artemis program, however, has faced numerous delays, and experts warned in September that the lunar lander developed by Elon Musk's SpaceX might not be ready in time.",
      "Trump first nominated Isaacman after the president's 2024 election victory, but withdrew the nomination in April, before\u00a0reissuing it again in November.",
      "Musk had lobbied for Isaacman to get the job. The back-and-forth reflected the president's on-again, off-again relationship with the SpaceX founder, who has been skeptical of the goal of returning to the moon.",
      "While the Trump administration was open several months ago to revising the Artemis program in favor of Mars, this prospect now seems to be fading.",

Indeed, he expects AI to be a part of virtually every worker's future, much as the internet became an integral part of daily life decades ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the workers best positioned to benefit as generative AI tools like ChatGPT reshape the labor market will be those who understand how to use the technology to maximize their own performance, as well as how to test and train AI, Seamans said.",

      "People who understand AI and, equally important, who are adept at explaining how it works in simple terms, will find themselves in demand, Seamans predicted. For example, he expects companies to recruit what he calls \"AI explainers\" or \"AI translators\" who can help managers better understand an organization's AI tools.",
      "\"The job is to provide a simple layperson's understanding of what's happening under the hood,\" he said.",

      "Another common role Seamans expects to emerge in the age of artificial intelligence is the \"AI auditor\" who\u00a0checks AI for bias or factual inaccuracies.",
      "\"They would need to know enough about an AI system to run tests on it, and know what benchmarks to use to determine whether bias is there or not,\" he said. \"They could potentially have a legal background, too.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 07:25:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department released thousands of new photos and records on Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, but at least 550 pages in the documents are fully redacted.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department released thousands of new records on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, but at least 550 pages in the documents are fully redacted, CBS News has found.",
      "The newly released files included photos of several prominent people in Epstein's orbit, images from his homes and investigative records that detail disturbing allegations against the late sex offender. But the heavy redactions in many of the records have drawn criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, as the department defends its handling of the files.",
      "One series of three consecutive documents \u2014 totaling 255 pages \u2014 is entirely redacted, with each page covered by a black box. A fourth 119-page document labeled \"Grand Jury-NY\" is also entirely redacted. It's unclear what proceedings it stemmed from, but the document listed immediately before it is a transcript in which a prosecutor asks a grand jury in 2020 to consider evidence for a superseding indictment of Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "At least 180 blacked-out pages appear in files that are mostly but not entirely redacted. In some cases, a cover page, a photo of a folder or something else that isn't fully redacted precedes several pages that are entirely obscured by a black box.",
      "In other cases, the redactions were more sparing. For example, a 96-page police report on a Florida investigation into Epstein in the mid-2000s redacts the names of victims and other details, but leaves many other details in.",
      "And some of the thousands of photos included in Friday's release are partially redacted, with some people's faces obscured by boxes. Photos that include former President Bill Clinton, pop star Michael Jackson and other notable people have partial redactions (though Clinton and Jackson themselves are fully visible).",
      "Why was the DOJ allowed to redact Epstein files?",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress last month, requires the Justice Department to release the files in its possession related to Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "Redactions are allowed for a handful of reasons, including to protect survivors' personal information and to leave out violent photos and child sexual abuse material. Documents can also be withheld in a \"narrowly tailored and temporary\" manner if their release would \"jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\"",
      "Some of Friday's redactions appear to black out the names of survivors, but it's not clear in every case why information was blacked out. The government is required to give Congress a list of redactions within 15 days.",
      "The law explicitly forbids the government from withholding records due to the risk of \"embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\" The Justice Department said on X that no politicians' names were redacted from the files.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a letter to Congress earlier Friday that a team of more than 200 Justice Department lawyers scoured the documents in search of survivors' names and other things that needed to be redacted. He said the department is still going through the files and will release more of them on a \"rolling basis,\" though the law required them to be released by Friday.",
      "Blanche's letter also said \"additional lawyers of review\" were necessary when reviewing grand jury transcripts. Judges in New York and Florida have given the government permission to release grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell's cases, but the judge overseeing the Maxwell case required the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan to \"personally certify\" that none of the documents contain victims' personal information.",
      "Democrats criticize the redactions in Epstein files",
      "Some lawmakers have blasted the Justice Department for the redactions and for acknowledging that some documents will be released later.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who helped lead the effort to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act, argued that Friday's document release wasn't in compliance with their law.",
      "Khanna called it an \"incomplete release with too many redactions\" in a video posted to X. He said he's \"exploring all options,\" including impeachment or referrals for prosecution. Massie said the release \"grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said: \"Simply releasing a mountain of blacked out pages violates the spirit of transparency and the letter of the law. For example, all 119 pages of one document were completely blacked out. We need answers as to why.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on the criticism.",
      "The Justice Department has defended its handling of the files. Blanche told Fox News Digital: \"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law \u2014 full stop.\"",
      "\"Democrat administrations in the past have refused to provide full details of the Jeffrey Epstein saga,\" Blanche said in his letter to lawmakers. \"But President Trump, Attorney General Bondi, and FBI Director Patel are committed to providing full transparency consistent with the law.\"",

      "Sensing the YouTuber was finished, Joshua rocked him with a right uppercut early in the sixth. The native of England then floored Paul with a combination to the head.",
      "Although Paul (12-2) reached his feet again, Joshua (29-4, 26 KOs) finally crushed Paul's upset dream when he dropped him a fourth time with a right to the head. Referee Christopher Young counted Paul out at 1:31 of the round in front of a capacity crowd of 19,600 at the Kaseya Center.",
      "Prior to the fight, Joshua told CBS Sports that he would consider it \"a failure\" if the match went longer than one round.",
      "But his post-match comments were more tempered.",
      "\"Jake Paul has done really well tonight,\" Joshua said, according to CBS Sports. \"I want to give him his props. He got up time and time again. It was difficult in there for him, but he kept trying to find a way. It takes a real man to do that.\"",
      "With the victory, Joshua now can angle to reclaim the heavyweight title he lost against Oleksandr Usyk. Joshua also has talked about a long discussed match with countryman and former champion, Tyson Fury. However, Fury is currently retired following consecutive losses to Usyk in 2024.",
      "It was Joshua's first bout since Daniel Dubois knocked him out in five rounds in September 2024.",
      "Joshua methodically established pace against Paul from the opening round as neither fighter engaged early. Midway through the round, Paul threw an overhand right that Joshua blocked with his glove. In the closing seconds, Joshua scored with a right to the head near the ropes.",
      "In the second, Joshua began utilizing his 6-inch reach advantage by leading with a left jab.",
      "Paul scored with a short right to the head early in the fourth. Later in the round, Paul twice fell to the canvas awkwardly as he again attempted to cut distance during close exchanges",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 00:14:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik's decision to drop out came after President Trump signaled he would not make an endorsement in the race at this stage.",
    "story": [
      "Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik dropped out of the New York governor's race Friday, concluding that a potentially fractious GOP primary could hurt Republicans' chances in an uphill statewide contest, as President Trump signaled he would not make an endorsement at this stage.",
      "Stefanik pointed to the risks in a statement to supporters, writing: \"While we would have overwhelmingly won this primary, it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York.\"",
      "Stefanik's political future is now unclear, as she said she is not planning to run for re-election in Congress. Stefanik, considered a rising MAGA leader, was initially set to leave Congress after Mr. Trump picked her in November 2024 for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, before her nomination was pulled by the administration in March over concerns about a narrowing Republican majority in the House.",
      "Two sources confirmed to CBS News that Stefanik spoke directly with President Trump on Thursday to discuss her decision to leave the gubernatorial race. Their conversation was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Mr. Trump later issued a statement following her announcement applauding Stefanik, calling her \"a fantastic person and Congresswoman from New York State\" and describing her as \"a tremendous talent.\" He said she would have \"great success\" in whatever she chooses next and signaled his continued support.",
      "A Republican member of Congress with direct knowledge of the race told CBS News they believed Stefanik ultimately concluded that a contested Republican primary would be difficult and potentially damaging, even if she were likely to win. The other major candidate is Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, another Trump ally.",
      "Under New York GOP rules, candidates must secure at least 25% of the weighted vote at the state party's February convention to qualify for the June primary ballot, or otherwise submit nominating petitions.",
      "While Stefanik was believed to have early support representing well above that threshold \u2014 possibly more than 75% of the weighted vote due to early endorsements from local party officials \u2014 New York Republicans told CBS News that a challenge from Blakeman still risked becoming a prolonged intraparty fight.",
      "The eventual nominee is expected to face off against incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul. New York hasn't elected a Republican governor since 2002, though Hochul won her 2022 race by a single-digit margin of\u00a0 6.4 percentage points, which spurred renewed interest among Republicans who viewed the result as a sign of potential Democratic vulnerability.",
      "\"My gut tells me this is not the right political time,\" Stefanik told New York Magazine in an interview on Friday. \"This is not the sort of array of things lining up \u2014 which is so difficult in New York, which is incredibly difficult in a picture-perfect year\u2013let alone with a primary and everything else.\"",
      "\"We viewed it as a waste of resources,\" she said, also citing family considerations. \"I have a 4-year old son, and that is a priority for our family.\"",
      "A senior House Republican official also said Stefanik was frustrated that Mr. Trump declined to endorse her early and effectively clear the field for her, a move that Stefanik allies believed could have avoided a divisive primary.",
      "Mr. Trump did call Blakeman after he entered the race, according to sources familiar with the phone call. He told the county executive that he did not like seeing \"good Republicans\" face each other in an electoral battle.",
      "Asked about the race on Dec. 10, the president repeatedly emphasized his reluctance to publicly intervene, stressing his personal relationships with both candidates and concern about collateral damage from a contested primary.",
      "\"First of all, he's a friend. She's a friend,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. \"These are two great people running. In a way, I hate to see them running against each other. I hope they're not going to be damaging each other.\"",
      "Mr. Trump went on to praise both candidates, saying, \"Elise is fantastic, and Bruce is. They're two fantastic people, and I always hate it when two very good friends of mine are running.\"",
      "Pointing to the state GOP convention, Trump said, \"I think you'll know pretty much at the end of February what's going to happen. And I'll probably have to, you know, do what I want to do.\"",
      "\"We have two very talented people. Either one should win against the Democrats,\" he added.",
      "After Stefanik announced she would end her campaign, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised her record, calling her \"an incredible advocate\" for her Upstate New York district and \"a true friend\" to Mr. Trump. Leavitt, who previously worked for Stefanik as a top adviser, added that she is \"a great leader, and an even better person.\"",
      "Stefanik, a member of House Republican leadership and one of Trump's closest allies in Congress, had been viewed by New York Republicans as a formidable contender given her national profile and fundraising strength \u2014 over $12 million raised.",
      "But she faced an uphill battle in deep-blue New York, with a recent Siena College poll showing Hochul with a double-digit lead versus both Republicans at this stage of the race.",

      "Biffle, his wife, Christina Grossu Biffle, their son Ryder and Biffle's daughter Emma were among the seven people killed when a Cessna C550 crashed while landing at Statesville Regional Airport in North Carolina on Thursday morning. The other three people aboard the flight were identified as Craig Wadsworth and Dennis and Jack Dutton.",

And I texted back, 'What's wrong with the plane?'\" Grossu told CBS News. \"Then the next thing was (the SOS alert) that you get from your automatic Apple phones when you have an accident or something. And so I knew that something was wrong.\"",

      "A flight path available on the tracking website FlightAware appears to show that the plane departed, then looped back toward the airport. North Carolina State Highway Patrol confirmed that the plane had departed and was returning to the airport on reapproach, but did not say why.",
      "The cause of the crash has not been determined. The National Transportation Safety Board said Friday it was able to recover a cockpit voice recorder that's on its way to Washington, D.C., to be examined. Officials said they weren't aware of any mayday call being made, and that they don't know who was piloting at the time. The NTSB said three people on the plane had licenses.",
      "Grossu said she had last seen the family on the day before the crash, but didn't remember what her final words to them had been.",
      "\"It's a cliche, people say to say 'I love you' to your loved ones all the time, and to embrace them and everything else. And that's the other regret I have, is I know when we said goodbye on Wednesday, we hugged. I don't know what my last words were,\" Grossu said, through tears. \"Maybe it was 'I love you.' I don't know. I don't remember.\"",
      "Grossu remembered the family as \"good people\" who \"lived life to the fullest.\"",
      "\"It was way too soon for all of them to lose their lives, but they didn't hold back and they were always giving,\" Grossu said.",
      "Grossu said 14-year-old Emma, whom Biffle shared with her mother Nicole Lunders, was a \"good girl.\" Ryder, 5, was a \"bundle of energy\" who called his grandparents Mimi and Baba. He was at Grossu's house all the time, she said. He dreamed of being an F1 driver.",
      "\"All of his presents under the tree were in that regard. And he asked me on Wednesday, he said, 'Mimi, can I open up one of my presents?' And I said 'No, you gotta wait till Christmas,'\" Grossu said. \"And I regret that, saying that, every hour since this happened, why I didn't let him open one present. I didn't, and I feel so badly about that.\"",
      "Tributes from the racing community and beyond have been pouring in since the family's deaths were confirmed. NASCAR remembered Biffle as \"more than a champion driver\" and a \"friend to so many.\" North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson wrote on X that Biffle was a \"great NASCAR champion\" and \"extraordinary person as well.\" A family statement called Biffle and his wife devoted parents who built their lives around their children. The statement also said Dennis Dutton and his son Jack were \"deeply loved,\" and that Craig Wadsworth was \"beloved by many\" in the NASCAR community.",
      "\"It's hard. We're devastated,\" Grossu said.",

      "Valente was admitted to the U.S. on a student visa and began graduate school at Brown University, where he took physics classes at the Barus & Holley building. He took a leave of absence in April 2001 and formally withdrew from the school in July 2003.",
      "2017",
      "Valente moved to the United States after receiving a green card through a visa lottery program. His last known residence was in Miami, Florida.",
      "Monday, Nov. 17 (26 days before the Brown shooting)",
      "Valente is seen on surveillance video at an Alamo Rent a Car on Atlantic Avenue in Boston at 11:44 a.m.",
      "Wednesday, Nov. 26 (17 days before the shooting)",
      "According to Foley, Valente rented a hotel room in Boston between November 26 and November 30.",
      "Friday, Nov. 28 (15 days before the shooting)",
      "A Brown University custodian spots a man in a surgical mask and the same clothes as the suspect, in the Barus & Holley building. The man walked into a bathroom, across from room 166, the auditorium where the shootings will eventually happen. The man was walking with a limp.",
      "Monday, Dec. 1 (12 days before the shooting)",
      "According to the affidavit, Valente rented a gray Nissan Sentra with Florida plates from an Alamo Rent-a-Car on Atlantic Avenue in Boston at 11:36 a.m. Foley said he then drove \"to the vicinity\" of Brown University.",
      "The Brown University custodian sees the same man again in Barus & Holley.",
      "Foley said Valente's rental car was \"observed intermittently\" between Dec. 1 and Dec. 12 in the area of Brown University.",
      "Saturday, Dec. 13 \u2014 the day of the Brown University shooting",
      "At 10:35 a.m., the suspect is seen on surveillance video wearing a mask, walking at Manning and Cooke streets in Providence, about five minutes away from the Barus & Holley building at Brown University.",
      "He is also spotted roaming on Cooke Street at 10:37 a.m., 10:56 a.m., 2 p.m. and 2:52 p.m.",
      "At 2:16 p.m., he encountered another person, later identified by police as \"John,\" on George Street. Valente then ran away from John, who ran after him. The two are then seen again \"in close proximity.\"",
      "At 2:56 p.m., the suspect is seen on surveillance video walking from Manning Street to Hope Street, crossing Hope Street into a parking lot near the Barus & Holley building.",
      "At 3:15 p.m.. he is spotted on Governor Street, George Street, Cooke Street and Benevolent Street, all within three blocks of the Barus & Holley building.",
      "Around 4 p.m., officials say he went into the Barus & Holley building and fired multiple shots in an auditorium, killing students Ella Cook and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov and wounding nine others. Police recovered 44 spent 9-millimeter shell casings at the scene, according to the affidavit.",
      "At 4:03 p.m., a camera on a Brown University shuttle bus showed him walking away from the Barus & Holley building.",
      "At 4:06 p.m., he is spotted briefly on surveillance video walking at the corner of Hope and Waterman streets. This short video was the first clip released to the public as the manhunt began.",
      "At 4:08 p.m., he is shown walking on Waterman Street.",
      "At 4:11 p.m., he was last shown on Pittman Street in Providence. Foley said Valente returned to Massachusetts between Saturday and Sunday.",
      "Sunday, Dec. 14",
      "A person of interest is detained at a hotel in Coventry, Rhode Island, but is later released. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said that night that while some evidence had \"pointed to\" that person of interest, the evidence now \"points in a different direction.\"",
      "Police continued viewing and collecting video from surveillance cameras and doorbell cameras on the east side of Providence.",
      "They determined the gunman is about 5 feet, 8 inches tall and they observed his \"common gait and body movements\" along with a \"distinctive walk.\"",
      "Monday, Dec. 15 \u2014 the day of the MIT professor's shooting",
      "Providence Police released multiple videos and images showing someone they called a person of interest.",
      "Detectives also interviewed some of the shooting survivors at Rhode Island Hospital. When they were shown the images, they confirmed he looked like the gunman.",
      "One woman \"said she got a good look at the suspect. When provided with a photo of the Suspect, (she) quickly froze, physically pushed back, and became emotional. She was observed to be tearing up and shaking. She then confirmed that the image showed the shooter.\"",
      "Investigators interviewed the Brown University custodian who had spotted a man who resembled the person of interest on Nov. 28 and Dec. 1. They then reviewed Brown surveillance footage from Dec. 1, \"where they saw an individual matching the general description of the suspect\"",
      "At 8:33 p.m., a man is shot at an apartment on Gibbs Street in Brookline, Massachusetts, just outside of Boston, about 50 miles from Brown University. He was rushed to Beth Israel Hospital where he died Tuesday morning.",
      "Foley later said security footage showed Valente \"within a half mile\" of the home and \"there's video of him entering that apartment building\" that night.",
      "She said he was seen about an hour later, entering a storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire, \"wearing the same clothes that he had been seen wearing right after the murder.\" According to Foley, Valente rented the unit in November.",
      "Tuesday, Dec. 16",
      "The man who was shot and killed in Brookline is identified as MIT professor Nuno Loureiro, a nuclear science and engineering professor from Portugal. He was 47 years old. No other information is released to the public about the shooting.",
      "FBI Boston Special Agent in Charge Ted Docks told reporters in Providence that \"there seems to be no connection as it relates to\" the Brown shooting.",
      "According to Foley, at some point, while he was in Massachusetts, Valente switched the plates on the Nissan Sentra to an unregistered plate out of Maine.",
      "Meanwhile, Providence Police released enhanced videos of the person of interest, hoping to generate more leads.",
      "That same day, their tip command center was told about a Reddit post from a person who claimed to have seen the suspected shooter.",
      "\"He blew this case right open,\" Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha would later say.",
      "The man, known only as \"John\" in the Providence Police affidavit, said he had several encounters with the suspect before Saturday's shooting.",
      "The Reddit post said:",
      "\"I'm being dead serious. The police need to look into a grey Nissan with Florida plates, possibly a rental. That was the car he was driving. It was parked in front of the little shack behind the Rhode Island Historical Society on the Cooke St. side. I know because he used his key fob to open the car, approached it and then something prompted him to back away. When he backed away he relocked the car. I found that odd so when he circled the block I approached the car that is when I saw the Florida plates. He was parked in the section between the gate of the RIHS and the corner of Cooke and George St.\"",
      "Based on the tip, police took another look at surveillance video in the area and spotted the Nissan.",
      "New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella said Friday that based on autopsy results, Valente is estimated to have died on Dec. 16.",
      "\"The examination confirmed that Mr. Neves Valente died as a result of a gunshot wound of the head, and that his manner of death was suicide,\" Formella said in a statement.",
      "Wednesday, Dec. 17",
      "Providence Police asked for the public's help in finding and speaking with a second person, who was later identified as the tipster, \"John.\"",
      "They released still images of him \"interacting with the suspect\" at 2:16 p.m. on Dec. 13, less than two hours before the Brown shooting.",
      "Later Wednesday evening, the Reddit poster approached police at the Brown University Alumni Hall on Meeting Street and identified himself. \"John\" went to the police station with officers and agreed to a recorded interview.",
      "He said he first encountered the suspect in a bathroom at the Barus & Holley building between 1:45 and 2 p.m. on Dec. 13, about two hours before the shooting. He gave investigators an extremely detailed description of Valente and his clothes, which he described as \"inappropriate and inadequate for the weather.\" John said Valente left the building and went to the parking lot. He then followed Valente up Manning Street.",
      "John then went into further detail about the encounter described in his Reddit post and told officers the suspect would switch directions every time they saw each other, and that it turned into a \"game of cat and mouse\" between the two of them.",
      "At one point, on George Street, they got within two feet of each other.",
      "According to the affidavit, \"John asked the Suspect, 'Your car is back there, why are you circling the block?' The Suspect responded, 'I don't know you from nobody,' then Suspect repeatedly asked, 'Why are you harassing me?'\"",
      "John said he walked away and never saw the man again. Less than two hours later, the gunman opened fire on students in the Barus & Holley building.",
      "Police showed John two photos from a license-plate reader camera, known as Flock images, of the Nissan and he said \"Holy s---. That might be it.\"",
      "Police had obtained the images of the car after a Brown faculty member came to them on Dec. 17 about seeing a Nissan with Florida plates driving \"unusually slow\" in the area near campus on Thursday, Dec. 11 \u2014 two days before the shooting.",
      "Police searched Flock cameras around the east side of Providence and found 14 images of the Nissan dating as far back as Dec. 1.",
      "Investigators traced the car's license plate to the Alamo rental center in Boston and found it was rented by Valente. ATF agents went to the Alamo and started looking through their surveillance video. Video from Dec. 1 showed Valente.",
      "Police also found video of Valente at the Alamo as far back as Nov. 17.",
      "\"In that critical video, Valente is seen wearing the exact same outfit as the Suspect on December 13,\" police wrote in the affidavit.",
      "Thursday, Dec. 18",
      "The U.S. Attorneys Offices in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Connecticut worked together to establish probable cause to charge Valente.",
      "A criminal complaint was filed, and that led to a search of the storage unit he had rented in Salem, New Hampshire.",
      "At 9 p.m., federal agents found Valente there dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. They also found a satchel, two guns and more evidence from the attacks, according to investigators.",
      "A joint statement from the FBI and ATF said forensic testing linked one of the guns to the Brown University shooting and the other to the murder of Loureiro in Brookline.",
      "The Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico in Portugal then confirmed that Valente had been a student at its Institute for Plasmas and Nuclear Fusion, studying for a degree in Engineering Physics between 1995 and 2000. MIT professor Nuno Loureiro took the courses during the same period, the institute said.",
      "\"My understanding is that they did know each other,\" Foley told reporters late Thursday night.",
      "She would not comment in a news conference Thursday night on any ballistics evidence from the shootings.",
      "\"He was sophisticated in hiding his tracks,\" Foley said of the suspect.",
      "The motive for the killings is still under investigation. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said investigators believe Valente acted alone.",

    "story": [
      "By the time it finally ended, five full days after the shooting, the manhunt for the Brown University gunman surpassed the four-day search for the Boston Marathon bombers and was on par with the five-day pursuit of Luigi Mangione in the UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting case.",
      "In the days the gunman was on the run, investigators say he went on to shoot and kill prominent MIT professor\u00a0Nuno Loureiro\u00a0at his home in the Boston area.",
      "The suspect, identified as former Brown grad student Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, was found dead by suicide in a New Hampshire storage unit Thursday night, police said.",
      "The manhunt was complicated by the early misidentification of a person of interest and limited, low-quality video footage.",
      "A timeline of the events shows a few key points where the investigation struggled \u2014 until\u00a0a Reddit tipster provided crucial information that police say led them to the shooter.",
      "Early misidentification of a person of interest",
      "The morning after the shooting, FBI Director Kash Patel announced on X that authorities had detained a person of interest overnight. Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said in a news briefing that the city could \"breathe a little easier.\"",
      "But later in the day, officials released the person after determining that he\u00a0had no involvement\u00a0in the shooting.",
      "Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said that some evidence had \"pointed to\" the initial person of interest, but that the investigation now \"points in a different direction.\" Providence Police Chief Colonel Oscar L. Perez Jr. said the detention was \"not a mistake\" but \"just how investigations work.\"",
      "Multiple law enforcement sources told CBS News on Monday that the investigation had fully moved away from that person, and that investigators \"had to effectively restart after early missteps\" set the process \"back by several hours.\" Officials acknowledged that the case was behind, especially as leads typically narrow after an early window.",
      "Patel and the FBI have faced scrutiny before\u00a0for their use of social media in high-profile cases, notably after Charlie Kirk's assassination, when Patel posted on X that a suspect was in custody, then backtracked two hours later.",
      "Poor images slowed identification",
      "Authorities later shared footage of a second person of interest who they believed was the shooter. But the images released to the public \u2014 even\u00a0an \"enhanced\" video\u00a0\u2014 were blurry and did not clearly show the person's face. The man was dressed in dark clothing and wearing a hat and face covering.",
      "Officials have said part of the Brown University building where the shooting occurred lacked cameras, citing its age.",
      "\"There are fewer, if any, cameras in that location, I imagine because it's an older building,\" Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee said in a news briefing.",
      "Brown University said in a statement that the campus has \"an expansive network of security cameras,\" more than 1,200 in all, but acknowledged that cameras \"do not extend to every hallway, classroom, laboratory and office across the 250+ buildings on campus.\"",
      "Video obtained from the neighborhood shows the second person of interest walking along a few streets near campus about two hours before the shooting, but his trail was lost after leaving the crime scene.",
      "Investigators re-canvassed the area around the campus on Monday, according to multiple law enforcement sources, and collected CCTV footage from homes and local businesses to attempt to reconstruct the suspect's movements and identify vehicles or escape routes that may have been used.",
      "However, it wasn't until a Reddit user posted comments about his encounters with the man, and shared information about the car he was driving, that law enforcement was able to pick up the trail and identify who they were looking for. They said they received the information from the Reddit tipster, known as \"John,\" on Tuesday, Dec. 16.",
      "By that time, another killing had already taken place.",
      "Providence Police Chief Col. Oscar Perez acknowledged the department was under a lot of pressure to solve the case.",
      "\"There was a lot of criticism, too, as far as, like, how long has the investigation taken,\" Perez told CBS News in an interview Friday. \"And sometimes, you know, it's just that when you're not a police officer, you don't understand how this works,\" he said, explaining that investigators have to evaluate all the leads and physical evidence, which can be a painstaking process.",
      "\"And so it takes work and \u2026 you can't do that within minutes. Sometimes it takes days,\" Perez said.",
      "Connecting the dots with a suspect on the run",
      "An FBI special agent said in\u00a0charging documents\u00a0that there is probable cause to believe the same gunman who committed the mass shooting at Brown on Saturday, Dec. 13, then traveled from Rhode Island to Massachusetts to murder Lourerio, who was shot at his home on Monday, Dec. 15.",
      "Following the Reddit user's tip, investigators determined that a gray Nissan Sentra rental car was captured on license-plate readers near Brown University from Dec. 1 to Dec. 12.",
      "When police showed the tipster, \"John,\" two of those vehicle photos, known as Flock images, he said, \"Holy s---. That might be it.\"",
      "CCTV images from the day before the shooting also captured an individual in the area of Brown University \"consistent with images\" of the suspect that were taken from surveillance video at the agency in Boston where he rented the car. Rental car records confirmed the suspect's identity, police said.",
      "At some point after the shooting, the suspect left Providence and drove back to Boston. The charging documents say Google email and voice accounts associated with the shooter were logged onto from IP addresses near Boston University on Sunday, Dec. 14.",
      "At that point, police still didn't know who they were looking for in the shooting that killed two students, sophomore Ella Cook and freshman Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, and wounded nine others.",
      "Then on the evening of Monday, Dec. 15, Lourerio was shot at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts. He died the next day.",
      "The professor's home is about a half mile from the area where the suspect logged into his Google accounts the day before. Police say surveillance footage also captured images of a vehicle matching the description of the suspect's rental car leaving the area after Lourerio was shot, and Foley said, \"there's video of him entering that apartment building\" that night.",
      "While the motive is still shrouded in mystery, investigators believe the suspect and the MIT professor had crossed paths before. Both studied physics at the same university program in their native Portugal in the late 1990s.",
      "\"My understanding is that they did know each other,\" said Leah Foley, U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts.",
      "The tip from \"John\" about the suspicious man and his car in Providence came in to police the day after Loureiro's shooting, and the investigation accelerated.",
      "\"He blew this case right open,\" Neronha said.",
      "Sources told CBS News that once they had the name of the suspect, they found the storage unit he'd rented in New Hampshire and knew to search there.",
      "That's where they found his body Thursday night \u2014 two days after he had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, an autopsy revealed.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-appealing-james-comey-letitia-james-dismissals/",
    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 18:30:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge ruled that Lindsey Halligan, the prosecutor who secured the indictments against them, was unlawfully appointed to her role as interim U.S. attorney.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department said Friday it will appeal a pair of decisions tossing out the criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the prosecutor who secured the indictments against them, was unlawfully appointed to her role as interim U.S. attorney.",
      "The appeal was expected, as the White House and Attorney Pam Bondi had indicated that the Trump administration would ask the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to review last month's rulings from U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie. But it comes as Halligan and Justice Department lawyers have so far twice failed to secure a new indictment against James.",
      "Halligan's name is on the notices of appeal, and she is listed\u00a0as \"United States attorney and special attorney.\"",
      "Currie ruled that Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney violated federal law and the Constitution's Appointments Clause and ordered the criminal charges brought against Comey and James to be dismissed.",
      "\"I conclude that all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey's indictment, constitute unlawful exercises of executive power and must be set aside,\" Currie wrote in her\u00a0opinion in the Comey case, a line that she repeated in her\u00a0ruling in the James case.",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who was a member of President Trump's defense team in the since-ended criminal case stemming from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents. She was tapped by Attorney General Pam Bondi to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in eastern Virginia in September.",
      "Soon after Halligan temporarily took the helm of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, she secured indictments against Comey and James. Comey was charged with two counts stemming from testimony he gave to Congress in September 2020 and pleaded not guilty. He was indicted just days before the statute of limitations for the offenses was set to expire.",
      "James faced charges of bank fraud and pleaded not guilty.",
      "Since Currie ordered the cases against Comey and James to be tossed out, Halligan has attempted to secure a new indictment against James. But grand juries in Norfolk and Alexandria, Virginia, have each\u00a0separately refused to indict James again.",
      "It's unclear whether Halligan has sought to re-indict Comey, though Currie suggested in her November decision that prosecutors could not seek a new indictment in his case because the statute of limitations expired at the end of September. Additionally, a separate federal judge in Washington, D.C., blocked the Justice Department from accessing material it seized from one of Comey's friends more than five years ago, which Halligan had relied on when she presented the case against Comey to a grand jury in September.",
      "Comey and James had also moved to have the criminal charges against them tossed out on the grounds that their respective prosecutions were vindictive and selective. Judges overseeing their cases had not yet ruled on those bids, however, when their cases were dismissed.",

      "\"Rob was my oldest friend. It's that simple. He's the person that I've known the longest. I met him when I was 14 years old. So I'm still in that not believing it stage,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Brooks said he still finds himself dialing his pal's number to chat, and then freezes when he realizes what he's done.",

      "Kathy Bates",

      "\"If I hadn't done 'Misery,' it would be like George Bailey going back and seeing what his life would have been like if he had never been there,\" she said. \"I wouldn't have had some of the friends that I have now. I wouldn't have had the richness in my life. I quite frankly probably would have stayed in the theater and I doubt I would have had a movie career. I might have dropped out altogether.\"",
      "Kiefer Sutherland",
      "Kiefer Sutherland who played Lt. Jonathan Kendrick in the 1992 legal drama \"A Few Good Men\" said Reiner had an unforgettable presence on set as director. He recalled the tense courtroom scene where Jack Nicholson \u2013 Colonel Nathan Jessup \u2013 had to deliver his now famous line, \"You can't handle the truth!\"",

      "\"No one said a word, and Rob went up to Jack Nicholson and whispered in his ear, 'Do you want to do another one?' And Jack Nicholson said, 'Well, we're here,'\" Sutherland recalled. \"So they did another one, and it was just as extraordinary.\"",
      "The actors planned a marathon filming day, but Sutherland said Reiner was so blown away by Nicholson's performance that day that he sent everyone home early.",

      "Robert Seamans, a professor of management and organizations at the NYU Stern School of Business, thinks such roles are just the kind of role that AI will create. Indeed, he expects AI to be a part of virtually every worker's future, much as the internet became an integral part of daily life decades ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the workers best positioned to benefit as generative AI tools like ChatGPT reshape the labor market will be those who understand how to use the technology to maximize their own performance, as well as how to test and train AI, Seamans said.",

      "People who understand AI and, equally important, who are adept at explaining how it works in simple terms, will find themselves in demand, Seamans predicted. For example, he expects companies to recruit what he calls \"AI explainers\" or \"AI translators\" who can help managers better understand an organization's AI tools.",
      "\"The job is to provide a simple layperson's understanding of what's happening under the hood,\" he said.",
      "\"They don't need to be the best computer scientist at creating and running large language models, but they need to understand enough about it so it's clear they're competent in that area and be able to talk about it to a broader audience,\" Seamans added.",
      "Another common role Seamans expects to emerge in the age of artificial intelligence is the \"AI auditor\" who\u00a0checks AI for bias or factual inaccuracies.",
      "\"They would need to know enough about an AI system to run tests on it, and know what benchmarks to use to determine whether bias is there or not,\" he said. \"They could potentially have a legal background, too.\"",

    "story": [
      "Law enforcement officials say the same gunman who opened fire at Brown University also shot and killed an MIT professor two days later. The suspect in both shootings has been identified as Claudio Manuel Neves Valente.",
      "Authorities said\u00a0he was found dead\u00a0in New Hampshire Thursday night following an intensive manhunt. An autopsy report released Friday indicates that he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, and that he's estimated to have died on Tuesday, Dec. 16 \u2014 two days before he was found.",
      "Two students were killed and nine were wounded in the shooting at Brown, in Providence, Rhode Island, on Saturday. Then\u00a0MIT professor Nuno Loureiro\u00a0was gunned down at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, on Monday.",
      "Investigators believe the suspect acted alone, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said.",
      "Here's what we know so far about the suspect.",
      "Who is the suspect in the Brown University and MIT professor shootings?",
      "The suspect in the shootings was identified by authorities as 48-year-old Claudio Manuel Neves Valente.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts posted a photo of Neves Valente on social media late Thursday night.",
      "He was a Portuguese national whose last known residence was in Miami, Florida, officials said during a news conference Thursday night.",
      "He studied at Brown as a grad student in 2000-2001 and then moved to the U.S. in 2017 after receiving a green card through a visa lottery program, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a social media post late Thursday.",
      "Where was the suspect found?",
      "Officials said Neves Valente died by suicide at a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, where he had rented a unit. A satchel and two firearms were found with him.",
      "\"We are 100% confident that this is our target, and that this case is closed from a perspective of pursuing people involved,\" Neronha said.",
      "But so far the motive remains a mystery.",
      "\"I don't think we have any idea why now, or why \u2014 why Brown? Why these students? Why this classroom? That is really unknown to us. It may become clear, I hope that it does, but it hasn't as of right now,\" Neronha said.",
      "How was the suspect identified?",
      "Security footage and hotel, rental car and storage unit records all helped in the case. And police said\u00a0information from a tipster who encountered the suspect near Brown University was key to making the identification.",
      "Leah Foley, U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, provided a timeline at a news conference Thursday night.",
      "She said the suspect stayed in a hotel room in Boston in late November, and then on Dec. 1 he rented a gray Nissan Sentra with Florida plates from a car rental agency in Boston and drove \"to the vicinity\" of Brown University. Providence is about an hour's drive from Boston.",
      "His car was \"observed intermittently\" between Dec. 1 and Dec. 12 in the area of Brown University, Foley said. The shooting took place on Saturday, Dec. 13, and suspect then returned to Massachusetts, where MIT professor Nuno Loureiro was shot at his home in Brookline on Monday, Dec. 15.",
      "A tipster known as \"John\" in a Providence police affidavit reported that he encountered a man near Brown resembling the person of interest. John began posting on the social media forum Reddit that police should look into \"possibly a rental\" gray Nissan.",
      "Following up on that tip \"blew this case right open,\" Neronha said.",
      "\"Investigators identified the vehicle that he had rented in Boston and drove to Rhode Island,\" Foley said, and they also obtained footage of him from the rental car location. She said a financial investigation also linked him to the car and hotels.",
      "Security footage also showed the suspect within a half-mile of Loureiro's apartment, and there was footage showing him entering \"in the location of the professor's apartment,\" Foley said.",
      "About an hour later, he was seen entering the storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire.",
      "When he was found dead Thursday he was dressed in the same clothes that he was seen wearing right after Loureiro's murder, Foley said.",
      "\"We found records, with the help of the FBI and others, that that was his storage area,\" Neronha said.",
      "What was the suspect's connection to Brown University?",
      "Neves Valente was enrolled at Brown University from the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2001, Brown's president, Christina Paxson, said. He was admitted to the graduate school to study in a PhD physics program.",
      "Paxson said he took a leave of absence in April 2001, before formally withdrawing on July 31, 2003.",
      "He was only enrolled in physics classes while at the school, which were held in the same building where the shooting took place.",
      "\"The majority of physics classes at Brown have always been held at the Barus & Holley classrooms and labs,\" Paxson said.",
      "What was the suspect's connection to the MIT professor?",
      "Both the suspect and MIT professor Nuno Loureiro were from Portugal and attended the same university program there.",
      "In a statement, the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico in Portugal confirmed that Neves Valente had been a student at its Institute for Plasmas and Nuclear Fusion, studying for a degree in Engineering Physics between 1995 and 2000. Loureiro took the course during the same period, the institute said.",
      "\"My understanding is that they did know each other,\" Foley said.",
      "They were close in age \u2014 the suspect was 48 and Loureiro was 47 \u2014 and both studied physics. Loureiro went on to become a prominent scholar in the field of fusion energy research and was director of MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:13:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Economists had expected CPI to rise at an annual rate of 3% last month.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.7% in November, cooler than economists had forecast and a sign that price pressures may be easing.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 3% on an annual basis last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. In the most recent inflation reading, from September, the CPI rate rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "November's cooler inflation data comes after prices had inched higher throughout much of the year, with economists pointing to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "The CPI tracks the changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, providing a snapshot of price changes on everyday items such as food and apparel.",
      "So-called core inflation, or CPI data that excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.6% over the past 12 months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 3% increase for that measure.",
      "Food prices rose 2.6% on an annual basis in November, down from 3.1% in September.",
      "Thursday's report provides the first glimpse of recent inflation data since late October, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released September CPI data.",
      "Data collection was disrupted due to the government shutdown, which delayed the September and November CPI reports. The Labor Department on Thursday said it didn't collect October data due to the shutdown, but said it was able to retroactively acquire some non-survey data for the month.",
      "What economists are saying",
      "Wall Street analysts cautioned that the November inflation figures may be distorted by the government shutdown, which disrupted data collection. The December CPI report should offer a clearer signal of whether the latest reading is a one-off or evidence that price pressures are truly easing, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's possible that this does reflect a genuine drop off in inflationary pressures, but such a sudden stop, particularly in the more-persistent services components like rent or shelter is very unusual, at least outside of a recession,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Bernard Yaros, lead economist at Oxford Economics, also said some \"caution is warranted\" in interpreting the November inflation data, given the housing component was unusually weak in the prior two months.",
      "Some analysts said the softer-than-expected inflation reading paves the way for an interest rate cut in January. That helped boost the three major stock indices, which all traded higher Thursday morning after the release of the CPI data. Interest rate traders now place the likelihood of a January rate cut at around 27%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.",
      "However, given gaps in the data, the Fed may put more weight on the December CPI release, which will be issued before the central bank's next interest rate decision in January, according to Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The Fed will instead focus on the December CPI released in mid-January, just two weeks before its next meeting, as a more accurate bellwether for inflation,\" he said in an email.",
      "New York Federal Reserve President John Williams told\u00a0CNBC on Friday that data distortions likely pushed the CPI reading down by \"probably a tenth or so.\"",
      "What it means for Americans' wallets",
      "Food prices are cooling, although certain grocery items remain expensive. Coffee has climbed 18.8% from a year ago, and ground beef has risen 14.9%.",
      "Some retailers have gradually passed along the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers, fueling concerns about higher prices. Still, tariff-driven inflation has been milder than many feared, Garrett Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said in an email ahead of the CPI release.",
      "In some cases, companies have absorbed the added costs rather than raising prices, while others stockpiled goods ahead of the tariffs, helping blunt price increases.",
      "In November, President Trump cut tariffs on a slate of products that the U.S. typically imports, including bananas and coffee, as his administration sought to address consumer frustrations over\u00a0affordability.",
      "While inflation is expected to ease next year, Americans could continue to face cost pressures, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon.",
      "\"I don't think Americans should brace for surging inflation, but I do think there is a growing risk of a persistent affordability crisis,\" he told CBS News earlier this month. \"Given prices are rising at a faster clip than they normally would, and income trends are slowing.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:06:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Millions of people with an Affordable Care Act health plan face a massive jump in premiums next year \u2014 this chart shows just how much.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are bracing for higher health costs in 2026, as subsidies that help them pay for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire on December 31.",
      "Experts warn\u00a0that a failure in Congress to extend the tax credits could be financially devastating for individual policyholders, while also raising health care costs as a whole. Roughly 22 million Americans receive the ACA subsidies, which were created in 2021 to lower households' monthly premiums.",
      "New\u00a0data from investment adviser SmartAsset projects how much people around the U.S. with an ACA plan would have paid on average for coverage in 2025 if they hadn't received the enhanced subsidies. As the analysis shows, monthly premiums for the government health insurance would've been hundreds of dollars higher.",
      "In Mississippi, where around 11% of residents are enrolled in an ACA plan, participants would have seen their average monthly premiums jump from $41 to $605, a 1,376% increase, SmartAsset found. In West Virginia, enrollees' premiums would have risen an average of 1,058%.",
      "A spokesperson for SmartAsset said the analysis captures 2025 costs, but noted the data amounts to a \"close approximation\" of how much more people with ACA coverage could expect to pay next year without the tax credits.",
      "SmartAsset used public records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' 2025 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period to calculate the average cost of ACA plans.",
      "The exact price hikes people could see next will depend on a range of factors, including their insurance plan, age, household income, health status and where they live, according to a spokesperson from KFF. The health policy group estimates that annual out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for the 22 million ACA enrollees who rely on the subsidies.",
      "What is the status of the ACA tax credits?",
      "The tax credits are set to lapse at the end of the year. Democratic lawmakers have pushed for an extension\u00a0but lack enough support in the Republican-led Congress. And while the House passed a health care bill this week that includes several policies favored by Republicans, it excludes an extension of the tax credits and faces hurdles in the Senate.",
      "Both chambers of Congress have left Washington until early next year, making it all but certain that the tax credits will expire on December 31. But four GOP members this week signed a Democratic measure to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years, teeing up a final vote early next year.",
      "If Congress fails to solve the tax credit issue, some enrollees will qualify for a smaller subsidy, while others could lose eligibility completely, according to KFF.",
      "With sharply higher ACA costs on the horizon, the Congressional Budget Office estimates\u00a0that about 4 million people could drop their health insurance altogether. Experts say that could lead to higher costs for people with other types of health insurance because hospitals will have\u00a0to provide more uncompensated care for those lacking coverage.",
      "\"Hospitals can only reconcile that by raising their prices for everybody,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News last week.",

    "story": [
      "As the public begins to sort through the deluge of files related to Jeffrey Epstein released by the Department of Justice on Friday, some of the material might seem familiar.",
      "That's because there's been a steady stream of material made public from various investigations into the deceased sex offender during the last year, some of which undoubtedly overlaps with the voluminous Justice Department release mandated by federal legislation passed in November.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act gave Attorney General Pam Bondi until Dec. 19 to make public all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials in possession of the Justice Department, the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices (with some personal information redacted to protect victims).",
      "Some of that material \u2014 tens of thousands of pages \u2014 has already been released by a House committee that subpoenaed the Justice Department and Epstein's estate. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have indicated they're still expecting even more documents to be produced by Epstein's estate in the future, as well as material from banking institutions he did business with. They've pledged to release more documents as they come in.",
      "Among other things, the documents released so far include emails and text messages showing that Epstein continued to court the rich and famous right up until his 2019 arrest.",
      "Here is an overview of documents already disclosed to the public:",
      "Dec. 18, 2025:\u00a0Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a batch of 68 photos from a trove of about 95,000 the committee obtained from Epstein's estate. Among them were photos of passages from \"Lolita\" written on a woman's body; a picture of a Ukrainian passport, with details blacked out; and text messages about 18-year-old from Russia.",
      "Dec. 12, 2025: Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released another selection of photos from Epstein's estate.The photos include snapshots of prominent figures like President Trump, former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, filmmaker Woody Allen and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The photos do not implicate any of those pictured in Epstein's crimes.",
      "Dec. 4, 2025: Democrats on the Oversight Committee released 73 photos and four videos of Epstein's estate on the 72-acre island known as Little St. James that he owned in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Epstein allegedly exploited underage girls for sex at the island, and he had stakes in businesses in the U.S. territory.",
      "Nov. 12, 2025: The House Oversight Committee released 20,000 records from Epstein's estate, including scores of emails. The disgraced financier often referenced Mr. Trump, writing of the president at one point: \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.\" Other messages showed him bantering with influential Harvard professor and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and attempting to reconnect with Bill Gates. None of those men have been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Oct. 30, 2025: Buckingham Palace announced that it was stripping the king's younger brother of his titles, relegating Prince Andrew to his civilian name, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. The announcement came weeks after news outlets in the United Kingdom revealed a 2011 email in which Andrew told Epstein, \"we are in this together.\" The former prince has been accused of sexually assaulting a young Virginia Giuffre, who said she was trafficked by Epstein; Andrew settled Giuffre's lawsuit but denied wrongdoing.",
      "Sept. 8, 2025: House Oversight released a tranche from Epstein's estate, including a 2003 birthday note to Epstein that appeared to be signed by Mr. Trump. The letter, written inside a drawing of what appears to be the form of a woman, ends with, \"A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday \u2014 and may every day be another wonderful secret. Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "The president denied penning the message, and Republicans accused Democrats of cherry-picking documents.",
      "Sept. 2, 2025: The panel released more than 33,000 pages of files from the Justice Department, including court documents, flight records, and a video of Epstein's cell block from before his death that includes a minute missing from earlier videos. Many of the documents were already in the public domain. Democratic lawmakers said just 3% of the pages were new. Those disclosures included logs of flights on Epstein's plane from 2000 to 2014 that were kept by Customs and Border Protection, according to Democrats.",
      "Aug. 22, 2025: The Justice Department released a transcript and audio recording of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's interview with convicted Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for involvement in trafficking. Maxwell said Mr. Trump \"was always very cordial and very kind to me.\" She said Mr. Trump and Epstein \"seemed friendly,\" but she \"only ever saw them in social settings.\" She said she \"never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way.\"",
      "Feb. 27, 2025: The White House gave a group of 15 conservative influencers binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" Several influencers said the binders contained little new info.",
      "Prior to 2025: Other documents, including contacts, schedules, flight logs and depositions, were made public previously, often as part of Epstein and Maxwell's criminal cases and in connection with civil lawsuits filed by survivors.",

D'Ambrosio said\u00a0in a statement. \"He ran this empire from prison, shielded by corruption, and in collaboration with a narco-state cartel intent on flooding the United States with cocaine.\"",
      "The U.S. State Department has offered up to a\u00a0$5 million reward\u00a0for information that leads to Guerrero Flores' arrest and/or conviction.",
      "Prosecutors allege Guerrero Flores operated from Tocor\u00f3n Prison, where he directed members to commit a wide array of crimes, including murders, sex trafficking and money laundering. Alongside other top leaders, he allegedly collected \"causa\" or income fees from these crimes. Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge Ricky J. Patel said in a statement that the leader \"grew TdA from a Venezuela-based prison gang to the vile, vicious organization it has become.\"",
      "CBS News' partner network BBC News\u00a0reported that Guerrero Flores was in and out of Tocor\u00f3n for more than a decade. He escaped in 2012 by bribing a guard and was then rearrested in 2013. In 2018, he was sentenced to 17 years in prison for the crimes of homicide, drug trafficking, identity theft and concealment of weapons of war, among other charges, the BBC reported.",
      "Within the prison walls, Guerrero Flores lived \"like a king,\" with a swimming pool, nightclub and television systems, according to the BBC. Thousands of police and military personnel were sent in 2023 to dismantle the prison's criminal gangs, but when they arrived, Guerrero Flores was gone. He remains at large.",
      "Gang members and associates left Venezuela and spread throughout North, South, and Central America and Spain, prosecutors allege. In recent years, the gang has expanded, recruiting from among the more than 7.7 million Venezuelans who have fled economic turmoil in their homeland and migrated to other Latin American countries or the U.S.",
      "In January, President Trump labeled Tren de Aragua\u00a0a foreign terrorist organization, alongside other gangs and cartels, and his administration has since ratcheted up pressure on Venezuela and its president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In recent months, the U.S. has amassed a large military presence in the Caribbean and carried out multiple\u00a0strikes\u00a0on boats it claims are carrying drugs from Venezuela.",
      "Robert Clifford, former director for the FBI's MS-13 National Gang Task Force, said he sees the indictment as an evolution in how U.S. law enforcement \"pursues a transnational criminal organization like TdA.\" Clifford said that for years, local law enforcement investigated MS-13 as a prison gang instead of viewing the members as part of a multinational criminal organization.",
      "In the years since, the law enforcement approach to investigating transnational criminal organizations has shifted, Clifford said, and Thursday's indictment is \"a model of state, local and federal cooperation and that is the only way to defeat a well-entrenched organization like TdA.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:04:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board told its shareholders that Paramount Skydance's offer \"provides inadequate value\" for the business.",
    "story": [
      "Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday urged shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid, arguing that it created \"significant risks and costs\" for the company and that Netflix's prior offer provides better value.",
      "The move follows competing bids for Warner Bros. Discovery, whose storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series. Netflix agreed on December 5 to buy a part of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, while Paramount Skydance followed on December 8 with an all-cash offer for the entirety of the media conglomerate.",
      "In making the bid for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison described it as a \"superior all-cash offer.\" Ellison said that its bid, combining the assets of Warner Bros. Discovery with Paramount Skydance (the parent of CBS News), would face an easier path through the government regulatory process.",
      "Paramount is offering $30 a share for the entire company, while Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros.'s HBO as well as its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television, for $27.75 a share.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's stock traded on Wednesday at $28.30 a share.",
      "Paramount Skydance on Wednesday said that it is sticking with its $30 per share offer, expressing confidence that the bid offers \"superior value\" to Netflix's bid.",
      "Paramount Skydance added that it believes a merger with Warner Bros. Discovery provides \"a faster, more certain path to completion than the Netflix transaction.\"",
      "\"I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders, who clearly understand the benefits of our offer,\" Ellison said in a statement. \"We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers and the creative industries.\"",
      "Why Warner Bros. Discovery prefers Netflix",
      "In recommending that shareholders reject Paramount Skydance's bid, Warner Bros. Discovery said its board concluded the two offers pose an equal regulatory risk. Warner Bros. Discovery also said its analysis found that Netflix's offer, which includes cash and Netflix stock, is superior.",
      "It also raised concerns about Paramount Skydance's $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which Warner Bros. Discovery said \"there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind.\" David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person, with a net worth of $243 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's recommendation comes shortly after one of Paramount Skydance's financial partners in the deal, Affinity Partners, said it had dropped out of the hostile bid. Affinity is the private equity firm founded by President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.",
      "An Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that, while it continued to believe in the \"strong strategic rationale\" for Paramount Skydance's offer, it had decided to pull back because \"the dynamics of the investment have changed significantly since we initially became involved in October.\"",
      "In a letter sent to shareholders, Warner Bros. Discovery's board said it believed Netflix's finances are also in better shape, with a stronger credit rating and a larger market capitalization.",
      "\"The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet,\" the letter stated.",
      "Paramount Skydance's credit rating is \"at or only a notch above 'junk' status from the two leading rating agencies,\" while its market valuation stands at $15 billion, Warner Bros. Discovery added.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery also expressed concern about Paramount Skydance's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its offer.",
      "\"The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change,\" its shareholder letter stated. \"As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time.\"",
      "While Wednesday's letter to shareholders means Paramount's is not the offer favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide to tender their shares in favor of Paramount's offer for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery and TNT.",

    "story": [
      "Seven wild Asiatic elephants were killed and a calf was injured when a high-speed passenger train collided with a herd crossing the tracks in India's northeastern state of Assam early Saturday, local authorities said.",
      "The train driver spotted the herd of about 100 elephants and used the emergency brakes, but the train still hit some of the animals, Indian Railways spokesman Kapinjal Kishore Sharma told The Associated Press.",
      "Five train coaches and the engine derailed following the impact, but there were no human casualties, Sharma said.",
      "Veterinarians carried out autopsies on the dead elephants, which were to be buried later in the day.",
      "The accident site is a forested area around 78 miles southeast of Assam's capital city of Guwahati. Railway tracks in the state are frequented by elephants, but Indian Railways said in a statement the accident location wasn't a designated elephant corridor. Trains that pass through the country's 150 wildlife corridors are under government orders to reduce speed to prevent collisions.",
      "The Rajdhani Express train, traveling from Sairang in Mizoram state bordering Myanmar, was bound for the national capital of New Delhi with 650 passengers onboard when it hit with elephants.",
      "\"We delinked the coaches which were not derailed, and the train resumed its journey for New Delhi. Around 200 passengers who were in the five derailed coaches have been moved to Guwahati in a different train,\" Sharma said.",
      "Speeding trains hitting wild elephants is not rare in Assam, which is home to an estimated 7,000 wild Asiatic elephants, one of the highest concentrations of the pachyderm in India. Since 2020, at least a dozen elephants have been killed by speeding trains across the state. 20 elephants are killed in train accidents every year on average, according to Indian government data. The deaths usually happen when elephants cross railway lines that run through their habitats.",
      "The country recently opened an elephant hospital\u00a0in Mathura. The southern state of Tamil Nadu has also launched an artificial intelligence and machine learning-enabled surveillance system meant to help prevent elephant deaths on railways.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-putin-ukraine-war-kyiv-claims-strike-shadow-fleet-tanker-mediterranean/",
    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 09:44:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Putin claims no \"willingness from Ukraine\" to negotiate a peace deal as he touts battlefield gains, and Kyiv claims a brazen strike on a ship far from Russia.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that his country was \"not seeing the willingness from Ukraine\" to negotiate a peace deal, again blaming the country he ordered a full-scale invasion of nearly four years ago for the continuation of a war he's refused even to acknowledge is a war.",
      "Putin said he was open to a negotiated end to what he calls a \"special military operation,\" but only on his terms, insisting, as he has for years, that Ukraine must accept a massive, formal forfeiture of occupied territory and some degree of national demilitarization \u2014   both terms that Kyiv has rejected.",
      "The Russian president said his forces had \"fully seized strategic initiative\" in the conflict and would take even more ground along the roughly 600-mile front line in eastern Ukraine before the end of the year.",
      "\"Our troops are advancing all across the line of contact, faster in some areas or slower in some others, but the enemy is retreating in all sectors,\" Putin said during the live, wide-ranging end-of-year news conference that has been a hallmark of his tenure.",
      "His remarks came as Ukraine claimed a dramatic new blow against Russia, but also as divisions among European nations over how to keep supporting Kyiv \u2014 fueled, many believe, by Moscow's pressure tactics \u2014 were laid bare.",
      "Putin's latest casting of blame for the war at both Kyiv and its backers in Europe also came as a senior\u00a0Russian envoy prepared to meet again for talks with Trump administration officials in Florida this weekend. The White House is pushing hard for a negotiated resolution to the conflict that President Trump had vowed to end quickly when he took office.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday called proposals being negotiated with the U.S. \"very workable,\" suggesting they could be finalized in a matter of days, allowing American officials to discuss with their Russian counterparts.",
      "Ukraine claims drone strike on Russian \"shadow fleet\" tanker in Mediterranean",
      "Ukraine has been defending itself with the support of the U.S. and its European partners, and as Putin spoke in Moscow, Kyiv claimed a significant expansion of its wartime resistance, with a first purported attack on an oil tanker said to be part of Russia's sanctions-violating \"shadow fleet\" in the Mediterranean.",
      "In a statement, Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency said Friday that it had \"struck a tanker belonging to Russia's 'shadow fleet' in neutral waters in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time,\" touting it as an \"unprecedented special operation more than 2,000 km [1,200 miles] from the territory of our state.\"",
      "The SBU said it used aerial drones to disable the Oman-flagged oil tanker Qendil, which it said was empty at the time, and thus \"did not pose any threat to the ecological situation in the region.\"",
      "The SBU shared a black-and-white video, seemingly captured by a drone, of the purported strike that shows several explosions on the deck of a tanker.",
      "\"Russia used this tanker to circumvent sanctions and earn money that went to the war against Ukraine,\" a source in the SBU told CBS News. \"Therefore, from the point of view of international law and the laws and customs of war, this is an absolutely legitimate target for the SBU. The enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop and will strike it anywhere in the world, wherever it may be.\"",
      "Ukraine has long targeted\u00a0fuel tankers and\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0in Russian ports and on land as part of its efforts to undermine Moscow's war funding, but only this month has Kyiv acknowledged attacking vessels outside Russia's territorial waters. CBS News reported on the first such strikes, targeting tankers off the coasts of Turkey and West Africa, just over a week ago.",
      "The SBU said the new strike had disabled the Qendil, which ship tracking website MarineTraffic.com confirmed was located in the eastern Mediterranean as of Friday afternoon. According to MarineTraffic, the vessel \u2014   which has not been listed by the U.S. Treasury among the Russian shadow fleet ships subjected to sanctions \u2014   was sailing from the Indian port of Sikka to the Russian port of Ust-Luga.",
      "The U.S. government has sanctioned many vessels and maritime companies in an effort to crack down on Russia's shadow fleet, ships with often murky registration and ownership that Moscow allegedly uses to evade heavy Western sanctions on its energy products, providing vital revenue for its war effort.",
      "The Trump administration accuses several major oil producers, including Russia, Venezuela, and Iran, of using a global fleet of such ships, and just last week, U.S. military forces seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker\u00a0after it left a port in Venezuela, sources told CBS News.",
      "Armed personnel approached in helicopters and boarded the vessel, which was\u00a0sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury three years ago\u00a0for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian military and its proxies in the Middle East.",
      "Asked Friday about the strike on the Qendil during his news conference, Putin was dismissive, but vowed to respond.",
      "\"They're pursuing some utilitarian purposes,\" the Russian leader said, without confirming any specifics. \"They want to raise insurance premiums, but this will not bring about the result they desire. This is not going to disrupt the supplies. This would only create additional threats, and Russia is certainly going to respond.\"",
      "Despite divisions, EU agrees on financial lifeline for Ukraine",
      "The European Union, meanwhile, stepped up overnight to offer a support package for Ukraine worth more than $100 billion \u2014 but the bloc could not agree on proposals pushed by leaders to use frozen Russian assets to do it.",
      "After failing to agree on specifics, the EU ended up taking out an interest-free loan for Ukraine, against its own budget, intended to fund the country's military and economic needs for two years.",
      "EU leaders wanted to finance the aid package with the frozen Russian assets, but there was always resistance to that idea among some members \u2014   most notably Belgium, where much of the ringfenced Russian money is held.",
      "Putin renewed threats in his remarks on Friday that there would be severe consequences for European nations that chose to use the Russian money, held as part of the sanctions against Moscow.",
      "He said any such move would have been \"daylight robbery.\"",
      "\"Why can't this robbery be carried out? Because the consequences could be grave for the robbers,\" he said Friday.",
      "Russia has been accused repeatedly in recent months of waging a hybrid war against Ukraine's European partners, with a series of unclaimed drone incursions, including around airports and military bases, Russian warplanes violating European \u2014   and NATO \u2014   airspace, and other acts of alleged sabotage targeting vital infrastructure.",
      "\"If Europe had walked away today without an agreement, we would not only have failed Ukraine, we would have failed ourselves,\" Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said Friday, putting a positive spin on the agreement that was reached.",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also hailed the agreement for a \"zero-interest loan\" for Ukraine, and leaving room for the Russian assets to be leveraged in the future.",
      "\"These funds are sufficient to cover the military and budgetary needs of Ukraine for the two years to come,\" Merz said, noting that the frozen Russian assets will remain blocked unless and until Russia pays reparations to Ukraine for the huge damage inflicted during the war.",
      "\"If Russia does not pay reparations, we will \u2014   in full accordance with international law \u2014   make use of Russian immobilized assets for paying back the loan,\" the German leader said.",
      "Ukraine's government welcomed the deal, but made it clear that Kyiv still feels Russia's frozen assets should be accessed in support of its defense.",
      "\"Indeed, there are moments when one should keep in mind that 'Perfect is the enemy of good,'\" Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya said. \"It was a long night for European leaders, but they were able to come up with a workable result.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:33:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Australia will use a sweeping buyback scheme to \"get guns off our streets,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Sydney\u00a0\u2014 Australia will use a sweeping buyback scheme to \"get guns off our streets,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Friday, showing his government was keen to take quick action less than a week after a terrorist attack left 15 people dead at a Jewish holiday gathering on Sydney's famed Bondi Beach.",
      "Sajid Akram and his son Naveed are accused of opening fire on the festival, which was organized to mark the first day of Hanukkah on Sunday, in what was one of Australia's deadliest mass shootings.",
      "Just hours after the attack, Albanese vowed to toughen national gun laws that allowed 50-year-old Sajid to own six high-powered rifles.",
      "\"There is no reason someone living in the suburbs of Sydney needed this many guns,\" he said.",
      "Australia would pay gun owners to surrender \"surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms.\"",
      "Albanese said Monday that his government was \"prepared to take whatever action is necessary. Included in that is the need for tougher gun laws.\" He specifically suggested measures that could limit the number of guns a licensed owner can obtain, and mandating a review process for existing licenses.",
      "The prime minister said the federal government would evenly split the cost of the buyback program with Australia's state and territorial administrations, with further details to be worked out when lawmakers return to work next week.",
      "Investigation continues as Sydney remains on high alert",
      "Sajid Akram, 50, was killed in a gunfight with police, but his 24-year-old son Naveed survived. The unemployed bricklayer was charged earlier this week with 15 counts of murder, an act of terrorism, and dozens of other serious crimes after waking up from a coma in a Sydney hospital.",
      "Albanese said the attack was inspired by ISIS ideology, and Australian police are still investigating whether the pair may have met with Islamist extremists during a visit to the Philippines just a couple weeks before the shooting.",
      "They spent most of November in the south of the Asian nation, in a hotel in Davao City. A hotel employee told CBS News on Thursday that the father and son extended their stay week by week and paid in cash, and that they would go out during the day but return to the hotel every night, often bringing food back to eat in their room.",
      "He said staff noticed nothing particularly suspicious about the men during their nearly monthlong stay.",
      "Sydney, meanwhile, remains on high alert almost a week after the shootings.",
      "Armed police released seven men from custody on Friday, a day after detaining them on a tip they may have been plotting a \"violent act,\" as they reportedly headed for Bondi Beach.",
      "Police said there was no established link with the alleged Bondi gunmen and \"no immediate safety risk to the community.\"",
      "A second major Australian gun buyback spurred by a mass shooting",
      "The new buyback, assuming it is approved by lawmakers next week, will be the largest such government-funded program since 1996, when then-Prime Minister John Howard cracked down on firearms in the wake of another mass shooting, in which 35 people were killed in the town of Port Arthur.",
      "Just 12 days after that attack, Australian lawmakers approved legislation banning the sale and importation of all automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns; forcing people to present a legitimate reason, and wait 28 days, to buy any firearm, and initiating the massive, mandatory gun-buyback for banned weapons.",
      "The government confiscated and destroyed nearly 700,000 firearms in the wake of the law's adoption, reducing the number of gun-owning households by half.",
      "\"It is incontestable that gun-related homicides have fallen quite significantly in Australia,\" former premier Howard, who defied many in his own conservative party to usher in the 1996 law, told CBS News' Seth Doane two decades later, in 2016.",
      "In the 15 years before those laws were passed, there were 13 mass shootings in Australia. In the two decades after, there wasn't a single one. Gun homicides overall decreased by nearly 60% in the same period.",
      "Asked to respond to critics who said the fall in gun deaths did not necessarily happen because of the legislation, Howard told CBS News: \"The number of deaths from mass shootings, gun-related homicide has fallen, gun related suicide has fallen \u2026 Isn't that evidence? Or are we expected to believe that that was all magically going to happen? Come on!\"",
      "A study published earlier this year, however, found Australia still has some way to go to fully implement the 2016 legislation, called the National Firearms Agreement. The\u00a0paper, by the Australia Institute think tank, said some of the measures had yet to be brought into force 29 years later, and others were being inconsistently enforced across different states.",
      "The law \"was ambitious, politically brave, and necessary for public safety,\" the report concluded, lauding Howard's will to defy his fellow lawmakers.",
      "But \"Australia still allows minors to hold firearm licenses, still lacks a National Firearms Register, and still has inconsistent laws that make enforcement difficult,\" the group said, adding that overall gun ownership across the country had actually boomed over the last three decades.",
      "\"There are now over four million registered privately owned guns in Australia: 800,000 more than before the (1996) buyback,\" the institute said in its May report. \"Australians needs gun laws that live up to the Howard Government's bravery, and right now Australia does not have them.\"",
      "Albanese, along with state and territorial leaders, agreed on Monday to look at ways to bolster gun laws, including by accelerating the launch of the national firearms register called for in the 1996 legislation, making gun licenses available only to Australian citizens, and imposing new restrictions the types of weapons that are legal for licensees to own.",
      "A memorial at sea, and a day of reflection planned for Bondi Beach victims",
      "Hundreds of people plunged into the ocean at Bondi Beach on Friday to honor the 15 people killed in the terror attack, forming a massive ring in the sea on surf and paddle boards, as Albanese announced a national day of reflection to be observed on Sunday.",
      "Albanese urged Australians to light candles at 6:47 p.m. on Sunday, \"exactly one week since the attack unfolded.\"",
      "On Friday, swimmers and surfers paddled into a circle, bobbing in the gentle morning swell, splashing water and roaring with emotion.",
      "\"They slaughtered innocent victims, and today I'm swimming out there and being part of my community again to bring back the light,\" security consultant Jason Carr, 53, told AFP. \"We're still burying bodies. But I just felt it was important.\"",
      "Carole Schlessinger, a 58-year-old chief executive of a children's charity, said there was a \"beautiful energy\" at the ocean gathering. \"To be together is such an important way of trying to deal with what's going on.\"",
      "\"It was really lovely to be part of it,\" she said, adding: \"I personally am feeling very numb. I'm feeling super angry. I'm feeling furious.\"",

    "summary": "TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok has signed a deal to sell its U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Axios was first to report the deal.",
      "Under a law passed last year, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must either sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law set a January 2025 deadline, but President Trump has extended it several times, most recently until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order paving the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "At the time, a senior White House official said that under the proposed deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Axios reported Thursday that Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will collectively own 45% of the U.S. entity. Almost one-third of the new entity will be owned by current ByteDance investors, according to Axios.",
      "When reached by CBS News Thursday, an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said in September, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during a call in September. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Kremlin envoy will travel to Florida to discuss a U.S.-proposed plan to end the war in Ukraine, a U.S. official said Thursday, as European Union leaders weighed a major loan to help the Ukrainian government.",
      "Kirill Dmitriev, who heads Russia's sovereign wealth fund, is set to meet with President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in Miami on Saturday, according to an American official who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview a meeting that hasn't yet been publicly announced.",
      "The official said that Witkoff and Kushner will sit down with Dmitriev, after meetings with Ukrainian and European officials in Berlin earlier this week, in which they discussed U.S. security guarantees for Kyiv, territorial concessions and other aspects of the American-authored plan aimed at ending the war.",
      "Asked about the meeting in Miami, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Moscow was preparing for contacts with the U.S. to learn about the results of the meetings in Berlin, but didn't give further details.",
      "Witkoff will also meet Friday in Miami with senior officials from Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to discuss the next phase of the Gaza deal, a senior State Department official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The first phase of the Gaza peace plan began on Oct. 10, halting fighting and exchanging hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The next phase involves an international security force and other measures and has not yet started. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month he planned to meet with Mr. Trump soon to discuss \"opportunities for peace\" in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end nearly four years of fighting following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24, 2022, but Washington's efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Wednesday that Moscow would seek to extend its gains in Ukraine if Kyiv and its Western allies reject the Kremlin's demands in peace talks.",
      "Putin wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which was illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He also has demanded that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow's forces haven't captured yet.",
      "The Kremlin also insists that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warns that Moscow won't accept the deployment of any troops from NATO members and will view them as a \"legitimate target.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine's bid to join the trans-Atlantic alliance if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine's preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.",
      "At the same time, Zelenskyy has rejected Moscow's demands that it pull back its troops from other areas that Russia hasn't been able to take by force.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian officials were expected to hold negotiations in the U.S. on Friday or Saturday.",
      "\"We have progress in our dialogue with the American side regarding some of our points, they also speak with Russian side,\" Zelenskyy said during a visit to Brussels where EU leaders were set to decide whether to use tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to underwrite a loan to meet Ukraine's military and financial needs over the next two years.",
      "\"We are in the war and United States are decision-makers, who can really stop Putin and I count on this,\" Zelenskyy said. \"I really count on pressure from United States. Putin does not want to stop this war, but he can if United States will pressure more.\"",
      "As European allies gathered for the high-stakes summit, Russia and Ukraine exchanged more aerial attacks.",
      "Ukraine's air force said that Russia fired 82 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight, 63 of which were intercepted or jammed.",
      "In Cherkasy, Russian drones that targeted critical infrastructure wounded six people and left parts of the city without electricity, regional administration head Ihor Taburets said. Russian drones also wounded four people in Kryvyi Rih and seven near Odesa, according to local officials.",
      "In Russia's Rostov region, three people were killed by Ukrainian drones overnight, including two crew members of a cargo ship that was hit in Rostov-on-Don and another man who died in Bataysk. At least 10 others were wounded, according to local officials.",

      "He and another detainee had fled an overcrowded jail in the eastern city of Dijon after sawing through their cell bars with blades that investigators suspect were delivered by drone.",
      "Police tracked down the Marseille native some 310 miles south of the prison to a run-down apartment complex in the north of the city, known to be a drug-dealing hotspot.",
      "His fellow fugitive, a 32-year-old man accused of violence against a partner, was arrested a day after their escape, when police officers swooped down on a village bar where he was sipping coffee.",
      "The Dijon public prosecutor's office confirmed Thursday's arrest to AFP, without offering further details.",
      "France has some of the worst prison overcrowding in Europe, ranking third worst after Slovenia and Cyprus, according to a Council of Europe report\u00a0published\u00a0in July. In early October, the national average was 135 inmates per 100 places available. Dijon prison, built in 1853, is in poor condition, with 311 inmates for 180 places, according to the justice ministry.",
      "\"Old-fashioned\" blades",

      "The 32-year-old man had left a message in his cell, saying he had been held for \"too long,\" according to Dijon's public prosecutor, Olivier Caracotch. It was not immediately clear for how long he had been held.",
      "Union official Ahmed Saih, who represents prison officers at the jail, told AFP shortly after the breakout that the inmates used \"old-fashioned, manual saw blades,\" and that several such blades had been found previously.",
      "The saws were likely delivered by drones, Caracotch said following the escape, with several individuals already sentenced over drone deliveries to the same jail.",
      "In early October, French prisons hosted 135 inmates per 100 places available.",
      "The Dijon prison, built in 1853, is in poor condition, with 311 inmates for 180 places, according to the justice ministry.",
      "In the week before the breakout, Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin announced the Dijon facility was scheduled to receive $7.3 million as part of a program to eradicate mobile phones from six French prisons.",
      "The prison break came less than two weeks after another escape in the northwestern city of Rennes. A 37-year-old convict, who had more than a year left to serve for theft, fled on Nov. 14 during an outing with fellow prisoners to the city's planetarium.

    "summary": "The Trump administration's announcement of plan to sell Taiwan a record $10 billion worth of weapons draws an angry response from China.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, drawing an angry response from China.",
      "The State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by President Trump, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all.",
      "The tension between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest single economies, has ebbed and flowed during Mr. Trump's second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China's increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has vowed to reunify with the mainland. President Xi Jinping has not ruled out the use of force to make that a reality.",
      "If approved by Congress, it would be the largest-ever U.S. weapons package to Taiwan, exceeding the total amount of $8.4 billion in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan during the Biden administration.",
      "The eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS \u2014 similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia \u2014 worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.",
      "Other sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.",
      "The eight sales agreements amount to $11.15 billion, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry.",
      "The State Department said the sales serve \"U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"",
      "\"The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,\" the statements said.",
      "China blasts U.S.-Taiwan arms deals, says they \"will only end up backfiring\"",
      "China's Foreign Ministry attacked the move, saying it would violate diplomatic agreements between China and the U.S.; gravely harm China's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity; and undermine regional stability.",
      "\"The 'Taiwan independence' forces on the island seek independence through force and resist reunification through force, squandering the hard-earned money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a powder keg,\" said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun.",
      "\"This cannot save the doomed fate of 'Taiwan independence' but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war. The U.S. support for 'Taiwan Independence' through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed,\" Guo added.",
      "The U.S. role in Taiwan's \"self-defense capabilities\"",
      "Under federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.",
      "President Trump, in an exclusive interview with 60 Minutes aired in early November, said Chinese President Xi Jinping didn't bring up the issue of Taiwan when the two leaders met in late October, but he said Xi knew \"the consequences\" of taking military action against the island.",
      "\"He never brought it up. People were a little surprised at that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But they understand what's gonna happen. He has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, 'We would never do anything while President Trump is president,' because they know the consequences.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell whether he would order U.S. forces to defend Taiwan if Xi did move militarily on the island, Mr. Trump said, \"I can't give away my secrets.\"",
      "Taiwan's Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday expressed gratitude to the U.S. over the arms sale, which it said would help Taiwan maintain \"sufficient self-defense capabilities\" and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan's bolstering of its defense \"is the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,\" the ministry said.",
      "Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung similarly thanked the U.S. for its \"long-term support for regional security and Taiwan's self-defense capabilities,\" which he said are key for deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan from China's mainland.",
      "The arms sale comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Mr. Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan's opposition KMT party and some of its population.",
      "Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te last month announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome. The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033.",
      "The U.S. boost in military assistance to Taiwan was previewed in legislation adopted by Congress that Mr. Trump is expected to sign Thursday. Last week, the Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it unfairly targeted China as an aggressor. The U.S. Senate passed the bill Wednesday.",

      "A French court on Thursday sentenced a doctor to life in jail for\u00a0poisoning 30 child and adult patients, 12 of whom died, reportedly in an attempt to discredit coworkers.",
      "Frederic Pechier, 53, worked as an anesthetist in two clinics in the eastern city of Besancon, when patients went into cardiac arrest in suspicious circumstances between 2008 and 2017. Twelve could not be resuscitated.",
      "Pechier's youngest victim, 4-year-old Teddy, survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil surgery in 2016. The oldest victim was 89.",
      "\"You will be incarcerated immediately,\" presiding judge Delphine Thibierge said.",
      "Pechier, who has denied wrongdoing and had not been detained since the start of the probe, appeared unmoved. Members of his family broke down in tears.",
      "A lawyer from the firm representing him, Ornella Spatafora, said he would appeal.",
      "An investigation was launched in 2017, after suspicious cardiac arrests were recorded during operations on patients considered low-risk.",
      "During the more than three-month trial, prosecutors called for Pechier to be jailed for life, saying he \"used medicine to kill.\"",
      "They say he contaminated IV bags with potassium, local anaesthetics, adrenaline, and even an anticoagulant to trigger cardiac arrest or haemorrhaging in patients being treated by colleagues.",
      "His goal, prosecutors said, was to \"psychologically hurt\" caregivers with whom he was in conflict and to \"feed his thirst for power.\"",
      "Pechier had argued during the probe that the majority of poisonings were the result of \"medical errors\" made by his colleagues.",
      "He admitted during the trial that there had been a person poisoning patients in one of the two clinics where he worked, but said it was not him.",
      "\"I am not a poisoner,\" he said.",
      "\"Whatever the outcome of all this, my career is over,\" Pechier told reporters at a press conference in 2019, BBC News\u00a0reported. \"You cannot trust a doctor who, at one point, has been labeled a poisoner. ... My family is broken and I am afraid for my children.\"",
      "Some colleagues described the doctor as a \"star anesthetist,\" while others said he came across as arrogant and manipulative.",
      "One co-worker claimed Pechier was \"certain he was the best\" and liked to \"think of himself as Zorro.\"",
      "One colleague described Pechier as a very good doctor with an \"oversized ego.\"",
      "Le Monde reported\u00a0that one of Pechier's lawyers withdrew from the case, citing insufficient compensation.",
      "In tears during the trial earlier this month, Pechier recounted trying to kill himself in 2021.",
      "The verdict comes after a court in May sentenced retired doctor Joel Le Scouarnec to 20 years in prison after he confessed to sexually abusing or raping 298 patients, most of them children, between 1989 and 2014.",

    "story": [
      "Australian police carried out a dramatic operation in a Sydney suburb on Thursday, with heavily armed officers in tactical gear reportedly ramming a car and at least briefly detaining several men amid the ongoing investigation into the Sunday terror attack on a Jewish holiday gathering at the city's Bondi Beach.",
      "The New South Wales state police force said in a statement that two cars were intercepted by tactical operations officers responding \"to information received that a violent act was possibly being planned.\"",
      "The operation was conducted in Sydney's southwest suburb of Liverpool, about a half hour drive away from Bondi Beach. Police said they had \"not identified any connection to the current police investigation of the Bondi terror attack.\"",
      "Australian news outlets NewsWire and The Australian newspaper said the intercepted men were believed to be heading for Bondi from the city of Melbourne, almost 550 miles away in Victoria state.",
      "No arrests were announced, though photos from the scene showed men sitting on the ground as officers moved around them. Police said seven men were \"assisting police with their inquiries.\"",
      "Police said there was no threat to the public and the operation had concluded.",
      "NewsWire quoted an unnamed witness of the operation as saying it was \"frightening to see so many police with huge weapons in the area\" so soon after the Bondi attack.",
      "While police said there was no immediate link to the Bondi Beach shooting, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said earlier Thursday morning that more raids should be expected in the wake of the terror attack, in which two gunmen killed 15 people attending a celebration marking the first day of Hanukkah.",
      "\"In the coming days, the New South Wales Joint Counter Terrorism Team will execute further search warrants to support our investigation. There is a lot of material to be examined, and the AFP continues to work with both domestic and international partners to build a more complete picture of the movements and who the alleged offenders had contact with, both in Australia and offshore,\" she said.",

      "Authorities investigating the Bondi Beach terrorist attack have been looking into a month-long trip taken by the suspects, father and son Sajid and Naveed Akram, to the Philippines, where there's been a decades-long Islamist insurgency in the south of the country.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said this week that the attack was inspired by ISIS, and there is an ISIS-affiliated militant group operating in a remote area of the Philippines.",
      "But a receptionist at a hotel in Davao City said the attackers never left their room for more than a day.",
      "Jojo, who works at at the GV Hotel in Davao, told CBS News on Thursday that Sajid and Naveed Akram, the elder of whom was killed during the Sunday attack, checked into the hotel on Nov. 1 and then left on Nov. 28.",
      "He said they extended their stay week by week and paid in cash, and that they would go out during the day, but return to the hotel every night, often bringing food back to eat in their room.",
      "He said there was nothing particularly suspicious about the father and son, who had one piece of luggage and one backpack between them.",
      "Australian public broadcaster ABC previously reported that the Bondi Beach attackers had undergone \"military-style training\" in the Philippines, citing security sources.",
      "But on Wednesday, Philippine presidential spokesperson Claire Castro, quoting a National Security Council statement, said there was \"no validated report or confirmation that individuals involved in the Bondi Beach incident received any form of training in the Philippines,\" according to French news agency AFP.",
      "The government \"strongly rejects the sweeping statement and the misleading characterization of the Philippines as the ISIS training hotspot,\" Castro said.",
      "There has been an Islamist insurgency in the southern Philippines for many years, but the two main militant groups involved are not affiliated with ISIS, Tom Smith, the academic director of the Royal Air Force College, who studies security and terrorism in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, told CBS News earlier this week.",
      "There is a relatively small splinter group called Abu Sayyaf based on a remote archipelago that is affiliated with ISIS, but Smith said it would be very difficult for foreigners to receive weapons training from the group.",
      "\"They would stick out like a sore thumb,\" Smith said. \"When I go there, you know, I'm there with military support. I have a Ph.D. in the area, and even I stick out like a sore thumb.\"",
      "He said there are \"plenty of armed people in Mindanao, in the Philippines, for them to go and practice, you know, firing rifles and what have you. But it's a long way to say that that equals a terrorist camp.\"",
      "Australian and Indian authorities have confirmed that Sajid Akram, 50, who was killed during the attack, traveled on an India passport, while his son, born in Australia, used an Australian passport.",

      "Pineida started his professional career at Independiente del Valle, where he played from 2010 to 2015. He then moved to the club of the coastal city of Guayaquil in 2016 and won two league titles there. The defender also had a brief spell at Brazil's Fluminense in 2022.",

      "Washington \u2014 The latest Democratic-led attempt to limit President Trump's authority to strike Venezuela and suspected drug-smuggling boats in the region failed Wednesday, as tensions with the South American country continue to escalate.",
      "House Democrats forced votes on two war powers resolutions as Mr. Trump has warned that land strikes against the country could commence \"soon.\" Mr. Trump's threats come amid a months-long military campaign against alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed at least 95 people.",
      "Both measures fell short.",
      "The first measure, introduced by Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, would remove U.S. armed forces \"from hostilities with any presidentially designated terrorist organization in the Western Hemisphere,\" unless Congress has declared war or authorized the use of military force for such purposes. It failed in a 210 to 216 vote.",
      "A second measure from Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts would remove the armed forces \"from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\" Some 211 voted in favor and 213 voted against it.",
      "Meeks' resolution had the support of Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Don Bacon of Nebraska, while Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas voted against it.",
      "Three Republicans \u2014 Massie, Bacon and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia \u2014 supported McGovern's resolution. Cuellar was the lone Democrat to vote against.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. But the White House has suggested that the decades-old law does not apply to the boat strikes because it does not view the attacks as putting service members in harm's way.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth held two separate classified briefings Tuesday for all senators and House members. The House and Senate Armed Services Committee received a more detailed briefing on Wednesday with Navy Adm. Frank Bradley, who ordered a second strike killing survivors of the initial Sept. 2 boat attack.",
      "Meeks left Tuesday's House briefing saying members received no adequate explanation for why the Trump administration has not consulted Congress before the strikes. He also questioned the president's motivations.",
      "\"It doesn't seem to be just about narcotics trafficking,\" Meeks told reporters Tuesday. \"So if this is about regime change, it seems to me that the administration should say that's what it is, and should come to Congress to ask for that authorization, which has not taken place.\"",
      "Bacon said after Wednesday's briefing that he would vote to authorize military action against Venezuela, but he still believes that Mr. Trump needs to get approval from Congress.",
      "\"I think there's enough support in Congress to pass an authorization,\" Bacon added. \"The mission is right, but continued hostilities does require congressional approval.\"",
      "A day before the votes, Vanity Fair published a piece based on nearly a dozen interviews with Mr. Trump's chief of staff Susie Wiles, in which she said the president \"wants to keep on blowing boats up until [Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro cries uncle. And people way smarter than me on that say that he will.\"",
      "The statement appeared to be in contradiction with the administration's stance that it is conducting the strikes to stop the flow of drugs to the U.S., not ousting Maduro.",
      "Wiles conceded that strikes on land would require congressional approval.",
      "\"If he were to authorize some activity on land, then it's war, then [we'd need] Congress,\" she told Vanity Fair.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he's \"very concerned\" about the U.S. actions around Venezuela.",
      "\"At this point, we still don't have a clear idea of what the president is trying to accomplish,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"But it sure looks like he's trying to accomplish regime change in Venezuela, and that he's willing to go to war and accomplish that, all without any congressional authorization.\"",
      "In a further escalation of Mr. Trump's pressure campaign against Maduro, the president on Tuesday said he was declaring the Venezuelan government a \"foreign terrorist organization\" and called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that the president has the authority to order the boat strikes under his constitutional authority.",
      "\"It is certainly appropriate,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters. \"It's necessary to protect the United States and our interests.\"",
      "During floor debate Wednesday, GOP Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, argued the president does not need congressional authorization to carry out \"precise, limited strikes.\"",
      "\"This president wants to be the judge, jury and the executioner,\" said Meeks, the House Foreign Affairs Committee's top Democrat.",
      "The House votes follow two failed efforts in the Senate to prohibit Mr. Trump from continuing military action against drug cartels without approval from Congress. A third Senate vote could happen as soon as this week.",
      "Jaala  Brown, \n                                                  \n                      Grace  Kazarian and \n                                                  \n                                  Patrick  Maguire\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "A Second Amendment clash has erupted between the federal government and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
      "The U.S. government sued the U.S. territory, its police department and Police Commissioner Mario Brooks on Tuesday, accusing them of obstructing and systematically denying American citizens the right to possess and carry guns.",
      "The U.S. Virgin Islands requires that applicants demonstrate \"good reason to fear death or great injury to his person or property,\" and to have \"two credible persons\" to vouch for their need of a firearm. Local law also requires that someone have \"good moral character\" to obtain a gun permit, which is valid for up to three years and applies to a single weapon.",
      "The lawsuit states that no specific standard has been set or defined for the requirement of character. It also claims that the defendants \"regularly\" refuse to issue permits to those who by law are \"deemed to be an improper person\" by the territory's police commissioner.",
      "The lawsuit states that those in the U.S. territory also must \"submit to intrusive and warrantless home searches\" as one condition to obtain a gun permit. If an applicant refuses a home inspection, which takes \"several months to a year to schedule and complete,\" the government will not process their request, according to the lawsuit.",
      "It also notes that the police department \"denies firearms licenses to otherwise qualified applicants whenever it deems that the applicant has 'too many' firearms.\"",
      "In addition, the lawsuit accuses the U.S. Virgin Islands of demanding that applicants \"unnecessarily spend money to install a safe,\" and that it be bolted to the floor or wall of their home.",
      "The lawsuit accuses the defendants of defying \"binding Supreme Court precedent to frustrate the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens.\"",
      "It notes that those citizens \"have a fundamental right to possess guns in their homes\" and carry handguns publicly for the purpose of immediate self-defense.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It asks that a judge find that the defendants are violating the Second Amendment and seeks an injunction to prohibit them from implementing local laws tied to the issuance of firearms licenses.",
      "The U.S. Virgin Islands government said in a statement late Tuesday that it is reviewing the lawsuit and taking the allegations seriously.",
      "It noted that the administration of Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. and Lt. Gov. Tregenza A. Roach \"is committed to protecting constitutional rights while maintaining public safety.\"",
      "The statement said that the allegations would be addressed in court, and that no further comment would be issued.",
      "The lawsuit was filed as the administration of President Trump pushes to expand gun rights. Last year, Trump claimed that the Second Amendment was \"under siege\" and described himself as \"the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uk-police-antisemitism-protests-more-assertive-bondi-beach-attack/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 12:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "After Bondi Beach attack, Britain's two biggest police forces indicate they will arrest people who use \"phrases causing fear in Jewish communities.\"",
    "story": [
      "Britain's two biggest police forces announced Wednesday that officers would take an \"enhanced approach\" to counter antisemitism, arresting protesters who use certain slogans and phrases, in response to a surge in\u00a0hate crimes targeting Jewish people in the United Kingdom.",
      "The\u00a0announcement was a response, the London Metropolitan and Greater Manchester Police forces said, to Sunday's\u00a0terrorist attack in Bondi Beach, Australia, targeting a Hanukkah event, in which 15 people were fatally shot. Police also cited a spate of incidents on British soil, including a vehicle and knife assault outside a synagogue in Manchester in October that left two Jewish people dead.",
      "\"Antisemitic hate crime has surged, protests have intensified, and online abuse has grown since 2023,\" the police forces said. \"The increased fear in Jewish communities, and high number of terrorist attacks disrupted in recent years requires an enhanced response.\"",
      "\"The words and chants used, especially in protests, matter and have real world consequences,\" the statement said. \"Now, in the escalating threat context, we will recalibrate to be more assertive.\"",
      "The forces said that officers \"have consistently been advised\" by British prosecutors that \"many of the phrases causing fear in Jewish communities don't meet prosecution thresholds\" under the U.K.'s current hate speech laws, so the new approach would work largely under the existing Public Order Act.",
      "\"We know communities are concerned about placards and chants such as 'globalize the intifada' and those using it at future protest or in a targeted way should expect the Met and GMP to take action,\" the police said. \"Violent acts have taken place, the context has changed \u2014 words have meaning and consequence. We will act decisively and make arrests.\"",
      "\"The current laws are inadequate,\" said the statement attributed to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley and Manchester Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson, adding that the forces welcomed a planned review by the government of existing public order and hate crime laws.",
      "\"Jewish communities across London, Greater Manchester, and the rest of the United Kingdom are already worried and scared,\" the police statement said, and that the attacks in Australia and Manchester \"only adds to it.\"",
      "The police said officers would be briefed on this new approach, calling the measures \"practical and immediate,\" but offering little detail on what, beyond the specific phrase about a global \"intifada,\" might now be deemed illegal behavior.",
      "It said there had already been stepped-up police patrols around synagogues, Jewish schools and community venues.",
      "\"Our intent is clear: create a hostile environment for offenders and a safer environment for Jewish communities, while protecting lawful protest,\" the police said. \"It is possible to protest in support of Palestinian people without intimidating Jewish communities or breaking the law.\"",
      "One of the leaders of pro-Palestinian protests in the U.K., Palestinian Solidarity Campaign director Ben Jamal, criticized the announcement by the British police, calling it \"another low in the political repression of protest for Palestinian rights,\" according to CBS News' partner network BBC News.",
      "He said there was no consultation with his organization \"before making this far-reaching statement on our rights.\"",
      "\"The horrific massacre in Sydney, Australia should not be used as a justification to further repress fundamental democratic rights of protest and free speech in this country,\" Jamal said.",
      "The Board of Deputies of British Jews advocacy group said in a social media post that its members \"strongly welcome this necessary intervention\" by the police forces, which it said came \"after repeated urging from the Board of Deputies and others.\"",
      "Australia takes a different approach",
      "Authorities in Australia are still in the early days of their investigation into the Bondi Beach attack, but they have faced sharp criticism from the Jewish community in Sydney and abroad over a perceived lack of preparedness given a documented rise in antisemitism.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said it was \"motivated by Islamic State ideology,\" and he and was quick to label it \"an act of evil antisemitism, terrorism.\"",
      "Albanese said just hours after the attack that his government was \"prepared to take whatever action is necessary. Included in that is the need for tougher gun laws.\"",
      "Police have said the suspects \u2014 a father and son \u2014   used rifles and shotguns owned legally by the older man. Albanese proposed new laws to limit the number of guns a licensed owner can obtain, and a review into how existing licenses could be subject to renewal over time.",
      "Chris Minns, the Premier of New South Wales state, where Bondi Beach is located, said Monday that the attack \"demands an overwhelming response,\" announcing that more than 320 police officers would be \"deployed today, and we will continue to increase that number.\"",
      "He said Tuesday that the state was looking at reforms that could include denying permission for protests after terror events.",
      "\"My concern is that a mass demonstration in this combustible situation with our multicultural community could light a flame that would be impossible to extinguish,\" Minns told reporters, according to The Guardian newspaper. \"In many cases, particularly in relation to restrictions on protests, there are constitutional issues. So, it has to be drafted in a particular way. We have to be very clear about the designation and the reason for it. I'm being crystal clear about it. I'm worried about a combustible situation and community harmony. That's the reason we would introduce this legislation. It's begun, the drafting process has begun. But when it's completed I'll let you know.\"",
      "The state premier added, however, that there had been \"a lot of conflation that protests lead to violence because some chants are being said, yet the events on Sunday were not related to a protest at all.\"",
      "Minns said any new law brought in would target no specific group, but rather \"be a blanket rule in place\" only in the wake of a terrorist incident.",
      "Albanese, speaking in a radio interview on Wednesday, highlighted some of the measures his government has already taken to address antisemitism, including appointing the nation's first ever envoy dedicated to the topic.",
      "\"We've strengthened legislation to address antisemitism and hateful conduct \u2014 criminalized hate speech advocating violence,\" Albanese said, noting also \"a landmark ban on the Nazi salute and hate symbols\" adopted last year.",
      "\"We've enhanced protection of Jewish communities,\" the prime minister said, adding in conclusion: \"There's more to do.\"",

    "summary": "Temperatures in the Arctic continue to follow a long-term warming trend, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
    "story": [
      "The Arctic just experienced its hottest year since record-keeping began more than a century ago, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Wednesday. Rising temperatures in the polar region show no signs of leveling off, either, according to the agency, which said they are rising twice as fast as overall global temperatures.",
      "NOAA reviewed how the Arctic is faring in a warming world in the latest iteration of its annual Arctic Report Card.",
      "\"To observe the Arctic is to take the pulse of the planet,\" reads the report's executive summary. \"The Arctic is warming several times faster than Earth as a whole, reshaping the northern landscapes, ecosystems, and livelihoods of Arctic peoples. Also transforming are the roles the Arctic plays in the global climate, economic, and societal systems.\"",
      "Since the previous year's report card, climate change has continued to impact the Earth's northernmost area even more than the rest of the planet, NOAA said. The latest report details some of the most concerning developments observed over the last year, with scientists noting \"a clear pattern of Arctic warming.\"",
      "During the observational period, from October 2024 to September 2025, average sea surface temperatures measured in the Arctic were higher than the 1991-2020 average by as much as 13 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the report. Those were the warmest sea surface temperatures observed in the Arctic since at least 1900, signaling an intensifying climate pattern for the region.",
      "In March, Arctic winter sea ice hit its lowest annual maximum extent in the 47 years of satellite data collection, and six months later, the ice reached its 10th lowest annual minimum. \"All of the 19 lowest September minimum ice extents have occurred in the last 19 years,\" the report noted.",
      "Air temperatures increased, too. The autumn season of 2024 was the warmest on record, and the winter of 2025 ranked as the second-warmest, the report card said. Scientists also determined that Arctic temperatures since 2006 have increased at more than double the rate of global temperature changes. They have been warning for years that climate change is heating up the northern polar region more dramatically than anywhere else.",
      "Vital ecosystems are being transformed as a result of the Arctic's persistent warmth, according to the report card. The heat is accelerating sea ice loss and glacier melt while transforming the region's landscapes. Its tundra, for example, has been turning green as thawed permafrost and longer summers give foliage more opportunities to grow.",
      "Scientists emphasize that what happens to the Arctic directly affects the rest of the world, especially as sea ice minimums have continued to drop. Glaciers in Scandinavia saw their largest annual loss of ice on record between 2023 and 2024, and the Greenland Ice Sheet lost an estimated 129 billion tons of ice in 2025, according to NOAA, continuing an ongoing trend.",
      "\"Ongoing glacier loss contributes to steadily rising global sea levels, threatening Arctic communities' water supplies, driving destructive floods and increasing landslide and tsunami hazards that endanger people, infrastructure, and coastline,\" NOAA's report said.",

      "But, Smith said, \"when you have two rather, sort of beefy militant groups, people get disgruntled. And so there's loads of other fringe, much smaller militant groups\" in the region, including one called Abu Sayyaf, which is affiliated with ISIS.",
      "Smith said these groups are \"much smaller in number, but probably more vicious in their attacks against civilians and government officials.\"",
      "\"Analysts now describe Abu Sayyaf as fragmented remnants with residual ideological affinity to Islamic State (ISIS), but little evidence of real operational direction or sustained funding\" from ISIS, Lucas Webber, a senior research fellow at the New York-based Soufan Center think tank, told CBS News.",
      "Based in the Philippines' remote Sulu archipelago, Abu Sayyaf's main business is kidnapping for ransom, Smith said.",
      "They \"wrapped themselves in the ISIS flag, or the al Qaeda banner in years gone by, because they want to inflate their sense of danger. Because, quite frankly, there's an economic incentive to that. Because it means that they will get a higher ransom paid more efficiently, and these guys don't play,\" he said. \"They will actually behead people.\"",
      "That is a view shared by the U.S. government, which designated Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organization in 1997, not long after it emerged as an offshoot of the larger Islamist groups in the country.",
      "According to the U.S. State Department's most recent assessment from 2023, it is \"one of the most violent terrorist groups in the Philippines.\"",
      "\"Some Abu Sayyaf Group factions have been reported to interact and coordinate with ISIS-P [ISIS-Philippines], including by participating in attacks that are claimed by ISIS in the Sulu Archipelago,\" the U.S. government assessment said, adding that it had \"committed bombings, ambushes of security personnel, public beheadings, assassinations, extortion, and kidnappings for ransom.\"",
      "But both Smith and Webber told CBS News that Abu Sayyaf, and other regional factions, had been dealt a serious blow in recent years.",
      "\"Years of military pressure [with U.S. support], better local governance in Bangsamoro, and amnesty/reintegration programs have broken up many networks, led to mass surrenders, and sharply reduced the frequency and scale of attacks,\" Webber said. \"At the same time, small pockets of militants and ex\u2011fighters with IS ideology remain in parts of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago, and individuals can still be radicalized online or through personal ties. The main risk today is less a large 'IS province' on Philippine soil, and more the possibility that residual cells or sympathizers could attempt sporadic attacks or link up with transnational plots if local conditions deteriorate or security efforts are neglected.\"",
      "Terror training camps?",
      "The Associated Press cited Philippine military and police officials on Tuesday as saying there has been no recent indication of any foreign militants operating in the south of the country.",
      "Smith said to travel to receive weapons training with Abu Sayyaf militants would be very difficult for foreigners in the Philippines, especially without any local language skills.",
      "\"They would stick out like a sore thumb,\" Smith said. \"When I go there, you know, I'm there with military support. I have a Ph.D. in the area, and even I stick out like a sore thumb.\"",
      "He said there are \"plenty of armed people in Mindanao, in the Philippines, for them to go and practice, you know, firing rifles and what have you. But it's a long way to say that that equals a terrorist camp.\"",
      "Referring to the suspects in the Bondi Beach attack, Smith said it was \"much more likely that they could have got some ex-rebels and gone somewhere in the jungle for a couple of weeks and been shown how to fire and clean their rifles and stuff like that.\"",
      "The two larger militant groups, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front   \u2014 which are not affiliated with ISIS \u2014 do \"have the training camps. They're left alone to their territories. But it would be very unusual if the Bondi Beach attackers got orientated with them, because I just can't imagine that the MILF or the MNLF would have countenanced that. So it is really unusual,\" Smith said.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 11:40:17 -0500",
    "summary": "From a diaper bank in South Carolina to a community clinic in Florida and a village in India, pregnant women are getting a healthier start thanks to free prenatal multivitamins from Vitamin Angels and its partners. Their stories reveal how targeted nutrition support can help moms carry to term and give babies a stronger beginning.",
    "story": [
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "When Stephanie got pregnant with her first child at age 32, she channeled her limited energy and finances towards things like preparing space in her home and gathering supplies. The task, and cost, of securing and taking prenatal vitamins fell by the wayside.",
      "As an unemployed mom in Columbia, South Carolina, she\u2019s not alone. The state is home to a high number of women of reproductive age who lack health insurance \u2014\u00a0one in eight to be exact \u2014 and even more who don\u2019t have access to proper prenatal care. The effects can be dire, contributing to birth defects, preterm birth, and even infant and maternal death.",
      "But when Stephanie conceived her second child years later at age 41, she had a leg up: Through a local diaper bank called Power in Changing, she received not just diapers, information, support, and other supplies, but also free prenatal vitamins from the global health nonprofit\u00a0Vitamin Angels. Had the supplements not been free, Stephanie said, she likely would have prioritized something else and skipped them once again. That, fortunately, wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\"With this pregnancy, I took the prenatal and I felt good throughout the whole pregnancy with him\u2026I just overall generally feel healthier,\" Stephanie said. Despite being significantly older, she recovered faster from childbirth too. Stephanie\u2019s second child, she added, \"definitely benefited from having a healthy mom and a healthy start. He\u2019s brought a lot of joy to my life.\"",
      "Prenatal vitamins like those provided by Vitamin Angels are more than nice to have:\u00a0Research shows that pregnant women with inadequate nutrition are more likely to experience complications including post-partum hemorrhage and preterm delivery, and their babies are at higher risk of poor cognitive and physical development.",
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "\"During pregnancy, a woman\u2019s body works overtime to nourish her baby,\" said\u00a0Colleen\u00a0Delaney, PhD, RDN, a researcher and registered dietitian nutritionist who serves as a technical advisor for Vitamin Angels. Simply eating more doesn\u2019t cut it. Moms with so-called \"hidden hunger\" may not lack calories, \"but they are short on the essential vitamins and minerals needed to support their health and their baby\u2019s development,\" Delaney added. \"Prenatal multivitamins are a simple, proven way to meet that need.\"",
      "But social and economic barriers like unemployment and unstable housing can prevent moms-to-be like Stephanie from taking the vitamins regularly. In fact, more than 1 million underserved pregnant women in the US miss out on important prenatal services, including multivitamins and nutrition support.",
      "That\u2019s where Vitamin Angels comes in. Thanks to donations from individuals and corporate partners like the brain supplement brand\u00a0Prevagen (which acts as a philanthropic collaborator and not a prenatal vitamin maker), pregnant women across the country can receive the supplements free of charge. And importantly, the women access them from local providers they already use and trust.",
      "\"Partners like Power in Changing know their community, they know the mothers they serve by name, and they know the support their clients need,\"\u00a0Ana C\u00e9spedes, Vitamin Angels CEO, said. \"We further support their work by giving them more tools \u2014 a proven prenatal multivitamin and nutrition education \u2014 to put into women\u2019s hands when they need it most.\"",
      "From South Carolina to East India",
      "A few states away from Stephanie, a Florida woman named Ty\u2019hara had trouble finding prenatal care options that accepted her Medicaid coverage. But when she discovered Bond Community Health Center, which provides a wide range of health services, she was able to access and take prenatal vitamins from Vitamin Angels diligently.",
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "While everyone\u2019s experiences and needs are different, and prenatals should be taken as a part of a healthcare provider\u2019s recommended prenatal care plan, Ty\u2019hara valued the healthy foundation they delivered during her pregnancy. The vitamins help the baby\u2019s organs \"function and form correctly,\" she said, \"as well as\u2026helping me with my iron and minerals and all the things that I need to support successful growth for her.\"",
      "Across the globe in India, a mom-to-be named Santoshini took Vitamin Angels supplements to round out her healthy routine. Like many of her neighbors, she got the vitamins free of charge from a program partner that collaborates with the Indian government to offer health education, childcare, immunizations, and more. \"I feel like these supplements help me get through the day without feeling tired,\" Santoshini said. That\u2019s important because, while she was pregnant, she also cared for her active\u00a0two-year-old son.",
      "Indeed, Vitamin Angels\u2019 impact goes far beyond underserved communities in the US to reach more than 74 million women and children annually in 65 countries worldwide. In low-resource areas, problems from insufficient nutrition from pregnancy until a child\u2019s fifth birthday can include additional and irreversible complications like blindness.",
      "But both at home and away, it doesn\u2019t take much to make a big difference. Case in point: A single dollar donation can impact four children;\u00a0$5 dollars reaches 20.",
      "\"Supporting moms during pregnancy is one of the smartest investments you can make,\"\u00a0Scott Minger, Vitamin Angels Chief Development Officer, said. \"For the cost of a few cups of coffee, we can provide a woman with a full course of prenatal multivitamins that help her stay healthy, carry to term, and welcome a stronger, healthier baby.\"",
      "Prevagen\u2019s leadership agrees the investment is well worth it, said Tom Dvorak, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Quincy Bioscience. \"At Prevagen, we believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to live a healthy life,\" he said. \"Our partnership with Vitamin Angels allows us to transform that belief into meaningful action by supporting mothers and children with the essential nutrition they need to thrive.\"",

      "\"It\u2019s becoming evident that this is a pretty severe variant of the flu,\" he said. \"Certainly in other parts of the world where this variant has been prevalent, it's caused some severe illness, and we're seeing an aggressive flu season already.\"",

      "\"The vaccine is very important to get, but because it's not perfectly aligned with this variant, I think that's also contributing to some degree to the severity of cases we're seeing,\" he said. \"We're going in [to this flu season] with lower vaccination rates and a variant that in itself seems to be more aggressive.\"",
      "\"There's a lot of concern that this could be a particularly difficult flu season, both in terms of the total number of cases [and] the severity of those cases.\"",
      "Staying indoors during the colder months increases the risk of exposure to winter illness. (iStock)",
      "Because subclade K is \"quite different\" from prior variants, Maniar said there is less natural immunity at the community level, further increasing the risk of spread and severity.",
      "Those who are unvaccinated are also at risk of experiencing more severe symptoms, as well as a higher risk of hospitalization, the doctor emphasized.",

      "In addition to getting vaccinated, the doctor recommends washing hands frequently and properly. While the flu can spread via airborne transmission, a variety of other illnesses, like norovirus, can stick to surfaces for up to two weeks, he added.",
      "The holiday season also boosts the risk of infection, as gatherings, large events, and packed planes, trains and buses can expose people to others who are sick.",
      "The flu vaccine can help to prevent hospitalization and reduce severe symptoms, doctors agree. (iStock)",
      "Those who are not feeling well or exhibiting symptoms should \"please stay home,\" Maniar advised \u2014 \"especially if you think you are in that contagious period of the flu or any of these other illnesses that we're seeing \u2026 whether it's norovirus or COVID or RSV.\"",

      "As snow blanketed parts of the U.S. this week, heart health experts have shared warnings of the physical strain shoveling can take \u2014 particularly for older adults.",
      "A 2025 Mayo Clinic review found that just 10 minutes of heavy snow shoveling can push the heart to about 97% of its maximum rate. Exposure to cold air was also found to increase blood pressure and reduce coronary blood flow.",
      "While there isn\u2019t an official age that\u2019s \"too old\" to shovel, some cardiologists recommend that individuals over 45 should exercise more caution to lower their chances of a cardiac event.",
      "When to take caution",
      "\"While there's no strict age cutoff, generally above the age of mid 40s and above, we tend to be a little more cautious \u2014 particularly in people who are less active [without] regular exercise,\" Dr. Navjot Kaur Sobti, M.D., an interventional cardiologist at Northwell\u2019s Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Heart health experts have shared warnings of the physical strain shoveling can take \u2014 particularly for older adults. (iStock)",

      "\"Unless you are in good cardiovascular shape and conditioned, it may be a good idea to ask someone for help,\" he said in an interview with Fox News Digital.",
      "The impact of snow removal is especially concerning for those with existing cardiovascular risks and a history of heart attack or stroke, according to the cardiologist. \"People with these characteristics and those who have had bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty simply should not be shoveling snow in any conditions,\" he said.",
      "Just 10 minutes of heavy snow shoveling can push the heart to about 97% of its maximum rate, a 2025 Mayo Clinic review found. (iStock)",
      "Osbourne said he often sees cardiac episodes in people who are typically sedentary and sit at a computer most of the day with little or no exercise. \"Then once or twice a year, they go out and try to shovel the driveway after a heavy snowfall, and that unexpected exertion can unfortunately lead to tragedy.\"",
      "Hidden strain",
      "The stress that is placed on one\u2019s heart while shoveling snow is similar to what occurs during a cardiac stress test, Sobti pointed out, and may even exceed it.",
      "Cold temperatures can cause blood vessels to constrict and blood pressure to spike \u2014 which, coupled with existing hypertension and the exertion of lifting snow, can significantly tax the heart, she warned.",

      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "That study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine last month, also found that those over age 65 had higher rates of temperature-related deaths.",
      "\"So the risk is very, very high,\" Sobti cautioned. \"It's really that sudden rise in blood pressure coupled with the physical stress of snow shoveling itself.\"",
      "Safer shoveling tips",
      "The cardiologist said it\u2019s ideal to have someone else help with snow removal \u2014 but if you do choose to use a shovel, she recommends pacing yourself and using a \"pushing or sweeping\" motion instead of heavy lifting.",
      "Recent research has shown that cold exposure accounts for nearly twice as many cardiovascular deaths as heat exposure. (iStock)",
      "To protect against the cold, Sobti also recommends covering your mouth, nose and extremities, wearing a hat and gloves, and using extra caution in windy conditions.",
      "Using an automated snow blower can still raise the heart rate \u2014 up to 120 beats per minute, compared to 170 while shoveling, the American Heart Association states on its website.",

      "As he aims to not only defend but expand the GOP's 53-47 Senate majority in next year's midterm elections, Sen. Tim Scott has a message for MAGA voters who don't always go to the polls when President Donald Trump's name isn't on the ballot.",
      "\"Donald Trump is on the ballot, and that's why he's been so active around the country,\" Scott, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) said this week in a Fox News Digital interview.",

      "But Scott predicts the tide will turn.",
      "\"I've said 2026 is a year of affordability, and the great news is President Trump has been producing time and time again,\" he touted.",
      "Pointing to the tax cut provisions in the GOP's sweeping domestic policy measure signed into law this past summer by Trump, Scott said \"2026 is shaping up to be the year where Donald Trump's activities, his actions, the legislation we've passed, shows up for the American voter.

      "But taking aim at the GOP narrative, French argued that affordability will continue to grab top billing with voters \"because Americans can't afford Donald Trump and Republican policies that continue to drive up the cost of groceries, basic goods, and, right now, Christmas presents.\"",
      "\"The out-of-touch insistence from the GOP that the economy is thriving proves they don't understand what working families are facing, which is probably why Democrats won or dramatically overperformed in every contested election this year,\" she emphasized. \"2026 will be no different as Democrats continue to put forward real plans to address the cost-of-living crisis.\"",
      "There are 35 Senate seats up for grabs next year, including special elections for GOP-held seats in Florida and Ohio. Overall, Republicans are defending 22 of the seats.",

      "\"We're excited about expanding our map, and Minnesota is one of the target states that we're looking at,\" Scott said. \"We see real reasons to be optimistic. President Trump was very close in Minnesota. It's a four-point race. We know with the right candidate, we will be successful.\"",

Almost half say this was a good year for them personally, even as fewer, around one-third, say it was good for the country, according to the latest Fox News survey released Friday.

      "Those financial pressures may help explain why most voters (81%) say it\u2019s at least sometimes okay to re-gift something they were given: 62% feel it is sometimes okay, while 19% say it\u2019s always acceptable. Some 19% think it\u2019s never okay.",

      "How to remove your personal information from scammers' reach",
      "You can start by looking yourself up online. Searching for different combinations of your name, address, email, and phone number should bring up a bunch of people search sites. Just visit the \"opt-out\" page on each site to request removal of your data.",
      "Private-database data brokers are a bit trickier. They sell data in bulk, usually to marketers and other third parties. So you won't be able to check if they have your information. But if you look into which data brokers operate in your area, you can just send opt-out requests to them all. There's a good chance they'll have your information.",
      "You can also turn to a data removal service. They completely remove the headache from this process and just automatically keep your personal info off data broker sites. If, like me, you don't have the time to keep manually checking data broker sites and sending removal requests every few months (because your data will keep reappearing), a personal data removal service is the way to go.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "How AI photo matching kept the search going",
      "Pam's 11-year-old indoor cat, Grayson, had never been outside alone. She believes he slipped out while she unloaded groceries at their home in Plano, Texas. The moment she realized he was gone, she acted fast.",
      "She said, \"We went up and down the streets day and night. We went online in the neighborhood and on Love Lost. We put up flyers all over the neighborhood. Friends and neighbors were looking for him. I went to the animal shelter, posted him there, and went every day for over a month, hoping to find him.\"",
      "Pam uploaded Grayson's photo to Petco Love Lost right away. She checked her daily match alerts and hoped she would see his familiar face pop up. She told CyberGuy, \"I received match alerts almost every day from Lost Love, but never saw Grayson. His profile had been on their site for over 90 days.\"",
      "The moment everything changed",
      "Missy, a nearby resident, spotted a thin cat in an alley near her home. She brought him inside, took a picture of him and then turned to Love Lost to see if anyone had reported a missing cat like him.",
      "Missy explained how simple the process felt. \"I used Lost Love to reunite them,\" she said. \"I uploaded a photo of the cat that we found, and it was matched through AI with the photo that the owner uploaded.\"",
      "She soon received an AI match alert and learned that the cross street Grayson's owner, Pam, had listed in her lost post was only a mile from her home. Missy contacted Pam right away.",
      "That message changed everything. \"I am sure that if we had not posted his picture and enabled the ability to match the images, we would never have known what happened to Grayson,\" Pam said. \"And we would not have connected with Missy.\"",

      "A long road for an aging cat",
      "Grayson is almost 12 and has never lived outdoors. That made this reunion feel even more emotional, Pam said.",
      "\"I am still amazed at Grayson's journey,\" she added. \"I look at him and cannot believe he made it through those 103 days. He is almost 12 years old, so he is not a young kitty.\"",
      "Pam said she still thinks about what those months were like for him. \"[I] guess I will always wonder where he was and how many stops he made before he reached Missy's loving home,\" she said. \"He must have known she would take care of him. It takes a special person to take the time to reunite a beloved pet with their family. Missy and her family went above and beyond to reunite us with Grayson.\"",
      "Why pet tech matters during the holidays",
      "This season brings joy but also risks for pets. Visitors, travel and loud celebrations create more chances for animals to slip out or feel spooked. Tools like AI photo matching help families act fast when a pet goes missing. Love Lost connects shelters and neighbors in one place so that people like Pam and Missy can find each other.",
      "What to do if your pet goes missing",
      "Losing a pet can feel overwhelming, but taking fast action helps. These steps guide you through what to do right away.",
      "Look in closets, garages and under furniture. Walk your street and ask neighbors to check yards and sheds.",
      "Take a clear photo and post it on the site. AI photo matching alerts you when a possible match appears. It also helps others contact you fast.",
      "Shelters update kennels throughout the day. Staff can guide you and help flag your pet's profile. Go often until you get updates.",
      "Use neighborhood apps, local Facebook groups and community forums. Include your pet's photo, last known location and your contact info.",
      "Use a large photo and simple details. Place flyers at busy intersections and near schools, parks and businesses.",
      "If your pet is microchipped, call the registry or log in to your account. Make sure the chip is registered to you, update your contact info and mark your pet as missing so shelters and vets can reach you fast.",
      "Check Love Lost alerts often. Visit shelters and follow up on every lead. Persistence made the difference for Pam and Grayson.",

      "How AirTags can help you find a lost pet faster",
      "While tools like AI photo matching are invaluable after a pet goes missing, prevention and real-time tracking can make an enormous difference during the first critical hours. That's where Apple AirTags come in. An AirTag isn't a GPS tracker, but it can still be a powerful recovery tool when used correctly. When attached securely to your pet's collar, an AirTag uses Apple's vast Find My network. That network consists of hundreds of millions of nearby iPhones, iPads and Macs that can anonymously and securely relay the AirTag's location back to you.",
      "If your pet wanders into a neighborhood, apartment complex or busy area, the chances are high that another Apple device will pass nearby and update the location automatically. You won't know who helped, and they won't know it was them, but the location can show up on your map within minutes. For indoor cats or dogs that don't usually roam far, this can be especially helpful. Even a rough location can narrow your search area and save precious time.",
      "Important limits to know: AirTags work best in populated areas. They rely on nearby Apple devices, so coverage may be limited in rural or remote locations. They also don't update continuously like true GPS pet trackers. That's why AirTags should be seen as a backup layer, not a replacement for microchipping or dedicated pet trackers.",
      "How to use an AirTag safely with pets",
      "Use a\u00a0secure, pet-specific AirTag holder that won't break easily.Attach it to a\u00a0breakaway collar\u00a0for cats and dogs to reduce injury risk.Make sure\u00a0Find My notifications are turned on so you get alerts quickly.Combine it with\u00a0microchipping and ID tags for the best protection.",

IRMO says the system can take as much as 50 pounds of stress off your knees, which can help reduce fatigue on long days outside.",

That alone puts it in line with top performance exoskeletons, but IRMO adds something new that it says shifts the entire experience.",
      "Terrain-aware AI that looks ahead while you move",
      "The M1 scans a four-foot radius around you with camera and laser-rangefinder sensors. This lets it read the terrain before you reach it. The system adjusts power output based on what is coming up next. If the M1 detects stairs, grass, sand or slopes, it prepares your legs with added support or added control.",
      "It can help you climb with more power, absorb impact on jumps and steady your pace on steep declines. IRMO says this predictive shift can reduce knee impact by up to 60%. You can use the M1 for hiking, running, jumping, cycling and even sports like basketball or tennis. If you want to build strength, you can switch from assist to resistance mode.",

      "You can buy the IRMO M1 through its Kickstarter campaign, which runs until early January 2026. Prices start at $399 for the M1 Neo tier and rise through several launch specials that offer different levels of power, weight and features. Higher tiers include models like the M1 Pro and M1 Ultra, which add stronger motors, lighter frames and longer battery performance. Each pledge level lists what comes in the box, including the main units, straps, charger, battery pack, user manual and packaging. Shipping is global with an estimated delivery window of May 2026.",

      "Any data breach affecting 1.6 million people is serious. It draws even more attention when it involves a company trusted to guard passwords. That is exactly what happened to LastPass.",
      "The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office has fined LastPass about $1.6 million for security failures tied to its 2022 breach. Regulators say those failures allowed a hacker to access a backup database and put users at risk.",

      "CHECK IF YOUR PASSWORDS WERE STOLEN IN HUGE LEAK",
      "Why the LastPass breach still matters",
      "LastPass is one of the most widely used password managers in the world. It serves more than 20 million individual users and around 100,000 businesses. That popularity also makes it an attractive target for cybercriminals.",
      "The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office fined LastPass for security failures tied to its 2022 breach. (LaylaBird/Getty Images)",
      "In 2022, LastPass confirmed that an unauthorized party accessed parts of its customer information through a third-party cloud storage service. While the incident initially raised alarms, the long-term impact has taken time to fully surface.",
      "The ICO now says the breach affected about 1.6 million U.K. users alone. That scope played a major role in the size of the fine.",
      "What regulators say went wrong",
      "According to the ICO, LastPass failed to put strong enough technical and security controls in place. Those gaps made it possible for attackers to reach a backup database that should have been better protected.",
      "The regulator added that LastPass promises to help people improve security, but failed to meet that expectation. As a result, users were left exposed even if their passwords were not directly cracked.",
      "Were passwords exposed or decrypted?",
      "There is still no evidence that attackers decrypted customer passwords. That point matters.",
      "Despite the breach, security experts continue to recommend password managers for most people. Storing unique, strong passwords in an encrypted vault is still far safer than reusing weak passwords across accounts.",
      "As one expert noted, modern breaches often succeed after identity access rather than password cracking alone. Once attackers get a foothold, the damage can spread quickly.",
      "Although attackers accessed a backup database, there is no evidence that customer passwords were decrypted. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the LastPass fine is a wake-up call for cybersecurity",
      "The ICO called the LastPass fine a turning point. It reinforces the idea that security is about governance, staff training and supplier risk as much as software.",

    "summary": "Baseball teams can now analyze complete swing mechanics in normal training environments using Theia&apos;s markerless AI system that processes standard high-speed footage.",
    "story": [
      "John Hankins, co-owner and co-investor of PitchCom, tells Fox News Digital that the idea for the communication device came from the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal.",
      "Baseball teams have long searched for a way to study the entire swing without sensors or complex lab setups. Today, a new solution is entering the picture. Theia, an AI biomechanics company, debuted a commercially available video-only system that analyzes bat trajectory and full-body biomechanics together. This new approach works in real baseball environments and needs no reflective body markers, wearables or special equipment.",
      "The system has been field-tested by Driveline Baseball and the San Diego Padres Biomechanics Lab, and the tests show it delivers high-quality results in both cages and on the field.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "MLB VOTES TO ALLOW ROBOT UMPS FOR CHALLENGES DURING 2026 SEASON",
      "Theia unveils a video-only biomechanics system that tracks a hitter\u2019s full swing without sensors or lab gear. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)",
      "A new chapter in baseball biomechanics",
      "Theia's platform relies on deep-learning models trained on millions of movement data points. It captures the full 3D bat path, attack angle, sequencing and body motion in one workflow that teams can run with standard high-speed video. This makes advanced biomechanics more accessible to coaches and players who train in normal environments.",
      "Dr. Arnel Aguinaldo of the PLNU Biomechanics Lab tested the system with the Padres. He said, \"Theia's markerless technology represents a breakthrough in how we capture and analyze swing mechanics. It removes the barriers of traditional setups, letting us gather quality swing data directly from the field or the cage. That's a game changer for both research and applied development.\"",
      "Independent testing across more than 2,000 swings showed median bat-plane angle differences of less than 3 degrees compared with marker-based systems. As a result, teams can evaluate roster-sized groups in routine cage or field sessions without slowing players down.",
      "Why video-only tracking works in real baseball settings",
      "Many existing tools rely on sensors or suits that can change how an athlete moves. Marcus Brown, CEO of Theia, explained to CyberGuy why video-only tracking matters.",
      "\"Using only video means teams get lab-grade biomechanics data that previously required a full lab setup, but without special suits, reflective markers, or hardware mounted to the bat or the player,\" he said.",
      "The system runs in the background once cameras are placed and calibrated. Coaches record sessions as usual, and the analysis processes automatically. Because of this, training routines stay the same, and players move naturally.",
      "Brown added,\u00a0\"Until now, full swing analysis meant choosing between bat-only tools or biomechanics labs that couldn't scale. Our new markerless technology changes that. Teams can now see the complete swing picture for every hitter using one system in an environment that matches their individual needs.\"",
      "How AI bat and body tracking improves player performance",
      "A complete swing view gives coaches the chance to link body motion to bat results. Brown described why this matters for player development.",
      "\"Theia's new bat tracking feature helps players improve because it gives coaches a complete and more accurate picture of the swing. Many tools today either measure the bat or the body, and many rely on wearables or sensors that can influence how an athlete moves,\" Brown said. \"When coaches can connect a player's sequencing, posture, timing, and rotation to the bat's path, speed, and contact quality, they can identify the specific movement patterns that drive results. That makes mechanical adjustments more targeted and much easier to track over time, leading to more consistent and meaningful improvements.\"",

      "Players will not need to attach anything to the bat or their bodies. They swing in their regular training spaces without changing behavior. Brown said, \"For athletes, the biggest change is the level of precise personalized feedback they get. Coaches can isolate whether an issue is coming from sequencing, posture, timing, or how the hitter is delivering the barrel to the ball. That level of detail helps translate mechanical work in the cage into more consistent, reliable results in the field.\"",
      "Independent testing shows consistent bat and body data",
      "Driveline Baseball and the PLNU x Padres Biomechanics Lab tested the system in both professional and collegiate settings. Brown said,\u00a0\"Our work with Driveline and the PLNUxPadres' Biomechanics Lab showed the system could deliver high-quality bat-and-body data in the same environments where hitters actually train. What those tests demonstrated was consistency: the ability to capture the full swing automatically, link the bat and body with the precision needed for player development, and fit seamlessly into a normal training session.\"",
      "Why Theia's system fits seamlessly into normal cage sessions",
      "Sports tech can create workflow friction, but Theia aims to avoid that. Brown said, \"We designed the system so coaches can use it without changing anything about their normal training routine. Once the cameras are in place, coaches simply record the session the same way they normally would, and the analysis happens automatically in the background.\"",
      "There are no extra steps, no equipment put on the players, and no training interruptions.",

      "Coaches can now review 3D bat paths and body sequencing using standard high-speed video. (Photo by Thien-An Truong/Getty Images)",
      "The road ahead for AI sports performance",
      "Brown believes this breakthrough sets the stage for future innovation.",
      "\"Player development is ultimately about understanding what drives performance, and this technology gives coaches a far clearer way to see that,\" he said. \"When you can connect a player's movement to the result of the swing with objective repeatable data, you can build training plans that are far more individualized and precise.\"",
      "He also added:\u00a0\"This work builds on more than a decade of research and over 50 peer-reviewed validation studies focused on highly accurate markerless human motion tracking. It reflects where the field as a whole is headed toward integrated markerless solutions that give athletes and coaches clearer insight with far less friction.\"",

      "News of more than 120,000 Korean home cameras being hacked recently can shake your confidence in connected devices. Stories like that make you picture cybercriminals breaking into homes with high-tech gadgets and spying on families through smart cams. That reaction is natural. But most of these headlines leave out important context that can help you breathe a little easier.",
      "First, smart home hacking is rare. Most incidents stem from weak passwords or from someone you already know, rather than from a stranger with advanced tools. Today's smart home brands push out updates to block intrusion attempts, including patches for new AI-related vulnerabilities that often make headlines.",

      "SMART HOME DEVICE MAKER EXPOSES 2.7 BILLION RECORDS IN HUGE DATA BREACH",
      "Smart home hacking headlines can look scary, but most threats come from weak passwords rather than targeted attacks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why criminals are not circling your house with hacking gear",
      "Many people imagine cybercriminals driving around neighborhoods with scanners that look for vulnerable devices. In reality, Wi-Fi ranges and technical limits make that nearly impossible. Even high-profile hacks of casinos and large companies do not translate to criminals trying to breach residential smart locks for petty theft.",
      "Burglars still choose low-tech methods. They look for unlocked doors or easy entry points. They avoid complicated hacking tools because the payoff is too small to justify the work.",
      "So how do smart homes get hacked? Here are the real attack paths and how they work.",
      "Common ways smart homes get attacked",
      "Smart homes face a handful of digital threats, but most come from broad automated attacks rather than someone targeting your house.",
      "Bots constantly scan the internet for weak passwords and outdated logins. These brute force attacks throw billions of guesses at connected accounts. When one works, the device becomes part of a botnet used for future attacks. That doesn't mean someone is targeting your home on purpose. Bots search for anything they can breach. A strong password stops them.",
      "Some phishing emails impersonate smart home brands. Clicking a fake link or sharing login details can open the door for criminals to reach your network. Even a general phishing attack can expose your Wi-Fi info and lead to broader access.",
      "Hackers often go after company servers, not individual homes. These breaches may expose account details or stored camera footage kept in the cloud. Criminals may sell that data to others who might try to use it. It rarely leads to direct smart home hacking, but it still puts your accounts at risk.",
      "Early IoT devices had vulnerabilities that allowed criminals to intercept the data they sent and received. (IoT stands for Internet of Things and includes everyday connected gadgets like smart plugs, smart thermostats or Wi-Fi cameras.) Modern products now use stronger encryption, making these attacks extremely rare in the real world.",
      "Bluetooth issues still pop up from time to time, but most modern smart home devices use stronger security than older models. When a new flaw is discovered, companies usually release fast patches, which is why it's important to keep your apps and gadgets updated. Today, these Bluetooth risks rarely lead to real smart home problems.",
      "ADT HACKED: IS YOUR HOME SECURITY SYSTEM REALLY SECURE?",
      "Who actually tries to hack smart homes",
      "When hacking happens, it usually involves someone with some level of access already. In many cases, no technical hack occurs at all.",
      "Simple steps like stronger Wi-Fi security and regular updates go a long way toward protecting connected devices. (\u00a0Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Exes, former roommates or relatives often know login info. They may try to spy or cause trouble. Update all passwords if you suspect this.",
      "There have been cases where employees at security companies snooped through camera feeds. This isn't remote hacking. It's a misuse of internal access.",
      "They steal account lists and login details to sell. Others may buy those lists and try to log in using exposed credentials.",
      "Some send fake messages claiming they hacked your cameras and threaten you. Most of these scams rely on lies because they have no access at all.",
      "Some banned foreign manufacturers pose surveillance risks. The FCC maintains a list of companies that cannot sell security tech in the U.S. Always check that list before buying unfamiliar brands.",
      "Smart home devices that can raise concerns",
      "Some everyday gadgets create small but real entry points for trouble, especially when their settings or security features get overlooked.",
      "They often arrive with default passwords that owners forget to change. Older models may use outdated IoT protocols with weaker protections. Many do not get frequent security updates.",
      "Wi-Fi offers convenience but also adds risk. Weak routers and poor passwords can allow strangers to access a feed. Closed network monitors avoid Wi-Fi risks but still face basic signal interception attempts.",
      "During setup, some bulbs broadcast an open temporary network. If a criminal joins at the exact right moment, they could reach the rest of your devices. These cases are rare but possible in theory.",
      "Voice ordering can be exploited by curious kids or guests. Set a purchase PIN so no one can order items with simple voice commands.",
      "Steps to stay safe in your smart home",
      "Strong habits and a few simple tools can block the most common threats that target connected homes.",
      "Choose long, complex passwords for your Wi-Fi router and smart home apps. A password manager makes this simple. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",

      "Removing your personal details from data broker sites helps prevent criminals from using leaked or scraped information to access your accounts or identify your home.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Pick smart home products from companies that explain how they protect your data and use modern encryption to lock down your footage and account details. Look for brands that publish clear security policies, offer regular updates and show how they keep your information private.",
      "Pick security cameras that let you save video directly to an SD card or a home hub, rather than uploading it to the cloud. This keeps your recordings under your control (and helps protect them if a company server is breached). Many cameras from trusted lines support local storage, so you do not have to rely on a company server.",
      "Install firmware updates quickly. Enable automatic updates when possible. Replace older gadgets that no longer receive patches.",
      "Your router is the front door to your smart home, so lock it down with a few simple tweaks. Use WPA3 encryption if your router supports it, rename the default network, and install firmware updates to patch security holes. For a full step-by-step guide on tightening your home network, check out our instructions in \"How to set up a home network like a pro.\"",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Smart homes feel intimidating when scary headlines surface. But when you look at real-world data, you see far fewer risks than the stories suggest. Most attacks rely on weak passwords, poor router settings or old devices. With the right habits, your smart home can stay both convenient and secure.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Managing diabetes already brings stress from medications and long-term health risks. Regular glucose checks only add to the weight. Most people test with finger pricks or wear a patch that needs a sensor under the skin. If you dislike needles, this part can feel like the hardest task of the day.",
      "Researchers at MIT are working on a new option. They developed a device that shines near-infrared light on your skin and reads your blood sugar without breaking the surface. It works through Raman spectroscopy, a method that looks at how light scatters when it hits molecules in your tissue.",

      "CANCER CURES COULD BE IN REACH WITH CUTTING-EDGE MEDICAL TECH, DOCTOR PREDICTS",
      "How the light-based scanner works",
      "The current setup is about the size of a shoebox. You rest your arm on top for a 30-second scan. A small beam shines through a glass window onto your skin. The light returns with tiny shifts in wavelength that reveal what molecules are present.",
      "Earlier Raman systems pulled in about 1,000 spectral bands with plenty of noise. The MIT team discovered that they only need three bands to calculate glucose levels. With fewer signals to process, the device becomes smaller, faster and more affordable. This boost also improves speed since the system no longer sorts through redundant data.",
      "In a four-hour study, a volunteer drank two glucose drinks while researchers took readings every five minutes. The new scanner matched the accuracy of two commercial glucometers the participant wore. That result surprised the team since the device is still in early development.",
      "Progress toward a wearable",
      "After perfecting the shoebox version, MIT engineers built a prototype the size of a cellphone. That unit is now in clinical testing with healthy and prediabetic volunteers. A larger trial with people who have diabetes is expected next year.",
      "The long-term goal is even more exciting. Researchers believe they can shrink the hardware to a watch size. They also want to confirm that the system reads accurately across many skin tones. If these steps succeed, a wrist-based glucose monitor could be possible.",
      "A quick 30-second scan can match the accuracy of today\u2019s commercial glucose monitors. (iStock)",
      "How this compares to other needle-free attempts",
      "This light-based method joins other ideas that try to move past needles. A recent chest strap used ECG signals to predict glucose levels. It looked promising, but it still needs time before it reaches consumers. Interest in noninvasive monitoring keeps growing since so many people want relief from the pain of repeated skin punctures or adhesive patches.",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT PERFORMS MEDICAL PROCEDURES VIA REMOTE CONTROL",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you or someone you love manages diabetes, fewer needle sticks could change your routine. A quick scan may replace the stress of drawing blood or inserting a sensor. The accuracy seen in early testing shows that noninvasive tools are not a distant dream. They could help you catch swings in your levels faster and bring more comfort to a daily task that often feels overwhelming.",

Unlike the federal government, states cannot shoot down a drone or jam its radio frequencies.",

      "At his year-end press conference, Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke about the threats that transnational terrorist criminal groups pose to the U.S.",
      "FIRST ON FOX: From a distance, Margarita Island looks like a Caribbean escape. Palm-lined beaches, duty-free shops, and resort towns sell the image of a tropical playground just off Venezuela\u2019s northeastern coast. But U.S. officials say the Venezuelan outpost has become something else entirely: Hezbollah\u2019s most important base of operations in the Western Hemisphere, strengthened by Iran\u2019s growing footprint and the Maduro regime\u2019s protection.",
      "That threat, U.S. officials warn, reflects a broader security challenge emerging from the region. \"The single most serious threat to the United States from the Western Hemisphere is from transnational terrorist criminal groups primarily focused on narcotrafficking,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at an end-of-year press conference at the State Department on Friday.",
      "\"Margarita Island might be of significance to the U.S. because of its location and the security dynamics around it,\" Melissa Ford Maldonado, director of the Western Hemisphere Initiative at the America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital. \"It is close to Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada, in an oil-rich part of the Caribbean along key maritime routes, and it has long had a reputation for being a major drug-trafficking hub, possibly because it\u2019s off the mainland and there\u2019s not a lot of law enforcement there.\"",
      "The island\u2019s isolation, she said, has made it attractive to \"irregular armed groups, foreign intelligence actors and criminal networks that use it as a departure point for boats carrying illicit shipments out of Venezuela.\"",

      "Marshall Billingslea, the former assistant secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes in the U.S. Treasury Department, said Margarita Island now serves as Hezbollah\u2019s key foothold in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "\"From what I have seen and what I have been told, there is a wide range of activities that Hezbollah and to some extent Hamas are engaged in,\" Billingslea told Fox News Digital. \"Margarita Island is really the center of gravity for their activities.\"",

      "In written testimony submitted to the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control for an Oct. 21 hearing, Billingslea traced the island\u2019s transformation back more than two decades. Under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, he wrote, Venezuela \"opened its doors to Hezbollah, allowing the group to establish a major footprint, including a paramilitary training site, on Margarita Island.\"",
      "\"When Nicol\u00e1s Maduro seized power,\" Billingslea added, \"the breadth and depth of Hezbollah\u2019s presence in Venezuela dramatically expanded, as did their ties to the narco-terrorist regime and the Cartel de los Soles.\"",

      "\"The relationship is very close with the Cartel de los Soles, and it has been so for many, many years,\" Billingslea said, referring to the network of senior Venezuelan officials accused by the United States of drug trafficking.",
      "Billingslea said Hezbollah has embedded itself into Margarita Island\u2019s economy, exploiting the island\u2019s duty-free status and cross-border access to Colombia to generate revenue through smuggling and drug importation. He said the group operates a wide range of companies on the island and also maintains several training camps there.",
      "His testimony also detailed how Venezuela\u2019s state apparatus helped embed Hezbollah inside the country. He wrote that former senior official Tareck El Aissami, while overseeing Venezuela\u2019s passport and naturalization agency, \"was instrumental in furnishing passports and citizenship documents to Hezbollah operatives as well as a large number of people from Lebanon, Syria, and Iran.\" Between 2010 and 2019, Venezuelan authorities issued more than 10,400 passports to individuals from those countries, according to the testimony.",

The filing also describes a subsequent weapons delivery at a hangar controlled by Maduro at the country\u2019s main international airport.",
      "Recent developments in the Middle East have only increased Margarita Island\u2019s importance, Billingslea said. Israel\u2019s campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon has damaged the group\u2019s military leadership and financial infrastructure, forcing it to rely more heavily on overseas networks.",
      "\"Israeli successes against Hezbollah in Lebanon in particular, including their strikes on the financial infrastructure Al-Qard al-Hassan that operates in Lebanon, are going to have two effects,\" he said. \"The first is that it is making the fundraising and the revenue generation that comes out of Latin America even more important to the terrorist group. Secondly, we have seen indications that Hezbollah actually has been relocating fighters from Lebanon, several hundred from Lebanon to Venezuela in particular.\"",

      "Asked whether that shift moves the threat closer to the United States, Billingslea said Hezbollah is now operating \"close to the U.S. and further away from the Israelis.\"",
      "He said Iran\u2019s role in Venezuela has deepened alongside Hezbollah\u2019s. \"There is a substantial Iranian footprint in Venezuela related to the trade of weapons and drones, in particular, for gold,\" he said. After suffering losses in the Middle East, he added, \"the Iranians find themselves even more dependent on that supply of gold in exchange for drones and weapons.\"",

      "He said Washington faces a strategic choice. \"I think the United States has positioned sufficient forces in the Caribbean at this time to take care of the Hezbollah threat,\" he said. \"But obviously, when you have a terrorist group that has merged into the local population, highly precise intelligence is needed. I believe the Venezuelan opposition possesses a great deal of that intelligence, though it is not clear to me that the United States government is making the best use of that access.\"",
      "For Billingslea, the conclusion is cleaner \u2014 eliminating Venezuela\u2019s narco-terrorist regime would significantly strengthen U.S. national security.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior correspondent Rich Edson joins \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 with details on President Donald Trump\u2019s upcoming national address and his move to designate Nicolas Maduro's regime as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "For years, Venezuelan dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has defied predictions of collapse. Sanctions, diplomatic isolation and internal unrest have failed to unseat him. But the latest escalation by the Trump administration \u2014 including the seizure of a Venezuelan crude tanker and the enforcement of a blockade on sanctioned vessels \u2014 has hit the regime where it is most vulnerable: its oil trade.",
      "Melissa Ford Maldonado, director of the Western Hemisphere Initiative at the America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital that while the timeline and outcome remain uncertain, the regime\u2019s dependence on oil leaves it uniquely vulnerable. \"One thing is clear: the Maduro regime can\u2019t sustain itself without oil revenue,\" she said.",
      "While the U.S. move has raised concerns among European allies, who warned that the escalation could undermine regional stability and complicate efforts toward a political resolution in Venezuela, Ford Maldonado says the administration\u2019s approach is striking at the core of Maduro\u2019s power.",
      "\"What we\u2019re seeing now with President Trump\u2019s order for a total blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela is a direct hit against Maduro\u2019s revenue streams,\" she said. \"He needs the oil money from these tankers to buy loyalty and pay off generals, cartel partners and political enforcers to stay in power. That pipeline is finally being cut.\"",

      "According to Reuters, up to 11 million barrels of Venezuelan crude are currently stranded aboard 39 tankers anchored offshore.",
      "Jorge Jraissati, president of the Economic Inclusion Group, said the recent U.S. actions \"fundamentally change the economics of Venezuela\u2019s oil exports.",
      "\"That oil is neither sold nor paid for,\" Jraissati said. \"Until those cargoes move, they generate no cash flow for PDVSA and deepen Maduro\u2019s liquidity strain.\" PDVSA is Venezuela's state-run oil company.",
      "Venezuela is one of the most oil-dependent countries on Earth. Oil accounts for more than 80% of exports and roughly 90% of government revenue, leaving the nation extraordinarily exposed when crude shipments falter.",
      "\"After years of economic collapse as a result of Venezuela\u2019s socialist policies, virtually all other sectors of the economy are bankrupted,\" Jraissati noted.",

      "U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil have been in place since 2019, but enforcement often lagged, and PDVSA continued to move crude through intermediaries and opaque trading networks, mainly toward Asia. The recent tanker seizure appears to have changed that dynamic.",
      "The Trump administration said the seized vessel was headed for Cuba, but Jraissati argued China was the more likely destination. \"Tankers of that size are typically deployed on long-haul routes, and China accounts for roughly 60% percent of Venezuela\u2019s oil exports,\" he said.",
      "Not only has crude become harder to sell, it has become cheaper. Venezuelan heavy crude is trading at discounts of up to $21 per barrel below Brent, according to sources cited by Jraissati and confirmed by Reuters reporting.",

      "Oil tankers, with cargoes worth tens of millions of dollars, now face heightened risk if they enter Venezuelan waters. This has sent buyers and shipowners scrambling for insurance and new terms.",
      "\"In general terms, this is a game-changing policy because it fundamentally alters the economics of exporting oil from Venezuela,\" Jraissati said. \"Exports will not stop, but the conditions under which they are sold will deteriorate sharply. It will weaken Maduro\u2019s cash flow.\"",

      "The STC has emerged as the dominant power in southern Yemen, and is reportedly backed by significant Emirati funding and military support. Formed in April 2017, it unites factions seeking to reestablish an independent South Yemen \u2014 reviving the state that existed from 1967 until unification in 1990. Last week, the head of Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government called on STC to withdraw from territories they have recently captured in the southeastern parts of the country, The Associated Press reported.",

      "On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned that Yemen was facing a dangerous new escalation following recent advances by forces affiliated with the STC in the eastern governorates of Hadramawt and al-Mahra. Guterres said such unilateral actions risk deepening divisions, hardening positions and accelerating fragmentation, with potential spillover effects on regional security, including the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Horn of Africa.",
      "Bridget Toomey, a researcher at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told Fox News Digital that for the U.S. to support southern secession would be \"at odds with the stated policy of the internationally recognized government of Yemen, which currently exists for one Yemen.\" She said the United States supports that government, but added that backing the STC as a partner in counterterrorism missions and in the fight against the Houthis \"would not necessarily be at odds with the government,\" particularly because the STC and its leadership are part of the current governing framework.",

      "Yemen\u2019s war has long divided the nation. In the north, the Houthis rule Sanaa and much of western Yemen with support from Iran and ties to Hezbollah.

      "The internationally recognized Yemeni government, which the United States continues to support, is formally based in Aden but remains fragmented. The Saudi-backed Presidential Leadership Council serves as the recognized authority and has relied heavily on a coalition of competing factions, including the STC, to govern and confront the Houthis and to maintain control on the ground.",
      "Toomey said, \"The government has faced serious economic, oversight and capacity challenges and has struggled to deliver basic services, a situation compounded by the ongoing fight against the Houthis and Yemen\u2019s broader humanitarian crisis.\"",

Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government has accused STC-affiliated forces of carrying out deadly attacks in Hadramout and warned that the group\u2019s recent expansion risks sparking conflict between rival factions within the anti-Houthi camp. The Associated Press reported that Yemeni officials urged the STC to withdraw from areas seized in the east, cautioning that unilateral moves could undermine the political process and destabilize a fragile balance in the south.",
      "Atef rejected that characterization, describing the Hadramout operation as a major success that demonstrated the STC\u2019s ability to fight what he called hostile forces operating in coordination with the Houthis.

Foreign policy analyst and editor-in-chief of the Foreign Desk Lisa Daftari said that while Trump has delivered on several strategic priorities \u2014 including strong support for Israel, terrorist redesignations, aggressive action against drug cartels and renewed momentum behind the Abraham Accords \u2014 other moves warrant closer scrutiny.",
      "\"This record is tempered by concerning diplomatic overtures that urge caution. The characterization of Syria's president as \u2018young, attractive tough guy\u2019 appears premature given unverified claims about severing ties with terrorist organizations\u2014particularly troubling in light of recent attacks on U.S. servicemen. Similarly, the administration's approach to Turkey and Saudi Arabia suggests a willingness to extend trust and strategic concessions that may exceed what these relationships warrant, potentially squandering leverage on critical issues like the Abraham Accords. Whether these calculated diplomatic gambles yield strategic gains or prove costly remains an open question. The true measure of this foreign policy doctrine will ultimately depend on how these relationships and decisions unfold in 2026.\"",

He chose the womb, he chose a family, and the family is under attack. So this is a beautiful nativity display, but I think it speaks to the heart of every Christian that looks for hope in the world, that looks for hope for us to overcome our own sins, and certainly hope that we can end the tragedy and the barbaric nature of abortion in our world. America is leading the way through that.\" \"We just had a historic year for the pro-life movement in 2025, and I think 2026 is going to be even better,\" he added. \"This display certainly inspires so much hope and confidence that if we pray, if we fast, if we're faithful and we get to work, we can end abortion anywhere.\"",

    "summary": "The Department of Justice released the long-awaited Epstein files Friday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Justice on Friday began releasing the remaining investigative files relating to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a massive collection of court documents, correspondence, and dozens of photos that have previously not been made public.",
      "Some of the photos in the 3,500 files released on the DOJ\u2019s website appear to be highly sexual in nature and have been redacted. Some are marked CSAM, which stands for Child Sex Abuse Material.",
      "Among the items in the filings is a book titled \u201cMassage For Dummies\u201d that was seized by investigators.",
      "Epstein was charged in 2019 in Manhattan federal court with sex trafficking of minors, many of whom he allegedly preyed on while they were performing massages on him. He died while awaiting trial and his death was ruled a suicide.",
      "In the files, there are several photos of Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell on what appear to be trips or vacations with others.",
      "Epstein was known to surround himself with rich and influential people and was friends for many years with Donald Trump before the Manhattan mogul was elected president. A search tool on the DOJ's website surfaces Trump\u2019s name hundreds of times in the newly released documents.",
      "And there are more than a thousand mentions of former President Bill Clinton, as well as numerous photos of Epstein with Clinton, including a series of undated shots of them with Maxwell on what appears to be a trip to Thailand.",
      "There is also an undated shot of Clinton and Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger flanking a woman whose face has been blacked out at an unspecified event.",
      "And there are previously unknown photographs of Epstein with the late singer Michael Jackson and actor Kevin Spacey.",
      "The DOJ did not provide any context for the photos and NBC News has reached out to Clinton, Jagger, Spacey and Jackson\u2019s estate for comment.",
      "Clinton has repeatedly stated that he was unaware of Epstein\u2019s crimes and cut ties with him before he was accused in 2006 of having sex with a minor. He also has denied visiting Epsein\u2019s private island in the Caribbean \u2014 an assertion that was backed up by Trump confidante and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles in an interview with Vanity Fair that was published this week.",
      "The DOJ and FBI said over the summer they did not uncover any evidence to warrant opening an investigation into any other person in Epstein\u2019s orbit.",
      "Also included in the document release is an apparently new photo of Epstein holding a novelty check made out to him for $22,500 that bears what appears to be Trump\u2019s signature.",
      "Trump and Epstein were fast friends until they had a falling out some 15 years ago. But the president has not been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein.",
      "The newly released documents also include some of the case files from the FBI\u2019s New York office dating back to 2019 when they did the investigative legwork that led to Epstein being charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan.",
      "Large sections of those records, which include DMV records and grand jury subpoenas, have been redacted.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California), one of the lead sponsors of the Epstein Files Transparency Act that mandated the release of these records, said the DOJ has provided no explanation for blacking out so many of the documents.",
      "\u201cOne document, 199 pages of grand jury testimony, was completely redacted,\u201d Khanna said.",
      "Another sponsor of the law, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), posted on X that the DOJ document drop \u201cgrossly fails to comply with both the spirit and letter of the law\u201d that Trump signed into law last month and which specified that all the long-awaited files were supposed to be released on Friday.",
      "Earlier in the day, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the DOJ would release \u201cseveral hundred thousand documents\u201d and that the agency would \u201crelease more documents over the next couple of weeks.\u201d",
      "Also, when the documents appeared on the DOJ site, the search function enabling the public to navigate the files online appeared to not be working for some users.",
      "For weeks, the DOJ had not responded to requests for information about how and when the files would be made public, not even to the lawmakers like Khanna and Massie who had been asking for that info.",
      "In addition to Trump and Clinton, Epstein had been close friends with powerful men like Ohio billionaire Les Wexner and former Prince Andrew of Britain, among others.",
      "Epstein died in his jail cell while awaiting trial and the circumstances of his death fueled years of conspiracy theories, some of which Trump himself fanned.",
      "During the presidential campaign in 2024, Trump promised to \u201cdeclassify the Epstein files\u201d if elected. And in February, his handpicked attorney general, Pam Bondi, announced that an Epstein client list was \u201csitting on my desk right now\u201d waiting to be reviewed and released.",
      "But the hyped up \u201cEpstein binders\u201d Bondi circulated to MAGA influencers contained no client list and turned out to be information that was already in the public sphere.",
      "Then in July, Trump\u2019s core supporters erupted in anger when the DOJ and FBI announced that an exhaustive Epstein case review had uncovered no evidence that justified investigating other individuals, and despite earlier pledges of transparency, they said no more information about the case would be released.",
      "Faced with an open revolt by some of his most ardent supporters, Trump called the demands for releasing the files a \u201cDemocratic hoax.\u201d",
      "The GOP-led House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the Justice Department to turn the entirety of the Epstein files over to the panel in August. The DOJ eventually turned over 33,295 pages of Epstein-related records, most of which were already public. The committee referred to the release as the first of what would be a series of releases, but the DOJ did not turn over any other documents.",
      "The demands for Trump and his DOJ to release the remaining files only grew louder.",
      "Then, in November, the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released emails written by Epstein in which he wrote that Trump \u201cknew about the girls,\u201d but didn\u2019t directly accuse him of any wrongdoing.",
      "Under pressure, the House and Senate overwhelmingly passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act that Trump signed into law on Nov. 19.",
      "Epstein was first charged by Florida federal prosecutors in 2006 with having sex with a minor. He wound up pleading guilty to state charges involving a single underage victim after reaching a secret non-prosecution agreement.",
      "That deal resulted in Epstein serving just 13 months in a Palm Beach County jail, where he was allowed to leave almost daily via a work-release program and have his own private security detail.",
      "Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term for conspiring to sex traffic minors and is reportedly seeking to get her sentence commuted by Trump, according to a whistleblower report to Congress."

      "The Justice Department on Friday released thousands of documents from its files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but the massive document release was heavily redacted, incomplete and shed little new light on his crimes.",
      "It did, however, contain some celebrity cameos.",
      "Here's a look at what is \u2014 and what is not  \u2014 in the \"Epstein files\" so far.",
      "Many of the files had already been released",
      "Many of the materials that were released had been made public through various lawsuits and court filings, including the reports from the Palm Beach police in Florida that led to the initial state criminal probe in 2005. Some records were also released as part of the House Oversight Committee investigation into the Epstein case.",
      "Among the documents released were already public filings from the criminal cases against Epstein and his co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, including filings from Maxwell\u2019s appeal for her conviction and 20-year prison sentence on sex trafficking charges. It also includes various civil complaints filed against Epstein over the years.",
      "But not all of it was old news. One of the files released was Maria Farmer\u2019s 1996 complaint to the FBI alleging Epstein stole photos she had taken of her 12- and 16-year-old sisters and sold them. She sued the federal government this year in federal court over alleged failures to protect her and other Epstein victims.",
      "\u201cI feel redeemed,\" Farmer said in a statement Friday.",
      "Her legal team said in a news release that the document \u201cproves that if the FBI had simply done its job in 1996, Epstein\u2019s decades-long sex trafficking operation could have been stopped at the outset.\u201d",
      "Farmer's suit is still pending and the government has yet to file a response to her allegations.",
      "Lots of records are still missing",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act gave the attorney general 30 days to \u201cmake publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice\u201d involving Epstein, \u201cincluding all investigations, prosecutions, or custodial matters.\u201d",
      "That clock ran out Friday, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche acknowledged that the release was several hundred thousand pages short of \"all\" and that it could take a \"couple of weeks\" for the rest to come to light.",
      "He attributed the delay to the need to redact information about the victims. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is we are looking at every single piece of paper that we are going to produce, making sure that every victim \u2014 their name, their identity, their story \u2014 to the extent it needs to be protected, is completely protected,\u201d he told Fox News.",
      "The law's co-author, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said the department needs to give a detailed timeline on when those documents will be released, and also noted that some documents appeared to be overly redacted.",
      "\"Some of the documents I\u2019ve just been scanning them have very heavy redactions,\" Khanna said, and under the law, \"they owe the Congress and the American public an explanation for every redaction.\"",
      "Khanna\u2019s co-author, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said in a video on X Thursday that he\u2019d been told by victims\u2019 lawyers that \u201cthere are at least 20 names of men who are accused of sex crimes in the possession of the FBI,\u201d but no such names were evident in the release.",
      "Few mentions of Trump in the DOJ release",
      "President Donald Trump's past friendship with Epstein is well known \u2014 and his chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair that he appears in the files  \u2014 but there were only a few passing mentions of him in the documents released Friday.",
      "Trump has said he had a falling out with Epstein before he ever faced criminal charges, and he has not been accused of any wrongdoing.",
      "Wiles told Vanity Fair that Trump was in the files but he\u2019s \u201cnot doing anything awful.\u201d She said he and Epstein had been \u201cyoung, single playboys together.\u201d",
      "In a statement following the DOJ release, the White House said: \u201cThe Trump Administration is the most transparent in history. By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee\u2019s subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein\u2019s Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.\"",
      "Bill Clinton makes numerous appearances",
      "Former President Bill Clinton, however, made numerous appearances in photographs that were released with the files. In one, he's standing with Epstein as they smile while looking at something that's not shown in the photo. In another, he's in a hot tub. In a third, he's photographed swimming in a pool with Maxwell.",
      "In two others, Clinton is shown with his arm around a woman whose face is blacked out, and in a third, he's shown sitting at a table with a woman sitting on his leg.",
      "The pictures are undated and it's unclear where they were taken. Clinton traveled on Epstein's plane four times in 2002 and 2003 on trips for his Clinton Foundation, according to his spokesperson, Angel Ure\u00f1a.",
      "Trump has called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Clinton's ties to Epstein, although the former president has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Nothing in the photos suggests any wrongdoing.",
      "Ure\u00f1a said in a post on X that the \"White House hasn\u2019t been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton. This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they\u2019ll try and hide forever. So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn\u2019t about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be.\"",
      "Wiles told Vanity Fair that \"the president was wrong\" to suggest that there was anything incriminating about Clinton in the Epstein records.",
      "More celebrity sightings",
      "Clinton wasn't the only well-known person whose picture appeared in the files. Appearing with the former president in another picture was Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, with a woman whose face is blacked out standing between them.",
      "A representative for Jagger did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In another shot, Epstein was photographed standing next to the late pop star Michael Jackson, in front of a painting of a naked woman reading on the beach.",
      "Others showed actor Kevin Spacey standing with Epstein. None of the photos are dated, so it's unclear when or where any of them are from. Spacey told journalist Piers Morgan last year that he traveled on Epstein's plane as part of a humanitarian mission with the Clinton Foundation but that \"he never spent time with him.\u201d",
      "A representative for Spacey did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a post on X earlier this year, Spacey wrote: \"Release the Epstein files. All of them. For those of us with nothing to fear, the truth can\u2019t come soon enough.\"",
      "Nothing in the photos suggests any wrongdoing by any other figure. In a letter to Congress on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that the records \"did not reveal credible evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals, nor did it uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\""

      "A sealed medical order was signed Friday by the judge overseeing the case's initial stages. Nick Reiner, 32, is charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of his parents, renowned filmmaker Rob Reiner, 78, and Michele Singer Reiner, 70.",
      "That sealed order may have to deal with Reiner\u2019s mental health condition and treatment. The sources declined to discuss the contents of the order.",
      "Reiner was being treated for a serious psychiatric disorder at the time of his parents\u2019 murder, the three sources said.",

However, they said it was of limited investigative value given all of the other evidence in the case, which includes what was found at the crime scene, items recovered during the arrest and Reiner\u2019s alleged statements to police.",
      "The Reiners were found dead in the master bedroom of their Brentwood home, on the west side of Los Angeles, the city\u2019s assistant police chief, Dominic Choi, said Tuesday. The couple had been fatally stabbed \u201cin the early morning hours\u201d on Sunday, the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office said.",

      "Nick Reiner was arrested shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday in University Park, near the University of Southern California, about 15 miles from his parents\u2019 home.",
      "He was being held with no bail at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in downtown Los Angeles, according to inmate records.",
      "He appeared in a Los Angeles courthouse on Wednesday wearing a blue vest. His arraignment has been postponed twice, and his next appearance is set for Jan. 7. His attorney, Alan Jackson, has said the arraignment was initially postponed because Reiner was not medically cleared in time.",
      "The Reiners\u2019 other two children, Jake and Romy Reiner, called their parents' death \u201chorrific and devastating, saying they were their best friends.",

      "ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. \u2014 In a campaign-style speech Friday night, President Donald Trump made his latest effort to persuade Americans that he is reducing costs and improving the economy, while also veering off into lengthy riffs that had nothing to do with either.",
      "Trump is facing growing pressure to demonstrate that his policies are making groceries and other necessities more affordable. Recent polls have shown that voters are unhappy about economic conditions and blaming Trump for not doing enough to fix them.",
      "Eager to stave off losses in the midterm congressional elections next year, Trump is stepping up efforts to show that he is already producing results and that voters will see their financial burdens lighten as his term goes on. On Wednesday, he gave a rare primetime address to the nation\u2014 an opening bid in his campaign to change perceptions that the economy is weak.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fixing four years of disaster and decline,\u201d Trump said Friday at an event center in eastern North Carolina, a perennial battleground state where Republicans are trying to hold a Senate seat in 2026.",
      "\u201cWe were a dead country, and now we\u2019re talking about the golden age of America \u2014 think of it, in 10 months,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump suggested that his negotiating style is paying dividends for Americans who are struggling to pay for prescription medication. He recounted how he had threatened his French counterpart, Emmanel Macron, with higher tariffs unless he agreed to a new drug price regime that will slash costs in the U.S. Reluctantly, Macron complied, Trump said.",
      "\u201cI said if you don\u2019t do it I\u2019m going to charge you a 25% tariff on everything you sell to America.\u201d Trump said.",
      "Earlier in the day, Trump announced a deal with nine pharmaceutical companies that agreed to cut drug prices for Medicaid recipients and those who buy medications in cash, as opposed to buying them via their insurance policies.",

      "\"She was smart, but she was nasty,\" Trump told the crowd. \"I wouldn't want to go home to her. She was nasty. Remember, she was a nasty person. I was going to use the B-word,\" he said, but added that he held off because Melania Trump, the first lady, would have objected.",
      "Trump said he\u2019s in good health and has passed various cognitive tests. Speculation about Trump\u2019s fitness has become more pronounced as he has seemed to nod off at times in meetings and has sported a large bruise on his right hand.",
      "\u201cNow, there will be a time when perhaps I won\u2019t be 100%,\u201d said the president, who is 79 years old. \u201cTrue with all of us. And when that time comes, I will let you know about it and in fact, you will probably find out about it just by watching. But that time is not now, because I feel the same that I felt for 50 years.\u201d",
      "The president also made clear he was still angry over the 2022 FBI search for classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago home after his first term ended.",
      "\u201cThey went into my wife\u2019s closet,\u201d he said, accusing the federal agents who entered the home unannounced of leaving behind \"a mess.\"",

      "\u201cBut isn\u2019t that a strange position to be in? I\u2019ve got to make a deal and negotiate with myself,\u201d he said.",
      "Democrats are vowing to hammer the issue of affordability in midterm election campaigns. Prices have already played a major role in Democratic victories in a pair of races for governor this year. Some Republicans have called on Trump to keep a tight focus on reducing costs.",
      "But a series of distractions, some of his own making, have at times diluted the message he sets out to deliver.",
      "Fresh controversies arose just this week. On Monday, Trump suggested on social media that famed film director and actor Rob Reiner was killed because of his contempt for the president, a baseless argument that drew blowback from fellow Republicans.",

Jake Paul did really well and he deserves his props. It takes a real man to do that and he deserves respect for trying and trying and trying. But he came up against a real fighter tonight.\"",
      "Joshua, 36, entered the Netflix bout as a heavy betting favorite based on his experience and skill set. The Brit (29-4 with 26 KOs) is considered one of the best boxers of his generation with an Olympic gold medal and wins over the likes of Wladimir Klitschko, Andy Ruiz Jr., Dillian Whyte and Alexander Povetkin.",
      "Joshua rebounded from a loss last year to fellow British heavyweight Daniel Dubois. He is expected to face another, Tyson Fury, in 2026 according to multiple reports.",
      "\u201cI shook off the cobwebs tonight,\" Joshua said. \"And if Tyson Fury is serious, and if he wants to shake off his Twitter fingers and pick up some gloves, he should fight me. Let\u2019s see how serious he is.\u201d",
      "Paul, a social media star-turned boxer, suffered his first defeat since dropping a split decision to Tommy Fury in February 2023. He previously won six straight, including including victories against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. and Mike Tyson.",
      "Though Paul has quieted early critics with impressive boxing skill over a short period of time \u2014 he only became a professional in 2020 \u2014 Joshua was a major step up in competition. Most of Paul's opponents to date have been former MMA fighters or aging boxers like Tyson, who came out of retirement to fight Paul when he was 58 years old.",
      "\u201cAnthony is a great fighter,\" Paul said postfight to Helwani. \"I got my ass beat but that\u2019s what this sport is all about. This sport has helped me so much \u2014 I think my jaw is broken, by the way.\u201d"

      "When Millie is first hired as the housemaid for the Winchester family, she thinks she landed the perfect job. Her tasks include cleaning up the home and taking care of the family's seemingly spoiled daughter, Cece (Indiana Elle). She is given a room in the attic to live in, even though the door strangely locks from the outside and has one tiny window that can't be opened.",
      "After her first night sleeping at the house, Millie wakes up to find the kitchen a wreck, with Nina throwing dishes onto the ground and screaming. Nina is only able to calm down when her husband, Andrew, runs into the kitchen and wraps her in a hug.",
      "Although Nina seems to be a perfectly normal housewife when Millie first met her, she quickly devolves and shows that she is deeply troubled. Millie then has to deal with Nina\u2019s ridiculous requests.",
      "Amid Nina's crazy behaviors, Millie builds a relationship with Andrew, who understands the way Nina functions. Their relationship quickly escalates from platonic to sexual when they end up going to New York City to see a play together, and spend the night at a hotel room.",
      "The story comes to a head when Andrew kicks Nina out of the house and says he plans on divorcing her.",

      "Andrew proceeds to lock Millie in her attic room and forces her to cut herself in the stomach with the pieces of the broken plate as a punishment.",
      "The point of view of the film suddenly shifts from Millie's perspective to Nina's perspective. The story goes back in time to recount when single mother Nina first met Andrew and had a quick engagement and wedding. Andrew always wanted a child of their own but as viewers discover, there's a reason Nina didn't want to get pregnant.",
      "It shows how the first few days of their marriage were picturesque, with Andrew seeming like the perfect husband before he suddenly shows his true nature.",
      "Andrew gets upset with Nina for not keeping up the roots of her bleached blond hair and locks her in the attic room. He says that she has to repent for making a mistake and forces her to pull 100 strands of hair out of her head and place them in an envelope in order to be let out of the room.",
      "Nina remains trapped in the room for days without access to food or water. In a feverish state, she finally gives in and completes the punishment.",
      "For years, Nina was forced to deal with the abuse. She feared Cece would be taken away from her if she tried to leave Andrew, as everyone believes he is the perfect husband and she is the crazy wife.",
      "However, Nina comes up with a plan to hire a housemaid, Millie, a pretty young girl with a history of violence to steal Andrew's attention. She knows that Andrew will be attracted to her and would take care of her \u2014 just like he did with Nina.",
      "How Does \u2018The Housemaid\u2019 End?",

      "It is revealed that Millie was in jail for murdering a man who tried to rape her roommate when she was in high school. With this violent background, she is not afraid to stand up to Andrew's  abuse.",
      "Nina feels guilty about leaving Millie with Andrew, knowing that he will torture her, so she goes back to the house to help her. She opens the door to the attic room, thinking that Millie was trapped in there, but actually lets Andrew out of the room.",

      "Does Millie go Back to Jail?",
      "After Andrew's death, the police come to the house to question Millie and Nina.

      "\u201cThis can be the last one. There\u2019s only one (unanswered question) in the story.

In \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d viewers get to meet the Mangkwan clan, also known as the Ash People, who are led by their wicked leader Varang, played by Oona Chaplin.",
      "When Will \u2018Avatar 4\u2019 Be Released?",
      "The year delay in the release of \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d pushed back the release dates of the franchise\u2019s final two movies, Deadline reported in June 2023.",
      "\u201cAvatar 4,\u201d which was originally scheduled for a December 2026 release, will now arrive in theaters in December 2029, according to Deadline.",
      "But, as Cameron told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published this week, he hopes the just-released \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d is another box-office smash in order for him to continue with the franchise.",
      "Still, Cameron shared tidbits about the script of \u201cAvatar 4\u201d with Entertainment Weekly way back in 2022, revealing that the movie would feature \u201ca big time jump\u201d to accommodate how much the franchise\u2019s younger actors have aged in real life.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re young men, young women at that point, when we get to the B side of that time jump,\u201d he said.",
      "During a 2023 appearance on \u201cWho\u2019s Talking to Chris Wallace,\u201d Cameron confirmed he\u2019d already begun working on both final films.",
      "\u201c\u2018Avatar 4\u2019 and \u20185\u2019 are both written. We even have some of \u20184\u2019 in the can,\u201d said Cameron.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve begun a franchise at this point,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe can safely say we\u2019ve begun a saga that can now play out over multiple films, which was our original goal.\u201d",
      "When Wallace asked if Cameron already knew the final scene of the entire franchise, Cameron responded, \u201cOh yeah. It\u2019s all been written. The scripts for 2, 3, 4 and 5 were all finished over five years ago. It\u2019s all mapped out.\u201d",
      "When Will \u2018Avatar 5\u2019 Be Released?",

      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to talk about it, but I\u2019ve now subsequently heard that Jim (Cameron) has talked about it a little bit,\u201d Landau said. \u201cIn movie five there is a section of the story where we go to Earth. And we go to it to open people\u2019s eyes, open Neytiri\u2019s eyes, to what exists on Earth.\u201d",

      "\u201cEarth is not just represented by the RDA,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like you\u2019re defined by the choices you make in life, not all humans are bad. Not all Na\u2019vi are good. And that\u2019s the case here on Earth. And we want to expose Neytiri to that.\u201d"

The Ash People are led by their evil leader Varang (Oona Chaplin).",
      "So as the war wages on, here is what happens at the end of \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash.\u201d",
      "What Happens at the End of 'Avatar: Fire and Ash'?",
      "Throughout the film, Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) has been exploring her power and attempting to connect with the spirit world and Pandora\u2019s deity, Eywa.",
      "The humans and Quaritch are also on the hunt for Jake, who eventually surrenders to them when his family is in danger and after they have captured Spider. Scientists want to use Spider after he acquires an ability to breathe on Pandora without an oxygen mask, thanks to the mycelium that has invaded his body when Kiri tried to save his life.",
      "An injured, healing and angry Neytiri infiltrates the RDA\u2019s facilities to rescue Jake. She is successful thanks to the help of Spider, who broke out of his cell, and marine biologist Dr. Ian Garvin (Jemaine Clement), who is against the humans killing Tulkun.",
      "Meanwhile, the RDA has big plans to kill dozens of Tulkun, whose brains carry amrita, a substance that stops humans from aging. After meeting the Ash People earlier in the film, Quaritch goes to Varang to ask for help in defeating Jake and the other Na\u2019vi in exchange for firearms and machinery. The Ash People come in handy when the big war rages.",
      "When they get back to the Metkayina clan, Jake rallies up as many Na\u2019vi to fight and save their people and all the innocent Tulkun. In the process, many get injured and Jake and Neytiri\u2019s children \u2014 Lo\u2019ak, Kirk, Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss) \u2014 as well as Spider, take matters into their own hands.",
      "During the fight, pregnant Ronal (Kate Winslet) dies, but not before delivering her baby and asking Neytiri to take care of her baby girl.",
      "Kiri, with the help of Spider and Tuk, successfully gets Eywa to help and fight against the RDA. Other casualties include Scoresby (Brendan Cowell), who is killed by a Tulkun, and General Ardmore (Edie Falco).",
      "Jake \u2014 who has been fighting alongside the Great Leonopteryx, the dragon-like warrior \u2014 then gets into a one-on-one battle with Quaritch on the floating islands. At one point, Spider is thrown into the middle of their fight. He slips and is at risk of falling to his death. Quaritch attempts to save him but also puts himself in danger \u2014 and Jake helps save them both. The encounter seems to draw them all to a truce.",
      "When Neytiri, her children and Tsireya (Bailey Bass) arrive to help defeat Quaritch, Jake tells them to stop. However, Quaritch jumps off the floating island and into an inferno below. It sure doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019d survive that, but \u201cAvatar\u201d fans know that guy has a thousand lives.",
      "As the movie comes to an end, one of the final scenes shows Kiri guiding Spider into the spirit world where they reunite with Neteyam, as well as Dr. Grace Augustine (Weaver), Kiri\u2019s biological mother.",
      "Does \u2018Avatar: Fire and Ash\u2019 Have a Post-Credits Scene?",
      "No, \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d does not have a post-credits scene. Neither 2009\u2019s \u201cAvatar\u201d or 2022\u2019s \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d had post-credit scenes and the third film follows that same lead."

      "In an exclusive interview with TODAY\u2019s Craig Melvin, the \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d star described himself as \u201creally fortunate in an unfortunate diagnosis.\u201d",
      "The conversation took place at Van Der Beek\u2019s ranch in Texas and touched on everything from his symptoms to how his wife and six children are dealing with his illness.",
      "The actor, 48, announced he had colorectal cancer last year. In September, he sparked concern when he didn\u2019t attend a \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d reunion in person, appearing in a video instead.",
      "But Van Der Beek said his absence was not cancer related and that he had to miss the event after being \u201chit with some stomach bugs,\u201d which also caused him to lose weight.",
      "\u201cI feel much, much better than I did a couple months ago,\u201d Van Der Beek told TODAY in an interview that aired on Friday, Dec. 19.",
      "\u201cIt's been a longer journey than I ever thought it would be. It's required more of me \u2014 more patience, more discipline, more strength than I knew I had. I knew I was strong. I didn't know I was this strong. But I feel good,\u201d he told Craig.",
      "The actor said he\u2019s still getting cancer treatment, \u201ctrying a bunch of stuff,\u201d though he declined to be specific about the therapies he\u2019s undergone.",
      "Shocked to Be Diagnosed",
      "Van Der Beek never suspected he would face a serious disease.",
      "\u201cI was so healthy, was in amazing cardiovascular shape. I was doing the cold plunges, and the saunas, and the intermittent fasting and all of it,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI had Stage 3 cancer and had no idea.\u201d",
      "His symptoms included a change of bowel habits and feeling like something was off with this body. But they weren\u2019t dramatic \u2014 \u201cnothing that made me think, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to run to a doctor right now,\" he said. Still, he made an appointment and asked for a colonoscopy.",
      "Van Der Beek remembered waking up from the anesthesia after the procedure and still in a haze when the doctor told him, \"It is cancer.\"",
      "\u201cI went into shock. I really don't think I knew what to do. Neither did my wife. And we drove home in silence. And part of me wanted to panic. Part of me wanted to just freak out. But then another part of my brain was like, \u2018You don't know enough yet,\u2019\u201d he recalled.",
      "His whole day was consumed with signing up for medical portals, scheduling appointments and scans. He had to pull out of acting roles as cancer became his full-time job.",
      "Van Der Beek was 46 when he underwent a colonoscopy and wants people to know anyone 45 and over can get colorectal cancer screening, whether they have symptoms or not. It can be done with a stool test, a colonoscopy or other techniques.",
      "He suspects doctors would have caught his cancer earlier if he\u2019d asked to be checked right at 45, but he\u2019s turned that regret into energy for raising awareness, which makes him feel better.",
      "\"If anybody takes anything away from this interview, it would be get tested, talk to your doctor,\u201d Van Der Beek said.",
      "Grateful for Family",
      "The actor credits his wife, Kimberly, for keeping him going, calling her \u201can absolute saint.\u201d She\u2019s become a caregiver, nurse, the head of the household and the one managing schedules \u2014 getting the kids to appointments and gymnastics, he said.",
      "The couple has been honest about his diagnosis with their six children, who are between the ages of 4 and 15. The worst case scenario of them crying and being scared never happened, he noted.",
      "\u201cKids know if you're not right. They know if you're sick. They know you're not feeling well. They know if you're in pain,\u201d Van Der Beek said.",
      "\u201cSo their request to me, especially the older ones, is, \u2018Just be honest with us. We want to know.\u2019\u201d",
      "He\u2019s proud to see them build resilience as they handle situations he never wanted to put them in and come out stronger.",
      "New Perspective on Life",
      "Van Der Beek revealed he gets scared sometimes, but tries to breathe through the fear.",
      "\u201cIn private moments, for sure, I break down and get scared and feel weak. And it's just all part of the journey,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe hardest part has been the patience this has required as I'll, say, make a plan and then not be able to follow through on it.\u201d",
      "Still, the actor calls cancer the best thing that ever happened to him because it forced him to make lifestyle changes and appreciate every moment. \u201cPresence I think is really the gift that cancer has given me,\u201d he said.",
      "Van Der Beek started eating a healthier diet and has slowed down. He pondered the concept of self-love and what it meant if he was no longer the same husband, father and provider for his family.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018If I'm just an underweight dude in a room with cancer who can't put his kids to bed because I'm away getting treatment, and can't kiss his wife because I'm not in the same state, what am I?\u2019\u201d he recalled.",
      "\u201cWhat I realized was I'm still worthy of love. My own love, God's love. And so are we all. That I never would've come to realize had I not gone through this journey.\u201d",
      "New Acting Roles",
      "Van Der Beek has just wrapped up filming the prequel series to \u201cLegally Blonde,\u201d which will stream on Amazon Prime Video.",
      "He called the work fun, noting he\u2019s getting more acting offers and is lucky to be in demand.",
      "The actor wants to go back on Broadway, calling stage acting his first love.",
      "Whatever comes his way, he\u2019s focusing on his faith.",
      "\u201cBefore cancer, God was something I tried to fit into my life as much as possible. After cancer, I feel like a connection to God, whatever that is, is kind of the whole point of this exercise on this planet,\u201d Van Der Beek said.",
      "\u201cTo be good stewards of our relationships with other people, and in doing so, connecting to whatever that force of God's love is.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee's governor pardoned country star Jelly Roll on Thursday for his criminal past in the state, acknowledging the Nashville native's long road back from drugs and prison through soul-searching, songwriting and advocacy for second chances.",
      "The rapper-turned-singer whose legal name is Jason Deford has spoken for years about his redemption arc before diverse audiences, from people serving time in correctional centers to concert crowds and even in testimony before Congress.",
      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee issued the pardon after friends and civic leaders of the Grammy-nominated musician joined in an outpouring of support.",
      "Jelly Roll's convictions include robbery and drug felonies. He has said a pardon would make it easier for him to travel internationally for concert tours and to perform Christian missionary work without filling out burdensome paperwork.",
      "He was one of 33 people to receive pardons Thursday from Lee, who for years has issued clemency decisions around the Christmas season. Lee said Jelly Roll's application underwent the same monthslong thorough review as other applicants. The state parole board gave a nonbinding, unanimous recommendation for Jelly Roll's pardon in April.",
      "\"His story is remarkable, and it's a redemptive, powerful story, which is what you look for and what you hope for,\" Lee told reporters.",
      "Jelly Roll and Lee meet at the governor's mansion",
      "Lee said he never met Jelly Roll until Thursday, when the musician visited the governor's mansion over the pardon news. The two hugged in front of a lit Christmas tree and a fireplace decorated with holiday garlands.",
      "Unlike recent high-profile federal pardons, which let people off the hook for prison, a Tennessee pardon serves as a statement of forgiveness for someone who has already completed a prison sentence. Pardons offer a path to restoring certain civil rights such as the right to vote, although there are some legal limitations, and the governor can specify the terms.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \"Whitsitt Chapel\" and crossover songs like \"Need a Favor.\" He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and also picked up seven career Grammy nominations.",
      "Much of his music deals with overcoming adversity, like the song \"Winning Streak\" about someone's first day sober. Or the direct-and-to-the-point, \"I Am Not Okay.\"",
      "\"When I first started doing this, I was just telling my story of my broken self,\" he told The Associated Press in an interview. \"By the time I got through it, I realized that my story was the story of many. So now I'm not telling my story anymore. I'm getting to pull it right from the crevices of the people whose story's never been told.\"",
      "Jelly Roll: 'I was a part of the problem'",
      "Before the parole board, Jelly Roll said he first fell in love with songwriting while in custody, calling music a therapeutic passion project that \"would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable.\"",
      "Outside of sold-out shows, he's testified before the U.S. Senate about the dangers of fentanyl, describing his drug-dealing younger self as \"the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about.\"",
      "\"I was a part of the problem,\" he told lawmakers at the time. \"I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Jelly Roll's most serious convictions include a robbery at 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two armed accomplices steal $350 from people in a home in 2002. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were quickly arrested. Jelly Roll was unarmed, and was sentenced to one year in prison plus probation.",
      "In another run-in 2008, police found marijuana and crack cocaine in his car, leading to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "Sheriff whose jail held Jelly Roll urged a pardon",
      "Friends and civic leaders cited his transformation in backing a pardon.",
      "Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who runs Nashville's jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino cited Jelly Roll's donations from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "\"I think he has a chance and is in the process of rehabilitating a generation, and that's not just words,\" Hall said in a phone interview Thursday. \"I'm talking about what I see we need in our country, is people who accept responsibility, accept the fact that they make mistakes and accept the fact that they need help.\"",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks the state's five-year timeline for eligibility after his sentence expired. Prominent Nashville attorney David Raybin represented Jelly Roll in the pardon case.",
      "Lee's office said no one was pardoned Thursday who had a homicide or a sex-related conviction, or for any crime committed as an adult against a minor."

      "In a teaser for the \u201cSurvivor\u201d Season 49 finale, host Jeff Probst said, \u201cThis has been one of the most unpredictable games we have ever seen.\u201d But did the five remaining castaways deliver an epic ending to the season?",
      "When the three-hour Season 49 finale began on Wednesday, Dec. 17, there were five contestants hoping to win the title of \u201csole \u2018Survivor\u2019\u201d and the $1 million prize: Kristina Mills, Rizo Velovic, Sage Ahrens-Nichols, Savannah Louie and Sophi \"Soph\" Balerdi.",

Plus, the after show revealed which two castaways will return for the historic Season 50, arriving Wednesday, Feb. 25,  2026.",
      "Read on to find out everything that happened in the Season 49 finale, including who was crowned the winner, below.",
      "1st  Immunity Challenge",
      "After Soph found an advantage in the jungle to help her in the Immunity Challenge, she learned from Probst at the challenge that half of her puzzle pieces were already placed in the correct spots. But Soph instantly fell behind during the first portion of the challenge and struggled to crawl through the mud.",
      "Meanwhile, Savannah sped through nearly every portion and quickly completed the puzzle, giving her a record-tying fourth Immunity Challenge win and guaranteeing her a spot in the final four.  She also won the reward and chose to take Sage to the Sanctuary to enjoy steak and potatoes.",
      "In her confessional, Savannah smiled wide as she celebrated her win and pointed out how she has been able to outlast her foes all season long.",
      "1st Tribal Council",
      "Back at camp, Kristina \u2014 who assumed Savannah, Soph and Rizo would vote together given that they've been a strong trio for most of the game \u2014 pitched voting out Sage to Soph and Rizo. During the reward meal, Sage suggested to Savannah that the better move was to vote out Kristina since she could beat anyone in the Fire-Making Challenge. Thus, the Tres Leches alliance was at a stalemate going into Tribal Council.",
      "After a back-and-forth between Kristina and Sage at Tribal Council where they both explained why the other was a threat, it was time to vote. Rizo \u2014 who had been holding onto his Hidden Immunity Idol for a record nine Tribal Councils \u2014 finally played his idol for himself before the votes were read.",
      "Probst read the votes and revealed Kristina as the 14th person voted out and seventh member of the jury.",
      "2nd Immunity Challenge",
      "Following an interruption due to an address from President Trump, the show picked up at the second and final Immunity Challenge of the night.",
      "The final four were neck and neck as they reached the final portion of the challenge. Soph pulled out a comeback victory and received her first Immunity Challenge win of the season.",
      "\"Oh my God, this is a dream!\" she said when Probst placed the necklace around her neck.",
      "Fire-Making Challenge",
      "As the winner, Soph had to choose which person to take to the end with her and which two castaways had to face off in the Fire-Making Challenge. She told the other three that they should practice while she contemplated her decision, adding that she didn't want them to plead their cases.",
      "In a confessional, Savannah said she felt betrayed by her \"best friend\" Soph for not instantly wanting to save her. Rizo tried to remain optimistic and said he had more experience making fire compared to Savannah and Sage. Sage also had a positive mentality as she prepared, telling herself that whatever was meant to happen would happen.",
      "At Tribal Council, Probst said Soph's choice could be a $1 million decision. She announced that she wanted to take Sage to the final three and have her two allies, Savannah and Rizo, make fire to earn the last spot.",
      "While Rizo struggled and repeatedly smothered his fire, Savannah nurtured a strong fire that continued to grow until it burned through the rope, making her the winner.",
      "Rizo became the eighth and final member of the jury. Before leaving, Rizo shared some emotional departing words. \"For a little Albanian boy from New York City... to say I have no regrets, to say I made my family proud, to say I made a whole country proud, I truly feel like I left an impact on this game.\"",
      "He asked to be called by his nickname, \"Riz God,\" as Probst snuffed his torch.",
      "Final Tribal Council",
      "As their final breakfast arrived at camp, Savannah, Sage and Soph reflected on being the first all-female final three in 20 seasons. They also shared some of their favorite moments with each member of the jury.",
      "Next, it was time for Final Tribal Council to begin. Rizo kicked things off by sharing kind words for the three ladies. The remaining members of the jury then posed questions that allowed each finalist to elaborate on their strategies and how they outwitted, outlasted and outplayed everyone else.",
      "When asked to name her most strategic move, Soph said she built strong connections outside of her trio that helped her social game. Savannah recalled a conversation with jury member Sophie Segreti where she pitched working together. Sage mentioned her move to vote out Sophie over Savannah.",
      "For their final pitches, Soph noted that she had been to 12 Tribal Councils and voted out more people than anyone else. Savannah said she successfully dodged the most bullets because she was adaptable, prioritized key relationships and dominated in Immunity Challenges. Sage said she had an important social component to her game that worked hand in hand with her strategic game, allowing her to build close friendships.",
      "And the Winner Is\u2026",
      "\"The jury has made their decision. I'll read the votes,\" Probst said. After three votes were revealed, each woman had a vote each. But as he continued to read the votes, Savannah's name appeared again and again. Savannah was crowned the winner of Season 49.",
      "The cast all toasted with champagne as Probst kicked off the after show.",

      "In the final moments of the episode, Probst introduced the first trailer for \"Survivor\" Season 50. At the start of the clip, the host is shown speaking to all the returning players. He tells them he expects them all to give \"everything\" they have to win.",

      "The deal between the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and YouTube will start with the 101st Oscars ceremony in 2029 and run through 2033. The telecast has aired live on ABC since the 1970s.",
      "\u201cWe are thrilled to enter into a multifaceted global partnership with YouTube to be the future home of the Oscars and our year-round Academy programming,\u201d Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Lynette Howell Taylor said in a joint statement.",
      "\u201cThe Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible \u2014 which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community,\u201d Kramer and Taylor said.",
      "The two academy leaders said the partnership would \u201cleverage YouTube\u2019s vast reach and infuse the Oscars and other Academy programming with innovative opportunities for engagement while honoring our legacy.\u201d",
      "The deal symbolizes YouTube\u2019s growing dominance in the television and video ecosystem \u2014 and Hollywood\u2019s recognition of digital media\u2019s power. The platform, which is owned by the technology behemoth YouTube, represented the largest share of U.S. streaming television viewing last month, according to Nielsen, a leading measurement firm.",

      "The most recent telecast brought in nearly 20 million viewers \u2014 a slight improvement over Covid-era installments, but still a fraction of the audience that tuned in for the ceremony at the height of its commercial and cultural power.",
      "\u201cThe Oscars are one of our essential cultural institutions, honoring excellence in storytelling and artistry,\u201d YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said in a statement. \u201cPartnering with the Academy to bring this celebration of art and entertainment to viewers all over the world will inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars\u2019 storied legacy.\u201d",
      "The ceremony \u2014 including red carpet coverage, behind-the-scenes programming \u2014 will be available live and for free to viewers around the world, as well as to YouTube TV subscribers in the United States, according to the academy.",

    "story": [
      "A pair of deadly attacks this month, in Syria and Australia, has shone a fresh spotlight on the Islamic State, the militant group whose sudden rise to power in the Middle East and reign of terror throughout the world had appeared to crest, and then fall, during the 2010s.",
      "But for experts who study ISIS, law enforcement and intelligence officials who fight it and the growing number of victims who have been attacked or intimidated, the group has long been more down than out \u2013 a diminished threat, but a threat nonetheless.",
      "\u201cThey never went away,\u201d said Aaron Zelin, an expert on the group and a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cThe nature of the threat just changed and the nature of the way they organized themselves changed. But what\u2019s animated the Islamic State has never changed.\u201d",
      "Last weekend, a member of Syria\u2019s security forces shot dead three Americans -- two soldiers and an interpreter -- near the city of Palmyra. The Islamic State didn\u2019t claim responsibility for the attack, but the U.S. and Syrian governments both blamed the terrorist group.",
      "The U.S. military launched strikes against Islamic State infrastructure and weapons sites in Syria in retaliation for the attack, officials said Friday.",
      "\u201cWe are striking very strongly against ISIS strongholds in Syria, a place soaked in blood which has many problems, but one that has a bright future if ISIS can be eradicated,\u201d President Donald Trump  said Friday in a post on Truth Social.",
      "In Sydney, two men opened fire on a Hanukkah gathering at  Bondi Beach on Sunday, killing at least 15 people. Both men were shot by police. One man died; the other, the man\u2019s son, survived and has been charged in the attack. Islamic State social media accounts traditionally linked to the group praised the attack but did not officially claim responsibility, referring to it  in an official publication as \"Sydney's pride.\" The two suspects were found with Islamic State flags and literature.",
      "While the two incidents were notable for their geographic spread, the identities of those killed and a perception that the Islamic State had faded from global headlines, experts say they were exceptions that belie a measurable metric: ISIS is getting weaker, and arrests and attacks have been declining globally.",
      "\u201cThere will always be some space for attacks here and there. But the trajectory is that ISIS is still on the decline,\u201d said Renad Mansour, a research fellow at Chatham House, a London-based foreign policy think tank. \u201cAnyone who has a grievance and finds a network can basically attack, and in many cases the central ISIS leaders don\u2019t know it happens until it happens, and then they claim it.\u201d",
      "The group has claimed 1,100 attacks so far in 2025, he said, down from a high of 3,460 in 2019.",
      "There have been 383 ISIS-related arrests worldwide so far in 2025, Zelin said, citing the Washington Institute\u2019s Islamic State Select Worldwide Activity Map, an initiative he leads. Reporting from police sources found 531 such arrests last year, Zelin said, the vast majority of which occurred in active war zones such as Iraq and Syria.",
      "One thing the recent attacks showcase is a strategy that has made the Islamic State effective in the past: its big-tent approach to operations and ideology that allow \u201clone-wolf\u201d actors to affiliate themselves with ISIS with almost no vetting or coordination.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re seeing more of and more of the hallmarks of ISIS-related activity that date back 10 years ago,\u201d Rebecca Weiner, Deputy Commissioner Intelligence and Counterterrorism at the New York Police Department, told NBC News. \u201cThe do-it-yourself model was professionalized and has been really deployed around the world by ISIS, inspiring dozens of people to carry out attacks in their name.\u201d",
      "The Islamic State emerged from the ferment of Syria\u2019s civil war in the early 2010s, when Syria\u2019s porous borders and surfeit of Islamist fighters offered fertile recruiting ground for all manner of jihadi groups. But ISIS  distinguished itself by forming a self-governing state encompassing parts of Syria and Iraq that promised a return to the political expansionism of early Islam.",
      "Though defeated, that \u201ccaliphate\u201d has remained a central part of the Islamic State\u2019s message, even as the group has shifted its focus more toward terrorism than nation-building.",
      "The two suspects in the Bondi Beach shooting are known to have visited the Philippines before the attack. If investigators find that the two men underwent ISIS commando training in southern Mindanao island, that could point to a level of centralized coordination that investigators haven\u2019t seen from ISIS in years.",
      "The group\u2019s activities over the past year have also shown an enduring, if dampened, public appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, Polish authorities said they had arrested a teenager who they said had sought contact with the group and whom they suspected of planning an attack on a Christmas market.",
      "In Michigan in October, two men were charged with plotting a mass shooting over Halloween weekend.",
      "And almost a year ago, an ISIS-inspired American Muslim killed 14 people by driving a truck into New Year\u2019s revelers in New Orleans.",
      "The Islamic State has still been unable to reconstitute its so-called caliphate, a vast Islamist emirate the group ruled across parts of Iraq and Syria until it was finally destroyed in 2019. In both countries, Islamic State attacks reached historic lows in the past year.",
      "Where the group has made strides and managed to constitute some territory is in the Sahel region of northwest sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 countries like Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.",
      "The Islamic State\u2019s presence in the remote, arid and sparsely populated parts of Africa may still feel more like merely surviving than thriving to the group\u2019s members and potential recruits.",
      "\u201cEven though they\u2019re active in several African countries, it doesn\u2019t have the same kind of ideological reverence because there is so much history in the Arab world related to Islam,\u201d said Zelin.",
      "And while the Sydney terror attack was lethally successful, many of the Islamic State\u2019s attacks have been thwarted by law enforcement as multinational counterterrorism sharing has grown far stronger.",
      "While observers have said it\u2019s too early to say the recent attacks amount to a resurgence of the group, two relatively recent changes could help revive its fortunes. The fall of Bashar al Assad\u2019s regime in Syria a year ago revived the country\u2019s chaos, offering a wider opening for Islamic State.",
      "When Syrian President Ahmed Al Sharaa \u2014 himself a former Islamist militant who once led a like-minded Al Qaeda offshoot group \u2014 joined the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS last month, it painted a target on the Syrian government\u2019s back.",
      "Even before that, an Islamic State-claimed attack on a church in Damascus that killed at least 25 people in June once again jolted Syrian authorities\u2019 attention to Islamic State\u2019s threat.",
      "Meanwhile, the group\u2019s messaging has exploited Israel\u2019s highly lethal war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip as a rallying cry for attacks against the West. Palestinian health officials say over 70,000 people have been killed in the war.",
      "\u201cI think the temperature has been turned up by the conflict in Gaza over the past two years,\u201d said Colin P. Clarke, the executive director of the Soufan Center, a New York-based security think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s brought in a larger swath of people who are now kind of consuming information that leads them pretty quickly through social media algorithms to extreme content.\u201d",
      "As much of the world gathers for the end-of-year religious holidays,  Islamic State commandos \u2014 whether self-annointed or directed by its leadership \u2014 are taking notice as well.",
      "The group has targeted religious festivities in the past, and analysts warned that another spectacular assault against Christian, Jewish or Muslim targets could give the Islamic State the publicity boost it needs for a more deadly and influential 2026.",
      "\u201cThese are big times when they might try to do stuff,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIf they can do stuff again quickly, that would be monumental for them, because they haven\u2019t been able to do stuff like that in years.\u201d"

      "Decades before this week\u2019s manhunt through New England ended with the discovery of his body in a storage facility, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente had been an academic powerhouse in his home country of Portugal. Enrolled at one of the country\u2019s most prestigious engineering schools, Neves Valente graduated at the top of his class, seemingly poised for a bright future.",
      "Now, Neves Valente is dead at age 48, suspected of committing two shocking acts of violence \u2014 and authorities in both the United States and Portugal are looking for a motive that could explain his actions.",
      "Officials believe Neves Valente was behind a mass shooting that killed two students and injured nine other people on Saturday at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. He is also suspected of fatally shooting 47-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno Loureiro at Loureiro\u2019s home in the Boston suburb of Brookline on Monday.",
      "The shootings gripped residents of Rhode Island and Massachusetts as days passed without anyone in custody. Then on Thursday, authorities announced they had closed in on a storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire, where they found Neves Valente\u2019s body, who appeared to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
      "Little is known about how he chose his targets, though Neves Valente has past connections to Brown and to Loureiro.",
      "A Providence police affidavit says that Neves Valente came to the U.S. to attend Brown University from August 2000 to spring 2001 on a student visa in the physics Ph.D. program. He requested a leave of absence from the school in 2001, and ultimately withdrew in 2003, the affidavit said.",
      "Neves Valente did not obtain a degree during his time there, Brown\u2019s president said in an email, and he did not have a current affiliation with the university. The email said that during his three semesters at Brown, Neves Valente most likely would have spent time in Barus & Holley, the building where Saturday\u2019s massacre occurred.",
      "Scott Watson told NBC News that he attended Brown with Neves Valente and had been his only friend there. He said Neves Valente was socially awkward and would often complain about Brown.",
      "\u201cHe would say the classes were too easy \u2014 honestly, for him they were,\u201d Watson wrote in an email. \u201cHe already knew most of the material and was genuinely impressive.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe could be kind and gentle, though he often became frustrated \u2014 sometimes angry \u2014 about courses, professors, and living conditions,\u201d Watson wrote.",
      "Watson recalled a conflict that Neves Valente had with another student whom he said Neves Valente would refer to as a \"slave\" because the student was from Brazil.",
      "\"I had to break up a fight once,\" he wrote.",
      "Prior to that time, both Neves Valente and Loureiro, the MIT professor, attended the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico in Lisbon, according to the school, which said that they were enrolled from 1995 to 2000 in the undergraduate program in technological physics engineering. Rog\u00e9rio Cola\u00e7o, the president of Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, told the Portuguese newspaper Expresso that Neves Valente graduated with a final average grade of 19 out of 20 \u2014 an exceptionally high score, particularly given how rigorous the university is.",
      "Even before starting college, Neves Valente had made a strong impression academically. He represented Portugal at the 1995 International Physics Olympiad for secondary school students, in Canberra, Australia, a news clip from the science publication Gazeta da F\u00edsica shows.",
      "Yet Neves Valente seemed to have left little imprint on those he studied with.",
      "\u201cMost classmates have no memory of Cl\u00e1udio Valente, other than the fact that he was the top student in the program that year,\u201d Cola\u00e7o told Expresso.",
      "Loureiro, meanwhile, was a researcher at the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico's plasmas and nuclear fusion unit and was described in a statement from the school as a \"brilliant colleague.\"",
      "\"His friends and colleagues at IPFN and at T\u00e9cnico, some of whom continued to collaborate with Nuno to this day, are deeply distressed by his premature passing,\" the statement said. \"We remember a brilliant colleague, with whom it was a scientific and personal pleasure to collaborate.\"",
      "Alex Schekochihin, a longtime friend and colleague of Loureiro's, said in an email that it was difficult to find anyone who did not like Loureiro.",
      "\"He was a fantastic physicist, a very effective leader with a clear vision and sophisticated sense of strategy, and an amazing human being,\" he wrote.",
      "What Neves Valente accomplished personally or professionally after graduation is not as clear.",
      "The Providence police affidavit said that Neves Valente obtained legal permanent resident status in 2017. Public records show he lived in Las Vegas that year and, more recently, appeared to reside in Miami. He had rented a hotel room in Boston twice in late November, an FBI agent wrote in a separate affidavit.",
      "A tipster on the chat forum Reddit led authorities to track down Neves Valente after the shootings. The Portuguese Criminal Police, Portugal\u2019s investigative force, said it was cooperating with U.S. authorities in the investigation.",
      "The Brown University students killed in Saturday\u2019s attack were identified as Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov and Ella Cook. Umurzokov, from Uzbekistan, was remembered by his aunt as kind and smart; Cook, from Birmingham, Alabama, had been the vice president of Brown\u2019s college Republicans group and was described by her church as an \u201cincredible, grounded, faithful, bright light.\u201d",
      "Loureiro had been a world-renowned plasma physicist and fusion scientist who joined MIT in 2016. In a video posted to YouTube earlier this year, Loureiro spoke about his work and offered advice to students in his field.",
      "\u201cI think on any given day, it\u2019s tempting to go for the low-hanging fruit,\u201d he said. \u201cBe a little more ambitious and tackle the really hard problems.\u201d"

      "\"I don\u2019t rule it out, no,\" he told NBC News in a phone interview.",
      "Trump on Tuesday ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers coming and going from Venezuela, increasing pressure on the country's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The U.S. recently seized an oil tanker captured near Venezuela, as well.",
      "The administration\u2019s campaign has already resulted in 28 boat strikes that have killed more than 100 people, including a \u201cdouble tap\u201d strike facing congressional scrutiny.",
      "In his phone interview, Trump said \"I don't discuss it\" when he is asked whether he rules out the possibility that such actions could lead to war.",
      "But when he was pressed, he confirmed it was a possibility and said there will be additional seizures of oil tankers. Asked for a timeline, Trump replied: \"It depends. If they\u2019re foolish enough to be sailing along, they\u2019ll be sailing along back into one of our harbors.\"",
      "Trump also declined to say whether ousting Maduro was his ultimate goal.",
      "\"He knows exactly what I want,\" Trump replied. \"He knows better than anybody.\"",
      "Trump's admission that he's not ruling out a war with Venezuela is significant. He has long tried to distinguish himself from the hawkish wing of the Republican Party, and in 2024, he campaigned on being able to keep the U.S. out of foreign conflicts.",
      "In his speech after he won the election, Trump said he was \"not going to start a war; I\u2019m going to stop wars.\"",

      "\"We're making so much money with tariffs that we are able to do that and have plenty left over,\" he said.",
      "A senior administration official said the one-time bonus for troops will cost about $2.6 billion and be paid drawing from military housing funds from the One Big Beautiful Bill. The legislation, which Trump signed in July, allocated $2.9 billion to reduce the out-of-pocket cost for service members for two years.",
      "A Senate appropriations source also said that the money will come from there, not tariffs, and that the Defense Department decided instead to give the money as a one-time payment instead of creating a precedent for housing costs down the line.",
      "Trump also touched on health care in his remarks Wednesday night, blasting \"gigantic health insurance companies that have gotten rich on billions of dollars of money that should go directly to the people.\"",
      "He said people should be able to \"buy their own health insurance, which will give far better benefits at much lower cost. It will be far better health insurance.\"",
      "Millions of people who get coverage through the Affordable Care Act are set to see their health insurance premiums skyrocket next year, after House Republicans refused to call a vote this week to extend the subsidies.",
      "Trump said he doesn't believe it's necessary to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.",
      "\"I don\u2019t have to do anything, because Obamacare would just repeal itself automatically because nobody\u2019s going to want to use it. Too expensive,\" he told NBC News.",
      "He also said he has no plans to announce a broader health care plan.",
      "\"As far as I\u2019m concerned, I rolled it out last night,\" he said. \"It\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s a very simple plan. The insurance companies have become totally rich and beyond any comprehension. They get billions and billions of dollars a year, and we\u2019re not going to let that happen.",

They can use \u2014 you know, there are many ways of doing it, but we\u2019re going to let them buy their own health care. They\u2019ll get much better health care at a much lower price.\"",
      "A central focus for both parties next year will be November's midterm elections, with the Republicans cognizant that losing control of either chamber of Congress could lead to investigations and headaches for the White House.",

That brings the country\u2019s total stolen crypto to around $6.75 billion, the report said. The total amount of stolen crypto around the globe rose to $3.4 billion.",

      "Part of the theft is most likely due to the increasingly common phenomenon of North Korean hackers\u2019 fraudulently obtaining remote technical jobs with international companies, the report said. That access can put them in positions to give their hacker colleagues a foothold to steal cryptocurrency keys and wire crypto to Pyongyang.",
      "There are scattered incidents of other countries\u2019 professional hackers\u2019 stealing large amounts of money.

The Trump administration has hailed the strikes as curbing the flow of drugs, including fentanyl \u2014 which is the leading cause of overdose deaths in the U.S. The synthetic opioid is often made with chemicals from China and trafficked through Mexico.",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order this week designating fentanyl and its core precursor chemical as weapons of mass destruction.",
      "The strikes also come at a time of tension between the U.S. and Venezuela. Trump announced a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers on Venezuela on Tuesday and said on Truth Social that Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is using oil revenue to finance illicit operations, including \u201cdrug terrorism.\u201d"

      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "After meetings with Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff, son-in-law Jared Kushner and European leaders in Berlin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters Monday that Kyiv had now been offered an equivalent of NATO\u2019s Article 5 deterrence mechanism, under which an attack on one member is considered an attack on them all.",
      "This guarantee would be legally binding, he said, voted on and approved by the U.S. Congress.",
      "Zelenskyy said the latest draft was not \"perfect\" but was \"very workable.\" He abandoned Ukraine's long-held ambition of joining NATO over the weekend, ahead of the talks.",
      "These guarantees are \"the biggest win so far for Ukraine and for Europe,\" a U.S. official told reporters, warning that they \u201cwill not be on the table forever.\u201d The official added that they believe Russia will accept it in a final deal.",
      "Zelenskyy has maintained that any deal would need to provide concrete security guarantees to prevent future attacks by Russia. It\u2019s a historically sensitive issue for Kyiv since Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 in violation of the Budapest Memorandum, meant to guarantee Ukraine's post-Soviet sovereignty in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons.",
      "European leaders suggested their countries could lead a \u201cmultinational force\u201d supported by the U.S. that would \u201cassist in the regeneration of Ukraine\u2019s forces, in securing Ukraine\u2019s skies, and in supporting safer seas,\u201d alongside a U.S.-led ceasefire monitoring, verification and deconfliction mechanism.",
      "All of this was discussed on a call with Trump, Zelenskyy said, and the American leader appeared happy with the progress.",

      "The multinational force is \u201ca clear red line for Putin,\u201d said John Lough, head of foreign policy at the New Eurasian Strategies Centre, a London/Washington-based think tank focused on Russia. The Kremlin will also reject the idea of a U.S.-led ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism, he said, and will likely ask for restrictions on the kinds of weapons systems available to Kyiv\u2019s forces.",
      "Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told ABC News on Monday that while he thinks Russia and the U.S. might be \u201con the verge\u201d of a deal, the agreement can\u2019t include the presence of foreign troops in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cSo this is likely to go a few more rounds,\u201d Lough said.",
      "And still to be worked out is the future of eastern Ukraine.",
      "Putin insists Russia is winning on the battlefield, giving him no incentive to negotiate what he thinks he can achieve by force.",
      "He wants Ukraine to give up its entire Donbas region, even though Kyiv's forces still control a part of it and it is something Zelenskyy has said he will never do.",
      "\u201cThe Americans are trying to find a compromise,\u201d Zelenskyy said Monday. \u201cThey are proposing a \u2018free economic zone\u2019 (in the Donbas). And I want to stress once again: a \u2018free economic zone\u2019 does not mean under the control of the Russian Federation.\u201d",
      "Trump has insisted that Ukraine would have to cede territory, but it's unclear how this compromise would work or whether the Kremlin would give it the time of day.",
      "A U.S. official said they had given Zelenskyy some \"thought-provoking ideas,\" and that they would speak with Russia and Europe about them after his response. Zelenskyy said the U.S. would take the new draft to Russia in the coming days.",
      "Asked if any of the security guarantees floated Monday were unacceptable to the Kremlin, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had yet to see any updated agreements. He reiterated that Russia wants a comprehensive peace deal, not a short-term ceasefire over Christmas as Kyiv has suggested.",
      "\u201cWe want peace. We don\u2019t want a truce to give Ukraine a breathing space and prepare for a continuation of the war,\u201d Peskov told reporters.",
      "But while the Kremlin is likely to stonewall the newest agreements, Tuck said, the proposed security guarantees put pressure on Russia by implying a growing consensus between Ukraine and the West on what a peace agreement should look like.",
      "\u201cThe agreement isn\u2019t nothing, we aren\u2019t back to square one: the statement does indicate a more united front by the West, and getting the U.S. to commit, even in general and early terms, to providing some form of security guarantees is a significant development,\u201d Tuck said."
