      "The world\u2019s largest live music event has reached its glitter-drenched conclusion with the grand final of the Eurovision Song Contest",
      "BASEL, Switerland -- The world\u2019s largest live music event has reached its glitter-drenched conclusion with the grand final on Saturday of the Eurovision Song Contest, a celebration of music and unity ruffled by discord over Israel\u2019s participation.",
      "A trio singing for Sweden about the joys of saunas and a classically trained Austrian countertenor are among those tipped to take the microphone-shaped Eurovision trophy at the contest in Basel, Switzerland.",
      "But at the ever-unpredictable event, the prize could just as easily go to powerful singers from France, the Netherlands or Finland \u2014 or even an Estonian who sings about Italian coffee. The final kicks off at 9 p.m. local time.",
      "Bookmakers say the favorite is KAJ, representing Sweden with their ode to sauna culture \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d followed by Austrian singer JJ\u2019s pop-opera song \u201cWasted Love.\u201d",
      "French chanteuse Louane has risen up the odds with \u201cmaman,\u201d as has Dutch singer Claude with soulful ballad \u201cC\u2019est La Vie\u201d and Finland\u2019s Erika Vikman with the innuendo-laden \u201cIch Komme.\u201d Estonia\u2019s Tommy Cash is also a contender with his highly caffeinated dance-pop song \u201cEspresso Macchiato.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael has won many fans with her anthemic \u201cNew Day Will Rise,\u201d but also faced protests from pro-Palestinian demonstrators calling for Israel to be kicked out of the contest over its conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza.",
      "Acts from 26 countries \u2014 trimmed from 37 entrants through two elimination semifinals \u2014 will perform to some 160 million viewers for the continent\u2019s pop crown. No smoke machine, jet of flame or dizzying light display has been spared by musicians who are given 3 minutes to make their mark.",
      "Dean Vuletic, an expert on the history of Eurovision, said the competition has become more diverse over the years, both musically and linguistically. There are songs in 20 languages this year, including Ukrainian, Icelandic, Albanian, Latvian and Maltese.",
      "\u201cIn the past it was about having a catchy, innocuous pop song, usually in English,\u201d he said. But in the past decade \u201cwe\u2019ve seen songs become much more socially and politically engaged, songs that present the audience with some sort of meaning.\"",
      "\u201cIn recent years the formulaic approach to a Eurovision entry hasn\u2019t succeeded,\" he added. \"An entry needs to be memorable and it needs to be authentic in order to succeed these days.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s contest has been roiled for a second year by disputes over Israel\u2019s participation. Dozens of former participants, including last year\u2019s winner Nemo of Switzerland, have called for Israel to be excluded.",
      "Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests have both taken place in Basel, though on a much smaller scale than at last year\u2019s event in Sweden, where tensions spilled over backstage and Dutch competitor Joost Klein was expelled over an alleged altercation with a crew member.",
      "The European Broadcasting Union or EBU, which runs Eurovision, subsequently tightened the contest\u2019s code of conduct, calling on participants to respect Eurovision\u2019s values of \u201cuniversality, diversity, equality and inclusivity\u201d and its political neutrality.",
      "Performers say the backstage vibe this year is more relaxed.",
      "After a controversial ban in 2024 on flags, apart from national ones, being waved in the arena, this year audience members can bring Palestinian flags or any others, as long as they are legal under Swiss law. Performers, though, can only wave their own country\u2019s flag.",
      "Axel \u00c5hman, one third of favorites KAJ, acknowledged that it\u2019s tough to keep Eurovision an unpolitical event.",
      "\u201cThe world always seeps in in some sense,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cBut we\u2019re here to represent Sweden and we have prepared for this for all our lives and want to make the best of our moment as artists in this huge and legendary competition.",
      "\"So our main focus is there, and the politics (we) try to leave that to the EBU and those actually making the decisions.\u201d",

      "Movies are a regular presence in author Kazuo Ishiguro's life in part because filmmakers keep wanting to turn his books into them",
      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Kazuo Ishiguro 's mother was in Nagasaki when the atomic bomb was dropped.",
      "When Ishiguro, the Nobel laureate and author of \u201cRemains of the Day\u201d and \u201cNever Let Me Go,\u201d first undertook fiction writing in his 20s, his first novel, 1982's \u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d was inspired by his mother's stories, and his own distance from them. Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki but, when he was 5, moved to England with his family.",
      "\u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d marked the start to what's become one of the most lauded writing careers in contemporary literature. And, now, like most of Ishiguro's other novels, it's a movie, too.",
      "Kei Ishikawa's film by the same name premiered Thursday at the Cannes Film Festival in its Un Certain Regard section. The 70-year-old author has been here before; he was a member of the jury in 1994 that gave \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d the Palme d'Or. \u201cAt the time it was a surprise decision,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people booed.\u201d",
      "Ishiguro is a movie watcher and sometimes maker, too. He penned the 2022 Akira Kurosawa adaptation \u201cLiving.\u201d Movies are a regular presence in his life, in part because filmmakers keep wanting to turn his books into them. Taika Waititi is currently finishing a film of Ishiguro's most recent novel, \u201cKlara and the Sun\u201d (2021).",
      "Ishiguro likes to participate in early development of an adaptation, and then disappear, letting the filmmaker take over. Seeing \u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d turned into an elegant, thoughtful drama is especially meaningful to him because the book, itself, deals with inheritance, and because it represents his beginning as a writer.",
      "\u201cThere was no sense that anyone else was going to reread this thing,\u201d he says. \u201cSo in that sense, it\u2019s different to, say, the movie of \u2018Remains of the Day\u2019 or the movie of \u2018Never Let Me Go.\u2019\u201d",
      "Remarks have been lightly edited.",
      "ISHIGURO: Often people think I\u2019m being unduly modest when I say I want the film to be different to the book. I don\u2019t want it to be wildly different. But in order for the film to live, there has to be a reason why it\u2019s being made then, for the audience at that moment. Not 25 years ago, or 45 years ago, as in the case of this book. It has to be a personal artistic expression of something, not just a reproduction. Otherwise, it can end up like a tribute or an Elvis impersonation.",
      "Whenever I see adaptations of books not work, it\u2019s always because it\u2019s been too reverential. Sometimes it\u2019s laziness. People think: Everything is there in the book. The imagination isn\u2019t pushed to work. For every one of these things that\u2019s made it to the screen, there\u2019s been 10, 15 developments that I\u2019ve been personally involved with that fell by the wayside. I always try to get people to just move it on.",
      "ISHIGURO: You can take two kind of approaches. You write a novel and that\u2019s the discrete, perfect thing. Other people can pay homage to it but basically that\u2019s it. Or you can take another view that stories are things that just get passed around, down generations. Even though you think you wrote an original story, you\u2019ve put it together out of other stuff that\u2019s come before you. So it\u2019s part of that tradition.",
      "I said Homer but it could be folktales. The great stories are the ones that last and last and last. They turn up in different forms. It\u2019s because people can change and adapt them to their times and their culture that these stories are valuable. There was a time when people would sit around a fire and just tell each other these stories. You sit down with some anticipation: This guy is going to tell it in a slightly different way. What\u2019s he going to do? It\u2019s like if Keith Jarrett sits down and says he\u2019s going to play \u201cNight and Day.\u201d So when you go from book to film, that\u2019s a fireside moment. That way it has a chance of lasting, and I have a chance of turning into Homer.",
      "ISHIGURO: I\u2019ve got a few centuries to go.",
      "ISHIGURO: I was between the age of 24 and 26. It was published when I was 27. I remember the circumstances very vividly. I can even remember writing a lot of those scenes. My wife, Lorna, was my girlfriend back then. We were both postgraduate students. I wrote it on a table about this size, which was also where we would have our meals. When she came in at the end of the day, I had to pack up even if I was at the crucial point of some scene. It was no big deal. I was just doing something indulgent. There was no real sense I had a career or it would get published. So it\u2019s strange all these years later that she and I are here and attended this premiere in Cannes.",
      "ISHIGURO: I think that\u2019s really insightful what you just said. There is a limit to how much understanding there can be between generations. What\u2019s needed is a certain amount of generosity on both sides, to respect each other\u2019s generations and the difference in values. I think an understanding that the world was a really complicated place, and that often individuals can\u2019t hope to have perspective on the forces that are playing on them at the time. To actually understand that needs a generosity.",
      "ISHIGURO: I wasn\u2019t like a journalist trying to get stuff out of my mother. There's part of me that was quite reluctant to hear this stuff. On some level it was kind of embarrassing to think of my mother in such extreme circumstances. A lot of the things she told me weren\u2019t to do with the atomic bomb. Those weren\u2019t her most traumatic memories.",
      "My mother was a great oral storyteller. She would sometimes have a lunch date and do a whole version of a Shakespeare play by herself. That was my introduction to \u201cHamlet\u201d or things like that. She was keen to tell me but also wary of telling me. It was always a fraught thing. Having something formal \u2014 \u201cOh, I\u2019m becoming a writer, I\u2019m going to write up something so these memories can be preserved\u201d \u2014 that made it easier.",
      "ISHIGURO: Someone said to me the other day, \u201cWe live in a time now where a lot of people would sympathize with the older, what you might call fascist views.\u201d It\u2019s not expressed overtly; the older teacher is saying it's tradition and patriotism.",
      "Now, maybe we live in a world where that\u2019s a good point, and that hadn\u2019t occurred to me. It\u2019s an example of: Yes, we write in a bubble and make movies in a kind of a bubble. But the power of stories is they have to go into different values.",
      "This question of how you pass stories on, this is one of the big challenges. You have to reexamine every scene. Some things that might have been a very safe assumption only a few years ago would not be because the value systems are changing around our books and films just as much as they\u2019re changing around us.",

      "CANNES, France -- You can get nostalgic about almost anything at the Cannes Film Festival, even Jerry Seinfeld on a zip line in a bumblebee costume.",
      "For many years, Cannes has played host not just to an endless stream of artistically ambitious movies, but also to some of Hollywood's most extreme promotional gambits. With so many films packed into the 12-day festival, and with much of the world watching, there are high stakes to standing out in Cannes.",
      "But in recent years, the Cannes marketing stunt has turned into an endangered species. Hopes that Tom Cruise might revive a dormant tradition passed with the relatively sedate premiere Wednesday of \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Final Reckoning.\u201d",
      "Would Cruise parachute into the Palais? Could he ride an airplane wing to the premiere? Nothing so elaborate came to pass. Cruise and company walked the red carpet while serenaded by an orchestra playing the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d theme.",
      "Along the Croisette this year, there's a noticeable lack of the kind of grand advertisements Hollywood has often trotted out for the festival. Paramount Pictures has a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d installation outside the Carlton Hotel, but \u2014 as has been true for several years \u2014 Hollywood rarely still seeks to make big marketing splashes in Cannes.",
      "Even though Universal Pictures' upcoming Formula One action drama \u201cF1\u201d might seem like a natural fit, with the Monaco Grand Prix just days away, \u201cF1\u201d \u2014 at least so far \u2014 has made no pit stop in Cannes.",
      "Things could change. Cannes runs until May 24. Someone might yet arrive by parasail over the Mediterranean, as T.J. Miller did in 2017 for \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d or do ninja kicks with a troupe of giant pandas, as Jack Black did in 2008 for \u201cKung Fu Panda.\u201d",
      "But for years, the circus-like quality of Cannes has been in decline. That's owed partly to budgetary constraints and shifting marketing priorities for major studios. For Cruise and \u201cFinal Reckoning,\u201d Cannes was just one stop on a worldwide tour.",
      "Plus, some of those who were most devoted to bringing Hollywood entertainment to Cannes are no longer regulars here. While head of DreamWorks Animation, Jeffrey Katzenberg made sure his films left a mark in Cannes, whether with models wearing \u201cTrolls\u201d wigs or Seinfeld's \u201cBee Movie\u201d zip line.",
      "Is the absence of such things anything to lament? Probably not, but they did add to the crazy-things-will-happen nature of Cannes, giving the festival the feel of big tent extravaganza. It could be counted as one small, superficial way that movies aren't quite the carnivalesque show they once were.",
      "For now, though, we can say we'll always have when Sacha Baron Cohen, for \u201cThe Dictator,\u201d rode a camel down the Croisette. Ah, the memories.",

      "PARIS -- For powerful men in France\u2019s film industry, this was a week of reckoning.",
      "G\u00e9rard Depardieu \u2014 the country\u2019s most famous actor \u2014 was convicted of sexual assault. Two days later, the Cannes Film Festival barred another actor accused of rape from walking the red carpet.",
      "Together, the decisions sent a message France had long resisted: that artistic brilliance may no longer shield those who abuse their power.",
      "For decades, Depardieu was revered as French cinema\u2019s \u201csacred monster\u201d \u2014 a towering talent whose gluttony, volatility, and magnetism became part of his myth. With more than 250 films to his name, many believed he would remain untouchable even after more than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.",
      "Now, that myth has cracked. The verdict has revived a broader question France has ducked since the dawn of #MeToo: Can a country that celebrates seduction and irreverence finally hold its male icons to account?",
      "France has long lived its own #MeToo contradiction with a long-held belief in \u201cl\u2019exception culturelle.\u201d That talent, charm, or intellect forgives misconduct and the art excuses the artist. Catherine Deneuve has defended \u201cthe freedom to bother,\" while Brigitte Bardot has dismissed feminism outright: \u201cFeminism isn\u2019t my thing. I like men.\u201d",
      "But the ground is shifting \u2014 fast.",
      "Depardieu was handed an 18-month suspended sentence Tuesday for groping two women on a 2021 film set. He denies the charges and is appealing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the end of impunity of artists with a capital A,\u201d Carine Durrieu Diebolt, a lawyer for one of the two women who won their case against Depardieu, told The Associated Press. The verdict represented \u201ca bookend for putting actors on a pedestal because they were talented,\u201d she added.",
      "Two days later, the prestigious Cannes Film Festival barred actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy \u2014 accused of rape by three former partners \u2014 from attending the premiere of a film he stars in. Though the file was dropped for lack of evidence, the women are relaunching their case as a civil complaint.",
      "Navarro-Mussy denies wrongdoing. His lawyer said she\u2019s unaware of any ongoing proceedings against him.",
      "What stunned wasn\u2019t just the decision, but who made it. Cannes director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux had long been seen as emblematic of the old guard. He defended Roman Polanski for years and continued to screen his films despite the director\u2019s 1977 guilty plea in the U.S. for sex with a 13-year-old. In 2018, when asked why Cannes still included Polanski, Fr\u00e9maux said: \u201cThese are complicated matters.\u201d",
      "Fr\u00e9maux opened 2023's festival with a film starring Johnny Depp, despite the actor\u2019s highly public legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard over allegations of domestic abuse, in which he was never criminally charged. When asked about the backlash, Fr\u00e9maux replied: \u201cI only have one rule: it\u2019s the freedom of thinking, and the freedom of speech and acting within a legal framework.\u201d",
      "This week, the rules changed.",
      "\u201cThe Cannes decision is of course linked to the Depardieu verdict,\u201d said C\u00e9line Piques of Osez le f\u00e9minisme (\u201cDare Feminism!\u201d), a group that campaigns against sexual violence. \u201c(They\u2019ve) realized which way the wind is blowing. Fr\u00e9maux is trying to right the wrongs.\u201d",
      "Not everyone welcomed the verdict \u2014 or what followed \u2014 as a cultural turning point.",
      "Fanny Ardant, one of French cinema\u2019s grandes dames and a longtime friend of Depardieu, sat on his side in court. She is now directing him in a film in Portugal, despite the conviction.",
      "\u201cFanny Ardant? She completely missed the point,\u201d said Piques. \u201cShe downplayed the violence, normalized it. That\u2019s rape culture, plain and simple.\u201d",
      "Juliette Binoche, Cannes jury president and one of France\u2019s most respected actresses, struck a note of restraint: \u201cHe\u2019s not a monster. He\u2019s a man \u2014 one who has, apparently, been desacralized.\u201d",
      "In 2024, more than 22,000 rapes were reported in France. Fewer than 3% led to convictions. \u201cThe Depardieu verdict shows there\u2019s progress,\u201d said lawyer Anne-Sophie Laguens, who works with victims of sexual assault. \u201cBut for most women, the barriers to justice remain enormous.\u201d",
      "When Bertrand Cantat \u2014 frontman of Noir D\u00e9sir and once one of France\u2019s bestselling rock singers \u2014 launched a 2018 comeback tour, he had served just four years in prison for killing his partner, actress Marie Trintignant, during a violent assault.",
      "Despite public outrage, he returned to the stage and performed.",
      "\u201cThat would be unthinkable today,\u201d said Piques. \u201cThe public mood has changed. What we tolerate has changed.\u201d",
      "One breakthrough came not in cinema, but in a Bordeaux courtroom. The conviction of 51 men for drugging and raping Gisele Pelicot \u2014 a case long ignored despite her pleas \u2014 marked a turning point. For years, shame was hers. Now, it belongs to the perpetrators.",
      "\u201cIt proved rapists aren\u2019t just strangers in alleys,\u201d said Piques. \u201cThey\u2019re husbands. Colleagues. Respected men.\u201d",
      "Other recent convictions in entertainment included director Christophe Ruggia, who was convicted of abusing actress Ad\u00e8le Haenel when she was a minor, though he is appealing; and actor-director Nicolas Bedos, who was sentenced for sexual assault.",
      "Slowly but surely, yes. The system that long protected men like Depardieu is not yet dismantled, but it is shifting.",
      "As one of the actor\u2019s accusers said through tears after the ruling: \u201cI\u2019m very, very much satisfied with the decision. That\u2019s a victory for me, really. And a big progress, a step forward. I feel justice was made.\u201d",

      "Musical acts from 26 countries will take the stage at the St. Jakobshalle arena on Saturday in a spectacular, sequin-drenched competition that has been uniting and dividing Europeans since 1956.",
      "Here\u2019s everything to know:",
      "Eurovision is competition in which performers from countries across Europe, and a few beyond it, compete under their national flags with the aim of being crowned continental champion. Think of it as the Olympics of pop music or the World Cup with singing instead of soccer.",
      "It\u2019s a celebration of silly fun and music\u2019s unifying power, but also a place where politics and regional rivalries play out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s biggest cultural event,\u201d said Dean Vuletic, an expert on the history of Eurovision. \u201cIt has been going on for almost 70 years and people love to watch it, not only for the show, for the glitter, the stage effects, the crazy costumes, but also because they like to see it as a reflection of the zeitgeist in Europe.\u201d",
      "Of 37 countries that sent performers to Eurovision, 11 were knocked out by public voting in semifinals on Tuesday and Thursday.

Dutch singer Claude is also highly rated with soulful ballad \u201cC\u2019est La Vie.\u201d Other favorites include classically trained Austrian countertenor JJ with his pop-opera song \u201cWasted Love,\u201d and Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, with her anthemic \u201cNew Day Will Rise.\u201d",
      "Eurovision has a reputation for campy europop with nonsense lyrics \u2014 past winners include \u201cLa, La, La\u201d and \u201cBoom Bang-a-Bang.\u201d But It has also produced some enduring pop classics. And it helped make stars of performers including ABBA \u2014 winners in 1974 with \u201cWaterloo\u201d \u2014 Celine Dion, Austrian drag performer Conchita Wurst and Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin.",
      "This year\u2019s finalists range from Lithuanian emo rockers Katarsis to a power ballad Spanish diva Melody and Ukrainian prog rockers Ziferblat.",
      "Campiness, humor and double entendres abound. \u201cEspresso Macchiato\u201d is a comic ode to Italian stereotypes performed by Estonia\u2019s Tommy Cash. Miriana Conte sings for Malta with the double entendre-filled \u201cServing\u201d -- performed on a set including a glitter ball and giant lips, it is classic Eurovision.",
      "It was once widely accepted that the most successful Eurovision songs were in English, but that is changing. This year\u2019s contest features songs in a record 20 languages, including Ukrainian, Icelandic, Latvian, Maltese and Armenian.",
      "Vuletic said viewers these days want \u201cmore authenticity in Eurovision entries.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t just want a standard pop song sung in English,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to also see something about the culture of the country that the song represents.\u201d",
      "Once all the acts have performed in the final, the winner is chosen by a famously complex mix of phone and online voters from around the world and rankings by music-industry juries in each of the Eurovision countries. As the results are announced, countries slide up and down the rankings and tensions build.",
      "Ending up with \u201cnul points,\u201d or zero, is considered a national humiliation.",
      "The final starts Saturday at 1900 GMT (3 p.m. EDT) and will be aired by national broadcasters in participating nations, on streaming service Peacock in the United States and in many countries on the Eurovision YouTube channel.",
      "During and immediately after the final, viewers in participating countries can vote by phone, text message or the Eurovision app \u2014 but not for their own country. Viewers in the U.S. and other nonparticipating countries can vote all day Saturday, online at www.esc.vote or with the app. The combined \u201crest of the world\u201d vote is given the weight of one individual country.",
      "The contest\u2019s motto is \u201cunited by music,\u201d but the world\u2019s divisions inevitably intrude.",
      "Russia was banned from Eurovision after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and since then Ukrainian musicians \u2014 including 2022 winner Kalush Orchestra \u2014 have competed under the shadow of war in the home country.",
      "This year\u2019s contest has been roiled for a second year by disputes over Israel\u2019s participation. Dozens of former participants, including Nemo, have called for Israel to be excluded over its conduct in the war against Hamas in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests have both taken place in Basel, though on a much smaller scale than at last year\u2019s event in Sweden.",
      "A handful of protesters attempted to disrupt a rehearsal by Israeli singer Raphael on Thursday with oversized flags and whistles and were escorted from the arena. Organizers say they have tightened security ahead of the final.",

      "The New Jersey man convicted of stabbing author Salman Rushdie on a New York lecture stage in 2022 is scheduled to be sentenced",
      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- The man convicted of stabbing Salman Rushdie on a New York lecture stage in 2022, leaving the prizewinning author blind in one eye, is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday.",
      "A jury found Hadi Matar, 27, guilty of attempted murder and assault in February.",
      "Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said he will request the maximum 25 years in prison for the Aug. 12, 2022, attack on Rushdie and seven years for injuring a second man who was on stage with the author. The sentences must run concurrently because both victims were injured in the same event, he said.",
      "Rushdie is not expected to return to court for his assailant's sentencing, the prosecutor said. During the trial, the 77-year-old author was the key witness, describing how he believed he was dying when a masked attacker plunged a knife into his head and body more than a dozen times as he was being introduced at the Chautauqua Institution to speak about writer safety.",
      "Rushdie spent 17 days at a Pennsylvania hospital and more than three weeks at a New York City rehabilitation center. The author of \u201cMidnight's Children,\u201d \u201cThe Moor\u2019s Last Sigh\" and \u201cVictory City\u201d detailed his recovery in his 2024 memoir, \u201cKnife.\u201d",
      "Matar next faces a federal trial on terrorism-related charges. While the first trial focused mostly on the details of the knife attack itself, the next one is expected to delve into the more complicated issue of motive.",
      "Authorities said Matar, a U.S. citizen, was attempting to carry out a decades-old fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death when he traveled from his home in Fairview, New Jersey, to target Rushdie at the summer retreat about 70 miles (112.6 kilometers) southwest of Buffalo.",
      "Matar believed the fatwa, first issued in 1989, was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa after publication of Rushdie's novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. Rushdie spent years in hiding, but after Iran announced it would not enforce the decree he traveled freely over the past quarter century.",
      "Matar pleaded not guilty to a three-count indictment charging him with providing material to terrorists, attempting to provide material support to Hezbollah and engaging in terrorism transcending national boundaries.",
      "Video of the assault, captured by the venue's cameras and played at trial, show Matar approaching the seated Rushdie from behind and reaching around him to stab at his torso with a knife. As the audience gasps and screams, Rushdie is seen raising his arms and rising from his seat, walking and stumbling for a few steps with Matar hanging on, swinging and stabbing until they both fall and are surrounded by onlookers who rush in to separate them.",
      "Jurors in Matar's first trial delivered their verdict after less than two hours of deliberation.",

      "The Weeknd's first feature film is a surrealist vanity project, writes Associated Press Music Writer Maria Sherman",
      "NEW YORK -- It's the final night of tour. SoFi Stadium, just outside Los Angeles, is packed. 80,000 fans stand before The Weeknd, an endless sea of blinding lights. The bestselling artist born Abel Tesfaye emerges onstage. He launches into the first song. Less than a minute goes by, and the unthinkable happens: His voice cracks. And then it is gone.",
      "That September night in 2022 marked a turning point for Tesfaye. He mines the scene in \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow, \u201d where, ironically, it arrives too late. The tedium of an incoherent first act paints the charismatic performer \u2014 one of the last few decades' most popular \u2014 as an unempathetic protagonist in a nonlinear and nonsensical world.",
      "But how much of The Weeknd is here, really? In his first leading role in a feature film, directed by Trey Edward Shults, Tesfaye plays a fictionalized version of himself, an insomniac musician (as made explicitly clear in the \u201cWake Me Up\u201d leitmotif, where he sings, \u201cSun is never rising / I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s day or night\u201d). He's marred by a recent breakup from an ex portrayed in a cruel voicemail message (\u201cI used to think you were a good person,\u201d she says) and a hedonistic lifestyle, instigated by his superficial friend-manager Lee, played Barry Keoghan.",
      "Shortly after Tesfaye loses his voice, a psychosomatic ailment, he meets superfan Amina, portrayed by Jenna Ortega. She offers temporary comfort and, in return, is afforded no agency. She exists for him. Soon, the uninspired horrors begin, culminating in what recalls the torture scene in \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d with less violence. Instead, Amina \u2014 when she is not weeping; I urge all viewers to keep a \u201ccry count\u201d and consider what feminist blogs might have to say \u2014 lip-syncs some of The Weeknd's biggest hits back to him, explaining that they're all about \u201cemptiness and heartbreak.\u201d Woven throughout is some conversation about absent fathers and fear of abandonment, with unearned delivery and first-draft acuity \u2014 something gesturing at depth without piercing the surface.",
      "According to press materials, Amina and Lee are not real people but representations of Tesfaye. She is meant to represent Tesfaye's disconnected, \u201cdeeper emotional self\u201d \u2014 and Lee, his public persona. That is not made explicitly clear in the film, except in a very generous reading of the ending. Subtext only works when there is context to back it up, otherwise, you are left with \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d: an exciting vanity project with surrealist imagination but stiff writing, no stakes, limited emotional weight and an unclear narrative.",
      "That won't be an issue for superfans, of course \u2014 those intimately familiar with The Weeknd's music and career. This film appears to be for them and Tesfaye, a producer, alone; they have the framework in which to enjoy the runtime. Considering that fandom is the dominant form of popular culture, it's not a bad business decision.",
      "And it's worked for him before. This is not Tesfaye\u2019s first foray into acting. Aside from his cameo in \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d he starred in HBO\u2019s 2023 series \u201cThe Idol. \u201d He co-created the show with Sam Levinson, a show that similarly presented unearned provocation. At the time, \u201cThe Idol\u201d received criticism for its sadomasochistic storytelling that emerged after a shift away from \u201cthe female perspective,\u201d allegedly a request from Tesfaye. It was not a clever or subversive show, nor was it really even about anything, but it did inspire conversation. It's easy to see how \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d may have similar effects.",
      "In a moment where autobiographical films about musicians are playful and creative \u2014 Pharrell Williams' Lego partnership \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d comes to mind, as does Robbie Williams' \u201c Better Man \u201d \u2014 \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d feels like a misstep for those outside The Weeknd's most devoted. Of course, the film does not identify as a biopic. But it could've benefited from less self-seriousness. And editing.",
      "But what about the music? \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d is connected to Tesfaye's latest album of the same name \u2014 and the final chapter in The Weeknd\u2019s record-breaking trilogy that began with 2020\u2019s \u201cAfter Hours\u201d and continued with 2022\u2019s \u201cDawn FM.\u201d The album, the quietest of the series, worked as an allegory on the trials of fame \u2014 a topic long covered by the most successful purveyors of pop. Retrospectively, it works best as a film's soundtrack than a stand-alone record, ambitious. Like the movie, it gestures at criticism of the celebrity-industrial complex without accomplishing it. It seems obvious, now, to learn that the movie predates the record.",
      "The film's strength far and away is its score, composed by Tesfaye with Daniel Lopatin (better known as the experimental electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never and for his \u201cGood Time\u201d and \u201cUncut Gems\u201d scores). It builds from Tesfaye's discography and morphs into something physical and psychedelic \u2014 at its most elated, dread-filled and clubby. It is so affecting, it almost distracts from moments of dizzying cinematography, with the films' penchant for spinning frames, zooms into upside skylines, blurred vision and erratic lights.",
      "Those tools feel better suited for a music video, the kind of sophisticated visual world Tesfaye has developed in his pop career. They elevate his euphoric, layered, evocative dance-pop, but they do not translate in this film.",
      "\u201cHurry Up Tomorrow,\u201d a Lionsgate release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language throughout, drug use, some bloody violence and brief nudity. Running time: 105 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "Strouse died at his home in New York City, his family said through the publicity agency The Press Room.",
      "In a career that spanned more than 50 years, Strouse wrote more than a dozen Broadway musicals, as well as film scores and the song \"Those Were the Days,\" the theme song for the sitcom \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Strouse turned out such popular \u2014 and catchy \u2014 show tunes as \"Tomorrow,\" the optimistic anthem from \"Annie,\" and the equally cheerful \"Put on a Happy Face\" from \"Bye Bye Birdie,\" his first Broadway success.",

      "Bono has a seaside villa that\u2019s a short trip away from Cannes",
      "CANNES, France -- Cannes is a short trip from Bono\u2019s seaside villa in Eze-sur-Mer. He bought it with The Edge in 1993, and considers himself grateful to a coastline that, he says, gave him a \u201cdelayed adolescence.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can tell you I\u2019ve slept on beaches close to here,\u201d Bono says with a grin. \u201cI\u2019ve woken up in the sun.\u201d",
      "But that doesn't mean the Cannes Film Festival is a particularly familiar experience for the U2 frontman. He\u2019s here to premiere the Apple TV+ documentary \u201cBono: Stories of Surrender,\u201d which captures his one-man stage show. Before coming, Bono\u2019s daughter, the actor Eve Hewson, gave him some advice.",
      "\u201cShe said: \u2018Just get over yourself and bring it,\u2019\" Bono said in an interview on a hotel off the Croisette. \"What do I have to bring? Bring yourself and your gratitude that you\u2019re a musician and they\u2019re allowing you into a festival that celebrates actors and storytellers of a different kind. I said, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll try to bring it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Besides, Cannes, he notes, was founded amid World War II as an alternative to then-Mussolini controlled Venice Film Festival. It was, he says, \u201cdesigned to find fascists.\u201d",
      "Shifts in geopolitical tectonics was much on Bono's mind. He has spent much of his activist life fighting for aid to Africa and combating HIV-AIDS. U.S. President Donald Trump's dismantling of USAID has reversed much of that.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s irrational is taking pleasure in the defacement of these institutions of mercy,\u201d Bono said.",
      "\u201cBono: Stories of Surrender,\u201d an Andrew Dominik-directed black-and-white film that begins streaming May 30, adapts the one-man stage show that, in turn, came from Bono's 2022 book, \u201cSurrender: 40 Songs, One Story.\u201d",
      "In the film, Bono is self-effacing and reflective, sifting through the formative influence of his father, U2's skyrocketing to fame and considering how ego and social work might be related. He calls it \u201cthe tall tales of a short rock star.\u201d And as was the case on a recent sunny afternoon in Cannes, Bono makes a captivating raconteur.",
      "Remarks have been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "BONO: Well, that\u2019s right. Globalization did very well for the world\u2019s poor. That and increased aid levels brought a billion people out of extreme poverty and halved childhood morality \u2014 remarkable jumps for quality of life for human beings.",
      "But it\u2019s also fair to say certain communities really paid the price for that \u2014 here in Europe, in the United States. And I\u2019m not sure those communities were credited enough for weathering storms that globalization brought. So I understand how we got to this place, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the right place to be in.",
      "Nationalism is not what we need. We grew up in a very charged atmosphere in Ireland. It makes you suspicious of nationalism and those animal spirits that can be drummed up. This is me speaking about surrender, \u201cStories of Surrender,\u201d at a time when the world has never been closer to a world war in my lifetime. At first I think it looks absurd, a bit ridiculous \u2014 now that has never stopped me in the past \u2014 but I think it\u2019s OK to look ridiculous for these ideas. Like surrender, nonviolence, peace.",
      "BONO: The new pope, he does look like a pope. That\u2019s a good start. I just saw the other day his first piece and he was talking about stopping shouting, God might prefer whispers. I thought, \u201cOh, this could be interesting.\u201d I\u2019m more of a shouter myself. I come from punk rock. But I\u2019m learning to turn that shout into a whisper in this film to get to an intimacy.",
      "BONO: Well, the accuracy of the put-down \u2014 \u201cYou are a baritone who thinks he\u2019s a tenor\u201d \u2014 is so all encompassing. I was going to call the play \u201cThe Baritone Who Thinks He\u2019s a Tenor.\u201d He\u2019s on my mind because he\u2019s the reason I sing.",
      "It\u2019s a wound that will never close because after playing him on stage for all those nights \u2014 just by turning left or right \u2014 I always loved him but I started to really like him. He started to make me laugh. There was a gift, as well as the voice, that he left me. Would he forgive me for impersonating him in the Teatro di San Carlo, a sacred place for tenors, probably not. But here I am impersonating an actor, so.",
      "BONO: Mission creep. I knew I had to write the book. The play was so I didn\u2019t have to tour the book in normal promotional activity, that I could actually have fun with it and play all the different characters in my life. I thought it was really good fun. Then I realized: Oh, there\u2019s parts of you that people don\u2019t know about. We don\u2019t go to U2 shows for belly laughs. But that\u2019s a part of who I am, which is the mischief as well as the melancholy.",
      "Then you end up doing a play with a lot of cameras in the way. Enter Andrew Dominik and he taught me something that I didn\u2019t really understand but my daughter does: The camera really knows when you\u2019re lying. So if want to tell this story, you better get ready to take your armor off. You\u2019re going to feel naked in front of the whole school, but that\u2019s what it takes.",
      "BONO: Based on my behavior just in the past week, the answer to that question is probably: Must try harder. The pilgrim\u2019s lack of progress. I would say that I understand a little better where I came from and that where I end up depends on how I deal with that.",
      "I\u2019ve been calling it the hall of mirrors, when you try to figure out who you are and who\u2019s behind the face. Then you just see all these faces staring back at you, and they\u2019re all true. The real star of this movie is my dad. I sort of like him better than I like myself because humor has become so important to me. It\u2019s not like everything needs to be a belly laugh, but there\u2019s a freedom. People like me, we can sing about freedom. It\u2019s much better to be it.",
      "BONO: There\u2019s a minister from Albania who said something that really stuck with me. She said: If you have a chance to hope, it\u2019s a moral duty because most people don\u2019t. So, yes, I feel we\u2019ll figure our way out of this. This is a scary moment.",
      "I think acknowledging that we can lose all we\u2019ve gained is sobering but it may be course-changing. I just believe in people enough. I believe in Americans enough. I\u2019m an Irish person, I can\u2019t tell people how to vote.",
      "I can tell you that a million children dying because their life support systems were pulled out of the wall, with glee, that\u2019s not the America that I recognize or understand. You\u2019re on the front lines of Europe here. America came in and saved the day. Ironically, so did Russia. More people died from Russia fighting the Nazis than everybody else. Now they tread on their own sacred memories by treading on the Ukrainians who also died on the front lines. I think part of that is that history didn\u2019t acknowledge it.",
      "I believe there is integrity in the Russian people. They need to change their leader, in my view. I believe there is integrity in the Americans. They will figure it out. Who was it who said: If you give Americans the facts, they will eventually make the right choice. Right now, they\u2019re not getting the facts. Think of it: a 70% decline in HIV-AIDS, Republican-led, Democratically followed though. The greatest health intervention in the history of medicine to fight HIV-AIDS has been thrown away. It was nearly there. To a space traveler, it\u2019s like getting to Mars and going, \u201cNah, we\u2019ll go back.\u201d It\u2019s bewildering to me.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amber Ruffin looked out upon hundreds of writers, publishers and editors gathered for PEN America's annual gala and shared her experience of being on the receiving end of censorship.",
      "\u201cI'm officially a banned book,\u201d the comic-writer joked, referring to her being dropped as a speaker at April's White House Correspondents Dinner. \u201cThey booked me and then they banned me.\u201d",
      "Thursday night's event at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City was a protest against the suppression of speech and a celebration of being permitted to say what you pleased.",
      "Ruffin presided over a dinner-fundraiser that included a tribute to actor-publisher-bibliophile Sarah Jessica Parker, imprisoned Egyptian poet-songwriter-activist Galal El-Behairy, Wesleyan University President Michael Roth and Macmillan CEO Jon Yaged.",
      "One of the biggest ovations was for a non-speaker, Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who during a White House meeting in February challenged President Donald Trump over her support for transgender athletes, When Trump suspended funds for a Maine child nutrition program, Mills sued in federal court and prevailed.",
      "PEN America, the century-old free speech organization, brought in Ruffin to host soon after the WHCA withdrew its invitation, contending it wanted to focus on the achievements of journalism. Ruffin is a blunt and sometimes profane critic of Trump and duly went after him Thursday, calling him \u201cgross,\" \u201cincompetent,\u201d \u201cracist\u201d and \u201csexually deviant.\u201d She also praised PEN for the chance to speak out.",
      "\u201cThank you to PEN America for asking me to host and more importantly, thank you, PEN America, for Googling me at least once before asking me to host,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking at you, White House Correspondents Association.\u201d",
      "Parker was presented the PEN/Audible Literary Service Award, given in previous years to Patti Smith, Robert Caro and Stephen Sondheim among others.",
      "Parker has been a longtime champion of books and literacy and runs the publishing imprint SJP Lit, where authors include Lucy Caldwell, Linda Grant and Elysha Chang. At the Sundance Film Festival in January, she premiered a documentary film for which she served as executive producer, \u201cThe Librarians,\u201d about the fight against book bans.",
      "\u201cTo censor a book is to limit imagination, curiosity, connection, empathy and inspiration,\u201d Parker said during her acceptance speech. \"Libraries aren't just buildings with shelves. They are a beacon. They are warm in the winter and cool in summer, and they are sanctuaries of possibility. They are a heartbeat of the neighborhood.\"",
      "El-Behairy, who has been imprisoned off and on since 2018 on charges of terrorism and \u201cspreading false news,\u201d won the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award, given to dissidents who have been jailed. The prize was accepted by his sister, Naiera, and father, Abdelfattah, who noted his son \"paid the price for his opposition with the best years of his life wasted in prison.\u201d",
      "Taye Diggs presented the Business Visionary award to Yaged and joked that he liked the Macmillan executive because he didn't publish his children's books just because Diggs was an extremely handsome and successful Black actor.",
      "Wesleyan President Michael S. Roth, a leading critic of Trump\u2019s threats to cancel research funding at Columbia University and other schools, won the PEN/Benenson Courage Award. During a speech that was loudly cheered, he remembered a happy, outspoken and admittedly privileged childhood during which threats to democracy were rarely considered.",
      "\u201cWe are going to have to draw on love and support if we are to resist the slide towards authoritarianism that has gathered momentum across the land,\" Roth said.",
      "PEN is still recovering from a tumultuous 2024. Allegations that leadership was reluctant to criticize Israel's invasion of Gaza and slow to respond to the suffering of Palestinians, including Palestinian writers and journalists, led to so many writers withdrawing from PEN's spring awards ceremony and World Voices festival that both were canceled. PEN CEO Suzanne Nossel departed at the end of the year and a permanent replacement has not yet been announced.",
      "The awards night and World Voices returned this month, although with reminders of the ongoing war in Gaza. Several prize nominees withdrew from competition, including two of the five finalists for the $75,000 Jean Stein Book Award for a work of \u201coriginality, merit, and impact.\u201d The daughters of Stein, the late author, editor and philanthropist, decided the prize money would be donated to the Palestine Children's Relief Fund and to Palestine Legal, a U.S.-based defense organization.",

      "LONDON -- Singer Chris Brown was arrested Thursday in England for allegedly hitting someone with a bottle in a London nightclub in 2023.",
      "The Metropolitan Police did not name Brown but said it took a 36-year-old into custody at a Manchester hotel on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. Under British law, police cannot name suspects before charges are filed.",
      "The Sun, which first reported the story, said producer Abe Diaw told them Sunday that he was hospitalized after Brown beat him in an unprovoked attack at the Tape nightclub in the swanky Mayfair neighborhood in London in February 2023.",
      "The tabloid said it became aware Brown was in the U.K. on Wednesday and called police to find out if he was under arrest. The newspaper said Met officers then traveled to Manchester and made the arrest.",
      "Brown's representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "Diaw said Brown cracked him on the head with a bottle and punched and kicked him on the floor. The producer has filed a 12 million pound ($16 million) lawsuit against the singer.",
      "Brown was on a U.K. tour at the time of the incident. He is scheduled to tour the U.K. in June and July.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Jon Batiste is hitting the road again. The Grammy and Oscar winner is launching his second headlining tour, promising fresh sounds for his forthcoming album and material from his latest project, \u201cBeethoven Blues (Batiste Piano Series, Vol. 1).\u201d",
      "Batiste announced Thursday that his Big Money Tour: Jon Batiste Plays America will begin Aug. 27 in Kansas City. He'll groove through more than 30 venues across the U.S. in cities like Detroit, Austin, Texas, Nashville, a co-bill with Diana Ross in St. Louis and Philadelphia, before closing in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 31.",
      "For the first time, Batiste will grace the stages of the Encore Theater in Las Vegas and the iconic Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado. He hopes the tour will offer attendees a deeper connection to him as an artist for the tour, a nod to his ninth studio album.",
      "\u201cEvery show is both an origin story and a manifesto,\u201d said Batiste, a seven-time Grammy winner who won an Oscar for his work on \u201cSoul\u201d in 2020. The tour comes on the heels of performing the national anthem at this year's Super Bowl and \u201cBeethoven Blues,\u201d which reimagined the famed German pianist\u2019s work and debuted No. 1 on Billboard's classical albums chart.",
      "Batiste, a Louisiana native, is known for his signature rich blend of R&B, hip-hop, swing, jazz and pop. He's also the former bandleader for the \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d",
      "The multitalented musician will wrap up his intimate Maestro Tour shows on Monday in Los Angeles.",
      "He expects to be joined on the road by his wife, Suleika Jaouad, who is currently facing cancer for the third time and recently released a new book, \u201cThe Book of Alchemy.\u201d",
      "Batiste believes his unreleased music can still forge a connection, even with those hearing it for the first time.",
      "\u201cI try to tell the most up-to-date origin story through the set,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you come to the show and you don\u2019t know any of the music, or you don\u2019t know anybody on stage and it\u2019s your first time seeing me perform or seen me on television, you\u2019ll leave and feel like you know the songs. You\u2019ll connect with the artist, the human being and the movement. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re going to see a play.\u201d",
      "Batiste said the tour will mark the beginning of his \u201cnext era\u201d of music. He views the live performances as an opportunity to introduce new material to audiences, allowing the songs to evolve through connection before ultimately recording them for his forthcoming album.",
      "Tickets will be available through artist presales beginning Friday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about getting the music to a point where you and your community and everybody is acquainted with the sound and feeling of it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve explored every aspect of it. You\u2019ve arranged and rearranged, then go record and share it, versus the opposite, which is most often the case. It\u2019s fresh and brand new. Then you go on tour, and you start discovering things in the music on stage you didn\u2019t even know were there in the studio.\u201d",
      "Along with introducing fresh sounds, Batiste said he'll incorporate some improvisation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always going to find a space in the show where there's improv,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's at the heart of what I\u2019m all about in trying to represent the cultural music that I come from. I really take a responsibility to push forward. This is about bringing people together, channeling the moment and communal expression.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Actor Daniel Dae Kim more than made the nominee list for the Tony Awards",
      "The first monologue Daniel Dae Kim ever performed was by David Henry Hwang.",
      "He had to do one for his college summer program at the National Theater Institute in Connecticut. Kim chose a scene from \u201cFOB,\" Hwang's play about the assimilation struggles of a Chinese American. So, it's fitting that 35 years later Hwang \u2014 the first Asian American to win the Tony Award for best play \u2014 would be the one to bring Kim into the Tony spotlight.",
      "Known for TV series such as \u201cLost\u201d and \u201cHawaii Five-0,\u201d Kim, 56, is the first Asian nominee in the category of best leading actor in a play in the Tonys\u2019 78-year history for his work in a Broadway revival of Hwang\u2019s \u201cYellow Face.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can imagine a lot of things, but I did not imagine this scenario with David,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThat I would be in a play with him, that we would both be nominated for Tony Awards and we would be able to call each other friends.\u201d",
      "In the semi-autobiographical show, which ran last fall at the Roundabout Theatre Company, Kim played a satirical version of Hwang. The show also scored nods for best play revival and best performance by a featured actor in a play for first-time nominee Francis Jue, an original 2007 cast member.",
      "You could not have scripted a better ending for a play that was written in response to the musical \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d casting white actors as Asian characters.",
      "Kim's performance was filmed in November and PBS will broadcast \u201cYellow Face\u201d on Friday. The Tonys, airing on CBS on June 8, also will put a spotlight on the play.",
      "This groundbreaking nomination seems like the perfect karmic reward for Kim, who has spent years advocating for greater Asian representation. At the pandemic's height, the Korean American actor was a constant media presence speaking out against anti-Asian hate. He also jump-started a campaign for veteran actor James Hong, then 91, to get a Hollywood star.",
      "He woke up to the news of his nomination after people were able to get around his phone's \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode. His competition includes George Clooney and Cole Escola.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be a huge surprise if I won, but I will say that even getting the nomination is a win especially when you put it in the context of our community and what this means for Asian Americans,\u201d said Kim, whose previous Broadway credits include \u201cThe King and I.\u201d",
      "He admits it's surprising and \u201ca little sad\u201d that no other Asian actor has been in this category. There\u2019s still never been an Asian nominee for best lead actress in a play.",
      "\u201cOf course, the barrier we really want to break is to actually have someone win, and hopefully that happens sooner rather than later, whether it\u2019s me or not.\u201d",
      "Kim is one of seven Asian acting nominees this year. Only three acting trophy winners have been Asian. One was Lea Salonga for \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d and another was Ruthie Ann Miles for \u201cThe King and I.\u201d Coincidentally, the first was BD Wong for best featured actor in Hwang's Tony-winning play, \u201cM. Butterfly.\u201d Hwang takes special pride in helping actors break glass ceilings.",
      "\u201cI get to feel like, \u2018Oh, maybe I\u2019m actually able to make a difference\u2019 and change the culture in the way that my little-kid-self would have loved but would not have thought possible,\" said Hwang, who now has his fourth career Tony nomination. He was last nominated 22 years ago.",
      "For a long time, Hwang felt the only way to get a play with Asian characters made was to set it outside America because \"Broadway audiences are not interested in Asian Americans.\u201d",
      "Historically, productions with Asian ensembles have been musicals set in \u201cthe exotic lands of Asia,\u201d such as \u201cThe King and I,\" said Esther Kim Lee, a theater studies professor at Duke University and author of \u201cThe Theatre of David Henry Hwang.\" \u201cFlower Drum Song,\u201d set in San Francisco, was an exception but the songs and book were by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. Hwang actually revised the book in 2002.",
      "\u201cIt's 2025. We finally see an actual Asian American play with an Asian American lead,\u201d Lee said. \u201cYou can have \u2018The King and I\u2019 and have great actors and they may get Tony Awards, but it\u2019s really not about Asian Americans. That this has happened with \u2018Yellow Face\u2019 is just incredible.\u201d",
      "The show's two-month run brought the Roundabout a 50% increase in first-time audience members \u2014 \u201ca powerful statement,\" Kim said.",
      "\u201cOne of the nicest compliments I would hear after the show when I would go to the stage door is, \u2018This is the first Broadway show I\u2019ve ever seen,\u2019\" Kim said. \u201cThat meant a lot to me because bringing Asian Americans into the theater is important and bringing younger people into the theater is important just for the health of theater in general.\u201d",
      "Besides discussing whitewash casting, \u201cYellow Face\u201d examines the pain of the main character's immigrant father. The role is based on Hwang's father's experience being wrongly accused of laundering money for China. With the current anti-immigrant and anti-DEI climate, the show's airing on PBS feels especially vital to Hwang.",
      "\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a conflict between America and any Asian country, Asian Americans are the first to get targeted,\u201d Hwang said.",
      "PBS is also where in 2020 the five-episode history docuseries \u201cAsian Americans\" aired for Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month. Kim was a narrator and remains \u201cunequivocally proud\" of the project.",
      "Five years after the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes, Kim sees \u201cYellow Face\u201d simply making it to Broadway as a victory.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to get preachy, but I will say that the goal with spotlighting and elevating people of color is not to threaten the establishment,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThe goal was really to say everyone can contribute to our society. Everyone can be a positive force for change.\u201d",

      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival barred French actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy from attending the premiere of the competition entry \u201cCase 137,\" in what's believed to be a first for the festival in the #MeToo era.",
      "Festival director Thierry Fremaux confirmed to the French magazine T\u00e9l\u00e9rama that Navarro-Mussy would not be allowed to attend the red carpet premiere of \u201cCase 137\" (\"Dossier 137\" in France) on Thursday night at Cannes. He has a supporting role in the film.",
      "T\u00e9l\u00e9rama reported that Navarro-Mussy was accused of rape by three former partners in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The case was dropped last month due to lack of evidence, but T\u00e9l\u00e9rama reported the three woman plan to appeal.",
      "\u201cIt is because there is an appeal, and therefore the investigation is still active, that the case is not suspended,\" Fremaux told the French magazine. \u201cWhen a legal decision becomes final, the situation changes.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Navarro-Mussy didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for the Cannes Film Festival referred inquires to Fremaux's comments to T\u00e9l\u00e9rama.",
      "Navarro-Mussy's attorney, Marion Pouzet-Gagliardi told T\u00e9l\u00e9rama: \u201cI have received no information indicating that any proceedings are ongoing. This proposed complaint with civil party status has, to my knowledge, not been legally filed.\"",
      "The decision marks a shift for the Cannes Film Festival, which has sometimes been criticized for welcoming men accused of sexual misconduct. But some say now that the festival is evolving as the #MeToo movement has made belated inroads into the French film industry.",
      "This year's Cannes opened hours after French actor Gerard Depardieu was found guilty of sexual assault and handed a 18-month suspended prison sentence. When asked about the Depardieu verdict, Juliette Binoche, Cannes jury president, said that \u201cthe festival is following this trend in social and political life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe festival is in step with what\u2019s happening today,\u201d Binoche said. \u201c#MeToo took some time to gain strength. We reacted very strongly recently.\"",
      "On Thursday, the French production company of \u201cCase 137,\u201d Haut et Court, said it last week received a warning about the situation.",
      "\u201cEven though the allegations largely predate the production of the film, we agreed with the festival management that the person in question will not accompany the film to Cannes, out of respect for the plaintiffs and their right to be heard, while also respecting the presumption of innocence of the accused,\u201d the company said in a statement.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean artist BIBI released her highly anticipated sophomore album \u201cEVE: ROMANCE\u201d on Wednesday, delivering a project that blends her signature genre-defying sound with philosophical twists.",
      "The singer, songwriter and actor, who moves fluidly between pop, R&B, hip-hop and electronic music, has built a reputation for her bold, unapologetic presence in an industry often defined by careful image management. Her latest album features 14 tracks, including six new songs alongside previously released hits like \u201cBam Yang Gang\u201d and \u201cDerre.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, BIBI explained the meaning behind the album\u2019s lead single \u201cApocalypse,\u201d which carries a more poetic Korean title meaning \u201cThe Apple Tree of the End Times.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought, if there was the fruit of knowledge of good and evil at the beginning, then this would be the apple tree at the end of times,\u201d BIBI said.",
      "\u201cYou know that saying \u2014 when asked what you\u2019d do if the world ended tomorrow, some say they\u2019d plant an apple tree, others say they\u2019d have an orgy. ... But to me, they felt like the same thing. Both are, in essence, acts of planting seeds.\u201d",
      "Her interpretation, merging ideas of creation, pleasure, and existential finality, may come across as provocative in a conservative South Korean society where open discussions about sex remain rare and often taboo.",
      "\u201cIn reality, everything has an end, and what each person chooses to do in that moment is their own,\u201d she added. \u201cIt can\u2019t be labeled as good or bad. After all, isn\u2019t the very idea of good and evil ambiguous?\u201d",
      "One of Korea\u2019s fastest-rising stars with a growing international presence, BIBI reflected on the surprising success of \u201cBam Yang Gang.\u201d The song, which means a chestnut jelly snack in Korean, became a viral sensation in South Korea last year while she was too busy to notice.",
      "\u201cI was filming two dramas simultaneously, so I was really busy,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t really feel it at that time. Actually, I felt it more this year because people introduce me saying, \u2018Last year was the year of Bam Yang Gang.\u2018\u201d",
      "Despite her growing popularity, BIBI aspires to maintain an element of \u201cambiguity\u201d in her artistry.",
      "\u201cI want to be a mysterious artist. Like \u2018Gacha!\u2019 \u2014 that kind of feeling. Like you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll get from a Gacha machine,\u201d she explained, referencing the Japanese toy vending machines known for their randomized collectibles.",
      "The album includes \u201cPygma girl,\u201d a track that reimagines the Greek myth of Pygmalion by reversing traditional muse-artist dynamics, suggesting the subject is the art itself rather than merely inspiring the creator.",
      "\u201cMidnight Cruise,\u201d another standout track, was written after she dreamt about her late grandfather before her Coachella performance in 2024.",
      "BIBI will kick off her first global tour in Seoul on May 16, before heading to the United States and Canada. She will then continue across Asia, with stops including Hong Kong and cities in Japan. The tour will conclude in Australia and New Zealand this October.",

I have no doubt. We\u2019re all campaigning. We\u2019re all leveraging. We all pay a lot of money for these rights and we all want the same thing.\u201d",
      "One would think the job has gotten somewhat easier the past couple years as the league has come up with more broadcast windows, including making Christmas Day a permanent fixture.",
      "The trade off though is that this is the third year under the league's broadcast deals that all of the games are up for bid for every network.",
      "CBS remains the primary home of the AFC, with the NFC on Fox, but if there is a great NFC matchup during a week when CBS has the doubleheader, that game will end up on CBS. That is the case in Week 1 with Detroit visiting Green Bay in the 4:25 p.m. EDT spot.",
      "Hans Schroeder, the NFL's executive vice president of media distribution, said this year's rotation of the NFC North facing the AFC North and NFC East created a lot of favorable matchups to divide among all the network's broadcast partners.",
      "\u201cWe love every schedule in May. Hopefully we love it in December too,\u201d said Schroeder, who is in his second year leading the league's scheduling team. \u201cWe have a lot of great matchups, and the flexibility of those new TV deals that every game could go into any widow, I think that's the key and to marry that with a team that is relentless in their effort, I think led to a fun and really great schedule.\u201d",
      "Even though the league announced the release date during the first round of the NFL Draft on April 24, the schedule wasn't totally finalized until Tuesday.",
      "Because some of the games started to be announced on Monday during network upfront presentations to advertisers, those matchups were locked in on Sunday night.",
      "The biggest final-minute decision with the early announced games came with the Fox Week 16 Saturday doubleheader on Dec. 20. The league knew it wanted Packers vs. Bears and Eagles vs. Commanders, but didn't finalize the home teams until Sunday night.",
      "If ever there was a year where the league could opt to move the Buffalo-Kansas City game from CBS to prime time, this was the one.",
      "However, the Week 9 matchup will again be on CBS and is the only 4:25 p.m. game on Nov. 2. Going into this season, Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen have faced each other nine times, including the playoffs. The first matchup in 2020 was on Fox with the rest being on CBS.",
      "\u201cTo be documenting the story of these franchises and star quarterbacks, we're thrilled to keep telling it,\u201d CBS Sports president and CEO David Berson said.",
      "CBS also got what could be the most-watched game during the regular season with Kansas City visiting Dallas on Thanksgiving Day. The most-watched Thanksgiving game was in 2022 when the New York Giants win over Dallas averaged 42.06 million on Fox.",
      "The Chiefs and Bills are both slated to have nine games on CBS.",
      "It is rare that a Super Bowl rematch airs on the network that carried the game, but Fox gets Kansas City visiting Philadelphia on Week 2 in the 4:25 p.m. EDT window.",
      "Getting the rematch satisfied a couple of requests that Fox made to the league. The network wants more variety in its late afternoon window, and is also getting more quality matchups when the top AFC teams play on their network.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be so reliant on the Dallas Cowboys. I think we hear complaints sometimes that fans feel like it gets a little bit monotonous that our 4:25 window is dominated by one team,\u201d said Mike Mulvihill, Fox Sports president, insight and analytics. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly still going to have our share of Dallas games, but we\u2019re going to have some Philly in there too. We\u2019re also going to have Buffalo, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Detroit, Washington. I think it is pretty different than what you\u2019re used to seeing on Fox, and I think it\u2019s actually going to be a little bit better.\u201d",
      "NBC not only has the Kickoff game between Dallas and Philadelphia on Sept. 4, it has the matchup between the last two NFL MVPs when Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens visit Allen and Buffalo on Sept. 7 on \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d.",
      "ABC will have 13 \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d games \u2014 11 simulcasts with ESPN and two exclusive games. There will also be two MNF doubleheaders on Sept. 15 and Oct. 20. The Week 7 doubleheader will have the late game between Houston and Seattle streamed on ESPN+.",
      "\u201cThursday Night Football on Prime Video\u201d features all 14 playoff teams from last year as well as 10 divisional matchups. Prime Video concludes its regular-season slate with Denver at Kansas City on Christmas night. The Black Friday game between Chicago and Philadelphia will also include an NBA doubleheader afterward.",
      "Derek Carr's retirement did not have any impact on New Orleans' schedule. The Saints were already in a rebuilding mode under new coach Kellen Moore and join Cleveland and Tennessee as the only teams not slated to make a prime time appearance.",
      "Pittsburgh is already a national brand, so the waiting game on if Aaron Rodgers suits up in black and yellow or who will be Mike Tomlin's quarterback also didn't have much of a factor. The Steelers \u2014 along with AFC North rivals Baltimore and Cincinnati \u2014 have four prime time games.",
      "However, in case Rodgers decides to sign with Pittsburgh, his Week 1 opponent will be at the New York Jets and former Steelers quarterback Justin Fields.",

      "An athlete will aim to be the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard to educate the public on sharks",
      "VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. -- Lewis Pugh has followed an unspoken rule during his career as one of the world\u2019s most daring endurance swimmers: Don\u2019t talk about sharks. But he plans to break that this week on a swim around Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where \u201c Jaws\u201d was filmed 50 years ago.",
      "The British-South African was the first person to complete a long-distance swim in every ocean of the world \u2014 and has taken on extreme conditions everywhere from Mount Everest to the Arctic.",
      "\u201cOn this swim, it\u2019s very different: We\u2019re just talking about sharks all the time,\u201d joked Pugh, who will, as usual, wear no wetsuit.",
      "For his swim around Martha\u2019s Vineyard in 47-degree (8-degree Celsius) water he will wear just trunks, a cap and goggles.",
      "Pugh, 55, is undertaking the challenge because he wants to change public perception around the now at-risk animals \u2014 which he said were maligned by the blockbuster film as \u201cvillains, as cold-blooded killers.\u201d He will urge for more protection for sharks.",
      "On Thursday, beginning at the Edgartown Harbor Lighthouse, he will swim for three or four hours in the brutally cold surf, mark his progress and spend the rest of his waking hours on the Vineyard educating the public about sharks. Then, he'll get in the water and do it again \u2014 and again, for an estimated 12 days, or however long it takes him to complete the 62-mile (100-kilometer) swim.",
      "He begins the journey just after the New England Aquarium confirmed the first white shark sighting of the season, earlier this week off the coast of Nantucket.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to test me not only physically, but also mentally,\u201d he said, while scoping out wind conditions by the starting line. \u201cI mean every single day I\u2019m going to be speaking about sharks, sharks, sharks, sharks. Then, ultimately, I\u2019ve got to get in the water afterwards and do the swim. I suppose you can imagine what I\u2019ll be thinking about.\u201d",
      "Pugh said the swim will be among the most difficult he\u2019s undertaken, which says a lot for someone who has swum near glaciers and volcanoes, and among hippos, crocodiles and polar bears. No one has ever swum around the island of Martha's Vineyard before.",
      "But Pugh, who often swims to raise awareness for environmental causes \u2014 and was this year named the United Nations Patron of the Oceans \u2014 said no swim is without risk and that drastic measures are needed to get his message across: Around 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day \u2014 a rate of 100 million every year, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
      "\u201cIt was a film about sharks attacking humans and for 50 years, we have been attacking sharks,\u201d he said of \u201cJaws.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s completely unsustainable. It\u2019s madness. We need to respect them.\u201d",
      "He emphasizes that the swim is not something nonprofessionals should attempt. He\u2019s accompanied by safety personnel in a boat and kayak and uses a \u201cShark Shield\u201d device that deters sharks using an electric field without harming them.",
      "Pugh remembers feeling fear as a 16-year-old watching \u201cJaws\u201d for the first time. Over decades of study and research, awe and respect have replaced his fear, as he realized the role they play in maintaining Earth\u2019s increasingly fragile ecosystems.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m more terrified of a world without sharks, or without predators,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d is credited for creating Hollywood\u2019s blockbuster culture when it was released in summer 1975, becoming the highest grossing film up until that time and earning three Academy Awards. It would impact how many viewed the ocean for decades to come.",
      "Both director Steven Spielberg and author Peter Benchley have expressed regret over the impact of the film on viewers\u2019 perception of sharks. Both have since contributed to conservation efforts for animals, which have seen populations depleted due to factors like overfishing and climate change.",
      "Discovery Channel and the National Geographic Channel each year release programming about sharks to educate the public about the predator.",
      "Greg Skomal, marine fisheries biologist at Martha\u2019s Vineyard Fisheries within the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, said many people tell him they still won't swim in the ocean because of the sheer terror caused by the film.",
      "\u201cI tend to hear the expression that, \u2018I haven\u2019t gone in the water since \u2018Jaws\u2019 came out,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "But Skomal, who published a book challenging the film's inaccuracies, said \u201cJaws\u201d also inspired many people \u2014 including him \u2014 to study marine biology, leading to increased research, acceptance and respect for the creatures.",
      "If \u201cJaws\u201d were made today, he doesn't think it'd have the same effect. But in the 1970s, \u201cit was just perfect in terms of generating this level of fear to a public that was largely uneducated about sharks, because we were uneducated. Scientists didn\u2019t know a lot about sharks.\u201d",
      "Skomal said the biggest threat contributing to the decline of the shark population now is commercial fishing, which exploded in the late 1970s and is today driven by high demand for fins and meat used in food dishes, as well as the use of skin to make leather and oil and cartilage for cosmetics.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve really moved away from this feeling, or the old adage that, \u2018The only good shark is a dead shark,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely morphing from fear to fascination, or perhaps a combination of both.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- An alligator that appeared in numerous TV shows and films over three decades, most notably the 1996 Adam Sandler comedy \u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d has died at a gator farm in southern Colorado.",
      "Based on his growth rate and tooth loss, Morris the alligator was at least 80 years old when he died, the Colorado Gator Farm said in a Facebook post Sunday. He was nearly 11 feet (3.3 meters) long and weighed 640 pounds (290 kilograms).",
      "\"He started acting strange about a week ago. He wasn\u2019t lunging at us and wasn\u2019t taking food,\u201d Jay Young, the farm\u2019s owner and operator, said in a video as he tearfully stroked Morris' head in an animal enclosure.",
      "\u201cI know it's strange to people that we get so attached to an alligator, to all of our animals. ... He had a happy time here, and he died of old age,\" he said.",
      "Morris, who was found in the backyard of a Los Angeles home as an illegal pet, started his Hollywood career in 1975 and retired in 2006, when he was sent to the Colorado Gator Farm in the tiny town of Mosca. He appeared in several films, including \u201cInterview with the Vampire,\u201d \u201cDr. Dolittle 2\" and \u201cBlues Brothers 2000.\" He also appeared on \u201cCoach,\u201d \u201cNight Court\u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno\u201d featuring the late wildlife expert Steve Irwin.",
      "But his most famous role was in \u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d a film about a failed and ill-tempered hockey player who discovers a talent for golf. The title character played by Sandler confronts Morris after hitting a golf ball that ends up in the gator's mouth.",
      "Sandler posted a tribute to Morris on Instagram on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe are all gonna miss you. You could be hard on directors, make-up artists, costumers \u2014 really anyone with arms or legs \u2014 but I know you did it for the ultimate good of the film,\" Sandler wrote. \"The day you wouldn\u2019t come out of your trailer unless we sent in 40 heads of lettuce taught me a powerful lesson: never compromise your art.\u201d",
      "The Colorado Gator Farm, which opened to the public in 1990, said it plans to preserve Morris' body.",
      "\u201cWe have decided to get Morris taxidermied so that he can continue to scare children for years to come. It\u2019s what he would have wanted,\" the farm posted on Facebook on Monday.",

    "story": [
      "The trials of Lyle and Erik Menendez and their conviction for killing their parents came at a time when televised trials captured national audiences in the 1990s",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The trials of Lyle and Erik Menendez came at a time of cultural obsession with courts, crime and murder, when live televised trials captivated a national audience.",
      "Their resentencing \u2014 and the now very real possibility of their freedom \u2014 came at another, when true crime documentaries and docudramas have proliferated and brought renewed attention to the family.",
      "A judge made the Menendez brothers eligible for parole Tuesday when he reduced their sentences from life without parole to 50 years to life for the 1989 murder of their father Jose Menendez and mother Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills home. The state parole board will now determine whether they can be released.",
      "Their two trials bookended the O.J. Simpson trial, creating a mid-1990s phenomenon where courts subsumed soap operas as riveting daytime television.",
      "\u201cPeople were not used to having cameras in the courtroom. For the first time we were seeing the drama of justice in real time,\u201d said Vinnie Politan, a Court TV anchor who hosts the nightly \u201cClosing Arguments\u201d on the network. \"Everyone was watching cable and everyone had that common experience. Today there\u2019s a true crime bonanza happening, but it's splintered off into so many different places.\u201d",
      "The brothers became an immediate sensation with their 1990 arrest. They represented a pre-tech-boom image of young wealthy men as portrayed in many a 1980s movie: the tennis-playing, Princeton-bound prep.",
      "For many viewers, this image was confirmed by the spending spree they went on after the killings. Their case continued a fascination with the dark, private lives of the young and wealthy that goes back at least to the Leopold and Loeb murder case of the 1930s, but had been in the air in cases like the Billionaire Boys Club, a 1980s Ponzi scheme that spurred a murder.",
      "Their first trials in 1993 and 1994 became a landmark for then-new Court TV, which aired it nearly in its entirety. Defense lawyers conceded that they had shot their parents. The jury, and the public, then had to consider whether the brothers' testimony about sexual and other abuse from their father was plausible, and should mean conviction on a lesser charge.",
      "The lasting image from the trial was Lyle Menendez crying on the stand as he described the abuse.",
      "At the time there had been some public reckoning with the effects of sex abuse, but not nearly to the extent of today.",
      "The two juries \u2014 one for each brother \u2014 deadlocked, largely along gender lines. It reflected the broader cultural reaction \u2014 with women supporting a manslaughter conviction and men a guilty verdict for first-degree murder.",
      "The trials came at a time when crime in the U.S. was at an all-time high, a tough-on-crime stance was a prerequisite for holding major political office, and a wave of legislation mandating harsher sentences was passed.",
      "That attitude appeared to prevail when, at their second trial, the brothers were both convicted of first-degree murder.",
      "As Associated Press trial reporter Linda Deutsch, who covered both trials along with Simpson\u2019s and countless others, wrote in 1996:",
      "\u201cThis time, the jury rejected the defense claim that the brothers murdered their parents after years of sexual abuse. Instead, it embraced the prosecution theory that the killings were planned and that the brothers were greedy, spoiled brats who murdered to get their parents\u2019 $14 million fortune.\u201d",
      "The second trial was not televised and got less attention.",
      "\u201cThere were no cameras, it was in the shadow of O.J. so it didn\u2019t have the same spark and pop as the first one,\u201d Politan said.",
      "They had become too well-known to be forgotten, but for decades, the Menendez brothers faded into the background. Occasional stories emerged about the brothers losing their appeals, as did mugshots of them aging in prison.",
      "\u201cThe public\u2019s memory of them was, \u2018Yeah, I remember that trial, the guys with the sweaters in court,\u2019\u201d Politan said.",
      "That would change in the era of true-crime TV, podcasts and streamers.",
      "The 2017 NBC drama series \u201cLaw & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders,\" wasn't widely watched, but still brought the case new attention. The next decade would prove more important.",
      "The 2023 Peacock docuseries \u201cMenendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed\u201d included a former member saying he was raped by Jose Menendez when he was 14. At about the same time, the brothers submitted a letter that Erik wrote to his cousin about his father\u2019s abuse before the killings.",
      "The new true-crime wave would continue to promote them, even if the portrayal wasn't always flattering.",
      "\" Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,\" a drama created by Ryan Murphy on Netflix, made them beautiful and vain buffoons, and the actors were shown shirtless on provocative billboards. Javier Bardem as Jose Menendez brought Oscar-winning star power to the project that dropped in September of last year.",
      "That was followed a month later by a documentary on Netflix, \u201cThe Menendez Brothers.\u201d",
      "Together, the shows had the public paying more attention to the case than it had since the trials. Almost simultaneously came a real-life turning point, when then- Los Angeles District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said he was reviewing new evidence in the case.",
      "The office of Gasc\u00f3n's successor, Nathan Hochman, opposed the resentencing.",
      "Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian constantly sought at hearings to make sure the \u201ccarnage\u201d caused by the brothers wasn't forgotten, and repeatedly emphasized that they \u201cshotgunned, brutally, their parents to death.\u201d",
      "But the shifts in public perception and legal actions were already in motion. The judge's decision to reduce their charges came not with the drama of the televised trial, but in a short hearing in a courtroom that wouldn't allow cameras. The broader public never saw.",
      "Despite his opposition, Hochman was reflective in a statement after the resentencing.",
      "\u201cThe case of the Menendez brothers has long been a window for the public to better understand the judicial system,\u201d Hochman said. \u201cThis case, like all cases \u2014 especially those that captivate the public \u2014 must be viewed with a critical eye. Our opposition and analysis ensured that the Court received a complete and accurate record of the facts. Justice should never be swayed by spectacle.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A former model has reproached one of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s lawyers for suggesting that her sexual abuse allegations against the ex-studio boss are lies",
      "NEW YORK -- A former model reproached one of Harvey Weinstein \u2019s lawyers for suggesting that her sexual abuse allegations against the ex-studio boss are lies.",
      "\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself,\u201d Kaja Sokola retorted. In her fifth and final day of testimony at Weinstein's sex crimes retrial, she maintained that she was telling the truth and that Weinstein's alleged conduct in her teens had changed the course of her life.",
      "\u201cIt changed the course of your life in that you got $3.5 million from false accusations?\u201d defense lawyer Mike Cibella pressed, referring to compensation she was awarded through civil proceedings in recent years.",
      "\u201cNo. That\u2019s very unfair,\" Sokola said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d",
      "During her days on the witness stand, she said Weinstein repeatedly offered to foster her acting ambitions but then made unwanted physical advances, beginning when she was 16 in 2002.",
      "Weinstein, 73, faces a sexual assault charge related solely to her allegation that he forced oral sex on her when she was 19. He also faces charges based on two other women's claims. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges, and his attorneys assert that his accusers had consensual sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer because they wanted movie and TV work.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers grilled Sokola about her requests for career help from him after the alleged assault, her motives for her civil lawsuits and criminal trial testimony, as well as her personal struggles, and even a private journal she kept for an alcohol-abuse program in her native Poland.",
      "After apparently getting the decade-old writings via the witness' sister, the defense was allowed to bring up portions in which Sokola said two other men had sexually assaulted her over the years but didn't say the same about Weinstein. Instead, she wrote that he promised her help but didn't deliver.",
      "Sokola testified Wednesday that she had left out Weinstein's alleged sexual abuse partly because she couldn't come to terms with it at the time. Also, she said, her sponsor was in the film business in Poland and knew who Weinstein was.",
      "Cibella questioned that explanation, noting that the text mentioned only \u201cHarvey W\u201d and nothing about his profession. Sokola said her sponsor nonetheless knew his identity because they talked about it.",
      "Tearing up as she spoke, she said she hadn\u2019t seen the black notebook for 10 years, never gave anyone permission to share it and was stunned and appalled to be confronted with it in court.",
      "\u201cI felt very violated,\u201d said Sokola, now 39 and a psychotherapist.",
      "She was the second of Weinstein's accusers to testify at the retrial, and the only one who wasn't involved in his first trial in 2020. That proceeding led to a landmark #MeToo-era conviction that was subsequently overturned, setting up the retrial. Prosecutors decided to add Sokola's allegations to it.",
      "Another woman, Miriam Haley, already has told jurors at the retrial that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify in the coming days or weeks. She alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission to be identified. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The 1989 shotgun murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez in Los Angeles gripped the nation.",
      "The killings of the entertainment executive and his wife in their wealthy Beverly Hills neighborhood were brutal. Their son Lyle Menendez was the one who called 911, with the brothers initially claiming the killing was Mafia-related or connected to their father\u2019s business dealings.",
      "Lyle Menendez was attending Princeton University, and his younger brother Erik Menendez was a tennis star.",
      "The brothers were later arrested, charged and convicted for their parents\u2019 deaths.",
      "The brothers have argued that they committed the crimes in self-defense after years of abuse by their father.",
      "On Tuesday, the brothers were granted their first chance at freedom in decades. A Los Angeles judge reduced the brothers\u2019 sentences from life in prison without parole to 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible for parole.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:",
      "Coming on the heels of the O.J. Simpson trial, the nation was hungry for true crime TV. The brothers\u2019 first trial was one of the first to be almost entirely televised on Court TV. It spawned documentaries, television specials and dramatizations.",
      "The Netflix drama \u201c Monsters: Lyle and Erik Menendez Story \u201d and the documentary \u201cThe Menendez Brothers,\u201d released in the fall of 2024, have been credited for bringing new attention to the case.",
      "The brothers\u2019 lawyers turned to family members and those who knew the brothers since their conviction to speak to their character and rehabilitation in prison in front of Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic.",
      "The Menendez family have supported the brothers and called for their release since their resentencing effort began last fall.",
      "Prosecutors, who have opposed the brothers\u2019 resentencing, did not call any witnesses. They\u2019ve argued the brothers haven\u2019t taken full responsibility for their crimes.",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez appeared virtually to read their statements to the court.",
      "\u201cYou did not deserve what I did to you, but you inspire me to do better,\u201d Erik Menendez said, addressing his family.",
      "Jesic issued his decision immediately after the brothers spoke, granting them a new sentence of 50 years to life.",
      "The brothers are immediately eligible for parole under California\u2019s youthful offender law because they committed the crime at ages 18 and 21, both under the age of 26.",
      "Parole suitability hearings are conducted by a state board to determine if a person should be released. An inmate will be scheduled for their first hearing no later than six months following their eligibility date, according to board policy.",
      "They already have a hearing before the board scheduled for June 13 in a clemency petition they\u2019ve submitted to Gov. Gavin Newsom. It\u2019s not yet clear if that will serve as their formal parole hearing or if a separate one will be scheduled.",
      "Newsom ordered the state parole board to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for him to determine their danger to the public if released.",
      "Anne Bremner, a trial lawyer in Seattle, said the brothers will have some pressure on them to prepare for the parole board and impress upon them that they should be let out.",
      "\u201cMy guess is the parole board has been watching this and of course they\u2019ve done these risk assessments already,\u201d she said. They know \u201cwho these two are, what their alleged crimes were and what they\u2019ve done since the time that they were incarcerated until today.\u201d",
      "If they are denied at their first parole hearing, they will continue to receive subsequent hearings until they are granted release.",
      "If parole is granted, Newsom could still move to override the board. If he lets the parole decision stand, the brothers would be released from prison.",
      "In May 2023, the brothers\u2019 attorneys also filed a petition for habeas corpus to the court, asking for a new trial in light of new evidence of their sexual abuse. LA prosecutors have filed a motion opposing that petition, but its status is unclear.",

      "Authorities say a man who attacked rapper Tory Lanez in a California prison is an inmate serving a life sentence for second-degree murder who was previously convicted for an in-prison assault with a deadly weapon",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Authorities said Tuesday that a man who attacked rapper Tory Lanez in a California prison is an inmate serving a life sentence for second-degree murder who was previously convicted for an in-prison assault with a deadly weapon.",
      "Lanez was in fair condition a day after the attack in a housing unit at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi, where he\u2019s serving a 10-year sentence for shooting hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion in the feet, Pedro Calderon Michel, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said in an email.",
      "Authorities did not specify how Lanez was attacked, but a message posted on the rapper\u2019s Instagram account Monday evening said Lanez was stabbed 14 times and both his lungs collapsed.",
      "Prison officials identified the alleged attacker as Santino Casio, 42. He has been put in restricted housing pending an investigation by the prison and the Kern County District Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "Casio has been in the facility since 2004, after he was sentenced to life, with parole possible, for convictions of second-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder. In 2008, he was sentenced to six more years for assault by a prisoner with a deadly weapon, and in 2018 he was sentenced to two more years for possession and manufacture of a deadly weapon by a prisoner.",
      "An email seeking comment sent to an attorney who previously represented Casio was not immediately answered.",
      "The prison is about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Los Angeles in the mountains of the Mojave Desert and houses about 1,700 medium- and maximum-security inmates.",
      "In December 2022, Lanez was convicted of three felonies: assault with a semiautomatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.",
      "Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, testified during the trial that in July 2020, after they left a party at Kylie Jenner\u2019s Hollywood Hills home, Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding.",
      "She had bullet fragments in both feet that had to be surgically removed. It wasn\u2019t until months after the incident that she publicly identified Lanez as the person who had fired the gun.",
      "A judge rejected a motion for a new trial from Lanez\u2019s lawyers, who are appealing his conviction. They had no immediate comment after the attack.",
      "Megan recently alleged that Lanez was harassing her from prison through surrogates, and in January a judge issued a protective order through 2030 ordering him to stop any such harassment or any other contact.",
      "The 32-year-old Canadian Lanez began releasing mixtapes in 2009 and saw a steady rise in popularity, moving on to major label albums, two of which reached the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s charts.",
      "The Monday Instagram post on Lanez\u2019s status said he was \u201ctalking normally, in good spirits, and deeply thankful to God that he is pulling through.\"",

      "CANNES, France -- One hundred years after Charlie Chaplin made dinner rolls dance and ate his shoe like it was a fine meal, \u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d has been vividly brought back to life in a new restoration that premiered Tuesday at the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "On the opening day of its 78th edition, Cannes debuted a 4K restoration of \u201cThe Gold Rush,\u201d one of Chaplin\u2019s most beloved silent masterpieces. The screening, held just before the festival\u2019s official opening ceremony, was part of a new day-one tradition for restored films, festival director Thierry Fremaux said before the screening at Cannes\u2019 Debussy Theatre.",
      "Years in the making, this \u201cGold Rush\u201d pristinely restores Chaplin\u2019s Tramp to all his downtrodden glory. The 1925 Alaskan frontier comedy may be marking its centenary, but it looks bracingly fresh in the restoration carried out by La Cineteca di Bologna.",
      "The restoration was more complicated than most because it included an extensive search for any missing footage. In 1942, Chaplin edited the film and re-released it with sound effects, music and narration. That version landed two Oscar nominations, but the restoration sought to get as close to the 1925 original as possible.",
      "In \u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d Chaplin's lone prospector ambles through the snowy Alaskan wilds in pursuit less of gold than some food and perhaps companionship. His antic, cliff-dangling struggles make up much of the film's deft slapstick, but the Little Tramp's humble, sweet hopes for romance greatly exceed his strike-it-rich ambitions.",
      "The film's premiere drew two grandchildren of Chaplin: Kiera Chaplin and Spencer Chaplin.",
      "\u201cWhat to say about \u2018The Gold Rush?' said Spencer Chaplin. \u201cIt was his biggest production to date. He built the set \u2014 it was almost like a tourist attraction in L.A. at the time. He built the mountains.\u201d",
      "The screening in Cannes drew a packed house in one of Cannes' largest theaters, a crowd that the Chaplin descendants warmly surveyed.",
      "\u201cOur grandfather would be really proud to see this, a hundred years later, to see all you here and interested in seeing the film,\u201d said Kiera Chaplin.",
      "\u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d will roll out in theaters worldwide on June 26 in a release organized by mk2 Films.",

      "Infant twins suffered from malnutrition in Nigeria",
      "DIKWA, Nigeria -- Under the dappled light of a thatched shelter, Yagana Bulama cradles her surviving infant. The other twin is gone, a casualty of malnutrition and the international funding cuts that are snapping the lifeline for displaced communities in Nigeria\u2019s insurgency-ravaged Borno state.",
      "\u201cFeeding is severely difficult,\u201d said Bulama, 40, who was a farmer before Boko Haram militants swept through her village, forcing her to flee. She and about 400,000 other people at the humanitarian hub of Dikwa \u2014 virtually the entire population \u2014 rely on assistance. The military restricts their movements to a designated \u201csafe zone,\u201d which severely limits farming.",
      "For years, the United States Agency for International Development had been the backbone of the humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria, helping non-government organizations provide food, shelter and healthcare to millions of people. But this year, the Trump administration cut more than 90% of USAID's foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance around the world.",
      "Programs serving children were hit hard.",
      "Bulama previously lost young triplets to hunger before reaching therapeutic feeding centers in Dikwa. When she gave birth to twins last August, both were severely underweight. Workers from Mercy Corps enrolled them in a program to receive a calorie-dense paste used to treat severe acute malnutrition.",
      "But in February, Mercy Corps abruptly ended the program that was entirely financed by USAID. Two weeks later, one of the twins died, Bulama said.",
      "She has no more tears, only dread for what may come next.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to bury another child,\u201d she said.",
      "Globally, 50% of the therapeutic foods for treating malnutrition in children were funded by USAID, and 40% of the supplies were produced in the U.S., according to Shawn Baker, chief program officer at Helen Keller Intl and former chief nutritionist at USAID.",
      "He said the consequence could be 1 million children not receiving treatment for severe malnutrition, resulting in 163,500 additional deaths per year. For Helen Keller Intl, its programs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria have been terminated.",
      "\u201cIt is very traumatic,\u201d said Trond Jensen, the head of the United Nations humanitarian office in Maiduguri, Borno's capital, of the funding cuts, noting that other donors, including the European Union, have taken similar steps this year. \u201cOne of the things is the threat to the lives of children.\u201d",
      "UNICEF still runs a therapeutic feeding center nearby, which now supports Bulama's surviving baby, but its capacity is stretched. It is turning away many people previously served by other aid groups that have pulled out due to funding cuts.",
      "Intersos, an Italian humanitarian organization, has the only remaining facility providing in-patient services for malnutrition in Dikwa, treating the most perilous cases. Its workers say they are overwhelmed, with at least 10 new admissions of seriously malnourished children daily.",
      "\u201cBefore the USAID cut, we made a lot of progress,\u201d said Ayuba Kauji, a health and nutrition supervisor. \u201cNow my biggest worry is high mortality. We don\u2019t have enough resources to keep up.\u201d",
      "Intersos was forced to reduce its staff from 30 to 11 in Dikwa after the USAID freeze. Its nutrition and health facilities now operate solely on support from the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, a smaller pot of money contributed by a few European countries. That funding will be finished in June.",
      "The crisis is equally acute in Maiduguri, where the economy is reeling from massive terminations of aid workers. At another Intersos-run facility, 10 of the 12 doctors have left and four nurses remain, with 50 new admissions of malnourished children per week.",
      "\u201cIt used to be far less,\u201d said Emmanuel Ali, one of the remaining doctors.",
      "The effects of the funding cuts extend far beyond nutrition. At the International Organization for Migration's reception center in Dikwa, thousands of displaced families and those escaping Boko Haram captivity are stranded. There are no new shelters being built and no support for relocation.",
      "\u201cBefore, organizations like Mercy Corps built mud-brick homes and rehabilitated damaged shelters to absorb people from the IOM reception center,\u201d said one official at the center, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the situation. \u201cNow, that has stopped.\u201d",
      "Jensen, the U.N. humanitarian head in Maiduguri, said, \u201csadly, we are not seeing additional funding to make up for the U.S. cuts.\u201d He warned that vulnerable people could turn to risky ways of coping, including joining violent groups.",
      "The crisis in Nigeria is part of a larger reckoning. According to Kate Phillips-Barrasso, Mercy Corps' vice president for policy and advocacy, 40 of its 62 U.S.-funded programs with the potential to reach 3.5 million people in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon and Gaza have been terminated.",
      "In Mozambique, where jihadist violence in the north has displaced over a million people since 2017, humanitarian organizations face steep shortfalls with \u201cdevastating\u201d effects on the needy, said Frederico Jo\u00e3o, chairman of the forum of NGOs in the region.",
      "More widely, the USAID funding cut compromises Mozambique's health sector, especially in HIV/AIDS care, said Inoc\u00eancio Impissa, cabinet spokesman. The government now seeks alternative funding to prevent total collapse of health systems.",

      "NEW YORK -- One week into a new job, Lisa Grouette discovered something missing come Sunday night: the sinking feeling of dread she used to experience before going to work every Monday.",
      "Groutte spent 10 years at an insurance agency with a boss whom she alleges screamed at her, slammed his hands on the desk, insulted her appearance and punched things. He falsely accused her of taking money and threatened to withhold an employment recommendation if she quit, she says.",

      "\u201cYou can't put a price tag on it,\u201d she said. \"It was the best 400 bucks a month I've ever spent, worth every penny. I was a little tight at first, but it didn't matter because I was happy.\u201d",
      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes unhealthy behavior and the kinds of treatment people will not \u2014 or should not \u2014 tolerate for a steady paycheck.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re developing language now around things like toxic workplaces,\u201d said Jennifer Tosti-Kharas, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College in Massachusetts.",
      "Younger generations entering the workforce, including millennials and members of Generation Z, are less willing to endure bullying behavior from colleagues and managers, and better at establishing boundaries, she said.",
      "At the start of her own career, \u201cif I encountered toxicity in the workplace, I had more of a \u2018Suck it up\u2019 attitude,\" said Tosti-Kharas, who identifies as a member of Generation X. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were as vocal about taking care of our mental health as we should have been.\u201d",
      "Conflicts and difficult relationships may be inevitable in any work environment. But there's a difference between an occasional disagreement and persistent abuse.",
      "\u201cWhat makes something toxic: it\u2019s more pervasive, more consistent over time,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said. \u201cYou may have tried some things and it\u2019s not getting better. ... It\u2019s very deeply entrenched.\u201d",
      "Possible indications of an emotionally harmful workplace include a widespread lack of trust and fear of being shot down if you speak up, she said.",
      "Loud screamers aren't the only kind of toxic co-workers and supervisors. There are quieter forms of toxicity, such as passive-aggressive behavior by leaders who use sarcasm, backhanded compliments, indirect criticism and exclusion to control their employees, according to Alana Atchison, a clinical psychologist based in Chicago.",
      "\u201cIt is a relationship where you can\u2019t communicate clearly or directly, so you have to silence yourself. You can\u2019t say truly what you need to say and feel safe,\u201d Atchison said.",
      "To spot a potentially toxic environment when applying for a new job, follow your gut instincts and consider warning signs. For example, frequent ads for the same position may reflect high turnover resulting from a negative environment. You can also search employee reviews online.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading Glassdoor reviews like crazy to see what the environment is like, what the culture is like, on anyplace I\u2019m applying to, because I can\u2019t lose my hair again over a job,\u201d said Grouette, who recently was laid off after several successful years at the newspaper.",
      "When on the receiving end of toxicity, consider whether the offending behavior says more about the person perpetuating it than the recipient.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a smokescreen to hide their deficits,\u201d Atchison said. \u201cIf someone feels insecure about their role or fears being overshadowed, they might resort to undermining others, gossiping or sabotaging projects to regain a sense of control or safety.\u201d",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Atchison's clients have increasingly complained about toxic work environments. She attributes that in part to the social isolation that accompanied lockdowns and restrictions on public activities.",
      "\u201cSocializing is a skill set, and that skill set has declined,\" she said.",
      "If you find yourself in a toxic work situation, talking about it with a trusted friend or professional therapist can help you process what is happening and develop a plan to deal with it, instead of letting it fester in your mind.",
      "Stephanie Strausser, 42, a video production manager, said she sought support from friends and family members when she worked under an extreme micromanager who made her feel unsafe and whose decisions she considered unethical.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t hide it or keep it in. Talk to people. Even if you\u2019re talking to ChatGPT,\" Strausser advises those who find themselves in similar circumstances. \"Don\u2019t internalize it. And don\u2019t take someone\u2019s perception as fact.\u201d",
      "Amanda Szmuc, a Philadelphia lawyer who considers some of her past work environments to have been toxic, recommends documenting your concerns in case it becomes necessary to escalate them.",
      "Writing down the details of troubling interactions as they happen and keeping copies of inappropriate messages or approved meeting recordings may come in handy if the human resources department gets involved, for example.",
      "Maintaining a record may also help you avoid gaslighting and reinforce your determination to protect yourself.",
      "If leaving a toxic environment isn't financially possible or you want to try to make your circumstances more bearable, think about exploring ways to limit your interaction with the difficult party may be an option.",
      "Possibilities may include negotiating a role that puts distance between you and the toxic person, such as working different shifts or on different projects, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "You can also set deadlines for yourself to keep things from deteriorating, according to Szmuc. Examples: \u201cI\u2019m going to give this two weeks. Is there any improvement?\u201d she said. \u201cIs there a way internally where I can maybe change my circumstances or get someone else\u2019s opinion?\u201d",
      "Ideally, an employee who feels mistreated could appeal to someone from human resources or the offending employee's manager with evidence to show a pattern of conduct violations and disciplinary action would be taken, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "But that doesn't always happen, leaving the reporting party in close proximity with the person they reported. \u201cIn the real world, you may realize they are unlikely to go anywhere, and it\u2019s you who has to go somewhere,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "In extreme situations, it's best to look for another job, she said.",
      "If an inspector found radon in your house, \u201cyou wouldn't say, \u2018Let me try to work with the radon,\u2019 or \u2018How can I keep it there but maybe lessen the effects?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYou would get the toxin out of the situation or you would get yourself out of the situation.\u201d",
      "Most people can't afford to leave their jobs without another one lined up. Carving out time to apply for different jobs is difficult when you feel under assault but also is empowering and may lead to a better situation.",
      "\u201cIf somebody gives you an impression that you\u2019re not able to leave this job, that\u2019s just not true,\u201d Grouette said. \u201cThose sorts of people don\u2019t have the reach or respect that they claim to have, because if they\u2019re volatile to you, they\u2019re volatile to others.\u201d",

      "Missouri lawmakers have approved a referendum seeking to repeal an abortion-rights amendment passed by voters six months ago",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Six months after Missouri voters approved an abortion-rights amendment, Republican state lawmakers on Wednesday approved a new referendum that would seek the amendment's repeal and instead ban most abortions with exceptions for rape an incest.",
      "The newly proposed constitutional amendment would go back to voters in November 2026, or sooner, if Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election before then.",
      "Republican senators used a series of rare procedural moves to cut off discussion by opposing Democrats before passing the proposed abortion-rights revision by a 21-11 vote. The measure passed the Republican-led House last month.",
      "Immediately after the vote, protestors erupted with chants of \u201cStop the ban!\u201d and were ushered out of the Senate chamber.",
      "The Senate then blocked further Democratic debate and gave final approval to a separate measure repealing provisions of a voter-approved law guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers and cost-of-living increases to the minimum wage. That measure does not go back to the ballot. It will instead become law when signed by Kehoe, who has expressed his support for it.",
      "After taking the sweeping votes, the Senate effectively ended its annual legislative session \u2014 two days ahead of a constitutional deadline to wrap up work.",
      "Democrats were outraged by the legislative actions and vowed to retaliate by slowing down any Senate work next year.",
      "\u201cOur rights are under attack,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Brian Williams said during debate. He accused Republicans of \u201ctrying to overturn the will of the voters.\u201d",
      "Republicans contend they are simply giving voters a second chance on abortion \u2014 and are confident they will change their minds because of the new rape and incest exceptions.",
      "\u201cAbortion is the greatest tragedy in the world right now,\u201d Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman said while explaining her efforts to repeal the abortion-rights amendment. If someone's fine with \u201ctaking the life of an innocent, then probably you can justify whatever you want.\u201d",
      "Some GOP lawmakers said they needed to repeal the paid sick leave requirement, which kicked in May 1, because it's adding costs that threaten the financial viability of small businesses. Republicans had been negotiating with Democrats over an alternative to exempt only the smallest businesses before scrapping that and opting for the full repeal.",
      "Missouri lawmakers have a history of altering voter-approved policies. They previously tried to block funding for a voter-approved Medicaid expansion and authored changes to voter-approved measures regulating dog breeders and legislative redistricting.",
      "Missouri's abortion policies have swung dramatically in recent years.",
      "When the U.S. Supreme Court ended a nationwide right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, it triggered a Missouri law to take effect banning most abortions. But abortion-rights activists gathered initiative petition signatures to reverse that.",
      "Last November, Missouri voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy. The amendment also allows later abortions to protect the life or health of pregnant women and creates a \u201cfundamental right to reproductive freedom\u201d that includes birth control, prenatal and postpartum care and \u201crespectful birthing conditions.\u201d",
      "A limited number of surgical abortions have since occurred in Missouri, but medication abortions remain on hold while Planned Parenthood wrangles with the state over abortion regulations.",
      "The new measure seeks to repeal the abortion-rights amendment and instead allow abortions only for a medical emergency or fetal anomaly, or in cases of rape or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. It also would prohibit gender transition surgeries, hormone treatments and puberty blockers for minors, which already are barred under state law.",
      "Polling indicates \u201cthat most voters are opposed to most abortions in Missouri but do want to allow for abortions with limited exceptions,\u201d said Sam Lee, director of Campaign Life Missouri.",
      "The ballot title that voters will see doesn't explicitly mention repealing Amendment 3. Instead, it says the new measure would \u201censure women's safety during abortions, ensure parental consent for minors\" and \u201callow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest.\u201d It also states that it will \u201cprotect children from gender transition,\u201d among other provisions.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Tracy McCreery called the measure \u201can attempt to mislead and lie to the voters,\u201d echoing similar accusations that Republicans had made against the original Amendment 3.",
      "An abortion-rights coalition that includes Planned Parenthood affiliates, the American Civil Liberties Union and others planned a rally Thursday at the Missouri Capitol and vowed a vigorous campaign against the measure.",
      "\u201cAbortion rights won in this state six months ago, and mark my words: Missourians will protect reproductive freedom again,\u201d said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes.",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of what are known as forever chemicals in drinking water",
      "On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.",
      "The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.",
      "President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.",
      "Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:",
      "PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation\u2019s air, water and soil.",
      "They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.",
      "The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.",
      "Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable \u2013 resistance to breakdown \u2013 make them hazardous to people.",
      "PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.",
      "There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.",
      "The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.",
      "The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.",
      "It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration\u2019s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.",
      "For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to meet them.",
      "Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can't legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.",
      "\u201cThe law is very clear that the EPA can\u2019t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,\u201d said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.",
      "Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration's underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.",
      "\u201cHowever, EPA\u2019s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,\u201d the industry group said.",
      "Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA's decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.",
      "Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "They did, however, get an extension.",
      "\u201cThis gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,\u201d said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy wanted an assurance from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. before he would vote to put him in charge of the nation's $1.7 trillion health department.",
      "Kennedy's history of promoting conspiracy theories or misspeaking about vaccines alarmed Cassidy, he said during a confirmation hearing earlier this year.",
      "So, the Louisiana senator asked: \"Can I trust that that is now in the past?\"",
      "Kennedy didn't give a direct answer that day. Now three months into the job, however, Kennedy's habit of casting doubts on vaccines has returned in interviews on television shows, public speeches and social media posts.",
      "Kennedy will make his first appearance as health secretary before Cassidy\u2019s powerful Senate health committee on Wednesday, when he's expected to face intense scrutiny about the thousands of job he's eliminated at the Department of Health and Human Services, the steep cuts he's made to vaccination campaigns and his response to a measles outbreak that\u2019s sickened 1,000 people.",
      "He will speak about the agency\u2019s budget request for the year, which includes a $500 million boost for his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative to promote nutrition and healthier lifestyles. The proposed budget also makes deep cuts, including to infectious disease prevention, maternal health and preschool programs.",
      "The secretary plans to \"share his vision on how HHS\u2019 transformation will improve health outcomes, eliminate redundancies to save the American taxpayer, and streamline operations to improve efficiency and service,\u201d HHS said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s supporters, meanwhile, have viewed his first three months in the job as a successful delivery of \u201cMAHA\u201d agenda items: He's pressured food companies to ditch artificial dyes, promised to study the cause of autism, vowed to reverse fluoride recommendations and earned buy-in from several Republican governors to ban soda from the food stamp program, for example.",
      "But many eyes and ears will be on Kennedy's dialogue with Cassidy, who extracted a number of guarantees from Kennedy about his approach to vaccines. Those included promises to keep the current childhood vaccination schedule, use the current vaccine monitoring system and not remove statements that say vaccines do not cause autism on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.",
      "\u201cI will watch carefully for any effort to wrongfully sow public fear about vaccines between confusing references of coincidences and anecdote,\u201d Cassidy said earlier this year, after voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination.",
      "Kennedy has since delivered a mixed message on vaccines that public health experts have said are hampering efforts to contain the measles outbreak. He's offered endorsements of vaccinations but continued to raise questions about their efficacy or safety. He's said the childhood vaccine schedule will be examined in a study of autism's causes. He\u2019s called the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine \u2014 a shot given to children to provide immunity from all three diseases \u2014 \u201cleaky,\u201d although it offers lifetime protection from the measles for most people. He's also said they cause deaths, although none has been documented among healthy people.",
      "At the agency, too, he's made moves that support the anti-vaccine movement. He hired a man who has published research that suggests vaccines cause developmental delays to oversee a study on autism. And he's terminated some research and public health funds dedicated to vaccines.",
      "Kennedy, who has rejected the anti-vaccine label, has regularly said that he is \u201cpro-safety\" and wants more research on vaccines, although decades of real-world use and research have concluded they safely prevent deadly diseases in children.",
      "\u201cHis longstanding advocacy has always focused on ensuring that vaccines, and other medical interventions, meet the highest standards of safety and are supported by gold-standard science,\u201d HHS said in a statement. \u201cAs he did during confirmation, Secretary Kennedy is prepared to address questions surrounding this topic.\u201d",

      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A judge on Tuesday ordered the restoration of a health monitoring program for coal miners in West Virginia and rescinded layoffs the federal government implemented in a unit of a small U.S. health agency.",
      "U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed against Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services by a coal miner who was diagnosed with a respiratory ailment commonly known as black lung disease.",
      "Nearly 200 workers at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health facility in Morgantown were told last month that their jobs were being terminated as part of restructuring within Health and Human Services. Berger ordered that jobs be restored within NIOSH's respiratory health division in Morgantown, although her ruling didn't specify a number. The division is responsible for screening and reviewing medical exams to determine whether there is evidence that miners have developed black lung.",
      "Federal law mandates that regular health screenings be made available to coal miners. Those diagnosed with black lung also are given the option to transfer to other positions in a mine to protect them from continued dust exposure without a pay reduction.",
      "Berger said the defendants \u201clack the authority to unilaterally cancel\u201d the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program within NIOSH. She ordered both the surveillance and job transfer programs to be restored, saying that \u201cthere be no pause, stoppage or gap in the protections and services\" mandated by the federal Mine Safety and Health Act.",
      "Poisonous silica dust has contributed to the premature deaths of thousands of mine workers from black lung disease. Plaintiff Harry Wiley, a West Virginia mine electrician who has worked in coal mines for 38 years, was diagnosed with early-stage black lung last November.",
      "Canceling the health surveillance program would \"cost lives,\u201d Berger wrote. \u201cRemaining in a dusty job may reduce the years in which Mr. Wiley can walk and breathe unassisted, in addition to hastening his death. It is difficult to imagine a clearer case of irreparable harm.\u201d",
      "The judge gave Kennedy 20 days to show the federal government is complying with her order.",
      "An email seeking comment from Health and Human Services wasn't immediately returned Tuesday night.",
      "Wiley's attorney, Sam Brown Petsonk, said the preliminary injunction \u201chad to happen, and the public, I think, understands the absolute necessity of this program. It cannot be hindered. It cannot be whittled away. It\u2019s essential because it saves the lives of some of he hardest-working people in this entire world.\u201d",

      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has signed a bill into law to make Maryland the first state to use money collected from a surcharge on insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act to pay for an abortion grant program",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland will become the first state to use money collected from a surcharge on insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act to fund a program to pay for abortions, regardless of a patient's insurance coverage, under a measure signed into law Tuesday by Democratic Gov. Wes Moore.",
      "The law will make about $25 million available when it takes effect July 1, because a $1 surcharge has been unused and growing over the last 15 years since the ACA took effect in 2010. It's estimated to make about $3 million available annually in future years.",
      "\u201cThe lieutenant governor and I were very clear from Day 1 \u2014 that Maryland will always be a safe haven for abortion access,\u201d Moore said, highlighting the measure among SOME 170 bills signed at a ceremony.",
      "The program will be paid for through the transfer of certain insurance premium funds collected by carriers that can only be used for abortion coverage in accordance with the ACA. Supporters say other states have access to a similar surplus of funds through their state exchange insurance systems.",
      "\u201cIf programs like ours are duplicated across the country, we could help millions of Americans access essential abortion care \u2014 without relying on taxpayer dollars,\u201d said Del. Lesley Lopez, a Democrat from Maryland's Montgomery County, in the suburbs of the nation's capital.",
      "Officials in New York and Illinois already have reached out to Maryland officials to learn more about the program, said Lopez, who sponsored the bill.",
      "A dozen states require abortion coverage in ACA marketplace plans, according to KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. They are California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.",
      "\u201cThis money exists in every state that has abortion as a required type of care under their state\u2019s benefit exchanges,\" Lopez said. \"It\u2019s basically all the blue states that mandated abortion be covered when the Affordable Care Act was starting to be implemented.\u201d",
      "The law creates a grant program fund in the state's health department to improve access to abortion clinical services. It requires the department to award grants to nonprofit organizations to support equitable access.",
      "Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund, which helps pay costs associated with abortion for people who live in Maryland or who travel there, said it\u2019s hard to keep up with an annual budget of about $2 million.",
      "\u201cWe would need many, many more times over that to fully be able to meet the full logistic and medical support for each caller,\u201d she said.",
      "She said the $3 million that would be made available annually under the new law could make a major difference. The fund could apply to administer a share of that money.",
      "\u201cThe $3 million is a great start, but it will take more than that and it will take sustained funding,\u201d she said.",
      "Maryland's legislature is controlled by Democrats, who hold a 2-1 advantage over Republicans in voter registration statewide. Last year, Maryland voters approved a constitutional amendment with 76% support to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution, in response to the 2022 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. The court's decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization gave control over abortion to the states.",
      "\u201cI think before the Dobbs decision, there just wasn\u2019t quite the same type of urgency as there is now,\" Lopez said. \"We\u2019ve seen abortion bans in some form or another in double digits in states across the country, so we\u2019ve got to make sure that we shore up all the support we can in a state like Maryland that has it as a constitutionally protected right.\u201d",
      "Twelve states currently enforce abortion bans with limited exceptions at all stages of pregnancy. Four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The Dobb decision and an influx of people from other states seeking abortions in Maryland has made the financial need more urgent, supporters of the law say.",
      "Maryland has been seeing an increase in patients from other states where abortion has been banned. Last year, 15% of abortions in Maryland were obtained by patients from other states, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. That's a decrease from 20% in 2023.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. health officials say they plan to phase out fluoride-containing supplements used to strengthen children\u2019s teeth, citing possible health risks",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health regulators announced plans Tuesday to phase out fluoride-containing supplements sometimes used to strengthen children\u2019s teeth, opening a new front in Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s effort against a mainstay of dental care.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said it will conduct a scientific review of the products by late October with the aim of removing them from the market. It was not immediately clear whether the agency planned to formally ban the supplements or simply request that companies withdraw them.",
      "The products targeted by the FDA are sometimes recommended for children and teens who are at increased risk of tooth decay or cavities because of low fluoride in their local drinking water. They usually require a prescription from a pediatrician or dentist. Fluoride-based tablets and lozenges are designed to be chewed or swallowed. Companies also sell drops for babies and infants.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the products pose a risk when swallowed by children because they may interfere with healthy gut bacteria that are critical to digestion, immunity and other key bodily functions. He also referenced studies showing possible associations between excess fluoride intake and other problems, including decreased IQ.",
      "Previous reviews by public health experts and dental professionals have not shown any serious health risks with the products.",
      "As state and local governments begin removing fluoride from their water, the need for supplemental fluoride is expected to grow.",
      "Officials in Utah \u2014 the first U.S. state to ban fluoride from drinking water \u2014 recently made fluoride supplements available without a prescription.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1962, the agency set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d tied to a range of health dangers. Last month, he announced a task force to scrutinize fluoride's use, while at the same time saying he would order the CDC to stop recommending it.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program concluded that drinking water with more than twice the CDC\u2019s recommended level was associated with lower IQs in kids. The study was based on research conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico.",
      "\u201cEnding the use of ingestible fluoride is long overdue,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Tuesday. \"This decision brings us one step closer to delivering on President Trump\u2019s promise to Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "An influential government health panel recommends fluoride supplements for children between the ages of six months and 5 years if they live in areas with low fluoridation levels. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Forces judged the recommendation to have \u201chigh certainty\u201d of benefit, based on the available evidence.",
      "A 2010 paper from the American Dental Association recommended supplemental fluoride for children up to 16 years old who are at high risk of cavities. The recommendation was based on a review of studies across different age groups. The most common side effect associated with the products is spotting or discoloration of the teeth, caused by extra fluoride.",
      "The FDA regulates most dental products, including fluoride-containing toothpastes, supplements, mouthwashes and rinses.",
      "In recent weeks those products have increasingly been targeted with lawsuits and legal actions.",
      "Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced an investigation into the marketing of fluoride toothpastes by Colgate-Palmolive and Proctor and Gamble. A press release from his office described the companies' promotions as \u201cmisleading, deceptive and dangerous.\u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- California's governor called upon the state's cities and counties to ban homeless encampments this week, even providing blueprint legislation for dismantling the tents lining streets, parks and waterways throughout much of the state.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, made homelessness a priority of his administration when he took office in 2019. It had previously been an issue primarily for mayors and other local officials, but Newsom pumped money into converting old motels into housing and launched other initiatives to tackle the issue.",
      "Still, he has repeatedly called out cities and counties to do their part, and on Monday, he unveiled draft language that can be adopted by local governments to remove encampments. Here is what to know:",
      "Newsom\u2019s model ordinance includes prohibitions on \u201cpersistent camping\u201d in one location and encampments blocking sidewalks and other public spaces. It asks cities and counties to provide notice and make every reasonable effort to identify and offer shelter before clearing an encampment.",
      "Organizations representing California's cities and counties balked at the suggestion that they are to blame for street conditions. They say they need dedicated, sustained funding over multiple years for permanent projects instead of sporadic, one-time funding.",
      "Carolyn Coleman, executive director and CEO of the League of California Cities, said that eight in 10 cities have policies to address encampments but they need money to address the root causes of homelessness, such as more housing.",
      "The California State Association of Counties said the state has not provided as much money to address homelessness as it says it has and that half of the money has gone to housing developers.",
      "Studies have shown that encampment bans and other punitive measures make it even harder for people to find stable housing and work, said Alex Visotzky with the National Alliance to End Homelessness.",
      "People may lose critical documents or lose contact with a trusted case manager, forcing them to start all over again.",
      "In Los Angeles, Jay Joshua watches over a small encampment in which he also lives. He says encampments can be a safe space for those living there.",
      "Major cities with Democratic mayors have already started cracking down on encampments, saying they present a public health and safety hazard.",
      "In San Francisco, new mayor Daniel Lurie vowed to clean up city sidewalks. In San Jose, Mayor Matt Mahan has proposed arrests if a person refuses shelter three times.",
      "Newsom can't make cities and counties adopt an encampment ban.",
      "But the proposed encampment legislation was paired with an announcement of $3.3 billion in grant money for facilities to treat mental health and substance abuse disorders, suggesting that he could condition state funding on compliance.",
      "In 2022, he paused $1 billion in state money for local government, saying that their plans to reduce homelessness fell short of the acceptable.",

      "A listeria outbreak linked to ready-to-eat sandwiches and snacks has sickened at least 10 people in the U.S., and a producer is voluntarily recalling dozens of products sold to retail stores, hospitals, hotels, airports and airlines, federal officials said.",
      "The products were made by Fresh & Ready Foods LLC and were sold in Arizona, California, Nevada and Washington.",
      "Those who fell ill and were hospitalized were in California and Nevada. The outbreak has been simmering for many months: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said cases date to December 2023.",
      "Listeria poisoning is caused by a particularly resilient type of bacteria that can survive and grow even during refrigeration. About 1,600 people are infected with it \u2014 and 260 die \u2014 each year in the U.S., according to the CDC.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know:",
      "The voluntary recall covers more than 80 specific products distributed between April 18 and April 25. The products have \u201cUse By\u201d dates from April 22 to May 19.",

      "Federal officials say anyone with the products should throw them away or return them. They also suggest cleaning any surfaces that touched the recalled foods.",
      "Listeria bacteria thrive in moist environments, including soil and water and decaying vegetation and are carried by some animals.",

      "When the bacteria get into a food processing plant, they can be tough to eradicate.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's plan to change the pricing model for some medications is already facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he's even signed the executive order set for Monday that, if implemented, could lower the cost of some drugs.",
      "Trump has promised that his plan \u2014 which is likely to tie the price of medications covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor\u2019s office to the lowest price paid by other countries \u2014 will significantly lower drug costs.",
      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the Republican president posted on social media on Sunday, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "But the nation's leading pharmaceutical lobby on Sunday pushed back, calling it a \u201cbad deal\u201d for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs.",
      "\u201cImporting foreign prices will cut billions of dollars from Medicare with no guarantee that it helps patients or improves their access to medicines,\u201d Stephen J. Ubl, the president and CEO of PhRMA, said in a statement. \u201cIt jeopardizes the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America, making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines.\u201d",
      "Trump's so-called \u201cmost favored nation\u201d approach to Medicare drug pricing has been controversial since he first tried to implement it during his first term. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry has argued that Trump\u2019s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \u201cupper hand\u201d in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.",
      "It's likely that Trump's executive order Monday will only impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, the insurance for doctor\u2019s office visits. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor\u2019s visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.",
      "A report by the first Trump administration found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "Trump has played up the announcement, saying it will save taxpayers big money.",
      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "But many Americans won't see the savings.",
      "Trump's proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office \u2014 think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring billions of dollars in savings to the government \u2014 not necessarily the \u201cTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u201d Trump boasted about in his post.",
      "Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both major political parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.",
      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump\u2019s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn\u2019t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced for much of the world.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very big announcement to make \u2014 like as big as it gets,\u201d Trump said last week.",
      "He came into his first term accusing pharmaceutical companies of \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d and complaining that other countries whose governments set drug prices were taking advantage of Americans.",
      "On Sunday, Trump took aim at the industry again, writing that the \u201cPharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the \u2018suckers\u2019 of America, ALONE.\u201d",
      "Referring to drug companies\u2019 powerful lobbying efforts, he said that campaign contributions \u201ccan do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party.\u201d",

      "The negotiations have reached the \u201cexpert\u201d level, meaning the sides are trying to reach agreement on the details of a possible deal. But a major sticking point remains Iran\u2019s enrichment of uranium, which Tehran insists it must be allowed to do and the Trump administration increasingly insists the Islamic Republic must give up.",
      "President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Earlier on Friday, Trump said Iran received a proposal during the talks, though he did not elaborate.",
      "During his trip to region this week, Trump at nearly every event insisted Iran could not be allowed to obtain a nuclear bomb, something U.S. intelligence agencies assess Tehran is not actively pursuing, though its program is on the cusp of being able to weaponize nuclear material.",
      "Mohammad Eslami, the head of Iran\u2019s atomic organization, stressed the peaceful nature of the program, saying it is under \u201ccontinuous\u201d monitoring by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, state TV reported Saturday.",
      "\u201cNo country is monitored by the agency like us,\u201d Eslami said, adding that the agency inspected the country\u2019s nuclear facilities more than 450 time in 2024. \u201cSomething about 25% of all the agency inspections\u201d in the year.",
      "Meanwhile, Israel routinely has threatened to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities if it feels threatened, further complicating tensions in the Mideast already spiked by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.",

      "Madrid's international airport has for months been the site of homeless encampments amid a growing housing crisis in Spain, where rental costs have risen especially fast in the country's capital and also in Barcelona",
      "MADRID -- Every morning at 6 a.m., Teresa sets out in search of work, a shower and a bit of exercise before she returns home. For around six months, that has been Terminal 4 of Madrid\u2019s international airport.",
      "Teresa, 54, who didn\u2019t want her full name to be used because of safety concerns, is one of the estimated hundreds of homeless people sleeping in the Spanish capital\u2019s airport amid a growing housing crisis in Spain, where rental costs have risen especially fast in cities like Madrid, the country's capital, and Barcelona.",
      "She and others sleeping at Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid-Barajas Airport \u2014 the third-busiest airport in Europe in 2023, according to Eurostat \u2014 described a situation where for months, authorities have neither helped them find other living arrangements nor have they kicked them out from the corners of the airport that they have occupied with sleeping bags unfurled on the floor as well as blankets, shopping carts and bags.",
      "Soon, things could change.",
      "Spain\u2019s airport operator AENA this week said that it would start limiting who can enter Madrid\u2019s airport during low-travel hours by asking visitors to show their boarding passes. AENA said that the policy would take effect in the next few days, but didn't specify exactly when. It said that exceptions would be made for airport workers and anyone accompanying a traveler.",
      "Teresa, a Spanish-Ecuadorian who said she has lived in Spain for a quarter-century, told The Associated Press on Thursday that she hadn't heard of the new policy. She and her husband would be forced to sleep outside on park benches and other public spaces if they aren\u2019t allowed back in.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t make demands. We\u2019re squatters,\u201d Teresa said, using a controversial term common in Spain. \u201cSquatters in what is private property. We are aware of that. We want help from authorities, but not a single one has come here.\u201d",
      "For months, a political blame game between officials at different levels of government has meant that the homeless encampments in the airport have largely gone unaddressed. In recent weeks, videos on social media and news reports of the airport's homeless population put a spotlight on the issue.",
      "Madrid\u2019s city council on Thursday said that it had asked Spain\u2019s national government to take charge and come up with a plan to rehabilitate every homeless individual sleeping in the airport. Spanish airports are overseen by AENA, a state-owned publicly listed company. A city council spokesperson said that Madrid's city government had recently called for a meeting with officials from AENA, the regional government of Madrid and several national ministries that declined.",
      "\u201cWithout them, there is no possible solution,\u201d said Luc\u00eda Mart\u00edn, a spokesperson for Madrid\u2019s city council division of social policies, family and equality. She said that the national ministries of transport, interior, inclusion, social rights and health declined to participate in a working group.",
      "A day earlier, AENA accused Madrid\u2019s city authorities of providing inadequate help and said that the city government's statements about the unfolding situation confirmed its \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d and abandonment of the airport\u2019s homeless individuals.",
      "\u201cIt's like a dog chasing its tail,\u201d said Marta Cecilia C\u00e1rdenas of the long list of authorities she was told could help her. C\u00e1rdenas, a 58-year-old homeless woman originally from Colombia, said that she had spent several months sleeping in Madrid's airport.",
      "It\u2019s not known how many people are sleeping in Madrid\u2019s airport, through which 66 million travelers transited last year. Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds newspaper reported that a recent count taken by a charity group identified roughly 400 homeless people in the airport, many of whom, like Teresa, had previously lived in Madrid and were employed in some capacity.",
      "AP wasn't able to confirm that number. Madrid city council officials, meanwhile, said that the Spanish capital's social service teams had helped 94 individuals in April with ties to the city, 12 of whom were rehabilitated into municipal shelters, addiction treatment centers or independent living.",
      "Teresa said she had heard about sleeping in the airport by word of mouth. Before she lost her job, she said she lived in an apartment in Madrid\u2019s Legan\u00e9s neighborhood, earning a living taking care of older people.",
      "She currently earns 400 euros ($450) per month, working under the table caring for an older woman. With the earnings, Teresa said she maintains a storage unit in the neighborhood that she used to live in. Though the work is sporadic, she said it was still enough to also cover fees for the gym in which she showers daily, pay for transportation, and purchase food.",
      "Over the last decade, \u200bthe average rent in Spain has almost doubled, according to real estate website Idealista, with steeper increases in Madrid and Barcelona. Spain also has a smaller public housing stock than many other European Union countries.",
      "Teresa said that she hopes to find a job soon and leave the airport, whatever authorities may force her to do in the coming days and weeks. She and her husband keep to themselves, avoiding others sleeping in the brightly-lit hallway dotted with sleeping bags who were battling mental health problems, addiction and other issues, she said.",
      "\u201cYou end up adjusting to it a bit, accepting it even, but never getting used to it,\u201d Teresa said over the constant din of airline announcements. \u201cI hope to God that it gets better, because this is not life.\u201d",

      "Norwegian chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen is playing a single game against 140,000 people worldwide",
      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 Norwegian grandmaster Magnus Carlsen is playing a single game of chess against 140,000 people worldwide in a mega-match that could overturn expectations by ending in a draw in the next few days.",
      "Billed as \u201cMagnus Carlsen vs. The World,\u201d the online match began April 4 on Chess.com, the world\u2019s largest chess website, and is the first-ever online freestyle game to feature a world champion.",
      "While Chess.com had predicted Carlsen would win by a wide margin, his Team World opposition could force a draw if it checks Carlsen\u2019s king three times.",
      "\u201cRight now we\u2019re heading towards a draw by perpetual check,\" Carlsen said in a statement on Friday. \u201cI felt that I was a little bit better, early in the opening, then maybe I didn\u2019t play that precisely. Honestly, since then, they haven\u2019t given me a single chance. So now, I think, it\u2019s just heading towards the draw.\u201d",
      "He added: \"Overall, \u2018the world\u2019 has played very, very sound chess from the start. Maybe not going for most enterprising options, but kind of keeping it more in vein with normal chess -- which isn\u2019t always the best strategy, but it worked out well this time,\u201d",
      "As a freestyle match, the bishops, knights, rooks, queen and king are randomly shuffled around the board while the pawns remain in their usual spots. Freestyle chess is popular because it allows players to be more creative and avoid memorization.",
      "Team World votes on each move, and each side has 24 hours to make their play. Carlsen is playing the white pieces.",
      "\u201cFor most of the world, it is their first chance to say they\u2019ve played a chess game against Magnus Carlsen,\u201d Mike Klein, senior journalist with Chess.com, told The Associated Press. \u201cI think \u2018the world\u2019 is going to be kind of tickled pink to be able to say, \u2019I was part of a draw against Magnus Carlsen.\u2019\u201d",
      "Klein has played, and lost, to Carlsen twice in blitz matches in a hotel bar when the Norwegian was bored during some downtime in a world championship.",
      "\u201cHe beat me twice without much effort, so I would have happily signed up for a draw in any of those games,\u201d Klein said.",
      "A grandmaster at 13, Carlsen enjoys celebrity status that few other chess players have.",
      "The 34-year-old became the world\u2019s top-ranked player in 2011 and has won five World Championships. He achieved the highest-ever chess rating of 2882 in 2014 and has remained the undisputed world number one for more than a decade.",
      "Last year, he garnered headlines for quitting a tournament in New York after refusing to change out of the jeans he wore to the competition. He later accepted a $200 fine and officials agreed to loosen the dress code.",
      "Carlsen auctioned the jeans off for charity and donated the winning $36,100 bid to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, a national youth-mentoring charity that carries out its mission through local chapters across 5,000 communities nationwide.",
      "This is the third \u201cvs. The World\u201d record-setting online game.",
      "In 1999, Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov played against more than 50,000 people on the Microsoft Network.",
      "A few top-ranked players helped steer the world's moves, but Kasparov won after four months and hailed it as \u201cthe greatest game in the history of chess.\u201d",
      "Klein was a summer camp chess teacher at the time. \u201cWe would start class each day by checking out Kasparov\u2019s next move and talking about it and spending a few minutes each morning deciding what we\u2019d reply.\u201d",
      "Indian grandmaster Viswanathan Anand won his \u201cvs. The World\u201d match last year against nearly 70,000 players on Chess.com.",
      "The goal of the Carlsen match was to break Anand\u2019s 70,000-player mark, and ended up doubling it.",

      "The veneration of Virgin Mary is central to Catholics, from popes to the ordinary faithful",
      "GENAZZANO, Italy -- Pope Leo XIV closed his first public blessing as pontiff with a Hail Mary, after invoking the feast day of Our Lady of Pompei. On his first papal trip, he went to the Sanctuary of Our Mother of Good Counsel in the medieval village of Genazzano and on the drive back stopped to pray by Pope Francis\u2019 tomb in the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome.",
      "That\u2019s just three of a myriad Virgin Marys around the world, whose veneration is central to Catholics from the pope to the ordinary faithful. Even many of the less-than-devout know what it means to throw a Hail Mary.",
      "The month of May is dedicated to Marian celebrations, so here\u2019s a look at the history and traditions about Mary and why praying to her means so much to so many.",
      "According to the Gospel, Mary is the mother of Jesus \u2014 and the mystery of the incarnation of the son of God through her is central to Christian dogma.",
      "The oldest title for Mary is precisely \u201cmother of God,\u201d or Theotokos in the original Greek. It was chosen after heated theological debate in the first centuries of Christianity.",
      "St. Mary Major is the oldest still-standing sanctuary dedicated to that, said Giuseppa Falanga, professor of liturgy at Pontificia Universita della Santa Croce in Rome. It was built on one of Rome\u2019s hills in the 5th century \u2014 according to tradition, because of the pope\u2019s dream and an August snowfall there on what is now also celebrated as the day of Our Lady of the Snows.",
      "There are three major categories of titles for Mary \u2014 first, those related to dogma and major events in her life.",
      "The Assumption on Aug. 15, for instance, celebrates Mary being taken body and soul into heaven. It's marked by Masses and religious festivals but also the peak of summer holidays for faithful and atheists alike in countries such as Italy and Greece, where all but the most essential work grinds to a halt on that feast day.",
      "Then there are titles related to apparitions. In December, millions gather in Mexico, and across the Americas, to celebrate the Virgin of Guadalupe who, according to church tradition, appeared to an Indigenous man in 1531. Millions more visit the sanctuaries in Fatima, Portugal, and in Lourdes, France, other sites of apparitions in the past few centuries.",
      "And then there are titles based on what pilgrims and faithful want \u2014 from Good Counsel to protection (the many \u201cGuard\u201d Marys ) to Star of the Sea, invoked by seafarers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like there\u2019s a Mary for everything,\u201d said Kayla Harris, professor and director of Marian Library at University of Dayton in Ohio.",
      "It\u2019s also why the rosary is one of the most widely used prayers \u2014 including publicly for the pope \u2014 and why popular devotions to the Virgin Mary, including processions and festivals, are so central to Christianity, Falanga said.",
      "How Mary is represented, however, varies greatly across time and places, Harris added.",
      "There are \u201cBlack\u201d Virgin Marys \u2014 dark-skinned paintings and statues like Brazil\u2019s much beloved Virgin of Aparecida. In rare icons, she\u2019s represented pregnant or as an older woman.",
      "She\u2019s either portrayed alone or, most often, holding the baby Jesus, as in the Genazzano 15th century painting, a close-up of the two faces with Jesus' fingers holding his mother\u2019s neck. Mary looking at Jesus makes a theological point, too \u2014 inviting worshippers to fix their gaze on Christ, not her.",
      "In fact, according to the Catechism, Catholics are to give Mary special veneration, but not worship her \u2014 something reserved for God alone, Falanga said.",
      "It\u2019s that relatability as a mother figure that makes Mary so universally appealing as an intercessor before God, Harris said.",
      "Since the 19th century, May has been devoted to the Virgin Mary \u2014 though already in Greek and Roman times, goddesses of fertility were celebrated in this month of springtime blooming, she added.",
      "Mother\u2019s Day is also celebrated in May in many countries, including Italy and the United States \u2014 and it coincided with Leo\u2019s first public Sunday blessing at noon, a time for another traditional daily invocation to the Virgin Mary.",
      "Two mothers who went to morning Mass on a recent weekday at the Genazzano chapel \u2014 where the Mary icon stands \u2014 said they pray their children, ranging in age from 18 to 24, will keep the faith.",
      "\u201cThe Madonna has been holding my hand since I was a child,\u201d said Anastasia Galizia, who grew up in the village and witnessed Leo\u2019s visit. \u201cI ask her how to love her son and I pray for conversion, for me, for my family and for the whole world.\"",
      "At the Basilica of St. Augustine in Rome, which is served by Augustinians \u2014 Leo\u2019s religious order \u2014 there are two popular prayer spots for mothers. One is a sculpture known as the \u201cLabor Madonna\u201d where expecting mothers go; the other is a chapel with the relics of St. Monica, St. Augustine\u2019s mother, who prayed incessantly for his conversion.",
      "\u201cWe welcome a lot of moms, who come to pray to St. Monica for their children, who have walked away from the faith, and they ask the Lord for the gift to touch their hearts,\u201d said the Rev. Pasquale Cormio, the basilica\u2019s rector.",

    "story": [
      "Young men who once lived the \u201cgangster life\u201d in Kenya's capital have become farmers with a social mission",
      "MATHARE, Kenya -- Joseph Kariaga and his friends once lived the \u201cgangster life\u201d in Nairobi\u2019s Mathare slum, snatching phones, mugging people and battling police. But when Kariaga's brother was shot dead by police, the young men took stock.",
      "\u201cWe said, 'We cannot live like this. We are going to lose our lives.\u2019 Many of our friends had died,\u201d said Kariaga, now 27. \u201cI reflected on my life. I had to change.\u201d",
      "Now the men are farmers with a social mission. Nearly a dozen of them founded Vision Bearerz in 2017 to steer youth away from crime and address food insecurity in one of Kenya\u2019s poorest communities.",
      "Despite challenges, Vision Bearerz makes a modest but meaningful community impact, including feeding over 150 children at lunches each week. Some residents praise the group and call the men role models.",
      "Amid cuts to foreign funding by the United States and others, experts say local organizations like this may be the future of aid.",
      "Vision Bearerz works on an urban farm tucked away in the muddy streets and corrugated-metal homes that make up Mathare, one of Africa's most populous slums. Estimates say about a half-million people live in this neighborhood of less than two square kilometers.",
      "Some 2 million people, or 60% of Nairobi\u2019s population, live in informal settlements, according to CFK Africa, a non-governmental organization that runs health and poverty reduction programs in such neighborhoods and is familiar with Vision Bearerz' work.",
      "Lack of infrastructure is a key challenge in these communities, which are growing amid sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s rapid urbanization and booming youth population, said Jeffrey Okoro, the group\u2019s executive director.",
      "Poverty pushes youth into crime, Okoro added.",
      "\u201cMost folks in slums such as Mathare are not able to earn enough to buy a decent meal, and kids who are under 5 are twice as likely to be malnourished,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the other major challenges affecting young people is gangs, and the promise of making a quick buck.\u201d",
      "The farmers of Vision Bearerz know this well.",
      "\u201cWhen you are born from this land, there is not much you have inherited, so you have to make it yourself,\u201d said Ben Njoki, 28, whose face tattoos are reminders of a gang-affiliated past. \u201cYou have to use violence.\u201d",
      "In 2017, not long after Kariaga\u2019s brother was killed, Njoki and other young men made a plan to change. More than a dozen people they grew up with had been killed, and they realized they would follow if they did not find an alternative to crime, said Moses Nyoike, 32, the chair of Vision Bearerz.",
      "To keep busy, the group began collecting garbage and would split profits from trading vegetables, buying produce in another county and reselling it locally. They noticed a gap in the supply of vegetables to Mathare, and with permission from authorities they cleaned up a garbage dump and began planting.",
      "Polluted soil, and water rationing, made it a tough start. Then, inspired by a TikTok account that showcased farming in a Colombian slum, Vision Bearerz tried their hand at hydroponics. With the help of an NGO that supports community enterprises, Growth4Change, they were able to get materials and training in urban farming methods.",
      "Today, Vision Bearerz grows vegetables, raises pigs and farms tilapia in a small pond. They sell a portion of what they produce, with revenue also coming from running a car wash and public toilet.",
      "With the earnings, the group buys maize flour to make ugali, a dough-like staple food, and beans, which supplement produce from their farm in weekly lunches for children.",
      "Vision Bearerz also runs outreach programs to warn against drug use and crime, and has sessions where women teach girls about feminine health.",
      "\u201cThe life I was living was a lie. It didn\u2019t add up to anything. We just lost people. Now, we are winning people in the community,\u201d Njoki said.",
      "Davis Gichere, 28, another founding member, called the work therapeutic.",
      "Challenges remain. Joining Vision Bearerz requires a pledge to leave crime behind, and there have been instances of recidivism, with at least one member arrested. Lingering criminal reputations have led to police harassment in the past, and finding money to buy food for Saturday feedings is a weekly struggle.",
      "Funding cuts across the development space, including the dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development, make the prospect of new financing dim.",
      "At least one other group in Nairobi\u2019s Kibera slum, Human Needs Project, does similar work of urging youth away from crime and addressing food insecurity through urban farming.",
      "It's a model that can be scaled up or copied elsewhere, said Okoro of CFK Africa.",
      "\u201cThe future of development is locally led organizations,\" he said, noting they are best suited to understanding the needs of their communities.",
      "Kariaga still feels the pain of his brother\u2019s death, but is proud of his new job.",
      "\u201cFarming can change the world,\u201d he said, a silver-capped tooth glinting in the sun.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Since U.S.-brokered talks began in March, Ukraine\u2019s strategy has been to convince the Trump administration that Vladimir Putin is unreliable and that Kyiv is serious about peace.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has few options, analysts and officials say, but to draw U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s ire against Putin, while depending on Europe\u2019s united and stalwart support.",
      "In the latest round, Zelenskyy not only accepted Putin's offer to hold direct talks in Turkey, after the U.S. endorsed the idea, but raised the stakes and challenged the Russian leader to a face-to-face. The gesture failed to move Putin and the Istanbul talks were demoted to a technical meeting Friday that failed to yield substantial results on ending the war.",
      "The U.S. has expressed frustration with the stalled talks and threatened to withdraw if results aren\u2019t achieved. On Friday, Trump told reporters after boarding Air Force One to return to Washington from Abu Dhabi that he may call Putin soon.",
      "\u201cHe and I will meet, and I think we\u2019ll solve it, or maybe not,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAt least we\u2019ll know. And if we don\u2019t solve it, it\u2019ll be very interesting.\u201d",
      "All along, Zelenskyy's message, directed at the Trump administration, has been: The Russian leader cannot be trusted.",
      "It's a rhetorical game of pingpong in which both Kyiv and Moscow try to outmaneuver the other vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. But the political theatrics are underscored by stark realities on the ground. In this war of attrition against Russia's invasion, Ukraine\u2019s position is poised to grow weaker as time goes on, unless powerful sanctions are imposed against Moscow and the U.S. continues arms deliveries.",
      "\u201cHe is in a difficult situation because behind him is a whole nation of people who are suffering,\u201d said Oleksandr Merezkho, a lawmaker in Zelenskyy\u2019s party. \u201cWe are playing (along), we are trying to do everything we can because we don\u2019t want to lose the support of the U.S. We don\u2019t want to be accused that it was our fault.\u201d",
      "Putin\u2019s no-show did not result in a strong reaction from Trump, which frustrated Ukrainian officials.",
      "\u201cIt looks surreal, weird when Ukraine is complying to everything required from us, and Putin ignores, rejects,\u201d said Merezhko. \u201cIt looks very imbalanced, it looks unfair for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Since March, Zelenskyy has made a point of showing Ukraine's willingness to acquiesce to U.S. demands to avoid alienating Trump, his most powerful ally.",
      "Kyiv hoped Russia\u2019s unwillingness to do the same would, in time, provoke the U.S. to unleash powerful sanctions and cripple Moscow\u2019s war machine \u2014 the most likely scenario in which Ukraine can hope to weaken Russia and negotiate an advantageous peace deal, analysts said.",
      "Russia\u2019s position has remained mostly consistent. The Kremlin kept repeating that it was ready for peace talks with Ukraine \u2014 while making demands that were politically untenable for Zelenskyy, and would require Ukraine to make territorial concessions, neutralize its army and vow never to join NATO.",
      "Throughout the war, Moscow has also accused Kyiv and its Western allies of seeking to prolong the fighting and derailing peace efforts.",
      "Most recently, the Kremlin pushed back against a proposed 30-day ceasefire, countering with two brief unilateral ones, and then accused Ukraine of failing to stop the fighting, painting it as unwilling to silence the guns. At the same time, Russian officials underscore the effort to resolve the conflict is complex.",
      "\u201cWe understand that Washington wants to achieve quick success in this process, but at the same time we hope that there is an understanding that the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis is too complicated, there are many questions and details that need to be addressed before the settlement,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters last month.",
      "Ukraine is asking for an unconditional temporary ceasefire, during which time future diplomatic talks can take shape. Zelenskyy also asked for a trust-building gesture, such as the release of prisoners of war, something the two sides agreed to Friday. The exchange of 1,000 prisoners would be their largest swap yet.",
      "But Ukraine has also maintained flexibility in its negotiating position by accepting Trump's proposals to avoid alienating the U.S. president.",
      "\u201cThey're desperate to keep the Americans on their side,\u201d said Balazs Jarabik, an analyst specializing in Eastern Europe and Ukraine.",
      "In March, Kyiv agreed to the U.S. proposal for an immediate 30-day ceasefire, which Putin effectively rejected by imposing conditions impossible for Ukraine. In April, Kyiv signed a landmark minerals deal sought by Trump after months of fraught negotiations and a brief pause in military aid.",
      "That is why agreeing to send a delegation to Istanbul, after Trump supported the idea, was a risky move for Zelenskyy. It played into Putin\u2019s aim of drawing Kyiv into talks that had been stalled since the early weeks of Moscow's 2022 invasion.",
      "\u201cWe showed that we are for peace negotiations and support Trump\u2019s plan,\" said Mykola Davydiuk, a Ukrainian political scientist. \u201cNow the ball is with Trump.\u201d",
      "Despite verbal threats from Europe and the U.S., sanctions of the kind that could devastate Russia\u2019s energy sector have not been forthcoming.",
      "Zelenskyy has expressed support for a sanctions package pushed in the U.S. Congress by Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham that could impose 500% tariffs on Russian energy imports. Graham has said he has enough support in the House to bring the sanctions bill to the floor.",
      "For now, Zelenskyy has few options but to continue to highlight Putin\u2019s disinclination to engage in meaningful talks and keep the U.S. engaged.",
      "\u201cIf it turns out that the Russian delegation really is just theatrical and can\u2019t deliver any results today, the world must respond,\u201d the Ukrainian leader said at a European summit in Albania on Friday. \u201cThere needs to be a strong reaction, including sanctions against Russia\u2019s energy sector and banks. Pressure must continue to rise until real progress is made.\u201d",
      "For Ukrainian soldiers fighting along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line the theatricality of the week\u2019s political developments stood in harsh contrast with the grinding war.",
      "\u201cBetter to call it a circus,\u201d said a Ukrainian drone operator with the 68th brigade who, like other soldiers, gave only his call sign Goose in line with military protocol.",
      "Analysts say Russia is at a crucial crossroads in the war, where it can negotiate a truce and consolidate gains, or launch a summer military campaign to maximize wins before the onset of winter.",
      "Ukraine has always been at a disadvantage and faces manpower and ammunition shortages. Analysts have offered estimates of six months to two years for how much longer it can hang on.",
      "Much will depend on what kind of support Ukraine receives from partners and how quickly the country can scale up domestic weapons production.",
      "Russian forces recently intensified offensive operations in the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, according to Ukraine\u2019s Southern Defense Forces spokesperson. Soldiers said Russia has a clear aim of reaching the borders of the Dnipropetrovsk region, to be able to claim the capture of two out of four partially occupied territories.",
      "\u201cThe feeling is that we will either hold out and allow the political leadership of the country to freeze the conflict along the contact line, or the enemy will break through,\u201d said a Ukrainian soldier with the call sign Corsair Denis in the Sumy region.",

      "LA PAZ, BOLIVIA -- Hundreds of supporters of ex-President Evo Morales marched toward Bolivia's top electoral court on Friday to push for their leftist leader's candidacy in presidential elections later this year, a rally that descended into street clashes as police tried to clear out a group of demonstrators.",
      "The confrontations come in response to a ruling by Bolivia\u2019s Constitutional Court that blocks Morales, the nation's first Indigenous president who governed from 2006 until his ouster in 2019, from running again in Aug. 17 elections. The turmoil escalates political tensions as Bolivia undergoes its worst economic crisis in four decades.",
      "As the march arrived in Bolivia\u2019s capital of La Paz, protesters seeking to register Morales\u2019 candidacy surged toward the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, chanting, \u201cComrades, what do we want? For Evo to come back!\u201d",

      "The court's unanimous decision Wednesday upheld an earlier ruling that bans presidents from serving more than two terms. Morales has already served three, and, in 2019, resigned under pressure from the military and went into exile as protests erupted over his bid for an unprecedented fourth term.",
      "Morales returned to Bolivia a year later as the 2020 elections vaulted to power his preferred candidate, President Luis Arce, from his long-dominant Movement Toward Socialism party.",
      "Arce, who announced earlier this week that he would not seek re-election, insisted that the Constitutional Court had disqualified Morales, his mentor-turned-rival, from running in 2025.",
      "But many experts doubt the legitimacy of that decision in a country where political conflicts undermine the courts and presidents have maneuvered to get their allies on the bench.",
      "\u201cThe Constitutional Court issues unconstitutional arbitrary rulings at the whim of those in power,\u201d said Morales, who himself reaped the benefits of favorable judges while seeking to run for a fourth consecutive term in 2017.",
      "After Morales lost a referendum seeking to do away with term limits while still in power, the Constitutional Court ruled it would be against Morales\u2019 human rights to stop him from running for another term.",

      "In defiance of the latest court ruling, Morales called a mass march that marshaled his loyal supporters in the rural tropics. They long have championed the Indigenous coca-grower for transforming the country during his tenure \u2014 redistributing Bolivia\u2019s natural gas wealth and seeking greater inclusion for its Indigenous majority.",

      "PANAMA CITY -- Dozens of boats carrying around 200 people, mostly farmers waving Panamanian flags, traveled along the country's central Indio River on Friday to protest a planned reservoir in the Panama Canal intended to solve water shortages in the waterway that have threatened international trade flow.",
      "The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) says building the reservoir is the best way to provide an additional water source for over 2 million people in Panama City and to ensure the canal operates efficiently in the coming decades.",
      "The canal, which needs around 189 million liters (50 million gallons) of freshwater for each ship crossing, faced severe water shortages in 2023 due to lack of rain, forcing authorities to cut crossings by 20% and delay traffic. The proposed reservoir, which would take four years and $1.6 billion to build, could allow 12 to 13 more ship crossings per day and support new water treatment facilities being built, authorities say.",
      "But protesters say building the reservoir using the Indio River, in the canal's watershed, would also force 2,000 people to be relocated from their homes because their communities would be flooded. Other areas downstream could also be affected by reduced river flow.",
      "Iris Gallardo, a teacher from the Guasimo community and a member of the \u201cNo to Reservoirs\u201d movement, was among the group of mostly farmers waving Panamanian flags.

They said the project would also offer jobs to communities and that the resettlement plan is being developed with the community.",

      "Petroperu told AP in a written statement that several companies were interested in Block 64 but withdrew at the last minute due to internal strategic shifts, not external pressure.",
      "The company denied that Indigenous opposition played a role, asserting that local communities support oil development and are urging operations to begin. It also said that the block has the required community approval \u2014 known as a social license \u2014 which is seen as crucial for multinational oil and gas projects to proceed without conflict.",
      "Since 1995, Indigenous groups have strongly opposed oil development in the area, blocking multiple companies due to environmental and rights concerns. In 2022, Petroperu took control of Block 64, which known as an oil concession where the government has granted rights to explore and extract oil within a specific territory.",
      "\u00a8It's been a fight ever since the Peruvian state granted the concession without consultation or consent (from Indigenous communities),\u00a8 Bisa Tirko said. \u00a8For more than 25 years, we have been fighting and resisting to defend our right to live in a healthy and balanced environment.\u00a8",
      "The outcome underscores the mounting legal, environmental and reputational risks deterring investors from Amazon oil development.",
      "Andrew Miller, advocacy director at Amazon Watch, an organization that works to protect the rainforest, says strong local opposition has deterred several multinational oil companies from developing Block 64 since 1995. He said that pollution from other oil blocks has harmed other communities in the Amazon.",
      "\"The history of their sister Indigenous communities in neighboring oil blocks is poisoned water sources, social division and impoverishment,\" Miller said. \u201cEach day the oil doesn\u2019t flow is a day they can still use the rivers for their sustenance, as they always have.\u201d",
      "Miller says despite multinational companies having invested tens of millions of dollars in past attempts to develop Block 64, none have seen a return, suggesting the industry now sees it as a costly financial dead end. Despite this, he believes the Peruvian government will keep searching for a way to encourage development of Block 64.",

      "However, Western sanctions imposed on the country during the Assad dynasty\u2019s rule have posed an obstacle to development and reconstruction projects.",
      "Earlier this week, during a regional tour during which he met with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would move to lift the sanctions, clearing the way for investments in Syria.",

A win could help position Retailleau for an eventual tilt at the French presidency in 2027, when Macron's second and last term ends.",

      "Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas on Thursday determined that the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission exceeded its statutory authority when the agency issued guidance to employers against deliberately using the wrong pronouns for an employee, refusing them access to bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, and barring employees from wearing dress code-compliant clothing according to their gender identity because they may constitute forms of workplace harassment.",

It followed a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination.",
      "Texas and the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025, in August challenged the guidance, which the agency says serves as a tool for employers to assess compliance with anti-discrimination laws and is not legally binding.

Today, thanks to the great state of Texas and the work of my Heritage colleagues, a federal judge said: not so fast.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThis ruling is more than a legal victory. It\u2019s a cultural one. It says no \u2014 you don\u2019t have to surrender common sense at the altar of leftist ideology. You don\u2019t have to pretend men are women. And you don\u2019t have to lie to keep your job. \u201d",

This decision does not change the law, but it will make it harder for LGBTQIA+ workers to enforce their rights and experience a workplace free from harassment.\u201d",

      "After two investigations, The Associated Press said it found no definitive evidence to warrant stripping Ut's photo credit. The AP said it was possible Ut took the picture, but the passage of time made it impossible to fully prove, and could find no evidence to prove anyone else did.",
      "World Press Photo said its probe found that two other photographers \u2014 Nguyen Thanh Nghe, the man mentioned in \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d and Huynh Cong Phuc \u2014 \u201cmay have been better positioned\u201d to take the shot.",
      "\u201cWe conclude that the level of doubt is too significant to maintain the existing attribution,\u201d said Joumana El Zein Khoury, executive director of World Press Photo. \u201cAt the same time, lacking conclusive evidence pointing definitively to another photographer, we cannot reassign authorship, either.\u201d",
      "World Press Photo, an organization whose awards are considered influential in photography, won't attempt to recover the cash award given to Ut, a spokeswoman said.",
      "Ut's lawyer, James Hornstein, said his client hadn't spoken to World Press Photo after some initial contact before \u201cThe Stringer\u201d was released. \u201cIt seems they had already made up their mind to punish Nick Ut from the start,\u201d he said.",
      "Gary Knight, a producer of \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d is a four-time judge of the World Press Photo awards and a consultant to the World Press Photo Foundation.",
      "The AP said Friday that its standards \u201crequire proof and certainty to remove a credit and we have found that it is impossible to prove exactly what happened that day on the road or in the (AP) bureau over 50 years ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe understand World Press Photo has taken different action based on the same available information, and that is their prerogative,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere is no question over AP's ownership of the photo.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Pulitzer Prize that Ut won for the photo appears safe. The Pulitzers depend on news agencies who enter the awards to determine authorship, and administrator Marjorie Miller \u2014 a former AP senior editor \u2014 pointed to the AP\u2019s study showing insufficient proof to withdraw credit. \u201cThe board does not anticipate future action at this time,\u201d she said Friday.",

      "Between collections resuming, courts challenging student loan programs and layoffs in the Education Department, borrowers might be confused about the status their student loans",
      "NEW YORK -- Between collections resuming, courts blocking student loan programs and layoffs at the Education Department, borrowers might be confused about the status of their student loans.",
      "Recently, the Education Department announced it would start involuntary collections on defaulted loans, meaning the roughly 5.3 million borrowers who are in default could have their wages garnished by the federal government.",
      "At the center of the turmoil are the government's income-driven repayment plans, which reduce monthly payments for borrowers with lower incomes. Those plans were temporarily paused after a federal court blocked parts of the plans in February.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much confusion, they\u2019ve made it very complicated,\u201d said Natalia Abrams, president and founder of the Student Debt Crisis Center.",
      "At the same time, some borrowers are struggling to get their loan servicers on the phone, making it hard to find answers to their questions, said Abrams.",
      "If you're a student loan borrower, here are some answers to your questions.",
      "Applications for income-driven repayment plans are open, but they're taking longer than usual to process.",
      "The applications were temporarily shut down earlier this year after a federal court in Missouri blocked the SAVE plan, a Biden administration plan that offered a faster path to loan forgiveness. The judge's order also blocked parts of other repayment plans, prompting the Education Department to pause income-driven applications entirely.",
      "Amid pressure from advocates, the department reopened the applications on May 10.",
      "Borrowers can apply for the following income-driven plans: the Income-Based Repayment Plan, the Pay as You Earn plan and the Income-Contingent Repayment plan.",
      "Abrams expects applications will continue to be approved but at a slower pace than before the application pause.",
      "Borrowers currently enrolled in an income-driven plan should be receiving notifications about recertification, said Khandice Lofton, counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Recertification is required annually to update information on family size and income, and dates are different for each borrower.",
      "To review income-driven repayment plans, you can check the loan simulator at studentaid.gov.",
      "Borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan have been placed in administrative forbearance while a legal challenge is resolved. That means they don't have to make payments and interest is not accruing. Time in forbearance normally does not count toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "The Education Department will notify borrowers with updates on payments and litigation.",
      "\"We don't know for sure when the SAVE forbearance is going to end,\" Abrams said.",
      "While the future of the SAVE plan is decided in court, Abrams encourages borrowers to explore their eligibility for other income-driven repayment plans.",
      "The online application for loan consolidation is available again, at studentaid.gov/loan-consolidation. If you have multiple federal student loans, you can combine them into one with a fixed interest rate and a single monthly payment.",
      "The consolidation process typically takes around 60 days to complete. You can only consolidate your loans once.",
      "It would be difficult for the Education Department to reinstate loans that were canceled during President Joe Biden's administration. So far, it isn't believed to be happening, Abrams said.",
      "Nothing has changed yet.",
      "President Donald Trump wants to change the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to disqualify workers of nonprofit groups deemed to have engaged in \u201cimproper\u201d activities. He signed an executive order to that effect, but it has yet to be enforced.",
      "Borrowers enrolled in PSLF should keep up with payments to make progress toward loan forgiveness, said Sarah Austin, policy analyst at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.",
      "\u201cThere could be some changes coming in regards to PSLF but at this current time PSLF is still functioning and there is still loan forgiveness being processed under the PSLF provision,\u201d said Austin.",
      "An income-driven repayment tracker has disappeared from the federal student loan website for many borrowers, said Abrams. For keeping track of their status, Abrams is recommending that borrowers take screenshots of their payments.",
      "Contacting your loan servicer is crucial to managing and understanding your student loans. Due to the large number of people trying to get answers or apply for programs, loan servicers are taking longer than usual to respond.",
      "Abrams recommends borrowers prepare for long wait times.",
      "\u201cWe've heard borrowers being in hold for three or four hours, then being transferred to a supervisor and then being hung up on, after all that wait time. It's incredibly frustrating,\u201d Abrams said.",
      "If you're delinquent, try to get back on track. Borrowers who don't make their payments for 270 days go into default, which has severe consequences.",
      "\u201cIf you're delinquent but have not defaulted yet, do whatever you can do to avoid going default,\u201d said Kate Wood, a student loans expert at NerdWallet.",
      "Borrowers who are delinquent on their student loans take a massive hit on their credit scores, which could drop 100 points or more, Wood said. A delinquency stays on your credit report for seven years.",
      "Wood recommends contacting your servicer to ask for options, which can include forbearance, deferment or applying for an income-driven repayment plan.",
      "The Education Department is recommending borrowers visit its Default Resolution Group to make a monthly payment, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan or sign up for loan rehabilitation.",
      "Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute for Student Loan Advisors, recommends loan rehabilitation.",
      "Borrowers in default must ask their loan servicer to be placed into such a program. Typically, servicers ask for proof of income and expenses to calculate a payment amount. Once a borrower has paid on time for nine months in a row, they are taken out of default, Mayotte said. A loan rehabilitation can only be done once.",

      "Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, maker of blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy, says its CEO is stepping down",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk A/S, maker of blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy, said Friday its CEO was stepping down by \u201cmutual agreement\u201d with the company's board of directors, citing \u201crecent market challenges\u201d and a steep decline in the company's share price.",
      "Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen's departure comes a week after the company downgraded its sales and profits forecast, and follows a more than 50% decline in the company's shares since mid-2024.",
      "The company said May 7 that Wegovy sales in the U.S. had been undercut by cheaper replica drugs produced by so-called compounding pharmacies using active ingredients of patented drugs in case of shortage. The Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. drug regulator, has said however that the shortages have eased and the replicas will have to cease in the coming months.",
      "On Sunday a study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine showing people lost more weight using competitor drug Zepbound, made by Eli Lilly of Indianapolis. The study, the first head-to-head comparison of the two, was funded by Lilly. Novo Nordisk's share price is down 54% from its peak in June 2024. Its U.S.-listed shares fell another 3% in premarket trading Friday.",
      "The company, headquartered in Bagsvaerd, Denmark, praised a \u201csignificant growth journey and transformation\u201d led by Jorgensen during his eight years as CEO.",
      "\u201cThe changes are, however, made in light of the recent market challenges Novo Nordisk has been facing, and the development of the company\u2019s share price since mid-2024,\u201d the company said in a statement. The board and Jorgensen \u201chave jointly concluded that initiating a CEO succession is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.\u201d",
      "Jorgensen will continue as CEO \u201cfor a period\u201d to support a smooth transition.",

      "Premchai Karnasuta, the president of Italian-Thai Development Co, the main Thai contractor for the building project, as well as designers and engineers were among 17 charged with the felony of professional negligence causing death, Bangkok deputy police chief Noppasin Poonsawat said.",
      "Noppasin said those who met police on Friday formally denied the charges. Several have previously issued public denials in response to allegations in the media.",
      "Ninety-two people were confirmed dead in the rubble of the building that had been under construction and a small number of other people remain unaccounted for. The building, which was to become a new State Audit Office, was the only one in Thailand to collapse in the earthquake that was centered in neighboring Myanmar. The search for victims at the site has been halted, though efforts to identify remains through DNA will continue.",
      "Noppasin said at a news conference that evidence and testimony from experts suggested the building plan did not meet standards and codes. The Bangkok Post newspaper said police had also determined the project showed \"structural flaws in the core lift shaft and substandard concrete and steel.\u201d",
      "Thai media have reported allegations of wrongdoing in the project almost every day since the building\u2019s collapse, many of them involving irregular documentation for the project. Their reports have highlighted the role of Italian-Thai\u2019s Chinese joint venture partner, the China Railway No. 10 company, which is involved in projects around the world.",
      "One of the 17 charged Friday was Chinese executive Zhang Chuanling, a director at China Railway No. 10\u2019s joint venture with Italian-Thai Development. He was previously arrested last month on a charge of violating Thai business law by wrongly using Thai nominees to serve as the Chinese firm\u2019s proxies to allegedly control the joint venture. Three Thai executives were also arrested on the charge.",
      "A Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for the 17 on the negligence charge on Thursday. Noppasin said 15 turned themselves in at a police station in the morning and the remaining two were expected to do so later Friday.",
      "The epicenter of the quake was in central Myanmar, where it killed more than 3,700 people and caused major damage in Mandalay, the country's second biggest city, and the capital Naypyitaw.",
      "Premchai\u2019s case is his second major tangle with the law. In 2019, he was convicted of wildlife poaching and served about three years in prison.",
      "He was found guilty of killing protected animals and illegal possession of weapons after park rangers found a hunting party at a wildlife sanctuary in 2018 with carcasses of a rare black panther, a kalij pheasant and a barking deer. The panther had been butchered and its meat cooked for soup.",

      "The European Union\u2019s growth is forecast to remain the same this year as it was last year \u2014 just 1%, the report said, citing weaker net exports and higher trade barriers. The United Kingdom\u2019s economic growth of 1.1% last year is projected to fall to 0.9%.",
      "Weakening trade, slowing investments and falling commodity prices are also forecast to erode growth in other major developing economies, including Brazil, Mexico and South Africa.",

      "Nonetheless, Mukherjee said, resolving uncertainties would help individuals and businesses move forward with economic decisions and that would have a positive impact on the global economy.",

      "Much like its creator, Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok was preoccupied with South African racial politics on social media this week, posting unsolicited claims about the persecution and \u201cgenocide\u201d of white people",
      "Much like its creator, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok was preoccupied with South African racial politics on social media this week, posting unsolicited claims about the persecution and \u201cgenocide\u201d of white people.",
      "The chatbot, made by Musk's company xAI, kept posting publicly about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in response to users of Musk's social media platform X who asked it a variety of questions, most having nothing to do with South Africa.",
      "One exchange was about streaming service Max reviving the HBO name. Others were about video games or baseball but quickly veered into unrelated commentary on alleged calls to violence against South Africa\u2019s white farmers. Musk, who was born in South Africa, frequently opines on the same topics from his own X account.",
      "Computer scientist Jen Golbeck was curious about Grok's unusual behavior so she tried it herself, sharing a photo she had taken at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show and asking, \u201cis this true?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe claim of white genocide is highly controversial,\" began Grok's response to Golbeck. \"Some argue white farmers face targeted violence, pointing to farm attacks and rhetoric like the \u2018Kill the Boer\u2019 song, which they see as incitement.\u201d",
      "The episode was the latest window into the complicated mix of automation and human engineering that leads generative AI chatbots trained on huge troves of data to say what they say.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even really matter what you were saying to Grok,\u201d said Golbeck, a professor at the University of Maryland, in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt would still give that white genocide answer. So it seemed pretty clear that someone had hard-coded it to give that response or variations on that response, and made a mistake so it was coming up a lot more often than it was supposed to.\"",
      "Musk and his companies haven\u2019t provided an explanation for Grok's responses, which were deleted and appeared to have stopped proliferating by Thursday. Neither xAI nor X returned emailed requests for comment Thursday.",
      "Musk has spent years criticizing the \u201cwoke AI\u201d outputs he says come out of rival chatbots, like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, and has pitched Grok as their \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d alternative.",
      "Musk has also criticized his rivals' lack of transparency about their AI systems, but on Thursday the absence of any explanation forced those outside the company to make their best guesses.",
      "\u201cGrok randomly blurting out opinions about white genocide in South Africa smells to me like the sort of buggy behavior you get from a recently applied patch. I sure hope it isn\u2019t. It would be really bad if widely used AIs got editorialized on the fly by those who controlled them,\u201d prominent technology investor Paul Graham wrote on X.",
      "Graham's post brought what appeared to be a sarcastic response from Musk's rival, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.",
      "\u201cThere are many ways this could have happened. I\u2019m sure xAI will provide a full and transparent explanation soon,\u201d wrote Altman, who has been sued by Musk in a dispute rooted in the founding of OpenAI.",
      "Some asked Grok itself to explain, but like other chatbots, it is prone to falsehoods known as hallucinations, making it hard to determine if it was making things up.",
      "Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has regularly accused South Africa\u2019s Black-led government of being anti-white and has repeated a claim that some of the country\u2019s political figures are \u201cactively promoting white genocide.\u201d",
      "Musk's commentary \u2014 and Grok's \u2014 escalated this week after the Trump administration brought a small number of white South Africans to the United States as refugees Monday, the start of a larger relocation effort for members of the minority Afrikaner group as Trump suspends refugee programs and halts arrivals from other parts of the world. Trump says the Afrikaners are facing a \u201cgenocide\u201d in their homeland, an allegation strongly denied by the South African government.",
      "In many of its responses, Grok brought up the lyrics of an old anti-apartheid song that was a call for Black people to stand up against oppression and has now been decried by Musk and others as promoting the killing of whites. The song's central lyrics are \u201ckill the Boer\u201d \u2014 a word that refers to a white farmer.",
      "Golbeck believes the answers were \u201chard-coded\u201d because, while chatbot outputs are typically very random, Grok's responses consistently brought up nearly identical points. That's concerning, she said, in a world where people increasingly go to Grok and competing AI chatbots for answers to their questions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a space where it\u2019s awfully easy for the people who are in charge of these algorithms to manipulate the version of truth that they\u2019re giving,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really problematic when people \u2014 I think incorrectly \u2014 believe that these algorithms can be sources of adjudication about what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t.\u201d",

      "The National Travel and Tourism Office released preliminary figures Thursday showing the number of airline and ship passengers who entered the country last month using business visas.",
      "The Middle East was the only region that saw higher business travel to the U.S., with arrivals up 9.4% compared to April 2024. But that didn't make up for big losses from other regions; the number of business travelers from Western Europe fell 17.7%, for example.",
      "The new government data didn't include people coming from Canada for business or who traveled by land from Mexico. Mexican arrivals by air for those holding business visas were down 11.8%, the government said.",
      "And overall travel from Canada also fell in April. According to Statistics Canada, Canadian residents' return trips by air from the U.S. fell 20% in April, while return trips by car were down 35%.",
      "Business travel to the U.S. held up better than leisure travel in the first quarter of the year. According to U.S. government data, more than 1.2 million travelers entered the U.S. using business visas in the January-March period, up 7% from the year before. The number of travelers using tourist visas fell 6%.",
      "But that flipped in April, as the late Easter holiday likely encouraged more leisure travel. Travel to the U.S. by international travelers holding tourist visas was up 13.8% in April.",
      "It's unclear if that trend will hold. Cirium, an aviation analytics company, said an analysis of online travel agency data indicated that advance bookings from Europe to 14 U.S. cities in June, July and August were down 12% from those same months last year.",
      "Multiple U.S. airlines have pulled their financial forecasts for the year, citing uncertainty and weaker demand from lower-fare leisure travelers. Many industry experts think business travel to the U.S. will continue to decline in the coming months.",
      "Leslie Andrews, the global travel leader for real estate company JLL and a board member at the Global Business Travel Association Foundation, said she thinks corporate travel to the U.S. will slow in the second and third quarters of the year as the full impact of economic and geopolitical volatility sets in.",

      "Haggarty, who owns a company that sells gifts and souvenirs, said Canadian retailers no longer want U.S.-made merchandise. His U.S. suppliers are struggling to stay afloat due to U.S. tariffs on products made in China. Above all, he\u2019s concerned about reports of international travelers being detained at the U.S. border.",
      "\u201cHonestly, my nervousness and reluctance to cross into the U.S. stems from that more than any hostility to the American market,\u201d said Haggarty, who lives in Halifax, Nova Scotia.",
      "Global Business Travel Association CEO Suzanne Neufang said a poll of more than 900 of the association\u2019s members last month showed nearly one-third expected a decline in global travel volumes this year.",
      "Canadian members were the most pessimistic, with 71% saying they expect a decrease in travel this year, Neufang said.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty is unnerving for a business travel sector that likes to be safe and likes to be efficient,\u201d she said.",
      "A drop-off in business trips would represent a setback for the U.S. travel industry and cities that host international conventions and trade shows. The $1.6 trillion global business travel sector was finally returning to normal after the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. business travel spending reached pre-COVID levels in 2023, Neufang said, while the rest of the world achieved that last year.",
      "Brett Sterenson, the president of Hotel Lobbyists, a Washington firm that helps groups book hotels for meetings and conferences, said he was losing international business as some countries warn travelers not to visit the U.S.",
      "U.S. government cuts are also hurting business, Sterenson said. He works with several groups that offer international exchange programs through the State Department. The programs welcome travelers from Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and elsewhere and share best practices on things like energy policy and environmental stewardship, he said. But with funding cuts, that part of his business is down 75%.",
      "\u201cThese exchanges were monumentally useful in spreading goodwill, but also in educating developing nations on good governance,\u201d Sterenson said.",
      "Haggarty, in Canada, said he canceled a trip to a trade show in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and said several retailers he works with also pulled out. He\u2019s now looking to England, France, Spain and other markets for goods to sell.",

      "Sales at retail stores and restaurants rose just 0.1% in April from March, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That is much lower than the previous month's 1.7% gain, which reflected a surge in car sales as consumers sought to get ahead of President Trump's 25% duty on auto imports that went into effect this month.",
      "Last month's tiny increase after the March surge makes it harder to get a clear read on consumer spending trends and reflects the ongoing turmoil and uncertainty in the economy in the wake of Trump\u2019s stop-and-go tariff policies. Many publicly-traded companies have withdrawn or held off on the traditional practice of forecasting their revenues and earnings for the rest of this year because the economic landscape has become so chaotic.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans are increasingly gloomy about the economy\u2019s prospects, according to sentiment surveys, but it's not yet evident whether that will translate into reduced spending and slower economic growth.",
      "In April, sales were flat or down for many retailers: They plunged 2.5% at sporting goods stores, which saw prices jump last month, according to the government's inflation report earlier this week. Sales dropped 0.4% at clothing stores, while they ticked down 0.2% at health and personal care stores and slipped 0.1% at auto dealers.",
      "Gas station sales dropped 0.5%, even as prices declined 0.1%. The figures aren't adjusted for price changes.",
      "Still, there were signs that at least some Americans were willing to spend. Sales at restaurants and bars jumped a healthy 1.2% last month, a sign many consumers boosted their discretionary spending.",
      "And sales at home and garden centers jumped 0.8%, the biggest gain since 2022, which suggests Americans are pursuing more home renovations as elevated mortgage rates cooled home sales.",
      "Trump imposed sky-high tariffs on imports from China last month that fueled fears of a recession, higher inflation, and even the specter of empty shelves by the winter holidays. But on Monday the U.S. and China announced a deal that sharply reduced the duties, partly assuaging those concerns.",
      "Retailers still face a lot of uncertainty around tariffs and how shoppers will react to higher prices after several years of sharply rising costs.",

      "Also Thursday, retail giant Walmart said its sales grew at a solid pace in the quarter ended April 30, as their customers stepped up purchases of groceries, toys, automotive goods and kid\u2019s clothes. Yet profits slipped and CEO Doug McMillon said the company would soon raise prices to offset the impact of tariffs.",
      "Retailers and importers had largely stopped shipping shoes, clothes, toys, and other items when the duties were so high, raising worries about empty shelves for the key back-to-school and holiday seasons. But many are now scrambling to resume shipping their goods from China while there is a pause in the trade war.",
      "While many retailers and suppliers are relieved with the reduced tariffs, they still face a lot of hurdles. For one, they\u2019re bracing for higher costs for shipping and freight as competition heats up to get their goods on shipping containers.",
      "San Francisco resident Elenor Mak, whose company Jilly Bing manufactures Asian American dolls in China, said she feels some relief that she has a more realistic path forward but the challenges are far from over.",
      "Mak is talking to her factories to see whether her dolls can be produced in time for the winter holidays, but she fears she will be at the back of the production line because she is a small business.

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. applications for jobless benefits held steady last week as layoffs remain low despite uncertainty over how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs will impact the economy.",
      "The number of Americans applying for unemployment aid was unchanged at 229,000 for the week ending May 10, the Labor Department said Thursday. That\u2019s in line with the 230,000 new applications analysts forecast.",
      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are seen as representative of U.S. layoffs and have mostly bounced around a healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000 since COVID-19 ravaged the economy and wiped out millions of jobs five years ago.",
      "Even though Trump has paused or rolled back many of his tariff threats, concerns remain about a global economic slowdown that could upend the U.S. labor market, which has been a pillar of the American economy for years.",
      "Last week, the Federal Reserve held its benchmark lending rate at 4.3% for the third straight meeting after cutting it three straight times at the end of last year.",
      "Fed chair Jerome Powell said the risks of both higher unemployment and inflation have risen, an unusual combination that complicates the central bank\u2019s dual mandate of controlling prices and keeping unemployment low.",
      "Powell said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment but that data has not yet shown significant harm to the economy.",
      "Also on Thursday, the government reported that inflation at the wholesale level fell unexpectedly in April for the first time in more than a year. However, new retail sales data showed that Americans pulled back their spending in April after stocking up on goods the month before to get ahead of expected price increases due to tariffs.",
      "On Monday, the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day pause in their trade war, giving financial markets a boost and at least temporarily relieving some of the anxiety over the impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy.",
      "Trump is attempting to reshape the global economy by dramatically increasing import taxes to rejuvenate the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "Contraction has already begun in the U.S., where the economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace from January through March as Trump\u2019s trade wars disrupted business. First-quarter growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the U.S. tried to bring in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s massive tariffs went into effect.",
      "Trump has also promised to drastically downsize the federal government workforce, which occupied much of the initial weeks of his second term.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when the job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 or \u201cDOGE,\u201d spearheaded by billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk \u2014 will surface in the weekly layoffs data. Many of the cuts are being challenged in the courts, though the federal government staff reductions are already being felt, even outside of the Washington, D.C. area.",
      "Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains robust, with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.",
      "Earlier this month, the government reported that U.S. employers added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate held at a historically healthy 4.2%.",
      "Many economists still anticipate that a negative impact from trade wars will materialize this year for American workers.",
      "On Tuesday, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers, nearly 3% of its workforce and its largest job cuts in more than two years as the company spends heavily on artificial intelligence.",
      "Other companies that have announced job cuts this year include Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta.",
      "The Labor Department's report Thursday said that the four-week average of claims, which softens some of the week-to-week fluctuations, rose by 3,250 to 230,500.",
      "The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of May 3 rose by 9,000 to 1.88 million.",

      "NEW YORK -- Walmart\u2019s first-quarter profit slipped, and it said it must raise prices due to higher costs from tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump.",
      "The nation\u2019s largest retailers posted strong quarterly sales Thursday and said it expects sales growth of 3.5% to 4.5% in the second quarter.",
      "Like many other U.S. companies, however, it did not issue a profit outlook for the quarter because of the chaotic environment, with stated U.S. tariff policies changing constantly. The company maintained its full-year guidance issued in February.",
      "Many Americans have pulled back on spending as they grow uneasy about the economy. Government data revealed slowing sales growth for retailers Thursday. Walmart said Thursday that its consumers remain cautious and selective. Trump\u2019s tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is at the core of Walmart\u2019s success.",
      "Trump\u2019s threatened 145% import taxes on Chinese goods were reduced to 30% in a deal announced Monday, with some of the higher tariffs on pause for 90 days.",
      "Retailers and importers had largely stopped shipping shoes, clothes, toys, and other items with the duties so high, but many will now resume importing from China in the narrow window, hoping to avoid sparse shelves this fall. Yet many retailers say they must raise prices to tariff costs. And they are also bracing for higher shipping costs fueled by a surge of companies scrambling to get their goods on ships to the U.S.",
      "Walmart has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Two-thirds of Walmart\u2019s merchandise is sourced in the U.S., with groceries driving much of that. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of Walmart\u2019s U.S. business.",
      "Still, Walmart isn\u2019t immune.",
      "\u201cWe will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible,\u201d Walmart's CEO Doug McMillon told industry analysts Thursday. \u201cBut given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren\u2019t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins.\u201d",
      "McMillon said price increases on the shelves will feel more gradual, but they had already begun as early as April, and they accelerated in May. The company said it has been focused on back-to-school receipts.",
      "McMillon said that it imports general merchandise from all over the world from dozens of countries. But China, in particular, represents a big chunk of volume in certain categories like electronics and toys.",
      "Tariffs on countries like Costa Rica, Peru and Colombia are raising costs on groceries like bananas, avocados, coffee and roses, he said. Walmart is absorbing costs on general merchandise within departments and not yet passing along rising costs in some cases.",
      "Walmart is also asking suppliers to change input materials for components, for example, using fiberglass instead of aluminum, which Trump hit with tariffs in early March.",
      "Walmart earned $4.45 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the quarter ended April 30, down from $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the same period last year.",
      "Adjusted earnings per share were 61 cents, exceeding the 58 cent projections from industry analysts, according to FactSet.",
      "Revenue rose 2.5% to $165.61 billion, just short of analyst estimates.",
      "Walmart\u2019s U.S. comparable sales \u2014 those from established physical stores and online channels \u2014 rose 4.5% in the second quarter, though that\u2019s slowed from a 4.6% bump in the previous quarter, and a 5.3% increase in the third quarter of 2024.",
      "Shares fell 4% at the opening bell Thursday.",
      "Business was fueled by health and wellness items as well as groceries. Sales were weaker in home and sporting good, which was offset by robust sales of toys, automotive goods and kid\u2019s clothing, the company said.",
      "Global e-commerce sales rose 22%, up from 16% in the previous quarter.",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report financial results and the numbers can provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper and how the tariffs are impacting its business.",
      "Earlier this month, Amazon announced higher first-quarter profit and sales, underscoring the online behemoth\u2019s hold on shoppers looking for low prices in an uncertain economy.",
      "Amazon brought in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect. And CEO Andy Jassy said that many of its third party sellers did the same.",

      "From there, Toronto had managed basically nothing \u2014 until Matthews broke through.",
      "The Toronto captain was 0 for 31 on shots against Florida this season, including the regular season. Bobrovsky had stopped 85 of the last 86 shot attempts he had seen in the series. And the Maple Leafs hadn't had the lead in basically the equivalent of 3 1/2 games \u2014 216 minutes, 30 seconds, to be precise.",
      "But when a pass got away from Florida's Aaron Ekblad, Matthews had a slight opening \u2014 and that was all he needed. A low shot skittered along the ice and beat Bobrovsky for a 1-0 lead with 13:40 left.",
      "\u201cIt's a big win, from top to bottom,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cWe earned that.\u201d",

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Rory McIlroy was forced to use a backup driver in the PGA Championship when his regular driver was tested and deemed to be nonconforming after he arrived at Quail Hollow, according to a report on XM Sirius PGA Tour Radio.",
      "McIlroy was tied for last in driving accuracy among the 74 players who made the cut on Friday, hitting only 10 fairways in two rounds. The Masters champion made the cut on the number after a bogey on the final hole when he drove left beyond a creek against corporate tents.",
      "For the second straight day, McIlroy left Quail Hollow and declined to speak to the media.",
      "The USGA, which tests clubs to make sure they are conforming at the request of the tournaments in the U.S. and Mexico, confirmed the USGA did testing at Quail Hollow when asked by the PGA of America. All tests are done before the first round.",
      "\u201cThat program is consistent with the same level of support that we provide to the PGA Tour as part of their regular program for driver testing,\u201d the USGA said.",
      "Results are confidential.",
      "The PGA of America did not immediately respond to a request for such information as how many players submitted drivers for testing, instead referring to the USGA statement.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers",
      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s not really about the books.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has instead morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers, as the White House tries to wrest control of what has for centuries been a legislative institution.",
      "It\u2019s a power struggle with potentially vast consequences. The Library of Congress not only stores the world's largest collection of books but also an office overseeing reams of copyrighted material of untold value.",
      "There is a research institute that has long been protected from outside influence. Its servers house extremely sensitive information regarding claims of workplace violations on Capitol Hill, as well as payments and other financial data for the legislative branch\u2019s more than 30,000 employees. There\u2019s even speculation that the whole affair is tied to an ongoing debate over whether big tech companies can use copyrighted material for artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Because of this, the battle over control of the Library of Congress has prompted Republican leaders on Capitol Hill to deliver rare pushback against a president who has pressed to expand the boundaries of his own power to enact his priorities. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other Republicans have been talking with the White House about a potential path to d\u00e9tente.",
      "This all has left the library in a bizarre state of purgatory.",
      "For now, Trump's choices for interim library leaders \u2014 most notably Todd Blanche, a deputy attorney general who had represented the president in his criminal proceedings \u2014 have not appeared to challenge the assertion by the library that one of its veteran officials would be the acting head. It would be unheard of for an executive branch official such as Blanche to simultaneously serve in the legislative branch, according to experts.",
      "\u201cThis egregious overreach into the legislature by the executive branch is just unwarranted and, we believe, unprecedented,\u201d said New York Rep. Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, which oversees the Library of Congress.",
      "The controversy began to unfold publicly last week, when Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden was fired in a terse email from a White House official. She had just one year left in her 10-year term.",
      "Then this week, Blanche was tapped by the White House to be the interim librarian, and two other Justice Department officials were chosen for other senior library posts. Those officials, Brian Nieves and Paul Perkins, tried unsuccessfully to enter the U.S. Copyright Office on Monday, but left voluntarily after library officials called Capitol Police.",
      "Thune told The Associated Press that Congress was \u201cnot entirely\u201d consulted ahead of Trump\u2019s dismissal of Hayden.",
      "Lawmakers want to ensure that \u201ccongressional legislative branch equities are protected,\u201d Thune said. He speculated that discussions with the White House to resolve the standoff would bleed into next week.",
      "The White House has said Trump was within his authority to dismiss Hayden, a former head of the library systems in Baltimore. It cited \u201cquite concerning\u201d behavior from Hayden involving diversity, equity and inclusion efforts as well as books for children that the White House found inappropriate.",
      "A copy of virtually every book published in the U.S. is sent to the Copyright Office, then the library decides whether to include it in the main collection. No one under 16 can get a reader card to access the collection.",
      "Existing regulations and past practices call for an acting librarian to come from the Library of Congress\u2019 current ranks if there is a vacancy. But the White House has argued that a law governing federal vacancies applies, even though the 1998 law deals with the executive branch, according to two people familiar with the discussions.",
      "When Nieves and Perkins showed up on Monday, they held a letter that invoked the vacancies law to justify their appointments, according to one of the people.",
      "Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who leads the panel overseeing funding for the Library of Congress, argued that in practice, the librarian is not a legislative branch employee, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s an appointment by the president of the United States, because we have to confirm her.\u201d",
      "Yet there is deep concern among lawmakers and aides about any unjustified intrusion of the administration into the Library of Congress and its operations.",
      "Especially worrisome to them is potential meddling with the Congressional Research Service, known as the nonpartisan think tank of Capitol Hill. It fields roughly 75,000 requests from members of Congress every year for research, legal expertise and other information critical for policymaking.",
      "The discussions between lawmakers and the Congressional Research Service are considered so sensitive that they are protected under the speech or debate clause of the Constitution, which shields members of Congress from being questioned -\u2013 such as in court -\u2013 about official legislative acts.",
      "The service's \u201cutility and trustworthiness would be substantially undercut if these inquiries were not protected or the Administration sought to shape responses to reflect its priorities,\u201d said Hope O\u2019Keeffe, a former associate general counsel at the Library of Congress.",
      "The library also oversees the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, which functions as the human resources office of the legislative branch, fielding complaints about harassment, discrimination and other workplace violations. It also stores financial information about legislative branch employees, who include not just those at the Library of Congress, lawmakers and their aides, but employees of the Capitol Police, the Architect of the Capitol and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "Robert Newlen, the principal deputy librarian, told library staffers shortly after Hayden\u2019s firing that he will serve as the acting librarian. He said in a note this week that while the White House had appointed its own acting librarian, \u201cwe have not yet received direction from Congress about how to move forward,\u201d indicating that the library was defying Trump\u2019s wishes.",
      "California Sen. Alex Padilla, the top Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, this week said flatly that Newlen is the acting librarian of Congress. Asked whether Blanche was respecting that, Padilla said, \u201cthat\u2019s my understanding.\u201d",
      "But a White House official stressed on Thursday that Trump selected Blanche to be the acting librarian. The official, granted anonymity because of the ongoing private discussions with lawmakers, said Trump chose Blanche because the president is \u201cappointing highly-qualified individuals who are wholeheartedly committed to advancing the America-first agenda.\" The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Some suspect that the Copyright Office is the true aim of the administration. Housed in the Library of Congress with a leader chosen by the librarian, the office accepts millions of copies of copyrighted material such as books, artwork and music every year as part of the copyright registration process.",
      "Shortly before the director of the office, Shira Perlmutter, was fired, her office released a report that questioned whether it was legal for the tech industry to use copyrighted material to \u201ctrain\u201d their artificial intelligence systems. Tech companies contend that doing so is legal when used for educational or research purposes or creating something new. Perlmutter\u2019s report said doing so, in some circumstances, would go beyond established boundaries of fair use when the AI-generated content is competing with creative works made by people.",
      "The material there is extremely valuable. For instance, copyright violation damages for the office's existing collection \u2014 if, for instance, tech companies scraped the material for AI purposes and then later were found liable for copyright infringement \u2014 would likely exceed $1.5 trillion, according to a person familiar with the calculations.",
      "Morelle noted that the firing came \u201cone day after, and I doubt there\u2019s any coincidence to this, a report which is in many ways at odds with what Elon Musk wants to do around intellectual property and copyright.\u201d Musk is the billionaire outside adviser for Trump who operates his own AI startup, called xAI. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "Fortnite says it\u2019s unavailable on Apple\u2019s iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe",
      "NEW YORK -- Fortnite says it's now unavailable on Apple's iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 marking the latest twist in a yearslong feud.",
      "Apple pulled Epic Games-owned Fortnite from its app store back in 2020, just two years after the widely-popular, multiplayer survival game had launched on iOS and garnered millions of users. iPhone players in the U.S. have been locked out since, although Apple users in the EU had been able to download the game through an alternative store over the last nine months.",
      "Following years of a tense litigation, a recent court ruling was set to clear the way for Fortnite to finally return to iOS users in the U.S., too. But the video game said early Friday that a move from Apple has prevented that \u2014 and, as a result, Fortnite says it's now dark on iOS globally.",
      "\u201cApple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the U.S. App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union,\" Fortnite wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \u201cSadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.\"",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Apple said it had asked Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update \u201cwithout including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.\u201d Sweden is where Epic\u2019s developer account for its alternative app store is based.",
      "But, Apple added, it \"did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces.\u201d",
      "Epic did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "In the U.S., Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple back in 2020, alleging the technology trendsetter was illegally using its power to gouge game makers. After a monthlong trial in 2021, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled against most of Epic\u2019s claims, but ordered Apple to loosen its previously-exclusive control over the payments made for in-app commerce and allow links to alternative options in the U.S. for the first time \u2014 threatening to undercut sizable commissions that Apple had been collecting from in-app transactions for over a decade.",
      "After exhausting an appeal that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Apple last year introduced a new system that opened the door for links to alternative payment options while still imposing a 27% commission on in-app transactions executed outside its own system.",
      "Epic fired back by alleging Apple was thumbing its nose at the legal system, reviving another round of court hearings that lasted nearly a year before Gonzalez Rogers delivered a stinging rebuke last month \u2014 which held Apple in civil contempt and banned the company from collecting any commission on alternative payment systems.",
      "That ruling cleared the way for Epic to finally return to the iPhone app store in the U.S., a reinstatement the video game maker was anticipating before Apple\u2019s latest move.",
      "Fortnite's availability in the EU, meanwhile, is under an alternative store for iPhone users \u2014 now called the Epic Games Store. Apple cleared the way for this last year under new regulatory pressures. Prior to Friday, Fortnite and other Epic games had been available for download on iPhones using this store in the EU since August 2024.",
      "Before the companies' prolonged legal battle, Epic launched Fortnite on iOS in April 2018. Between then and its August 2020 removal, 116 million users accessed Fortnite on iOS devices, company filings note \u2014 raking in a daily average of about 2.5 million players, which represented about 10% of Fortnite's total daily traffic at the time.",

      "Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, says an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d led its Grok chatbot to post unsolicited claims on social media about the persecution and \u201cgenocide\u201d of white people in South Africa",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company said an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d to its chatbot Grok was the reason why it kept talking about South African racial politics and the subject of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d on social media this week.",
      "An employee at xAI made a change that \u201cdirected Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic,\u201d which \u201cviolated xAI\u2019s internal policies and core values,\u201d the company said in an explanation posted late Thursday that promised reforms.",
      "A day earlier, Grok kept posting publicly about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in South Africa in response to users of Musk\u2019s social media platform X who asked it a variety of questions, most having nothing to do with South Africa.",
      "One exchange was about streaming service Max reviving the HBO name. Others were about video games or baseball but quickly veered into unrelated commentary on alleged calls to violence against South Africa\u2019s white farmers. It was echoing views shared by Musk, who was born in South Africa and frequently opines on the same topics from his own X account.",
      "Computer scientist Jen Golbeck was curious about Grok's unusual behavior so she tried it herself before the fixes were made Wednesday, sharing a photo she had taken at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show and asking, \u201cis this true?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe claim of white genocide is highly controversial,\" began Grok's response to Golbeck. \"Some argue white farmers face targeted violence, pointing to farm attacks and rhetoric like the \u2018Kill the Boer\u2019 song, which they see as incitement.\u201d",
      "The episode was the latest window into the complicated mix of automation and human engineering that leads generative AI chatbots trained on huge troves of data to say what they say.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even really matter what you were saying to Grok,\u201d said Golbeck, a professor at the University of Maryland, in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt would still give that white genocide answer. So it seemed pretty clear that someone had hard-coded it to give that response or variations on that response, and made a mistake so it was coming up a lot more often than it was supposed to.\"",
      "Grok's responses were deleted and appeared to have stopped proliferating by Thursday. Neither xAI nor X returned emailed requests for comment but on Thursday, xAI said it had \u201cconducted a thorough investigation\u201d and was implementing new measures to improve Grok's transparency and reliability.",
      "Musk has spent years criticizing the \u201cwoke AI\u201d outputs he says come out of rival chatbots, like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, and has pitched Grok as their \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d alternative.",
      "Musk has also criticized his rivals' lack of transparency about their AI systems, fueling criticism in the hours between the unauthorized change \u2014 at 3:15 a.m. Pacific time Wednesday \u2014 and the company's explanation nearly two days later.",
      "\u201cGrok randomly blurting out opinions about white genocide in South Africa smells to me like the sort of buggy behavior you get from a recently applied patch. I sure hope it isn\u2019t. It would be really bad if widely used AIs got editorialized on the fly by those who controlled them,\u201d prominent technology investor Paul Graham wrote on X.",
      "Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has regularly accused South Africa\u2019s Black-led government of being anti-white and has repeated a claim that some of the country\u2019s political figures are \u201cactively promoting white genocide.\u201d",
      "Musk's commentary \u2014 and Grok's \u2014 escalated this week after the Trump administration brought a small number of white South Africans to the United States as refugees, the start of a larger relocation effort for members of the minority Afrikaner group that came after Trump suspended refugee programs and halted arrivals from other parts of the world. Trump says the Afrikaners are facing a \u201cgenocide\u201d in their homeland, an allegation strongly denied by the South African government.",
      "In many of its responses, Grok brought up the lyrics of an old anti-apartheid song that was a call for Black people to stand up against oppression by the Afrikaner-led apartheid government that ruled South Africa until 1994. The song's central lyrics are \u201ckill the Boer\u201d \u2014 a word that refers to a white farmer.",
      "Golbeck said it was clear the answers were \u201chard-coded\u201d because, while chatbot outputs are typically random, Grok's responses consistently brought up nearly identical points. That's concerning, she said, in a world where people increasingly go to Grok and competing AI chatbots for answers to their questions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a space where it\u2019s awfully easy for the people who are in charge of these algorithms to manipulate the version of truth that they\u2019re giving,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really problematic when people \u2014 I think incorrectly \u2014 believe that these algorithms can be sources of adjudication about what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Musk's company said it is now making a number of changes, starting with publishing Grok system prompts openly on the software development site GitHub so that \u201cthe public will be able to review them and give feedback to every prompt change that we make to Grok. We hope this can help strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI.\u201d",
      "Among the instructions to Grok shown on GitHub on Thursday were: \u201cYou are extremely skeptical. You do not blindly defer to mainstream authority or media.\u201d",
      "Noting that some had \u201ccircumvented\u201d its existing code review process, xAI also said it will \u201cput in place additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can\u2019t modify the prompt without review.\u201d The company said it is also putting in place a \u201c24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok\u2019s answers that are not caught by automated systems,\u201d for when other measures fail.",

      "The internet wouldn\u2019t be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The internet wouldn't be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip.",
      "Like it or not, the button has served as a creative catalyst, a dopamine delivery system and an emotional battering ram. It also became an international tourist attraction after Facebook plastered the symbol on a giant sign on that stood outside its Silicon Valley headquarters until the company rebranded itself as Meta Platforms in 2021.",
      "A new book, \u201cLike: The Button That Changed The World,\" delves into the convoluted story behind a symbol that's become both the manna and bane of a digitally driven society.",
      "It's a tale that traces back to gladiator battles for survival during the Roman empire before fast-forwarding to the early 21st century when technology trailblazers such as Yelp co-founder Russ Simmons, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, and Gmail inventor Paul Buchheit were experimenting with different ways using the currency of recognition to prod people to post compelling content online for free.",
      "As part of that noodling, a Yelp employee named Bob Goodson sat down on May 18, 2005, and drew a crude sketch of thumbs up and thumbs down gesture as a way for people to express their opinions about restaurant reviews posted on the site. Yelp passed on adopting Goodson's suggested symbol and, instead, adopted the \u201cuseful,\u201d \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d buttons conceived by Simmons. But the discovery of that old sketch inspired Goodson to team up with Martin Reeves to explore how the Like button came to be in their new book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something simple and also elegant because the Like button says, \u2018I like you, I like your content. And I am like you. I like you because I am like you, I am part of your tribe,\u2019 \u201d Reeves said during an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cBut it's very hard to answer the simple question, \u2018Well, who invented the Like button?\u2019 \u201d",
      "Although Facebook is the main reason the Like button became so ubiquitous, the company didn't invent it and almost discarded it as drivel. It took Facebook nearly two years to overcome the staunch resistance by CEO Mark Zuckerberg before finally introducing the symbol on its service on February 9, 2009 \u2014 five years after the social network's creation in a Harvard University dorm room.",
      "As happens with many innovations, the Like button was born out of necessity but it wasn't the brainchild of a single person. The concept percolated for more than a decade in a Silicon Valley before Facebook finally embraced it.",
      "\u201cInnovation is often social and Silicon Valley was the right place for all this happen because it has a culture of meet-ups, although it's less so now,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cEveryone was getting together to talk about what they were working on at that time and it turned out a lot of them were working on the same stuff.\u201d",
      "The effort to create a simple mechanism to digitally express approval or dismay sprouted from a wellspring of online services such as Yelp and YouTube whose success would hinge on their ability to post commentary or video that would help make their sites even more popular without forcing them to spend a lot of money for content. That effort required a feedback loop that wouldn't require a lot of hoops to navigate.",
      "And when Goodson was noodling around with his thumbs-up and thumbs-down gesture, it didn't come out of a vacuum. Those techniques of signaling approval and disapproval had been ushered into the 21st century zeitgeist by the Academy Award-winning movie, \u201cGladiator,\u201d where Emperor Commodus \u2014 portrayed by actor Joaquin Phoenix \u2014 used the gestures to either spare or slay combatants in the arena.",
      "But the positive feelings conjured by a thumbs up date even further back in popular culture, thanks to the 1950s-era character Fonzie played by Henry Winkler in the top-rated 1970s TV series, \u201cHappy Days.\u201d The gesture later became a way of expressing delight with a program via a remote control button for the digital video recorders made by TiVO during the early 2000s. Around the same time, Hot or Not \u2014 a site that solicited feedback on the looks of people who shared photos of themselves \u2014 began playing around with ideas that helped inspire the Like button, based on the book's research.",
      "Others that contributed to the pool of helpful ideas included the pioneering news service Digg, the blogging platform Xanga, YouTube and another early video site, Vimeo.",
      "But Facebook unquestionably turned the Like button into a universally understood symbol, while also profiting the most from its entrance into the mainstream. And it almost didn't happen.",
      "By 2007, Facebook engineers had been tinkering with a Like button, but Zuckerberg opposed it because he feared the social network was already getting too cluttered and, Reeves said, \u201cis he didn\u2019t actually want to do something that would be seen as trivial, that would cheapen the service.\u201d",
      "But FriendFeed, a rival social network created by Buchheit and now OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor, had no such qualms, and unveiled its own Like button in October 2007.",
      "But the button wasn't successful enough to keep the lights on at FriendFeed, and the service ended up being acquired by Facebook. By the time that deal was completed, Facebook had already introduced a Like button \u2014 only after Zuckerberg rebuffed the original idea of calling it an Awesome button \u201cbecause nothing is more awesome than awesome,\u201d according to the book's research.",
      "Once Zuckerberg relented, Facebook quickly saw that the Like button not only helped keep its audience engaged on its social network but also made it easier to divine people's individual interests and gather the insights required to sell the targeted advertising that accounted for most of Meta Platform's $165 billion in revenue last year. The button's success encouraged Facebook to take things even further by allowing other digital services to ingrain it into their feedback loops and then, in 2016, added six more types of emotions \u2014 \u201clove,\u201d \u201ccare,\u201d \u201chaha,\u201d \u201cwow,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d",
      "Facebook hasn't publicly disclosed how many responses it has accumulated from the Like button and its other related options, but Levchin told the book's authors that he believes the company has probably logged trillions of them. \u201cWhat content is liked by humans...is probably one of the singularly most valuable things on the internet,\u201d Levchin said in the book.",
      "The Like button also has created an epidemic of emotional problems, especially among adolescents, who feel forlorn if their posts are ignored and narcissists whose egos feast on the positive feedback. Reeves views those issues as part of the unintentional consequences that inevitably happen because \u201cif you can\u2019t even predict the beneficial effects of a technological innovation how could you possibly forecast the side effects and the interventions?\u201d",
      "Even so, Reeves believes the Like button and the forces that coalesced to create it tapped into something uniquely human.",
      "\u201cWe thought serendipity of the innovation was part of the point,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we can get bored with liking or having our capacity to compliment taken away so easily because it\u2019s the product of 100,000 years of evolution.\u201d",

      "A 29-year-old former tire shop manager who quit his job and cashed in his retirement savings to buy a sailboat has become a social media sensation as he sails from Oregon to Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix",
      "HONOLULU -- Midway while sailing across the Pacific with just his cat named Phoenix, Oliver Widger reflected on why he thinks his many followers \u2014 more than a million on TikTok and Instagram \u2014 are drawn to his story of quitting his 9-to-5 job and embarking on a journey from Oregon to Hawaii.",
      "\u201cThe world kind of sucks and, like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in how I felt with my work,\u201d Widger, 29, told The Associated Press on Wednesday via Zoom. \u201cYou can be making $150,000 a year and you still feel like you\u2019re just making ends meet, you know what I mean? And I think people are just tired of that and working really hard for nothing and want a way out.\"",
      "People are inspired by someone who found a way out, said Widger, who is among a growing number of people who have undertaken such voyages in recent years.",
      "Being diagnosed four years ago with a syndrome that carried a risk of paralysis made him realize he hated his job as a manager at a tire company, a job requiring him to be clean-shaven and wear pressed shirts. He heard about people who sailed from California to Hawaii and decided that was the life for him.",
      "He abruptly quit his job with \u201cno money, no plan\u201d and $10,000 of debt.",
      "\u201cI knew one thing: I'm buying a sailboat,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI'm sailing around the world.\u201d",
      "He liquidated his retirement savings, taught himself to sail mostly via YouTube and moved from Portland to the Oregon coast, where he spent months refitting the $50,000 boat he bought.",
      "Now, Widger is harnessing the power of social media to fund his round-the-world sailing dream.",
      "Since he set sail in April, followers have been tuning into his \u201cSailing with Phoenix\u201d social media posts to view videos of him and his feline first mate battling the waves and bouts of seasickness, enjoying dazzling sunsets, recounting tricky boat repairs or just reflecting on life at sea.",
      "As he discussed his journey with the AP, a netted bag carrying bottled water and snacks swung wildly over his head as the boat rocked.",
      "He recalled highlights of the voyage so far, including marveling at the speed dolphins cut through the water and finding flying fish on the deck. There have been stretches when there were no birds in sight for days. It can be a struggle to sleep when the boat is creaking while being buffeted by waves or to steady a boiling pot for the MREs he has been subsisting on.",
      "There have been harrowing moments like when a rudder failed and the boat tilted sideways in the surf for three hours as he made repairs, and the time he locked himself in the engine compartment and pried his way out with a wrench.",
      "Widger acknowledged he is relatively inexperienced as a sailor, but he has implemented safety measures and communication backup plans, including a satellite phone and an emergency beacon.",
      "Lt. Cmdr. Jesse Harms of the U.S. Coast Guard in Hawaii hasn't been following the journey closely, but said he is relieved to hear Widger has the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon, known as an EPIRB.",
      "It's a critical tool for rescuers to locate a mariner's position during an emergency, especially in the Pacific, the largest ocean, Harms said.",
      "Widger's journey provides a good opportunity to educate the public about sailing safety, such as the importance of wearing a personal flotation device whenever topside on the boat, monitoring the weather closely and registering emergency tools like the EPIRB, Harms said.",
      "\u201cThat's a really critical piece for anybody that's getting motivated by his story to go set off on their own adventure,\u201d Harms said.",
      "Until his arrival, likely in Honolulu, Widger is making sure everything is in place to avoid Phoenix having to undergo Hawaii's animal quarantine. A mobile vet will sign off on Phoenix's health when they arrive, he said.",
      "Widger wasn't aware of the deadly danger of cat feces to the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, but he has been keeping all his trash, including kitty litter, on board. Even though he said he is legally allowed to throw it overboard, seeing so much plastic in the ocean motivates him not to.",
      "In addition to managing the practicalities of daily life on a boat, he is coping with going viral in the middle of the ocean by creating social media content and making decisions about merch his fans want to buy.",
      "He credits it all to his neck issue, which \u201cshook up my world and it changed my perspective on everything.\u201d He also hopes he can be an inspiration for anyone who's in a rut.",
      "\u201cEverything I\u2019ve done I thought was impossible,\u201d Widger said. \"Sailing around the world is such a ridiculous dream. Whatever your dream is, just go, just do it.\u201d",

      "A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is growing and thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him.",
      "Researchers described the case in a new study, saying he\u2019s among the first to be successfully treated with a custom therapy that seeks to fix a tiny but critical error in his genetic code that kills half of affected infants. Though it may be a while before similar personalized treatments are available for others, doctors hope the technology can someday help the millions left behind even as genetic medicine has advanced because their conditions are so rare.",
      "\u201cThis is the first step towards the use of gene editing therapies to treat a wide variety of rare genetic disorders for which there are currently no definitive medical treatments,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert who co-authored the study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The baby, KJ Muldoon of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, is one of 350 million people worldwide with rare diseases, most of which are genetic. He was diagnosed shortly after birth with severe CPS1 deficiency, estimated by some experts to affect around one in a million babies. Those infants lack an enzyme needed to help remove ammonia from the body, so it can build up in their blood and become toxic. A liver transplant is an option for some.",
      "Knowing KJ\u2019s odds, parents Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, both 34, worried they could lose him.",
      "\u201cWe were, like, you know, weighing all the options, asking all the questions for either the liver transplant, which is invasive, or something that\u2019s never been done before,\u201d Nicole said.",
      "\u201cWe prayed, we talked to people, we gathered information, and we eventually decided that this was the way we were going to go,\u201d her husband added.",
      "Within six months, the team at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, along with their partners, created a therapy designed to correct KJ\u2019s faulty gene. They used CRISPR, the gene editing tool that won its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2020. Instead of cutting the DNA strand like the first CRISPR approaches, doctors employed a technique that flips the mutated DNA \u201cletter\u201d \u2014 also known as a base \u2014 to the correct type. Known as \u201cbase editing,\" it reduces the risk of unintended genetic changes.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cvery exciting\u201d that the team created the therapy so quickly, said gene therapy researcher Senthil Bhoopalan at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis really sets the pace and the benchmark for such approaches.\u201d",
      "In February, KJ got his first IV infusion with the gene editing therapy, delivered through tiny fatty droplets called lipid nanoparticles that are taken up by liver cells.",
      "While the room was abuzz with excitement that day, \u201che slept through the entire thing,\u201d recalled study author Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a gene therapy expert at CHOP.",
      "After follow-up doses in March and April, KJ has been able to eat more normally and has recovered well from illnesses like colds, which can strain the body and exacerbate symptoms of CPS1. The 9 \u00bd-month old also takes less medication.",
      "Considering his poor prognosis earlier, \u201cany time we see even the smallest milestone that he\u2019s meeting \u2013 like a little wave or rolling over \u2013 that\u2019s a big moment for us,\u201d his mother said.",
      "Still, researchers caution that it\u2019s only been a few months. They\u2019ll need to watch him for years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still very much in the early stages of understanding what this medication may have done for KJ,\u201d Ahrens-Nicklas said. \u201cBut every day, he\u2019s showing us signs that he\u2019s growing and thriving.\u201d",
      "Researchers hope what they learn from KJ will help other rare disease patients.",
      "Gene therapies, which can be extremely expensive to develop, generally target more common disorders in part for simple financial reasons: more patients mean potentially more sales, which can help pay the development costs and generate more profit. The first CRISPR therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, treats sickle cell disease, a painful blood disorder affecting millions worldwide.",
      "Musunuru said his team\u2019s work \u2014 funded in part by the National Institutes of Health \u2014 showed that creating a custom treatment doesn\u2019t have to be prohibitively expensive. The cost was \u201cnot far off\u201d from the $800,000-plus for an average liver transplant and related care, he said.",
      "\u201cAs we get better and better at making these therapies and shorten the time frame even more, economies of scale will kick in and I would expect the costs to come down,\u201d Musunuru said.",
      "Scientists also won't have to redo all the initial work every time they create a customized therapy, Bhoopalan said, so this research \u201csets the stage\u201d for treating other rare conditions.",
      "Carlos Moraes, a neurology professor at the University of Miami who wasn't involved with the study, said research like this opens the door to more advances.",
      "\u201cOnce someone comes with a breakthrough like this, it will take no time\" for other teams to apply the lessons and move forward, he said. \u201cThere are barriers, but I predict that they are going to be crossed in the next five to 10 years. Then the whole field will move as a block because we\u2019re pretty much ready.\u201d",

      "Across the Americas, organizations that guide women seeking abortions in various countries are raising alarm, decrying what they see as a new wave of censorship on platforms owned by tech giant Meta \u2014 even in countries where abortion is decriminalized. The organizations believe this is due to a combination of changes to Meta policies and attacks by anti-abortion groups that denounce their content.",
      "While this also occurs on Instagram and Facebook, the blocking of organizations\u2019 verified WhatsApp business accounts, which they use to communicate with people seeking help, has been particularly disruptive. These accounts are crucial for communicating with people seeking help, and their blockage has significantly complicated daily interactions between women and support providers.",
      "Meta usually attributes its content blocking to policy violations, though it has acknowledged occasional mistakes. Since January, Meta changed the way it moderates content, now relying on user-generated notes \u201cto allow more speech and reduce enforcement mistakes.\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump has said the changes were \u201cprobably\u201d made in response to his threats over what conservatives considered a liberal bias in fact-checking.",
      "Among the organizations whose WhatsApp business accounts were suspended is the MSI Foundation (part of MSI Reproductive Choices, formerly Marie Stopes) a network working in Mexico for 25 years. Its account was suspended in February, and the Colombian group Ori\u00e9ntame, or Guide Me, which has worked in women's health in Colombia for decades, was labeled by Instagram as \u201cdangerous.\u201d",
      "While conservatives cheered the change in Meta moderation policies, organizations helping women who seek abortions say that, even if they just apply in the U.S., they often result in over-enforcement, likely driven by Artificial Intelligence, which disproportionately flags or removes their posts \u2014 obstacles that have increased since the start of the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt is not always intentional censorship, but the outcome is still more censorship for us and our partners,\u201d said Martha Dimitratou, cofounder of Repro Uncensored, an organization that monitors digital suppression of reproductive health content.",
      "In additional comments on Thursday, Meta rejected any link between the groups\u2019 experiences and its policy changes.",
      "\u201cOur policies and enforcement regarding abortion medication-related content have not changed recently and were not part of the content moderation changes,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",
      "\u201cFrom one day to the next they blocked communication between our users and women who need first-hand information\u201d to address doubts or look for medical follow-up with MSI, said Araceli L\u00f3pez-Nava, the organization\u2019s Latin America director.",
      "In the days after the suspension, appointments dropped 80%",
      "L\u00f3pez Nava said that MSI had previously faced issues with regular WhatsApp numbers, because it\u2019s easy to file complaints. So, the organization thought it would be different with a business account, which gives them a platform to manage the thousands of messages they receive every month.",
      "That wasn't the case. After an initial suspension, MSI's WhatsApp business account was permanently suspended two weeks later. The reason cited in Meta\u2019s notification? \u201cSending spam.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe argument is that they\u2019ve received complaints, but from whom?\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava asked. She said the organization can\u2019t be accused of sending spam because they only answer those who contact them and provide information in line with Mexican law. Abortion is decriminalized in Mexico at the federal level and in the majority of its 32 states.",
      "\u201cIt looks like an orchestrated strategy to us,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava said. \u201cAnd not necessarily by Meta.\"",
      "Dimitratou, who is also digital strategist for Canada-based Women on Web and the U.S.-based Plan C, said cases of blocked content have increased since Trump\u2019s election, not only in the U.S., but around the world, likely driven by anti-abortion groups.",
      "Conservative or religious groups have a history of attempting to leverage technology companies to obstruct abortion supporters\u2019 efforts, but the anonymity of app reporting prevents organizations from proving who is behind it.",
      "That is why MSI and an ally NGO, Women\u2019s Link Worldwide, have asked Meta to implement transparent mechanisms to be able to appeal the company\u2019s decisions and to respect international human rights standards. They have not received a response.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told The Associated Press that MSI's WhatsApp business account was blocked for valid reasons, saying that organizations receiving numerous negative comments receive warnings before suspension. Meta declined to provide details about the nature of the negative comments or comment on whether they could be coordinated by anti-abortion groups aiming to paralyze MSI.",
      "The Instagram accounts of Women on Web United States and Women on Web Latin America were suspended right after the U.S. presidential election in November, though they were later reinstated. Dimitratou said that Meta has also limited the organization\u2019s ability to place ads on accounts in Latin America, South Korea and West Africa.",
      "Repro Uncensored has documented at least 60 instances of similar digital censorship since January. The most recent occurred this week, when Thailand's TamTang Group said that Facebook had accused them of violating rules on selling medicines simply for sharing information about free abortion pills provided by the Thai government.",
      "A 2025 report by the California-based Center for Intimacy Justice, based on a survey of 159 nonprofits worldwide, found that major tech platforms were removing ads and content related to abortion and other women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health issues like menopause.",
      "When asked about the report, Meta downplayed its findings, noting that it was based on a small number of examples.",
      "Tech companies often cite policies against explicit or inappropriate sexual content or the advertisement of unsafe substances, such as abortion pills, even though the World Health Organization has said they\u2019re safe.",
      "In April, months after Meta announced changes to ensure greater freedom of expression, Ori\u00e9ntame, the Colombian collective that offers reproductive health services, posted on Instagram a drawing of a heart and the phrase \u201cAbort without pain.\u201d The post was blocked with the explanation: \u201cDangerous people and organizations, photo removed.\u201d",
      "While Colombia legalized abortion in 2022, Ori\u00e9ntame experienced censorship of at least 14 of their posts on Instagram in April 2025. That same month, their WhatsApp business account was suspended, said Tatiana Mart\u00ednez, who manages their social media. Although the WhatsApp account was restored after a week, they worry it could happen again.",
      "A Meta spokesperson said this week that the Instagram posts were mistakenly taken down and not the result of a change in its content standards.",
      "Ori\u00e9ntame director Mar\u00eda Vivas says the organization has been battling Google for years over online content limitations. The tech giant said in a message to the AP that it only restricts content when it violates policies. But Google keeps Colombia on the list of countries with restrictions on abortion ads \u2014 even though abortion was decriminalized there in 2022.",
      "As for their problems with Meta, Vivas said they started in late 2024, when the company started to make some data management adjustments.",
      "Taking legal action against tech giants, when each country has its own laws, is complicated. As a result, affected organizations have turned to creative strategies, like operating multiple backup accounts, having a substitute ready when one is blocked and reformulating language in posts to avoid censorship triggers.",
      "\u201cIt feels like Meta is our boss,\u201d Vivas joked about the ongoing struggle with the tech giant over the basic right to provide health information. \u201cWe live to respond to Meta, to adapt ourselves to Meta,\u201d she said. \u201cThat's absurd.\u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A former food delivery driver pleaded guilty to conspiring with others to steal more than $2.5 million from DoorDash by getting the company to pay for deliveries that never occurred, federal prosecutors said.",
      "Sayee Chaitanya Reddy Devagiri pleaded guilty Tuesday in federal court in San Jose to a single count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said.",
      "Devagiri, 30, of Newport Beach, California, admitted to working with three others in 2020 and 2021 to defraud the San Francisco-based delivery company, federal prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors said Devagiri used customer accounts to place high-value orders and then used an employee\u2019s credential to gain access to DoorDash software and manually reassign the orders to driver accounts that he and others controlled. Devagiri then caused the fraudulent driver accounts to report that the orders had been delivered when they had not, and manipulated DoorDash\u2019s computer systems to pay the fraudulent driver accounts for the nonexistent deliveries, officials said.",
      "Devagiri would then use DoorDash software to change the orders from \u201cdelivered\u201d status to \u201cin process\u201d status and manually reassign the orders to driver accounts he and others controlled, beginning the process again, prosecutors said.",
      "The now-former employee in the scam pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in November 2023 and admitted to being involved in the scheme, prosecutors said.",
      "Devagiri is the third defendant to be convicted of his role in this conspiracy. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000. He is scheduled to return to court on Sept. 16.",

      "NEW YORK -- Responding to complaints from the tech industry and other countries, the U.S. Department of Commerce has rescinded a Biden-era rule due to take effect Thursday that placed limits on the number of artificial intelligence chips that could be exported to certain international markets without federal approval.",
      "\u201cThese new requirements would have stifled American innovation and saddled companies with burdensome new regulatory requirements,\u201d the Commerce Department stated in its guidance.",
      "President Joe Biden established the export framework shortly before he left office in an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries. While the United States had already restricted exports to adversaries such as China and Russia, some of those controls had loopholes and the rule would have set limits on a much broader group of countries, including Middle Eastern countries that President Donald Trump is visiting this week.",
      "The Biden rule's sorting more than 100 countries into different tiers of export restrictions drew strong opposition from those countries, as well as U.S. chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. They argued the restrictions could actually push some countries to turn to China instead of the U.S. for their AI technology.",
      "What Biden's rule did \"was send a message to 120 nations that they couldn\u2019t necessarily count on us to provide the AI they want and need,\u201d said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, at a U.S. Senate hearing last week.",
      "Commerce Undersecretary Jeffery Kessler said Tuesday that President Donald Trump's administration will work to replace the now-rescinded rule to pursue AI with \"trusted foreign countries around the world, while keeping the technology out of the hands of our adversaries.\" The administration said a replacement rule is coming in the future but hasn't said what the new rule will say.",
      "The European Commission welcomed the change, said spokesperson Thomas Regnier, arguing that the Biden rule, if it took effect, would \"undermine U.S. diplomatic relations with dozens of countries by downgrading them to second-tier status.\u201d",
      "European Union countries should be able to buy advanced AI chips from the U.S. without limitations, Regnier said.",
      "\u201cWe cooperate closely, in particular in the field of security, and represent an economic opportunity for the U.S., not a security risk,\u201d he said in a statement.",

      "A Brazilian scientist whose work shows farmers how to shift crop production toward more biologically based solutions instead of chemical fertilizers is being honored with this year\u2019s World Food Prize",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- A Brazilian scientist who pushed back against chemical fertilizers and researched biologically based approaches to more robust food production has been honored with this year\u2019s World Food Prize, the organization announced Tuesday.",
      "Microbiologist Mariangela Hungria's research helped her country become an agricultural powerhouse, an accomplishment that has now won her $500,000 from the Iowa-based World Food Prize Foundation. Hungria has been researching biological seed and soil treatments for 40 years, and has worked with Brazilian farmers to implement her findings.",
      "\u201cI still cannot believe it. Everybody said, my whole life, it's improbable, you are going the wrong way, just go to things like chemicals and so on. And then, I received the most important prize in the world of agriculture,\" Hungria said in an interview. \"Sometimes I still think I'll wake up and see that it's not true.\u201d",
      "Norman Borlaug, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his work to dramatically increase crop yields and reduce the threat of starvation in many countries, founded the World Food Prize. Since the first prize was handed out in 1987, 55 people have been honored.",
      "Hungria said she grew up wanting to alleviate hunger. Early in her career, she decided to focus on a process called biological nitrogen fixation, in which soil bacteria could be used to promote plant growth. At that time, farmers in Brazil and around the world were reluctant to reduce their use of nitrogen fertilizers, which dramatically increase crop production but lead to greenhouse gas emissions and pollutes waterways.",
      "Hungria studied how bacteria can interact with plant roots to naturally produce nitrogen. She then demonstrated her work on test plots and began working directly with farmers to convince them that they wouldn't have to sacrifice high crop yields if they switched to a biological process.",
      "The work is credited for increasing yields of several crops, including wheat, corn and beans, but it has been especially affective on soybeans. Brazil has since become the world's largest soybean producer, surpassing the United States and Argentina.",
      "Although Hungria's research could be applied on farms in other countries, soybean production in the U.S. is different than it is in Brazil; American farmers typically rotate crops on their land between growing corn and soybeans. Enough nitrate fertilizer applied to corn still remains in the soil when soybeans are planted that little or no fertilizer needs to be applied, Hungria said.",
      "Brazilian agricultural companies have faced fierce criticism for clearing forested land to create farmland, largely to grow soybeans.",
      "Much of that criticism is justified, Hungria said, but she added that her biological approach builds up the soil and makes further encroachment into forested areas less necessary.",
      "\u201cIf you manage the crop well, the crop will enrich the soil with nitrogen. Soil health improves if you do the right things,\u201d she said.",
      "Hungria will be awarded her prize at an annual October gathering in Des Moines, Iowa, of agricultural researchers and officials from around the world.",
      "Gebisa Ejeta, chair of the World Food Prize Laureate Selection Committee, credited Hungria for her \u201cextraordinary scientific achievements\u201d that have transformed agriculture in South America.",
      "\"Her brilliant scientific work and her committed vision for advancing sustainable crop production to feed humanity with judicious use of chemical fertilizer inputs and biological amendments has gained her global recognition both at home and abroad,\u201d Ejeta said in a statement.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Major social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and X have failed to protect LGBTQ+ users from hate and harassment, in part, because they intentionally rolled back previous safety practices, the advocacy group GLAAD said Tuesday in its annual Social Media Safety Index.",
      "The report said that recent \u201cunprecedented hate speech policy rollbacks\u201d from Instagram and Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google's YouTube are \u201cactively undermining the safety of LGBTQ people\u201d both online and offline. Meta\u2019s rollback now allows users to call LGBTQ people \u201cmentally ill,\u201d among other policy changes.",
      "The scorecard assigns numeric ratings to each platform with regard to LGBTQ safety, privacy, and expression. Elon Musk's X received the lowest score at 30 out of 100, while TikTok came in highest at 56. Meta's Facebook, Instagram, Threads and Google's YouTube were in the 40s. The group's methodology has changed since last year, so the scores are not directly comparable to previous reports.",
      "\u201cAt a time when real-world violence and harassment against LGBTQ people is on the rise, social media companies are profiting from the flames of anti-LGBTQ hate instead of ensuring the basic safety of LGBTQ users,\" said Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD's president and CEO.",
      "While X has received the lowest scores since Musk's takeover of the platform in 2022 \u2014 when it was called Twitter \u2014 Meta's backslide can largely be attributed to its recent policy shift. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that Meta is removing restrictions on topics like immigration and gender \u201cthat are out of touch with mainstream discourse,\u201d citing \u201crecent elections\u201d as a catalyst. GLAAD calls the rollback \u201dparticularly extreme.\"",
      "Representatives for Meta, TikTok and X did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Monday afternoon.",
      "GLAAD said Google recently removed \u201cgender identity and expression\u201d from YouTube's list of protected characteristic groups, which suggests that the platform is \"no longer protecting transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming people from hate and discrimination.\"",
      "Google says this is not the case.",
      "\u201cWe confirmed earlier this year our hate speech policy hasn\u2019t changed. We have strict policies against content that promotes hatred or violence against members of the LGBTQ+ community and we continue to be vigilant in our efforts to quickly detect and remove this content,\u201d Google said in a statement.",
      "Although GLAAD acknowledges Google's statement, the organization stresses that gender identity has not been restored as a protected characteristic on YouTube's hate speech policy page.",
      "\u201cYouTube should reverse this dangerous policy change and update its \u2018Hate Speech\u2019 policy to expressly include gender identity and expression as a protected characteristic,\u201d the report says.",
      "GLAAD's report makes policy recommendations for protecting LGBTQ users, though it's unclear if the platforms will take these up, given that many have rolled back such protections. For instance, GLAAD says platforms should protect LGBTQ people from hate, harassment and violence, prohibit targeted misgendering and \u201cdeadnaming\u201d of transgender users and explain steps it takes to stop wrongfully removing or demonetizing legitimate accounts and content related to LGBTQ topics.",

      "\"We have made progress,\" Orleans Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said during a press briefing. \"Today, three of the escapees are now in custody. We have active leads on the others.\"",
      "\"People are talking. We appreciate that,\" the official said, highlighting that one of the arrests came directly from a Crime Stoppers tip. \"The second person that we got into custody was actually an actual Crime Stopper tip.\"",
      "Initially, officials said 11 had escaped, but officials didn't realize one had just been transferred to another cell.",
      "Eight inmates remain at large, including four men -- Corey Boyd, Lenton Vanburen, Jermaine Donald and Derrick Groves -- who are charged with second-degree murder, officials said.",
      "Some of the inmates began tampering with a locked cell door at 12:22 a.m. Friday and were seen on surveillance footage entering the cell about 20 minutes later, according to Major Silas Phipps with the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office.",
      "The 10 inmates exited the jail through a wall behind a toilet at 1:01 a.m., according to Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson. They then made their way off the property through a loading dock door and scaled the perimeter wall using blankets to protect themselves from the barbed wire, Phipps said. From there, they had a clear path to railroad tracks and then the interstate.",
      "The sheriff's office showed surveillance video uncovered during their investigation into the breach that showed the inmates jarring open a sliding door on a cell, fleeing from the loading dock and running crossing Interstate 10. Their orange jail uniform was found abandoned in a neighborhood near I-10, authorities said.",
      "\"We have the indication that these detainees received assistance in their escape from inside our department,\" Hutson said at a press conference Friday.",
      "\"It's almost impossible -- not completely -- but almost impossible for anybody to get out of this facility without help from the outside,\" Hutson said.",
      "The men were discovered missing during a routine headcount at the Orleans Justice Center at approximately 8:30 a.m. local time Friday, according to Major Silas Phipps with the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office.",
      "The United States Marshals, Louisiana State Police and Probation and Parole were notified by 9:30 a.m., the sheriff's office said. New Orleans police officials said they were notified at 10:30 a.m.",
      "\"These folks that were able to get out did so because of defective locks on the cells,\" Hutson said.",
      "\"There's no way people can get out of this facility without some lapse,\" Hutson said. \"We intend to find out exactly what happened.\"",

      "Cuts to Medicaid could increase the number of uninsured.",
      "Key components of the bill to fund President Donald Trump's agenda looks to provide major tax breaks by cutting spending elsewhere, including massive cuts to Medicaid.",
      "Medicaid is a joint federal and state health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) works with state programs to administer Medicaid, under which more than 71.2 million people are enrolled.",
      "Medicaid offers benefits including nursing home care, personal care services and assistance paying for premiums and other costs, according to CMS.",
      "An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates cuts to Medicaid could increase the number of people without health insurance by at least 8.6 million by 2034.",
      "\"Medicaid is an important safety net for so many Americans,\" Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association, told ABC News. \"When we look at the most vulnerable and most underserved, it's going to impact these groups disproportionately.\"",
      "Many Republicans have insisted that cuts to Medicaid are only to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse and will not result in lost coverage for those who need it, which was repeated during testimony this week by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "But some Americans who rely on Medicaid for their own coverage, or coverage for their families, told ABC News they're worried that cuts could reduce their ability to receive health care, or force them to choose between paying for coverage or paying for necessities.",
      "'I feel very scared'",
      "Rosa Andresen, from Southgate, California, has been her 27-year-old daughter's caregiver for the past 13 years.",
      "Her daughter, Amanda, is disabled and has conditions including cerebral palsy and a seizure disorder. Over a decade ago, Andresen left her job at a data entry retrieval company to care for her daughter full time.",
      "Andresen, 54, said Amanda is covered by Medicare and Medicaid, which has helped pay for diapers, seizure medication and mobility tools such as a shower chair and a ramp to help her go up and down stairs.",
      "It's unclear if Amanda would lose Medicaid coverage under the new proposal but, if she did, it would be a massive blow to her care, Andresen said.",
      "\"It's very devastating,\" Andresen told ABC News. \"I'm very, very sad, and I feel very scared for my daughter's well-being. It could drastically affect her health and her life, the quality of life that she has.\"",
      "Andresen said she is scared that she will receive a letter in the mail telling her that her daughter is no longer eligible for Medicaid or she'll take Amanda to a doctor's appointment and find out that her daughter cannot receive care there or can no longer be prescribed a certain medication.",
      "She said she has tried to see if she could get private insurance for her daughter, such as through her husband's job, but insurance companies allegedly told her they don't cover people with chronic illnesses.",
      "According to the HHS, \"health insurers can no longer charge more or deny coverage to you or your child because of a pre-existing health condition like asthma, diabetes, or cancer, as well as pregnancy\".",
      "While California does have Medi-Cal, which is the state's implementation of the federal Medicaid program, Andresen said she doesn't know what the program would cover and what she would have to pay out of pocket.",
      "\"I use government assistance to buy food, like the [electronic benefit transfer], to put food at my table and if I have to also use money out of my pocket, I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it if I [have to] decide to buy my daughter's medication or put food on the table,\" Andresen said.",
      "Work requirements could jeopardize care",
      "Four years ago, Jodie Montplaisir, a mother-of-five from North Hampton, Massachusetts, was struggling with opioid use disorder. She was unhoused, unemployed and separated from her children.",
      "Montplaisir said she realized she had hit a low point and needed help. She entered an opioid treatment program (OTP), paid for by Medicaid.",
      "\"I really just was like, 'I need to fix my life,' and I did,\" Montplaisir, 38, told ABC News. \"I really stuck in with the clinic and doing all of the meetings, all the groups, all my therapy, just really utilizing the clinic \u2026 and they really helped me.\"",
      "Montplaisir is now three years into her recovery, currently living in an apartment, reunited with her children and has a job working with unhoused people.",
      "Medicaid currently covers her medication-assisted treatment, and she attends clinic weekly to stay accountable. However, she fears any interruption, such as red tape or new requirements, could jeopardize her progress.",
      "\"If I didn't have Medicaid, I wouldn't have been able to do the clinic,\" she said. \"There's absolutely no way possible. If I didn't have Medicaid and the help of the system, I wouldn't have been able to do it alone.\"",
      "The Republicans' proposed bill would impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients -- at least 80 hours per month -- or require enrolling in an educational program for at least 80 hours or some combination per month.",
      "Not all Republicans are in favor the bill in its current form. A growing number of House GOP members are expressing grievances, some because they don't believe the bill does enough to protect vulnerable Americans and others because it does not include some of the most drastic cuts that Republican hardliners were pushing for.",
      "Montplaisir said if work requirements were in place when she was in OTP, it would have made it impossible for her to focus on her recovery, and it will make it difficult for the unhoused people she now works with.",
      "While the draft language has exemptions for certain adults, including those who have substance use disorder, Montplaisir worries proving an exemption could be complex and may result in lost coverage anyway.",
      "Additionally, trying to prove work requirements as opposed to focusing on recovery could derail people's progress, she said.",
      "\"Medicaid is there to help us ... how we supposed to work if we're trying to get sober?\" Montplaisir said. \"If I had to have paid money while I'm trying to get sober or having to work while I'm trying to get sober, it wouldn't work.\"",

      "The tanks are a key part of a parade that will honor the Army's 250th birthday and fall on President Donald Trump's 79th birthday. Since it was announced, the parade has grown in scope and participation, and one of the highlights will be columns of tanks rolling in formation along Constitution Avenue. Each Abrams tank can weigh 60 tons or more and carry a crew of four.",
      "Concerns over the tanks' weight, and what that would do to D.C.\u2018s streets, ultimately kept them from being used for a parade during Trump\u2019s first term. The metal plates are seen as the best way to protect the streets Each plate weighs hundreds of pounds and will be placed at points along the parade route where the tanks will turn \u2014 and where their metal and rubber-shoed tracking that helps them move can do the most damage, the official said.",
      "In April, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said if the tanks are used on the city's roads, funding to repair the damage they may do should also be part of the plan. Her office was not immediately available for comment on Friday.",
      "Movement of a single M1 Abrams tank is a loud affair \u2014 movement of 25 in unison is expected to be thunderous, the official said.",
      "The parade and celebration will likely cost between $25 million and $45 million, a White House official told The Associated Press. It will involve thousands of troops also marching in formation, in uniforms representing every U.S. conflict dating back to the Revolutionary War, which began in 1775.",
      "Each war will have 60 troops in period costume, followed by 400 troops from that same unit in their regular battle dress uniforms.

      "State efforts to stamp out diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are accelerating during Donald Trump's second term",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Republican-led states are accelerating efforts to stamp out diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, expanding from higher education to other government functions since President Donald Trump fully embraced the movement.",
      "Governors and lawmakers this year have about doubled last year's actions targeting DEI initiatives, which had roughly doubled those of 2023, according to an Associated Press analysis aided by the bill-tracking software Plural.",
      "The surge comes as Trump's executive orders seeking to halt DEI initiatives ripple through the federal government, universities and schools, despite legal challenges.",
      "\"The federal attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion from the Trump administration have further cleared the path for conservative state legislators,\u201d said Shaun Harper, a professor of education, business and public policy at the University of Southern California who founded the National DEI Defense Coalition.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing the multiplication of the anti-DEI effort literally everywhere,\u201d Harper added.",
      "Details vary by state, but many efforts contain at least some aspects of a four-pronged plan outlined two years ago by a pair of conservative think tanks. The legislative model promoted by the Manhattan Institute and the Goldwater Institute focused on higher education, seeking to abolish DEI offices and staff, end mandatory diversity training, ban compulsory diversity statements and outlaw racial or sexual preferences in hiring and admissions.",
      "Now Republican-led states are using the same model to prohibit DEI initiatives in state and local governments.",
      "\u201cDespite the Trump administration taking action, the states cannot rely on the federal government to root out DEI for them,\u201d said Timothy Minella, senior fellow at the Goldwater Institute.",
      "Efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion have existed for years in higher education institutions, businesses and government bureaucracies. Supporters say such initiatives benefit everyone by helping people navigate diverse societies and understand people's differing viewpoints and experiences. Their goal is to promote student bodies and workplaces where everyone feels valued.",
      "That is why some DEI offices have tailored services to people of particular races, genders, sexual orientations and cultures and disabilities. Some institutions also have factored in equity goals when admitting students, providing scholarships or making employment decisions, to try to reflect society at large.",
      "Findings in a poll conducted earlier this month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research show that while \u201cDEI\u201d has become a politically toxic term for many Americans, some components of DEI programs have much less opposition.",
      "The poll found about 4 in 10 Americans \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favor DEI programs in colleges and universities, while about 3 in 10 oppose those initiatives and about 3 in 10 are neutral.",
      "Support is higher for courses on racism and scholarships for students of color, among other services designed to help students from underrepresented groups.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration required diversity and equity goals in various government programs.",
      "Trump has reversed those efforts, denouncing DEI policies as a form of discrimination that threatens merit-based decision-making. The Republican roll-back gained momentum after the Supreme Court in 2023 struck down racial affirmative action in college admissions. With Trump's return to the presidency, a growing number of businesses have voluntarily withdrawn their DEI programs.",
      "There is no universal definition about what\u2019s covered by those initiatives. But most state laws and gubernatorial orders focus on initiatives related to race, ethnicity, gender or sex.",
      "Some measures, such bills passed in Oklahoma and Wyoming, further narrow their definition of DEI activities to those that grant preferential or differential treatment of individuals based on such factors.",
      "The state measures don\u2019t typically mention people with disabilities, military veterans or those from lower-income households, even though they might also be included in an institution's equity efforts, said Paulette Granberry Russell, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education.",
      "\u201cDiversity, equity and inclusion efforts extends well beyond race, gender and sexuality, but it has been framed in ways that targets those populations and demonize those populations,\u201d she said.",
      "Some workers targeted by Trump\u2019s anti-DEI measures claim they are being used to justify firing people who happen to be minorities and women. One class-action complaint by federal workers alleges that Trump\u2019s anti-DEI executive orders discriminate against employees who aren\u2019t white men.",
      "Limits on DEI initiatives in higher education recently approved by legislatures in Missouri and Oklahoma raise the total number of similar state laws and gubernatorial orders to two dozen since 2023. That includes bills passed earlier this year in Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wyoming. More are under consideration in additional states.",
      "The Missouri measures show the growth of the movement. A provision limiting DEI in higher education got left out of the state budget last year. But it got included this year after new Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe issued an order barring executive agencies from using state funds on DEI positions and activities.",
      "New laws in Tennessee, West Virginia and Wyoming target DEI initiatives in state and local governments as well as higher education.",
      "More governors are issuing directives now.",
      "On his first day in office in West Virginia in January, Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey ordered an end to DEI staff positions and activities that grant preferential treatment based on race, ethnicity or sex in executive departments and state-funded institutions. On his second day, Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Braun issued a similar order. Kehoe's anti-DEI order came in his second month as Missouri governor.",
      "Texas was among the first states in 2023 to legislate against spending on DEI programs in higher education. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott expanded upon that this year, ordering all state agencies to \u201ccomply with the color-blind guarantee\u201d of the U.S. and state constitutions. His executive order described DEI concepts as \u201cblatant efforts to divide people\u201d with \u201cnew forms of racism.\u201d",
      "A new Idaho law signed by Republican Gov. Brad Little not only bans DEI offices and programs in higher education but also addresses what's taught in the classroom. It prohibits colleges and universities from requiring students to take DEI-related courses to meet graduation requirements, unless they're pursuing degrees in race or gender studies.",
      "It's the first such law nationally, according to the Goldwater Institute, which teamed up with Speech First to develop a model they describe as the \u201cFreedom from Indoctrination Act.\u201d DEI opponents are hoping more states will soon follow.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to get rid of the DEI mandates for general education and programs in order to get a degree,\" Minella said.",

    "summary": "As FEMA prepares for hurricane season starting on Jun 1, the agency is ill-prepared, according to an internal document obtained by ABC News.",
    "story": [
      "The acting agency head told staff that planning is about 80-85% complete.",
      "The acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency told staff members on Thursday that he believes President Donald Trump is a bold man with a bold vision for the agency -- but that FEMA doesn't yet have a full plan to tackle hurricane season.",
      "\"I would say we're about 80 or 85% there,\" Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson told staff on a conference call, parts of which were obtained by ABC. \"The next week, we will close that gap and get to probably 97-98% of a plan. We'll never have 100% of a plan. Even if we did have 100% of a plan, a plan never survives first contact. However, we will do our best to make sure that the plan is all-encompassing.\"",
      "The conference call came after an internal document prepared for Richardson as he takes the helm of the agency responsible for managing federal disasters indicated the agency was ill-prepared for the upcoming hurricane season, which starts on June 1.",
      "\"As FEMA transforms to a smaller footprint, the intent for this hurricane season is not well understood, thus FEMA is not ready,\" according to the document, which was obtained by ABC News.",
      "In the conference call, Richardson said he and staff sat down for \"about 90 minutes\" and started to come up with a plan for this year's disaster season.",
      "He said the plan would be ready soon.",
      "\"Listen closely: The intent for disaster season 2025 (is to) safeguard the American people, return primacy to the states, strengthen their capability to respond and recover, and coordinate federal assistance when deemed necessary, while transforming to the future of FEMA,\" Richardson said.",
      "Richardson was placed at FEMA by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after former acting Administrator Cam Hamilton was fired last week because of his testimony in front of a House panel, according to a source familiar with the matter, which went against the shuttering of the agency.",
      "The acting administrator said this version of FEMA will look different than the agency of the past.",
      "\u201cThe president\u2019s intent for FEMA is to ensure that FEMA is only doing the things in law that it should be doing,\u201d he said during the conference call, adding there is a \u201clarge push\u201d to get resources to the states.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine that makes FEMA look very, very different. What it's going to look like in the end, we'll find out,\u201d he told staff. \u201cRemember, the president's a bold man. The president has a bold vision, he makes bold statements.\"",
      "The earlier document about the agency's hurricane planning said that staffing limitations, hiring and a lack of coordination with states will also impact FEMA's operations heading into hurricane season.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told ABC News earlier that the information in the document is \"grossly out of context.\"",
      "\"You are referencing one line on a nineteen-page slide deck and the unsubstantiated opinion of one official inside the agency,\" a DHS spokesperson said. \"The slide was used during a daily meeting Acting Administrator David Richardson has held every day titled Hurricane Readiness Complex Problem Solving. In other words, exactly what the head of an emergency management agency should be doing before Hurricane Season. This is just another example of a long line of internal leaks from people who clearly couldn't care less about Americans facing disaster and prefer to manufacture petty drama for their own self-aggrandizement. Under Secretary Noem's leadership, and the efforts of Acting Administrator Richardson FEMA is fully activated in preparation for Hurricane Season.\"",
      "At his first all-hands meeting last week, Richardson told employees to not get in his way when he is trying to achieve the president's objectives, a source told ABC News.",
      "\"Don't get in my way if you're those 20% of the people,\" he told employees last Friday morning, according to a source with knowledge of the meeting. \"I know all the tricks.\"",
      "\"Obfuscation. Delay. Undermining. If you're one of those 20% of the people and you think those tactics and techniques are going to help you, they will not because I will run right over you,\" he said, according to a source with knowledge of the meeting. \"I will achieve the president's intent. I am as bent on achieving the president's intent as I was on making sure that I did my duty when I took my Marines to Iraq.\"",
      "Morale at FEMA has been sinking since Noem said she was going to eliminate the agency, according to sources within the agency.",
      "Noem was pressed during a House panel on Wednesday about whether she has a plan to eliminate FEMA. She said she didn't have a plan, but said the White House would be coming forward with a plan.",
      "\"There is no formalized final plan for how this goes forward, because the input of Congress is critically important,\" she told Rep. Bennie Thompson.",

      "A new book that alleges White House aides covered up Biden's physical and mental decline has put the questions about Biden's health back in the spotlight, months after former Vice President Kamala Harris lost to President Donald Trump. Several potential Democratic contenders for the 2028 nomination in recent days have been asked whether they believe Biden was declining in office or whether he should have sought reelection before a disastrous debate performance led to his withdrawal.",

Trump has done his best to prevent that \u2014 mentioning Biden's name an average of six times per day during his first 100 days in office, according to an NBC News analysis \u2014 and Republicans have followed his lead, betting that voters frustrated by Trump's policy moves will still prefer him over memories of an unpopular presidency.",

Three-quarters of Americans \u2014 and 69% of Democrats \u2014 said in August 2023 that they believed Biden was too old to serve as president for another four-year term.",

      "After major potential Republican candidates for key U.S. Senate races in 2026 passed on running, some Republicans are split on whether their party is struggling to recruit competitive Senate candidates.",
      "There are 35 Senate seats up for election in 2026 -- 33 in regular elections and two in special elections. Two of them, in Georgia and Michigan, could be a toss-up after two high-profile Republicans opted not to run in 2026, while seats in Minnesota and New Hampshire being vacated lean Democratic, and two seats from incumbents in Maine and North Carolina lean Republican, according to the Cook Political Report.",
      "Republicans currently hold 53 seats to Democrats' 45. Two independents caucus with Democrats.",
      "\"My goal is to stay in the majority; my stretch goal is to add seats. \u2026 I'd like to be at 55,\" Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, recently told Axios.",

      "Some Republicans have pointed to Kemp's decision, and to a lesser extent Sununu's, as signs that Republicans are having challenges recruiting centrist candidates who would appeal to voters statewide. Some have also felt that candidates who appear too tied to Trump or too right-wing will struggle in statewide races even if they clear the primary, if the White House and Trump continue to face backlash toward policies and federal government cuts.",

      "As for concerns over public opinion of Trump, the operative also pointed to Trump's win in Georgia in 2024 and enthusiasm among Republicans in New Hampshire and noted that both the White House and candidates will continue to engage voters in the midterm elections to motivate them to turn out regardless of candidate.",
      "Mahoney, separately, pointed to how even though the party in power usually performs worse in a midterm election, news around the economy and other issues is constantly shifting and no one can predict yet if Trump's presidency and agenda by 2026 will be popular or \"an albatross.\"",

      "\"They said the same thing about Donald Trump when he ran in 2016, and they said the same thing about it in 2024. People back in Georgia, they know that's a lie,\" Greene told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "She added in her post on Friday, \"Beating Jon Ossoff? That would be easy.\"",
      "The NRSC has indicated it'll consider getting involved in Senate primaries on a case-by-case basis. Scott, who chairs the NRSC, told Fox News in February, \"Whatever is in the best interest of the voters in each state, I will make a state-by-state decision on how we play and where we play.\"",
      "\"Republicans are working as one team with President Trump to deliver for the American people, protect our Majority in 2026, and hold Senate Democrats and candidates in Georgia, Michigan and New Hampshire accountable for their radical, out-of-touch priorities,\" NRSC Communications Director Joanna Rodriguez said in a statement to ABC News.",
      "On the other side of the aisle, Democrats have been celebrating Kemp's decision, thinking that it puts them in a strong position to take on whoever challenges Ossoff. Democrats have also said they think they can expand their Senate map, and that they intend to play in as many seats as they can.",
      "But the Democratic Party, as it faces low approval ratings and continues to digest its heavy losses in 2024, faces a very challenging Senate map in 2026.",

      "\"Senate Democrats are positioned to win seats in 2026 as midterm backlash driven by rising costs and threats to Social Security and Medicaid drags down Republican Senate candidates and puts their majority at risk,\" Maeve Coyle, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told ABC News in a statement.",
      "But some Democrats are less bullish. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate in 2024, said recently that he does not feel confident Democrats will be able to win the Senate in 2026.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A humanities federation and a state council have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to reverse local funding cuts made by Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Portland, Oregon, by the Federation of State Humanities Councils and the Oregon Council for the Humanities, names DOGE, its acting administrator, Amy Gleason, and the NEH among the defendants.",
      "The plaintiffs ask the court to \"stop this imminent threat to our nation\u2019s historic and critical support of the humanities by restoring funding appropriated by Congress.\" It notes the \u201cdisruption and attempted destruction, spearheaded by DOGE,\u201d of a partnership between the state and the federal government to support the humanities.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Thursday, maintains that DOGE and the National Endowment for the Humanities exceeded their authority in terminating funding mandated by Congress.",
      "DOGE shut down the funding and laid off more than 80% of the staff at the NEH in April as part of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump.",
      "The humanities is just one of many areas that have been affected as Trump's Republican administration has targeted cultural establishments including the Smithsonian Institution,the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the National Endowment of the Arts. The moves are part of Trump's goals to downsize the federal government and end initiatives seen as promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, which he calls \"discrimination.\u201d",
      "The humanities groups' lawsuit said DOGE brought the core work of the humanities councils \u201cto a screeching halt\" this spring when it terminated its grant program.",
      "The filing is the most recent lawsuit filed by humanities groups and historical, research and library associations to try to stop funding cuts and the dissolution of federal agencies and organizations.",
      "The funding freeze for the humanities comes when state councils and libraries have been preparing programming for the summer and beginning preparations for celebrations meant to commemorate next year's 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Requests for comment Friday from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the White House were not immediately returned.",

      "Idaho police earlier Friday listed Jian Shi, 56, of Shanghai, as among the dead but later corrected their statement to say Shi sustained injuries but survived the crash. Police said the first statement should have included Li as among the dead.",
      "There were 14 people in the van. Of the 13 passengers, 12 had Chinese nationality and one was Italian, police said. Survivors were taken to nearby hospitals with injuries.",
      "The truck\u2019s driver also died. Authorities earlier identified him as Isaih Moreno of Humble, Texas.",

      "NEW YORK -- Testimony in the sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs began this week, opening a window into what prosecutors say was the sordid world of group sex, drugs and violence beneath the glittering, jet set persona cultivated by the Bad Boy Records founder.",
      "Much of the testimony was hard to watch. Combs' ex-girlfriend, Cassie, recounted being beaten and pressured into degrading sexual performances with strangers.",
      "Here are five key moments from the trial, which resumes Monday:",
      "Lawyer Teny Geragos took a novel approach to defending Combs in her opening statement.",
      "She conceded the hip-hop impresario has a \u201cbad temper\u201d and is prone to violent outbursts that are often fueled by alcohol, jealousy and drugs.",
      "But she maintained that while his actions might have warranted domestic violence charges, they aren\u2019t proof he engaged in sex trafficking and racketeering \u2014 the charges he faces.",
      "Geragos argued that Combs\u2019 sexual habits were part of a swinger lifestyle involving consenting adults and reminded jurors that \u201ckinky\u201d sexual predilections don\u2019t equate to sex trafficking.",
      "\u201cSean Combs is a complicated man. But this is not a complicated case,\" she said. \u201cThis case is about love, jealousy, infidelity and money.\u201d",
      "The packed courtroom fell silent when jurors were shown security camera video of Combs assaulting Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.",
      "The video depicts Cassie, an R&B singer, headed down a hallway toward the hotel\u2019s elevators just before Combs rounds a corner, strikes her and throws her to the ground before kicking her and then dragging her back toward their hotel room.",
      "Jurors also viewed photographs of damage in the hotel hallway, including flowers strewn on the floor and soil spattered against a wall. Later, as Cassie testified about the attack, they were shown photos of the musician\u2019s swollen lip.",
      "The trial\u2019s first witness was a former security guard at the hotel. Israel Florez testified Combs attempted to bribe him, holding out a stack of money with a $100 on top, telling him: \u201cDon\u2019t tell nobody.\u201d",
      "Florez said he responded: \u201cI don\u2019t want your money. Just go back into your room.\u201d",
      "The \u201cMe & U\u201d singer, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, testified that Combs was into voyeurism and dictated every aspect of sex events he dubbed \u201cfreak-offs.\u201d",
      "The highly orchestrated affairs, which Combs also called \u201cwild king nights\u201d or \u201chotel nights,\" involved male sex workers, heavy drug use and copious lubrication.",
      "\u201cIt was his fantasy,\u201d Cassie said.",
      "Cassie said each \u201cfreak-off\u201d involved about 10 large bottles of baby oil -- heated up.",
      "\u201cIt was such a mess,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018What are we doing?\u2019\u201d",
      "She said Combs also asked her to perform degrading and painful sex acts with male sex workers.",
      "Cassie said eventually she was doing \u201cfreak-offs\u201d weekly for a decade, with the final one in 2017 or 2018.",
      "\u201cThe freak-offs became a job,\u201d Cassie recounted.",
      "She said she felt she couldn't refuse because she feared the videos would be made public.",
      "Jurors also heard from Daniel Phillip, who said he was a professional stripper paid to have sex with Cassie while Combs gave instructions. He testified that he once saw Combs drag Cassie by her hair as she screamed.",
      "Defense lawyers, during their cross examination of Cassie, sought to cast the musician as an enthusiastic participant in the sex marathons.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always ready to freak off,\u201d she wrote in one 2009 message read in court.",
      "Later that year, however, Cassie expressed frustration with the state of their relationship and told Combs she needed something more from him than sex.",
      "In a 2017 text message, Cassie told Combs: \u201cI love our FOs when we both want it,\u201d using the initials of freak-off. On the stand, Cassie explained: \u201cI would say loving FOs were just words at that point.\u201d",
      "The former cast member on Combs\u2019 MTV reality show \u201cMaking the Band\" testified that she saw Combs physically attack Cassie on multiple occasions.",
      "During a 2009 incident in his home, Richard said Combs tried to strike Cassie in the head with a black skillet before he put his arm around her neck and dragged her up the stairs.",
      "\u201cI was scared for her and scared to do anything,\" she said. \u201cI had never seen anything like that before.\u201d",
      "Richard, who was later a member of the Combs' band Diddy \u2014 Dirty Money, sued the producer last year, accusing him of physical abuse, groping, and psychological abuse during the years they worked together. His representative denied the claims at the time.",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Monica Truax has lived in her Portland home since 1992, on a cul-de-sac she described as a close-knit community. But since a bottle redemption center opened next door several years ago, her block has struggled with drug dealing, garbage and fights in the middle of the night, she said.",
      "\u201cIt's just all completely changed,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the people are all still here, you know, all the residents are here still, and still raising their families.\u201d",
      "After more than five decades, Oregon's first-in-the-nation \u201cbottle bill\u201d \u2014 now replicated in nine other states \u2014 faces a potential overhaul, with lawmakers considering new time restrictions on bottle redemption sites that some say have become magnets for drugs and homelessness.",
      "The trailblazing law to reduce littering by incentivizing recycling helped cement the state's reputation as a leader in the emerging environmental movement. It has also become a financial security net for many, including those experiencing homelessness.",
      "The legislation echoes calls to modernize the bottle bill, with some saying changes are needed to address unintended consequences.",
      "\u201cHe did not envision this,\u201d Truax said of former Oregon Gov. Tom McCall, who signed the bottle bill into law. \u201cIt\u2019s just a mess.\u201d",
      "Consumers originally paid a 5-cent deposit on each eligible bottle or can, then collected the deposit when they redeemed the empty container at a retailer, such as a supermarket or convenience store.",
      "Over the years, the program has expanded accepted containers and increased the deposit to 10 cents. Twenty-seven centers exclusively for returns have been opened across the state.",
      "California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Vermont and the U.S. territory of Guam followed Oregon in adopting the concept, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "In Oregon, people can sign up for accounts in which their refunds are deposited or choose cash redemptions. Some stores count containers by hand. Other sites have counting machines or areas where account holders can drop off bags of containers.",
      "The deposit has not kept pace with inflation \u2014 5 cents in 1971 would be equal to 40 cents today, according to the Consumer Price Index\u2019s inflation calculator \u2014 but many low-income residents rely on it.",
      "Stores must accept container returns when they are open, and owners of all-night convenience stores, particularly in Portland, say they're concerned about employee safety.",
      "In an op-ed for The Oregonian/OregonLive last year, Jonathan Polonsky, president and CEO of the Plaid Pantry chain of convenience stores, wrote that fentanyl was selling for less than $1 a pill and \u201ca small number of cans add up to enough to buy drugs.\u201d",
      "People redeeming containers at night \"may be belligerent and intimidating, presenting a major safety risk to our store associates who have no choice under Oregon\u2019s Bottle Bill to handle returns at that hour,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Truax, who lives with her husband in northeast Portland, said homeless encampments and people relieving themselves in public were among the many things she had witnessed on her block.",
      "\u201cI've seen it all,\u201d she said, describing the scourge of fentanyl as \u201cthe cherry on the sundae.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's just sad,\" she added.",
      "At the bottle redemption center near Truax's home, Chris Grass waited with his father and girlfriend in the long line outside the door. They each redeemed the maximum amount of 350 containers per person per day for $105 in cash to help pay for gas and provide some extra money for things like cigarettes and coffee while he's unemployed, he said.",
      "\u201cA lot of people don't like people that go out and can,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it's actually good for the environment.\"",
      "In 2023, roughly 87% of eligible containers were returned for redemption, according to the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission. That was the highest rate in the nation that year, according to the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative, which operates the bottle bill program on behalf of its distributor members.",
      "The bill being considered by lawmakers would allow stores across the state to refuse container returns after 8 p.m.",
      "In Portland, it would allow for \u201calternative\u201d redemption sites, including possible mobile sites such as trucks that travel to different neighborhoods. Nonprofits would run the alternative sites for people who redeem containers every day, relieving the pressure on retailers, particularly downtown.",
      "Stores in an area with an alternative drop site could limit or refuse hand-counted returns, with convenience stores specifically allowed to stop them at 6 p.m.",
      "The proposal is supported by retailers as well as groups like the Ground Score Association, whose members include \u201ccanners\u201d and waste pickers who collect containers for income. The association operates a Portland redemption center under a bridge called The People's Depot that processes some 38,000 containers daily, according to its website.",
      "It has pushed back against claims that the bottle bill fuels the fentanyl crisis and says most people redeeming bottles need the money to make ends meet.",

      "House Republicans are in the final rounds of negotiations over a sweeping budget plan that has been significantly influenced by President Donald Trump's priorities",
      "WASHINGTON -- Days before Republicans unveiled their sweeping tax cut plan, the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee had one last person to consult. He went to the White House, where he and President Donald Trump went over the legislation \u201cline by line.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was very happy with what we\u2019re delivering,\u201d said Rep. Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri.",
      "Trump had every reason to be pleased. His imprint is all over on the bill making its way through the House, starting with its title \u2014 the \u201c One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\u201d",
      "The legislation realizes many of Trump's campaign promises, temporarily ending taxes on overtime and tips for many workers, creating a new $10,000 tax break on auto loan interest for American-made cars, and even creating a new tax-free \u201cMAGA account\u201d \u2014 a nod to his \u201dMake America Great Again\" movement, but in this case, it means \u201cMoney Accounts for Growth and Advancement.\u201d This would contribute $1,000 to children born in his second term.",
      "The Trump-inspired contours of the legislative package, months if not years in the making, reflect not only the president's considerable influence over the Republican Party, but also the hard political realities in the House, where Republicans have only the barest of majorities and often find it difficult to find consensus without Trump's involvement.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., effectively owes his job to Trump and has kept in constant contact with him during the negotiations, including during his overseas trip this week.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s excited about our forward progress,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou know, I keep him apprised of the developments, and he\u2019s had a busy time over there in the Middle East, and it\u2019s been good \u2014 he\u2019s in good spirits and we\u2019re in good spirits.\u201d",
      "The Republican bill runs a whopping 1,116 pages and includes more than $5 trillion in tax cuts, costs that are partially offset by spending cuts elsewhere and other changes in the tax code. The legislation would make permanent the tax cuts from Trump's first term while reducing funding for programs involving food assistance, college financing and environmental protection.",
      "As talks over the bill have progressed, divisions have emerged among Republicans, particularly between fiscal hawks most concerned about federal deficits and others more focused on the impact of cuts back home.",
      "That's where Trump usually comes in, playing the \u201ccloser\u201d who turns no votes to yes.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has gone out of his way to ask us: \u2018Are there any members you want me to call? Anybody that you want me to talk to?\u2019 And he calls them right then,\" said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La. \"He\u2019s been incredibly hands-on and incredibly helpful at getting the bill to where it is.\u201d",
      "Trump's involvement seems certain to grow as Johnson labors to get the tax package through the House by a self-imposed Memorial Day deadline.",
      "Conservatives slowed the process Friday, refusing to advance the tax package out of the House Budget Committee until it includes faster implementation of Medicaid changes and a more wholesale repeal of Biden-era green energy credits. They vowed to hold firm until their demands are met.",
      "Trump took notice, applying pressure even before the gavel went down on the failed committee vote.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t need \u2018GRANDSTANDERS\u2019 in the Republican Party,\" Trump wrote on social media. \"STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!\u201d",
      "Negotiations were expected to stretch through the weekend, with the Budget Committee reconvening late Sunday night in hopes of a breakthrough.",
      "Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, predicted the tax package will ultimately get over the finish line once Trump \u2014 just returning from a tour of the Middle East \u2014 starts making calls to skeptical lawmakers.",
      "\u201cYou may have noticed he likes talking on the telephone,\u201d Rogers said.",
      "Added Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, \u201cI think the only way we\u2019re going to get on track with it is with Trump.\u201d",
      "The close coordination with Republican leaders stands in stark contrast to Trump's first term, when the party first enacted a slew of personal and corporate tax breaks. Republicans quickly cobbled that tax package together in late 2017 after a disastrous attempt at fulfilling their central campaign promise -- repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare.",
      "This time, White House aides have been in regular contact with GOP lawmakers as the tax bill progresses through drafts and markups, highlighting programs they aim to overhaul and provisions they\u2019d like to add or cut.",
      "The president \u201cis much more engaged in directing what happens than the first time because he and the leadership of Congress in 2017 were not seeing eye-to-eye,\" Scalise said. \"He didn\u2019t necessarily want health care to be the first thing that was done, and yet it was. This time around we talked a lot before he was sworn in to make sure we were all on the same page.\u201d",
      "Trump first began to set the course of the GOP's current legislative strategy back in January, when he posted to social media that Republicans should pass \u201cone powerful bill\u201d that would tackle all of the party\u2019s priorities instead of splitting the agenda into two packages.",
      "Senate Republicans argued for a different approach. They urged quick passage of a bill to provide billions for the Pentagon and Trump's immigration clampdown, saying a second tax package could wait until later.",
      "Trump wavered for a time, giving Republicans on Capitol Hill mixed signals over the best approach. But his original preference for one bill won out in the end, in part because House Republicans insisted their chamber could not do it any other way.",
      "Democrats uniformly oppose the package but have little power to stop it from becoming law if Republicans remain unified. As they continue to grapple with the party's losses in last year's election, Democrats have worked to mobilize public opposition to the bill, decrying it as a giveaway to the rich paid for with cuts to healthcare and other social services.",
      "Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called it \u201cone big, beautiful betrayal.\u201d",
      "Republicans, meanwhile, are eager to press ahead and get the tax package to the Senate, with hopes of getting it on Trump's desk by the Fourth of July.",
      "Burchett said that while \u201ceverybody rises up in righteous indignation\u201d over the details, Republicans will start \u201ccoming to the table\u201d once Trump is fully engaged.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like an NBA basketball game right now,\" Burchett said. \"Don\u2019t watch the game. Just wait till the last two minutes and then turn on the TV.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A decade ago, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was a volunteer organizer for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign",
      "Among Democrats on Capitol Hill, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wields far more power than New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But the progressive champions have the hearts of Democratic voters across the country.",
      "About three-quarters of Democrats have a \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d favorable view of Sanders, while about half have a favorable view of Ocasio-Cortez, according to a recent survey from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Compare them with Schumer, an establishment Democrat, who is viewed favorably by only about a third of Democrats.",
      "Nearly the entire difference in favorability ratings between Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez can be explained by voters who said they don\u2019t know enough to form an opinion of AOC. Their unfavorable ratings among Democrats were essentially the same, around 15% for both.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez, now 35, was an anonymous Sanders campaign volunteer a decade ago. Now she\u2019s perhaps the best positioned to be the 83-year-old Sanders\u2019 successor atop his progressive movement as the Democratic Partytries to position itself in Trump\u2019s America.",
      "But that role comes with risks \u2014 President Donald Trump and Republicans have long made AOC a foil, and some Democrats, progressive and moderate alike, have argued she and Sanders are too disruptive and push for unrealistic policy ideas.",
      "Sanders and AOC have long portrayed their political relationship as familial. She used to call him \u201cTio Bernie,\u201d Spanish for \u201cUncle Bernie.\u201d He recently held her hand onstage in front of a huge crowd and said, tongue in cheek, \u201cI want to say a word about my daughter.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Sanders, Anna Bahr, said Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are \u201callies, collaborators and friends who built their relationship around a shared vision.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn many ways, the congresswoman represents what Bernie has been advocating for decades: When working-class people in this country stand up against the entrenched political elite and fight to fix an economic system propelled by uncontrollable greed, they will win,\u201d Bahr said.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez returned home to the Bronx after graduating from Boston University in 2011. She was a volunteer organizer for Sanders' 2016 campaign, his first presidential run and one that built a national movement around his vision of democratic socialism, even as he lost to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",
      "When she decided to run for office herself, AOC had virtually no money but was assisted by progressive organizations, among them Brand New Congress and Justice Democrats, with ties to veterans of Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign.",
      "Sanders was quick to congratulate his virtually unknown prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in June 2018 after she defeated Rep. Joe Crowley, a member of the Democratic leadership and potential future speaker, in the primary.",
      "A month later, they campaigned together in Kansas for two progressive House candidates and sat for a joint interview on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust two years ago, we were both in St. Mary\u2019s Park in the South Bronx. I was in the crowd with thousands of other people across ages, races, creeds, incomes. And to be here two years later pushing that revolution in Kansas is pretty amazing,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said during their joint Kansas appearance.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez began her congressional career in 2019 by introducing the Green New Deal. The ambitious proposal called for transforming the U.S. economy by eliminating fossil fuels while creating national health care coverage and job guarantees, as well as high-quality education and affordable housing. It has been criticized by Republicans and many Democrats for its cost and the potential disruption that would be caused by a restructuring of the economy.",
      "It was only a nonbinding resolution, but the Green New Deal became a major issue in the 2020 Democratic primary and a lightning rod for criticism on the right, further cementing Ocasio-Cortez as a power player in Democratic politics.",
      "By late 2019, Sanders was struggling in his second White House campaign. Much of the Democratic field \u2014 notably Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 had co-opted pieces of his agenda and split the progressive coalition.",
      "Then, Sanders suffered an untimely heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas. He needed a boost, and it came from Ocasio-Cortez.",
      "She bestowed her endorsement during a rally at a park in her congressional district. She later campaigned with him in the crucial early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, and she seconded his nomination at the Democratic National Convention.",
      "As the Sanders presidential campaign floundered, Ocasio-Cortez was conflicted about whether to endorse him, according to a book published years later. Just months into her first term in Congress and already one of the best-known members of the House, she was still uncomfortable speaking to crowds and still feeling out how to build and wield her influence, aides told the authors of \u201cThe Truce: Progressives, Centrists, and the Future of the Democratic Party.\" The book was published last year and excerpted in Vanity Fair magazine.",
      "Corbin Trent, her first communications director in the House, threatened to quit when Ocasio-Cortez floated delaying the rally, according to the book. He told the authors he remembered a \u201cbig argument\" about the episode. Even as she campaigned for Sanders, she worried she'd be outshined and her star power would evaporate as quickly as it arrived.",
      "After Sanders lost the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, they continued occasional joint appearances, campaigning for progressive candidates or discussing topics such as the early response to COVID-19, union activism and climate change. As the 2024 election approached, they campaigned together for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee who replaced Biden after his debate performance.",
      "Trump's return to the White House left Democrats dejected and searching for a way forward. Sanders answered with a series of rallies he called his \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour, an attempt to push the rebuilding party to lead the working class in existential struggle against wealthy elites.",
      "After a few solo rallies, he invited AOC to come along.",
      "She introduced him, as she had years prior, as the inspiration for her own political career. But she added more depth.",
      "\u201cI know that one of the things that inspired me to run for office for the first time is that when I saw Sen. Sanders on television, and I was wiping tables down and saw the TV on and saying, every person in this country deserves health care as a human right,\" she told a crowd in Tempe, Arizona, in March. \"And I know it made me feel almost for the first time that this isn\u2019t something that we should earn. This is something that should be afforded to all of us because we are human. I just want to thank him, and so let\u2019s give him the most earthshaking round of applause.\u201d",
      "Sanders has resisted talking publicly of naming a successor while noting that he will not run for president again in 2028, when he turns 87. But holding her hand in Salt Lake City last month, he told a roaring crowd that he considered AOC to be family.",
      "\u201cNow I want to say a word about my daughter. I want to say a word about Alexandria and why what she\u2019s doing is so important,\" he said. \"Six years ago, what were you doing for a living? She was a waitress. But she looked around her and she saw a society that was fundamentally unjust and in many ways ugly to the people in the community in which she lived in New York City. She stood up and took on one of the most powerful people in the House of Representatives.\u201d",

      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has announced he will veto a measure to create a commission to study potential slavery reparations in the state",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland Gov. Wes Moore announced Friday he will veto a measure to create a commission to study potential slavery reparations in the state, saying that while it was a difficult decision, the issue already has been studied and now is the time \u201cto focus on the work itself.\u201d",
      "Moore, a Democrat who is the state's first Black governor and the only Black governor currently serving, wrote in his veto letter that he applauded the legislature's work on the bill.",
      "\u201cBut in light of the many important studies that have taken place on this issue over nearly three decades, now is the time to focus on the work itself: Narrowing the racial wealth gap, expanding homeownership, uplifting entrepreneurs of color, and closing the foundational disparities that lead to inequality \u2014 from food insecurity to education,\u201d Moore wrote.",
      "The governor also noted in his veto letter that Black politicians have risen to the highest levels of government in the state in recent years. For example, U.S. Senator Angela Alsobrooks is the state's first Black U.S. senator. Maryland also has a Black attorney general, a Black state House speaker and a Black treasurer.",
      "\u201cWe have moved in partnership with leaders across the state to uplift Black families and address racial disparities in our communities,\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cThat is the context in which I\u2019ve made this difficult decision. Because while I appreciate the work that went into this legislation, I strongly believe now is not the time for another study. Now is the time for continued action that delivers results for the people we serve.\u201d",
      "The bill was introduced in this year's legislative session as a top priority of the Legislative Black Caucus, which, with 66 members, is the largest Black caucus in the nation's state legislatures.",
      "The caucus released a statement Friday night expressing deep disappointment in the governor's veto.",
      "\u201cAt a time when the White House and Congress are actively targeting Black communities, dismantling diversity initiatives, and using harmful coded language, Governor Moore had a chance to show the country and the world that here in Maryland we boldly and courageously recognize our painful history and the urgent need to address it,\" the caucus said in the statement. \u201cInstead, the State\u2019s first Black governor chose to block this historic legislation that would have moved the state toward directly repairing the harm of enslavement.\u201d",
      "The measure passed with strong support in the General Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats. The House voted 101-36 for the bill, and the Senate approved it 32-13. Both chambers approved the measure with margins large enough to override a veto, if all members who voted for the bill decided to vote to override the governor's veto.",
      "The legislature ended its regular 90-day session last month, and it would not take up veto overrides until lawmakers gather again, whether next year's regularly scheduled 90-day session in January, or a special session this year, if one were to be called.",
      "The governor's veto was one among 23 announced by the governor late Friday afternoon.",
      "\u201cThe Senate will closely evaluate each veto from the Governor's Office and have more details on possible action in the near future,\" said David Schuhlein, a spokesman for Senate President Bill Ferguson.",
      "House Speaker Adrienne Jones issued a statement specifically on the governor's veto of creating the commission, saying \u201cI am proud of all our work during the 2025 session and grateful to lead a state that has always put these issues at the forefront of our policy discussions.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe work is not done, and I remain committed to working alongside all our partners to continue righting historical inequities,\u201d the speaker, a Democrat, added.",
      "Potential reparations outlined in the bill included official statements of apology, monetary compensation, property tax rebates, social service assistance, as well as licensing and permit fee waivers and reimbursement. Reparations also could include assistance with making a down payment on a home, business incentives, childcare, debt forgiveness and tuition payment waivers for higher education.",
      "The governor wrote in his veto letter that over the last 25 years, Maryland has launched several commissions and study groups to examine the legacy of slavery in the state, from the Maryland Lynching Truth and Reconciliation Commission to the State Commission to Coordinate the Study, Commemoration, and Impact of the History and Legacy of Slavery in Maryland.",
      "\u201cThe scholarship on this topic is both vast in scope and robust in scale,\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cAnd we are grateful for the Marylanders who have contributed their expertise to the vital project of understanding how the legacy of slavery continues to impact Black communities in our state today.\u201d",
      "Last year, California lawmakers passed some of the nation\u2019s most ambitious legislation aimed at atoning for a legacy of racist policies that drove racial disparities for Black people. None of the bills provided widespread direct payments to Black Americans. Instead, California lawmakers approved the return of land or compensation to families whose property was unjustly seized by the government, and issuing a formal apology.",
      "New York City lawmakers approved legislation last year to study the city\u2019s significant role in slavery and consider reparations to descendants of enslaved people.",

      "Slaton described being caught in an avalanche at one point, causing her to fall and hurt her leg. She didn\u2019t say which day that happened. She had a bicycle, a tent, two sleeping bags and food, she said, but she ended up losing all of her equipment, leaving her with only a lighter, a knife and some snacks.

      "Slaton had been on an extended biking and backpacking trip that also included time in Oregon, department spokesman Tony Botti said. Her journey took her to the Sierras, where she decided to make the trek to the Mono Hot Springs before meeting a friend in mid-April, he said. She was last seen on April 20 by a security camera near Huntington Lake, an unincorporated mountain community, riding on a bicycle and also sitting on a sidewalk with a backpack.",

      "The owner of Vermilion Valley Resort, Christopher Gutierrez, said his staff left cabin doors unlocked during the winter in case someone needed shelter during the frequent mountain snowstorms. His backcountry lodge sits in the Sierra Nevada about halfway between Yosemite and Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks and is a frequent stop for hikers on the John Muir and Pacific Crest trails.",

      "An indictment alleging the crimes by Maria Del Rosario Navarro Sanchez, a 39-year-old Mexican, was unsealed Friday in the Western district of Texas. It was not immediately clear if Navarro Sanchez had a lawyer.",
      "It came just days after an indictment was unsealed in San Diego against two alleged Mexican drug cartel leaders on narco-terrorism charges.",
      "Navarro Sanchez was arrested by Mexican authorities on May 4, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Office. Among the things found with her was a golden AR-15-style assault rifle.",
      "Prosecutors said Navarro Sanchez was assisting the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, one of Mexico\u2019s most powerful and violent organized crime groups. She is alleged to have conspired to give the cartel grenades, buy guns for them, smuggle cash across the border and move drugs.",
      "Two men were also charged in the indictment, though not with providing material support to a terrorist organization.",
      "In February, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel was among eight Latin American criminal groups designated as foreign terrorist organizations the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. He had called for the move in an executive order signed in January.",
      "The \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d label is unusual because it deploys a terrorist designation normally reserved for groups like al-Qaida or the Islamic State group that use violence for political ends \u2014 not for money-focused crime rings such as the Latin American cartels.",
      "The Trump administration argues that the international connections and operations of the groups \u2014 including drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and violent pushes to extend their territory \u2014 warrant the designation.",
      "The Jalisco cartel was one of six Mexican organized crime groups to receive the designation.",
      "\u201cThe arrest of Maria del Rosario Navarro Sanchez should send a clear message to people who wish to align themselves with terrorist groups that they will be sought out and held to the highest extent of the law,\u201d FBI Director Kash Patel said in the statement.",
      "Trump has made clear he wants to throw everything possible at Mexico's cartels for flooding the U.S. with fentanyl. Mexico's new administration has shown a willingness to help, pursuing cartel operations and making arrests like that of Navarro Sanchez.",

      "After a wildfire decimated a California high school\u2019s newsroom, destroying its cameras, computers and archived newspapers spanning six decades, one of the first offers of help that its journalism adviser received came from the other side of the country.",
      "Claire Smith, founding executive director of Temple University's sports media center, had known Lisa Nehus Saxon since they helped carve out a place for women journalists in Major League Baseball more than 40 years ago. They\u2019d supported each other through the days of being barred from locker rooms, and now with much of Palisades Charter High School damaged, Smith wanted to be there for her friend again.",
      "\u201cI just thought, \u2018What can we do? How can we help with healing?\u2019\u201d Smith said.",
      "Earlier this week, she traveled from Philadelphia to deliver the result of that offer: a university paper featuring the high school students\u2019 articles.",
      "Across nearly a dozen pages, the insert showcased articles on price gouging in the rental market after the wildfire and the school returning to in-person lessons, along with poignant firsthand accounts of losing everything to the fire. There were also poems and hand-drawn pictures by students from Pasadena Rosebud Academy, a transitional kindergarten through eighth-grade school in Altadena, California, that was destroyed in the fire.",
      "Wildfires in January ravaged the Los Angeles area, wiping out nearly 17,000 structures including homes, schools, businesses and places of worship.",
      "The Palisades high school, made up of about 3,000 students in Los Angeles, saw about 40% of its campus damaged and had to move temporarily into an old Sears building. Nehus Saxon estimated that around a quarter of its newspaper staff members lost their homes, with some forced to move out of the community and switch schools.",
      "This project, she and Smith said, was a way to give students a project to focus on after the tragedy while also providing them a place to tell a larger audience the experience of their community.",
      "Smith said she thought the project would be healing for the students \u201cbut also give them something that they could hold in their hands and, when they grow up, show their children and grandchildren.\"",
      "Inside a basement classroom in Santa Monica on Wednesday, Smith and Samuel O\u2019Neal, The Temple News\u2019 editor-in-chief, handed out the papers to the high school staff.",
      "It was the first time they had seen their Tideline articles in print, as the paper had moved online years ago due to the cost.",
      "Kate Swain, 18, a co-editor-in-chief for the paper, said it felt surreal to finally flip through the printed pages.",
      "\u201cBecause of everything that we\u2019ve gone through together, everything that we\u2019ve had to persevere through and everyone\u2019s had all these personal things that they\u2019ve been dealing with,\" she said. \"And yet simultaneously, we\u2019ve been pouring all this time and energy and all of our passion for journalism into writing these articles.\u201d",
      "Gigi Appelbaum, 18, a co-editor-in-chief of the paper who lost her home in the fire, said the project felt especially distinct because it involved people thousands of miles away.",
      "\u201cThe fact that people from across the country are aware of what's going on with us and emphasize with our situation and want to get our voices out there, it\u2019s really special,\u201d said Appelbaum, who has been on the paper for four years.",
      "One of the things she lost in the fire was a box filled with important cards and messages. She said she plans to store her copy in a new box as she works to restart the collection.",
      "Smith and Nehus Saxon met in 1983 during a game between the Angels and Yankees in Anaheim, California. Nehus Saxon said she walked over to Smith to introduce herself and found her hustling to meet a deadline.",
      "\u201cWho knew that little introduction would blossom into this,\u201d said Nehus Saxon.",
      "In the years since, they\u2019ve traveled to London together for Major League Baseball\u2019s first games in Europe, and they cried together in 2017 as Smith became the first woman to win the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America\u2019s Career Excellence Award.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t talk every week,\u201d Nehus Saxon said. \u201cSometimes we can go, you know, months and months without talking. But all we have to do is send each other a text message and we know the other will be there immediately.\u201d",
      "That bond was made all the more clear when Nehus Saxon heard from Smith as fire engulfed her community. Her home was only three blocks from the school. While it survived the blaze, it\u2019s filled with led laden ash and may not be safe to live in for years.",
      "But with the help of Smith, she and her students have been able to move forward and produce the final edition of the school year. After the papers were handed out, Nehus Saxon kept one for the school's archive.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019ve lost everything you\u2019ve got to start somewhere,\u201d Smith said.",

      "A Wisconsin angler fishing in the fog this week discovered the wreck of an abandoned tugboat in Lake Michigan",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A Wisconsin angler fishing in the fog this week discovered the wreck of an abandoned tugboat submerged in the waters of Lake Michigan for more than a century, state officials announced Friday.",
      "Wisconsin Historical Society Maritime Archaeologist Tamara Thomsen said that the society confirmed that Christopher Thuss found the wreck of the J.C. Ames. Thuss was fishing in Lake Michigan off the city of Manitowoc in foggy conditions on Tuesday when he noticed the wreckage in nine feet of water off a breakwater, she said in a message to The Associated Press.",
      "The society said that according to the book \u201cGreen Bay Workhorses: The Nau Tug Line,\u201d the Rand and Burger shipbuilding company in Manitowoc built the J.C. Ames in 1881 to help move lumber. The tug was one of the largest and most powerful on the Great Lakes, with a 670-horsepower engine.",
      "The tug served multiple purposes beyond moving lumber, including transporting railway cars. It eventually fell into disrepair and was scuttled in 1923, as was the practice then when ships outlived their usefulness, Thomsen said.",
      "The ship had been buried in the sand at the bottom of the lake for decades before storms this winter apparently revealed it, Thomsen said. A lack of quagga mussels attached to the ship indicates it was only recently exposed, she said.",
      "Historians are racing to locate shipwrecks and downed planes in the Great Lakes before quagga mussels destroy them. Quagga have become the dominant invasive species in the lower lakes over the last 30 years, attaching themselves to wooden shipwrecks and sunken aircraft in layers so thick they eventually crush the wreckage.",
      "\u201cThese kinds of discoveries are always so exciting because it allows a piece of lost history to resurface. It sat there for over a hundred years and then came back on our radar completely by chance,\u201d Thomsen said in a statement. \u201cWe are grateful that Chris Thuss noticed the wreck and reported it so we can share this story with the Wisconsin communities that this history belongs to.\u201d",

    "summary": "The board that oversees California&rsquo;s toxic substances agency unanimously voted Thursday to remove a controversial proposal that would have weakened a state hazardous waste disposal rule",
    "story": [
      "The board that oversees California\u2019s toxic substances agency unanimously voted Thursday to remove a controversial proposal that would have weakened a state hazardous waste disposal rule",
      "CYPRESS, Calif. -- California shouldn't weaken hazardous waste rules to allow local landfills to accept toxic dirt that currently goes to two specialized disposal sites in the Central Valley and hazardous facilities in other states, the state Board of Environmental Safety voted Thursday.",
      "The vote went against a proposal by the Department of Toxic Substances Control that had prompted fierce opposition from environmental groups.",
      "\u201cI think they have been really listening to the community,\" said Melissa Bumstead with the advocacy group Parents Against the Santa Susana Field Lab.",
      "California's hazardous waste laws are stricter than the federal government's, and the state has long transported much of the waste it considers hazardous to other states with more lenient rules.",
      "The Department of Toxic Substances Control said disposing more waste in state would likely reduce costs and truck emissions. But environmental advocates worried the plan could have exposed already vulnerable communities to contaminated waste and set the precedent for more rules to be weakened.",
      "\u201cI don't think that municipal waste landfills were ever designed to accept this kind of waste, and to deregulate it ... puts those landfill communities\u201d at risk, said Jane Williams, executive director of California Communities Against Toxics.",
      "California only has two hazardous waste landfills \u2014 Buttonwillow and Kettleman Hills in the San Joaquin Valley \u2014 which are expected to reach capacity by 2039, according to a report by the department. An estimated 47% of California\u2019s hazardous waste is trucked across state borders. Contaminated soil, waste oil and mixed oil are the state\u2019s three largest annual sources of hazardous waste. On average, more than 567,000 tons (514,373 metric tons) of toxic soil are produced every year.",
      "The hearing comes months after wildfires in Los Angeles incinerated cars, homes and everything in them, turning ordinary objects into hundreds of tons of hazardous waste requiring specialized cleanup. It was the largest wild\ufb01re hazardous materials cleanup in the EPA\u2019s history.",
      "The infernos have also raised concerns about toxic ash and soil. Just this week, the Pasadena Unified School District published soil testing results showing high levels of arsenic or brain-damaging lead in nearly half its schools.",
      "After the fires, hazardous waste was sent to temporary sites to be separated and packaged before most of it was trucked to Utah, Arizona, Nebraska and Arkansas. Two facilities were in California \u2014 in Wilmington, near the port of Long Beach, and Buttonwillow. The type and amount of waste deposited in them varies by site, but it includes oil, radioactive materials, paint residue, asbestos, controlled substances and fluorescent lamps.",
      "\u201cI think that the fires have really brought to the fore some long-standing issues,\u201d said Angela Johnson Meszaros with the environmental law group Earthjustice. \u201cAnd one of them is, how are we going to deal with cleanup, right? Because fires are not the only thing that cause soil to be hazardous.\u201d",
      "A state law passed in 2021 set out to reform the Department of Toxic Substances Control. In March, the department released a draft plan of sweeping proposals that would guide state and local hazardous management. The board is expected to make a final decision in the summer, and it's not clear if the department could go against the board's wishes not to weaken the hazardous waste disposal rule.",
      "Board member Alexis Strauss Hacker recalled how concerned people were about the proposal during their March meeting in Fresno. The fear, she said, was \u201cso palpable.\u201d",
      "Although California has decreased its hazardous waste by more than 40% since 2000, lithium-ion batteries and other types of waste are expected to increase, the report says, and the state currently lacks the capacity to manage them. Lithium-ion batteries are found in common items such as electronic vehicles, cellphones and laptops.",
      "Decades of industrial environmental pollution can accumulate, too.",
      "Bumstead has lived near the heavily polluted Santa Susana Field Laboratory in Southern California, once a site for rocket testing and nuclear reactor development.",
      "Her 15-year-old daughter is a two-time cancer survivor, and Bumstead was born with three spleens. She believes her family\u2019s health issues are linked to pollution from the nearby site. So when she heard that California environmental regulators wanted to weaken hazardous waste disposal rules in a bid to dump toxic soil into local landfills, she was very concerned.",
      "The Los Angeles fires have made more people realize that toxic materials could end up in their backyard, Bumstead said.",
      "\u201cThe more we see climate change, the more we see wildfires, the more this is going to become a front line issue,\u201d she told the board. \u201cThis is an opportunity not just for hazardous waste that is manufactured, but also hazardous waste that is created by wildfires on how to create a plan that is going to protect Californians in the future.\u201d",

      "DHS asked for the troops to help carry out President Donald Trump's \u201cmandate from the American people to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens,\u201d department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said. She said DHS will \u201duse every tool and resource available\" to do so because the \u201csafety of American citizens comes first.\u201d",
      "Unlike the troops deployed at the southern border, these National Guard units would come from the states and be used to assist in deportation operations in the interior of the country.",
      "How the troops would be used may depend on whether they remain under state governors\u2019 control. Under the Posse Comitatus Act, troops under federal orders cannot be used for domestic law enforcement, but units under state control can.",
      "The addition of 20,000 National Guard troops would provide a huge boost to immigration enforcement. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the DHS agency responsible for immigration enforcement in the interior of the country, has a total staff of about 20,000 people spread across three divisions.",
      "Enforcement and Removals Operations, which is the division directly responsible for arresting and removing people who do not have the right to stay in the country, has a total staff of roughly 7,700 people, including a little over 6,000 law enforcement officers.",
      "It was unclear why the request was made to the Defense Department and not to the states. The U.S. official spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public.",
      "Trump has been carrying out a wide-ranging crackdown on illegal immigration, issuing a series of executive orders designed to stop what he has called the \u201cinvasion\u201d of the United States.",
      "The U.S. already has as many as 10,000 troops under state and federal orders along the U.S.-Mexico border, including some who are now empowered to detain migrants they encounter along a newly militarized narrow strip of land adjacent to the border.",
      "So far, these troops have largely been limited to providing airlift, bolstering the wall, surveillance and administrative support to free up border agents for arrests or detentions.",
      "Along the newly militarized zone, troops have put up warning signs and accompanied border agents but left the detention of migrants crossing the border to other agencies.",
      "In New Mexico, where the new militarized zone was first created, federal magistrate judges have started dismissing national security charges against migrants accused of crossing the southern U.S. border through the newly designated military zone, finding little evidence that they were aware of the zone.",
      "The request for 20,000 troops was first reported by The New York Times.",

The growth has come so quickly that the city \u2014 which more than doubled its population since 2020 \u2014 has struggled to build roads and infrastructure fast enough as it transforms from a farming community.",

      "The Army will place large metal plating at key points on Washington's streets",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Army will place large metal plates at key points on the streets of Washington to better protect the pavement from the movements of 25 M1 Abrams main battle tanks set to roll through the capital on June 14, a U.S. official told the Associated Press.",
      "The tanks are a key part of a parade that will honor the Army's 250th birthday and fall on President Donald Trump's 79th birthday. Since it was announced, the parade has grown in scope and participation, and one of the highlights will be columns of tanks rolling in formation along Constitution Avenue. Each Abrams tank can weigh 60 tons or more and carry a crew of four.",
      "Concerns over the tanks' weight, and what that would do to D.C.\u2018s streets, ultimately kept them from being used for a parade during Trump\u2019s first term. The metal plates are seen as the best way to protect the streets Each plate weighs hundreds of pounds and will be placed at points along the parade route where the tanks will turn \u2014 and where their metal and rubber-shoed tracking that helps them move can do the most damage, the official said.",
      "In April, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said if the tanks are used on the city's roads, funding to repair the damage they may do should also be part of the plan. Her office was not immediately available for comment on Friday.",
      "Movement of a single M1 Abrams tank is a loud affair \u2014 movement of 25 in unison is expected to be thunderous, the official said.",
      "The parade and celebration will likely cost between $25 million and $45 million, a White House official told The Associated Press. It will involve thousands of troops also marching in formation, in uniforms representing every U.S. conflict dating back to the Revolutionary War, which began in 1775.",
      "Each war will have 60 troops in period costume, followed by 400 troops from that same unit in their regular battle dress uniforms. For example, the Civil War will be represented by the Army's 4th Infantry Division, based in Fort Carson, Colorado, with 60 soldiers wearing historical costumes and 400 in today's uniforms.",
      "Overall the parade plans call for about 6,600 soldiers, 150 vehicles and 50 helicopters to follow a route from the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, to the National Mall.",
      "The late-afternoon parade will be followed by a parachute jump by the Army's Golden Knights, a concert and the fireworks.",

      "The board chose Johnson from a field of four finalists, which included FAMU's chief operating officer Donald Palm, who was the clear favorite among an outspoken contingent of the university's students and supporters, and who was endorsed by the school's influential alumni association.",
      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have your own students, faculty, and alumni behind you, no matter what relationships you have, that\u2019s a recipe for disaster,\" film producer and alum Will Packer told the board ahead of the vote. \"Do not set Marva Johnson up to fail.

      "WHITE CASTLE, La. -- Flames ripped through a massive mansion in Louisiana, destroying much of the historic structure that was used as a plantation house when it was completed in 1859, authorities said.",
      "The fire that engulfed the Nottoway Plantation House on Thursday devastated the building along the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Iberville Parish President Chris Daigle said on social media. Nearly a dozen fire departments from surrounding towns battled the blaze, he said. No injuries were reported.",
      "Before the fire, it was a resort and event venue, and its website described it as \u201cthe South's largest remaining antebellum mansion.\" Daigle called it \u201ca cornerstone of our tourism economy and a site of national significance.\u201d",
      "The 53,000-square-foot (4,924-square-meter) home on a former sugar plantation about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of New Orleans had a three-story rotunda adorned with giant white columns and hand-carved Italian marble fireplaces, according to a description on its website.",
      "The mansion's owner, Louisiana attorney Dan Dyess, said in a written statement that the fire had led to a \u201ctotal loss\" after all the time and money he invested in the building.",

      "In a statement on Facebook, Daigle touched on the structure's history of racial injustice during a time when enslaved Black people helped build the home and operate the sugar plantation that surrounded it. In 1860, 155 enslaved people were held at the property, according to National Park Service records.",
      "\u201cWhile its early history is undeniably tied to a time of great injustice, over the last several decades it evolved into a place of reflection, education, and dialogue,\u201d Daigle said.",
      "\u201cSince the 1980s, it has welcomed visitors from around the world who came to appreciate its architecture and confront the legacies of its era,\" he added. \"It stood as both a cautionary monument and a testament to the importance of preserving history \u2014 even the painful parts \u2014 so that future generations can learn and grow from it.\u201d",

    "summary": "Whole TV shows shot in one long take are made possible by new lightweight cameras.",
    "story": [
      "Three strong knocks from the police battering ram and the front door bursts open. There's a lot of shouting.",
      "We follow heavily-armed officers as they stream into the house, a woman drops to the floor as the camera turns left, and we head up a small, dimly lit staircase, passing a man with his back against the wall, hands raised, yelling to no avail.",
      "Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van.",
      "All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than 120 million people worldwide in its first month.",
      "It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimed in a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a \"oner\", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming.",
      "Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry.",
      "At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again.",
      "You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator \u2013 there's a minuscule wobble \u2013 but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless.",
      "It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects.",
      "This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage.",
      "The result is \"phenomenal\", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer.",
      "He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. \"As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take.\"",
      "Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds.",
      "In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.",
      "Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes \u2013 but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.",
      "Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.",
      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",
      "The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.",
      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",
      "Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.",
      "Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.",
      "The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"",
      "There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.",
      "Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.",
      "But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take \u2013 I want to watch these things because they're good.\"",

      "\"The government will ban the payment of unfair bonuses for polluting water bosses,\" Reed said. \"The days of profiting from failure are over.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Thames chairman Sir Adrian Montague told MPs: \"We live in a competitive marketplace and we have to provide the right sort of packages to these people otherwise the head hunters come knocking.\"",
      "In a statement, a Thames spokesperson said the company was involved in a \"complex turnaround and restructuring process\" to \"deliver better results for our customers and the environment and seek a long-term solution to our financial resilience\".",
      "\"It is critical that the business retains the people best placed to deliver the improved outcomes our stakeholders rightly expect.\"",

      "The UK needs more nuclear energy to power the data centres needed for artificial intelligence (AI), the boss of the world's largest cloud computing company has said.",

      "AWS is the single largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world and has funded more than 40 renewable solar and wind farm projects in the UK.",
      "The UK's 500 data centres currently consume 2.5% of all electricity in the UK, while Ireland's 80 hoover up 21% of the country's total power, with those numbers projected to hit 6% and 30% respectively by 2030.",
      "The body that runs the UK's power grid estimates that by 2050 data centres alone will use nearly as much energy as all industrial users consume today.",

      "\"Replication of Hinkley Point C, alongside the roll out of SMRs, can power Britain's digital economy.\"",

      "A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero told the BBC that modular reactors \"will play a particularly important roles in growing energy-hungry sectors like AI and we're shaking up the planning rules to make it easier to build nuclear power stations across the country\"",
      "But this technology is many years away and new grid connections already take years to establish.",
      "Jess Ralston at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said: \"Investors can be waiting years for grid connections holding back growth.\"",
      "\"Nuclear could be a way of supply data centre's power needs, but hardly any SMRs have been built anywhere in the world and traditional nuclear remains very expensive and takes a long time to build. So, it may be a while, if ever, for this to be a viable solution\".",
      "AI regulation",
      "AWS estimates that 52% of businesses are using AI in some way \u2013 with a new business adopting it at a rate of one a minute. Mr Garman said this is a good thing.",
      "\"AI is one of the most transformative technologies since the internet. It's going to have a significant effect on almost every part of our lives.\"",
      "He said he understands why many are nervous.",
      "\"With any technology that is sufficiently new or hard to understand, people are probably appropriately scared of it initially, until they better understand it so that initial response is not particularly surprising.\"",

      "However, he admitted he thinks a lot about the responsibility of releasing AI into the world.",

    "summary": "The Caribbean island is building a power station that will use steam naturally heated by volcanic rock.",
    "story": [
      "With rainforests, waterfalls, volcanoes and hot springs, the Caribbean island of Dominica's dramatic landscape is a haven for adventure-seeking ecotourists.",
      "It attracted 83,966 visitors last year, a 13% rise from 2023, and led by new direct flights from the US, and the opening of more hotels.",
      "Nicknamed the \"Nature Island\", and now recovered from the extensive damage caused by 2017's Hurricane Maria, Dominica's government is set to harness its natural resources to generate clean electricity for its 66,000 residents and tourism sector.",
      "To end the country's long reliance on generators fuelled by imported diesel, a geothermal power station is being built in the south of the country. It will access the boiling hot water contained in natural underground reservoirs that are heated by the surrounding volcanic rock.",
      "The 10-megawatt plant, under construction near the village of Laudat in the lush Roseau Valley, is on track to become operational by the end of the year.",
      "Steam will be drawn up to the surface to drive turbines that will generate electricity. The used steam will then be cooled to the point where it becomes water again, and reinjected back underground for the process to restart.",
      "Dominica country profile",
      "\"We hope to totally eliminate the need for diesel generation for electricity in Dominica by 2030,\" Dominica's energy minister Dr Vince Henderson tells the BBC. The government also says that the geothermal plant will reduce electricity bills.",
      "And it is not just Dominica (not to be confused with the similarly named Dominican Republic), that is set to benefit. Long-term plans include exporting surplus electricity via undersea cables to neighbouring islands.",
      "Dr Henderson adds that he hopes the success of the geothermal plant will inspire other Caribbean nations to explore more renewable energy sources.",
      "Dominica's geothermal plant will be just the second in the Caribbean. Guadeloupe, an overseas department of France, has had a 15-megawatt station in operation for three decades.",
      "The Roseau Valley facility is being created through a public-private partnership between the Dominican government and US-Israeli renewable energy company Ormat Technologies.",
      "It is costing tens of millions of US dollars, partially funded by grants and investments from several governments, including the US, UK, Japan and New Zealand. Additional funding has come from various non-governmental organizations from around the world, and loans from the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB).",
      "The Dominican government has also ploughed significant resources into the project, which required high upfront costs and a complex exploration process including drilling deep underground to test temperatures.",
      "\"Finding the resource is the first challenge. Then you need someone like us to build the facility,\" says Ormat's chief executive Doron Blachar. \"Ormat is doing the entire project, from making the plant's elements, shipping them to Dominica, mainly from Israel, and then constructing the power plant.\"",
      "Ormat has been designing and building renewable energy systems for more than five decades, and owns and operates geothermal plants in various countries from the Americas to Africa.",
      "\"Geothermal is a great, zero-emission electricity that doesn't depend on wind or sun, and operates 24/7,\" Mr Blachar explains. \"It brings jobs to a country, both during construction and, more importantly, during the plant's operations, along with new technology and expertise.\"",
      "Yet despite geothermal's green credentials, Dominica's new plant has raised concerns among some local residents, including environmentalist Atherton Martin who fears for the effects on the ecologically valuable Roseau Valley.",
      "\"There is no other area like it in the Caribbean,\" he says, adding that the removal of vegetation during the exploration process \"decimated wildlife\" including endemic frogs.",
      "Other residents told the BBC of some controversy over the amount of money the project was costing. It has certainly been several years in the making with the Dominican government alone said to have invested around $15m (\u00a311.3m).",
      "Dr Henderson admits that the project is \"not easy\" for a country that \"faced a big challenge\" when it had to substantially repair its electricity network after 2017's Hurricane Maria. But he insists \"it will be worth it in the end\".",
      "Another common fear about geothermal plants is the potential for triggering earthquakes.",
      "Ormat says it has never had a such an incident in its many years of operations.",
      "Mr Blachar believes the Caribbean could become \"a hub\" for geothermal technology.",
      "Ormat acquired Guadeloupe's plant from the French government in 2017 and is currently expanding it to boost its capacity to 25 megawatts.",
      "With support from the CDB and driven by the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Commission, work is also under way to explore and develop geothermal potential in fellow volcanic island nations Grenada, St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.",
      "Ormat will operate the Dominica plant for 20 years before handing it over to state electricity provider Domlec. Mr Blachar estimates it will employ around 30 local people when it comes on stream later this year.",
      "It should initially generate enough power to meet half of Dominica's peak electricity demand, says Fred John, managing director of the government-owned Dominica Geothermal Development Company, which is also involved in the scheme.",
      "Authorities are confident the plant will then soon support the entire country, and have enough spare electricity for some to be exported to neighbouring islands.",
      "Mr John says that the facility will \"serve as a test case for an attractive alternative\" to fossil fuels. \"The rest of the OECS will benefit from the lessons learned here \u2013 both what worked and what didn't,\" he adds.",
      "The OECS recently set a target to reach 30% renewable energy within 10 years, with some countries, including Dominica and St Kitts, aiming for 100% by then.",
      "OECS Director General Dr Didacus Jules describes Dominica's geothermal project as a \"bold and visionary step\".",
      "\"As a region heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, the transition to green energy is not optional - it is existential,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This development also breathes new life into the long-held vision of a regional energy grid - one that connects our islands through clean, reliable, and affordable energy.\""

    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 23:03:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The US currently has no high-speed rail services, but two are under construction, and more planned.",
    "story": [
      "The US is a country of 340 million people, 71 interstate highways, more than 5,000 public airports, and currently no high-speed railways.",
      "Yet with two high-speed rail (HSR) projects now under construction, and others planned, is the US finally on track to start catching up with the fast trains seen in China, Japan and Europe?",
      "Rick Harnish, of US campaign group High Speed Rail Alliance, says it is at least good to see the first two schemes being built.",
      "\"The first is the San Francisco to Los Angeles route,\" he explains. \"That's an incredibly challenging route to build because of the mountains in California.",
      "\"Then there's Las Vegas to Los Angeles, a relatively easy project to build, as it is flat land.\"",
      "In addition, there are plans for a HSR line from Portland in Oregon to Seattle in Washington State, and onto Vancouver in Canada. And another between Dallas and Houston.",
      "Yet Mr Harnish warns that planning efforts for the former are \"moving slowly\", while the Texas line is now more doubtful after President Trump's government cancelled a $63.9m (\u00a348m) grant.",
      "By marked contrast, the total length of China's HSR network will reportedly exceed 50,000 km (31,000 miles) this year.",
      "Meanwhile, the European Union has 8,556 km of HSR lines, led by Spain's 3,190 km.",
      "In the UK, the only current HSR line is High Speed 1, the 68 miles link between the Channel Tunnel and London St Pancras. But High Speed 2 continues to be constructed from London Euston to Birmingham, despite well-publicised funding issues.",
      "While there is no universally agreed definition on what constitutes HSR, global railways trade group International Union of Railways says that trains generally need to be moving at more than 250 km/h (155 mph).",
      "So why does US lag behind Europe and especially China?",
      "\"We're a very car-addicted nation,\" says American rail industry journalist and author Will Doig. \"There's lots of people who just don't think we need it, or don't really want it coming through their area.",
      "\"And the US government has really shown a willingness to shut down investment in a lot of projects, especially rail.\"",
      "Further complicating the situation in the US is that the boss of the government-owned passenger train service Amtrak, Stephen Gardner, resigned last month. It was widely reported that he stood down after pressure from the White House.",
      "Amtrak currently does not operate any HSR trains. Later this year it is due to enter 28 new 160mph NextGen Acela trains into service on its Northeast Corridor route between Boston and Washington DC. However, only around 50 miles of the 457-mile line can presently allow trains to travel at more than 150mph.",
      "Amtrak is not involved in the high-speed lines being built in California and Nevada. The LA to San Francisco project, called California High-Speed Rail, is being led by the state of California, and due to be completed by 2033.",
      "The line from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Brightline West, is a privately-run project. It is expected to open in 2028.",
      "Globally, there are 23 nations with HSR, according to Mr Harnish. His non-profit organisation has the sole mission of bringing it to the US.",
      "Allowing HSR trains to run safely is far from straightforward, he adds. \"You can't have any crossings with highways, it needs to be very straight and a sealed corridor.\"",
      "In China the country is still building more and more HSR lines, with the total distance expected to reach around 60,000km by 2030.",
      "Chinese cities that get HSR links see their economies increase by 14.2%, according to data from Denmark-based think tank 21st Europe.",
      "Chinese firms are also helping to build HSR systems in other Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Will Doig, who wrote a book called High-Speed Empire, Chinese Expansion, and the Future of Southeast Asia, says that China is not just interested in helping its neighbours improve their rail networks.",
      "\"It is a way of China spreading its influence across a region that it felt was geopolitically strategic,\" he says.",
      "\"In some of these cases, countries have taken out loans from China so that China can then build the railways.\" He warns that this may put them \"in a position where they're beholden to China\".",
      "Europe's growing HSR network is testament to the continent's history of investing in its public infrastructure, says Kaave Pour from 21st Europe.",
      "His think tank is now calling for further expansion of HSR, so that it connects most capitals and main cities in the EU, and those in the UK.",
      "Mr Pour says that if the US wants to develop HSR it needs to start with a cultural shift, a move towards more public transport, and asking itself \"what type of future does it want?\".",
      "Mr Harnish from the High Speed Rail Alliance says that in order for HSR to work in the US, \"the federal government is an essential component\".",
      "Yet as already flagged, the White House has pulled the plug on giving the planned high-speed line between Houston and Dallas a federal grant. US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy described the project as a \"waste of taxpayers' money\".",
      "Scott Sherin is an executive at French train manufacturer Alstom. His firm is suppling Amtrak's new high-speed trains, but he questions whether the US has the political will \"to spend the public purse on rail versus other modes of transportation\".",
      "He also notes that any future HSR lines would struggle to get into city centres such as Dallas and Houston, because there are too many buildings. \"The issue is that the cities are so densely built [in their centres]\".",
      "Will Doig says that going forward he would love to see China helping to build more HSR in the US, but that he is not holding his breath.",
      "\"It's politically very difficult,\" he says. \"Which is too bad because without the animosity between the US and China, you could see how a partnership between them could really create great things for America, that America is not so good at building itself.\""

    "story": [
      "Going back to the Moon after half a century, and then to Mars, literally means reinventing the wheel.",
      "After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat.",
      "\"One thing you cannot have is a puncture,\" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin.",
      "The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover.",
      "Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.",
      "As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027.",
      "Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030.",
      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",
      "Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).",
      "Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface.",
      "Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes.",
      "ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet.",
      "The work might have some useful applications here on Earth.",
      "While working on his doctorate at the University of Southern California, Dr Cole joined a Nasa entrepreneurial programme to work on commercialising some of the technology from the Mars super-elastic rover tyre.",
      "An early product this year will be nickel-titanium bicycle tyres.",
      "Priced around $150 (\u00a3120) each, the tyres are much more expensive than regular ones, but would be extremely durable.",
      "He also plans to work this year on durable tyres for motorbikes, aimed at areas with rough roads.",
      "For all this, his \"dream\" remains to play a part in humanity's return to the Moon.",

      "With US President Donald Trump due to visit Gulf states this week, a key focus will be securing significant new investment for the US economy.",
      "\"President Trump wants the announcement [of more Gulf money for the US],\" says economist Karen Young, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank.",
      "\"He wants to have a big poster in a meeting that describes where these investments might go. And some estimation of what they will do to the American economy in terms of job creation or his big push, of course, on domestic manufacturing.\"",
      "Trump is due to arrive in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday 13 May, to meet the country's de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "Trump is then expected to attend a summit of Gulf leaders in the city on 14 May, before travelling to Qatar that same day, and then ending his three-day trip in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 15 May.",
      "The economic importance of the region to Trump is highlighted by the fact that the visit to Saudi Arabia was due to be the first overseas trip of his second term in the White House. That was before the death of Pope Francis necessitated Trump attending his funeral in Rome towards the end of April.",
      "Saudi Arabia was also the first country that Trump visited during his first term of office, going against the modern practise of US presidents to start with the UK, Canada or Mexico.",
      "Securing new investments in the US from Gulf states, and particularly from their state-backed sovereign wealth funds, will help Trump to signal back home that his \"America First\" agenda is delivering results.",
      "The presidential visit is drawing top Wall Street and Silicon Valley leaders to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-US investment forum on 13 May in Riyadh will feature CEOs from BlackRock, Palantir, Citigroup, IBM, Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Franklin Templeton.",
      "The push comes amid economic headwinds, as President Trump's new import tariffs have significantly disrupted global trade, confidence, and the US economy itself. US economic output fell in the first three months of this year, its first fall in three years.",
      "Back in January, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn (\u00a3450bn) in the US over the next four years. However, Trump has already said that he'd like that to rise to $1tn, including purchases of more US military equipment.",
      "According to Ali Shihabi \u2013 a Saudi commentator and author, with close ties to the Saudi government \u2013 a number of economic agreements will be signed during the trip.",
      "\"These deals will further integrate the Saudi and US economies together, joint ventures in the kingdom, in the United States, procurements of American weapons and goods,\" says Mr Shihabi.",

      "Meanwhile, the UAE has already committed to investing $1.4tn in the US over the next 10 years, in sectors such as AI, semiconductors, energy and manufacturing. This was announced by the White House in March after the UAE's national security advisor, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met President Trump in Washington.",
      "Yet Ms Young from the Middle East Institute says that the scale of these investments is not realistic in the short term. She instead says that they are long-term strategic moves, and that the figures should be taken \"with a little bit of a grain of salt\".",
      "Regarding specific deals that could be announced during Trump's visit, it is widely reported that Saudi Arabia will agree to buy more than $100bn of US arms and other military items.",
      "These are said to include missiles, radar systems and transport aircraft.",
      "The US has been a longstanding arms supplier to Saudi Arabia, but in 2021 the then Biden administration stopped selling Riyadh offensive weapons, citing concerns about the country's role in the war in neighbouring Yemen.",
      "The 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was also widely reported to be a factor. A US report said that Prince Mohammed had approved the murder.",
      "The Biden White House resumed the sale of these weapons last year. While it cited that the Saudis had stopped bombing Yemen, some commentators said that the US was seeking Saudi assistance to help end the conflict in Gaza and aid its future reconstruction.",
      "Mr Shihabi says Saudi Arabia will be seeking assurances from the White House that the US will implement a \"more efficient procurement system\", enabling the Gulf state to access ammunition and military equipment far more quickly and easily.",
      "\"The Trump administration is initiating procedures to facilitate those deals. So, it's expected that this process will improve immediately,\" he adds.",
      "Artificial intelligence is the other topic that will dominate the agenda during Mr Trump's visit. Talks are expected to centre on attracting greater Gulf investment into US tech firms, and boosting the region's access to cutting-edge American semiconductors.",
      "The UAE and Saudi Arabia have been investing billions of dollars into tech and AI sectors as they try to diversify their economies away from oil.",
      "The Emiratis, in particular, are keen to establish themselves as a global AI hub.",
      "Last week, the Trump administration scrapped the Biden-era chip regulations that placed restrictions on exports of advanced US chips to more than 120 countries including the Gulf states.",
      "The White House is expected to draft new rules that would potentially involve direct negotiations with countries like the UAE.",
      "\"For the UAE, this is absolutely essential,\" says Ms Young. \"They are aggressively building out their AI capacity. So, for them getting access to US technology is imperative to be the best.\"",

      "The decline was further fuelled by the group of oil producing nations, Opec+, announcing plans to increase output.",
      "Saudi Arabia is part of that group, and some commentators said that the rise was in part a desire to please Trump, who has called for lower oil prices.",
      "Other analysts said the reason was more that Opec+ remains confident that the global economy is growing.",

      "Private school fees were 22.6% higher on average in January compared with a year ago, according to the body that represents most independent schools in the UK.",
      "The Independent Schools Council (ISC) says it expects a reduction in pupils applying to private school as a result of changes to VAT - but says it is too soon to know the full effects of the policy, which was introduced mid-year.",
      "The average termly fee for a day school in January was \u00a37,382, which includes 20% VAT, according to the ISC. In January last year the average was \u00a36,021.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson says the increase in fees are not only down to VAT and fees have been rising in private schools over the last 25 years.",
      "VAT on private school fees was introduced on 1 January across the UK.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the money raised would help \"provide the highest quality of support and teaching\" in the state sector.",
      "At the time, the government predicted fees would increase by about 10% as a result of the changes, saying some schools would be able to absorb part of the cost.",
      "The ISC said that many schools were able to reduce their fees, excluding VAT, in January to \"cushion the impact\" on parents.",
      "But the ISC chief executive Julie Robinson said the sector had been hit by a \"triple whammy\" of national insurance changes, an end to charitable business rates relief and \"the blow of 20% VAT on fees\".",
      "\"It seems clear to us that the government has underestimated the effect,\" she said.",
      "\"We know parents have already left the sector because of the threat of VAT coming in so we do expect the reality of this to lead to further decreases but the full effects will only become apparent over the next few years,\" Ms Robinson added.",
      "The 22.6% increase in average fees compares with an 8.4% rise in 2024 and a 6.4% rise in 2023.",
      "The figures were provided to the BBC by the ISC, which represents about 1,400 private schools across the UK. Its annual census, which looks at fees and pupil numbers, is conducted in January and is due to be released next week.",
      "Kath decided to remove her 12-year-old son from his private school in October after she was made aware the fees would be increasing in January.",
      "\"We worked it out and it was unaffordable. Within two terms the cost was going up by 26% to almost \u00a38,000 a term, \" she said.",

      "\"The state system is stretched and underfunded. He is a happy and resilient boy and now we have to fight for his needs to be met.\"",
      "David Morton, headmaster of The King's School in Gloucester, which charges pupils between \u00a33,725 and \u00a39,050 a term, said the policy is \"misjudged\".",
      "\"The government is trying to tax the more affluent areas of society in order to support the least affluent, but the wealthiest people have been affected the least.\"",
      "\"It's low to middle income families and those children on bursaries where the impact of VAT is being felt most,\" Mr Morton added.",
      "Given overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 in England by 2030, the government is confident that schools in the state sector will be able to accommodate any additional pupils moving from private schools.",
      "It estimates about 35,000 will move to the state sector in the long term and the impact will be \"very small\".",
      "Research by think tank the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) said it would be possible for the state sector to easily accommodate extra pupils as the number leaving is bigger than the total number of children attending private schools.",
      "The ISC said some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in Year 7 pupils in September 2024, but experts say the declining birth rate and cost of living could be having an impact.",
      "A judicial review of the policy has been brought by three separate groups, including parents of children with SEND and low-paying faith schools. A decision is expected  soon.",
      "The court heard how the government decided to bring the policy in mid-year to maximise the amount of money it raised.",
      "It estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m this year, rising to \u00a31.8bn by 2029/30.",
      "As part of their election campaign, Labour promised this would be used to recruit 6,500 specialist teachers in England over their parliamentary term.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c033dp0z1edo",
    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 15:09:32 GMT",
    "summary": "The government says \"every single penny\" raised by the policy will be spent on state schools.",
    "story": [
      "Average private school fees were 22% higher in January 2025 than in January 2024, according to the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents most independent schools in the UK.",
      "The government introduced VAT on school fees in January to pay for more state school teachers in England.",
      "But the ISC and a number of families have taken the government to the High Court over claims the policy is discriminatory and breaches human rights laws.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods and services. The standard rate of VAT is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education. That exemption was removed on 1 January.",
      "About half of England's private schools are charities, which means that they also received an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "The government removed that tax relief in April, but dropped earlier plans to scrap private schools' charitable status entirely.",
      "How will the government spend the extra VAT raised?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",
      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in the 2024/25 financial year, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"every single penny\" will go to state schools - including funding the recruitment of 6,500 new teachers in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for many years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "The government also said there will be funding to address other issues in schools, such as crumbling buildings and delays in the system for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send).",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",
      "While some famous schools, like Eton and Harrow, charge about \u00a350,000 a year, the average is about \u00a315,000.",
      "There are about 2,500 private schools in the UK, educating about 7% of all pupils, including about 570,000 in England.",
      "Private schools have more freedom than government-funded state schools, and do not have to follow the national curriculum.",
      "Some local authorities pay for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) to attend private schools.",
      "Those that have a local authority education, health and care plan (EHCP) which names a specific private school that can meet their needs do not have to pay VAT.",
      "The government also said a grant to help cover the boarding school fees for children of military families was increased to take account of the VAT increase.",
      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Have private school fees gone up?",
      "The ISC represents more than 1,400 private schools. It said its annual census showed average school fees were 22.6% higher in January 2025 than they had been in January 2024.",
      "It blamed the \"triple whammy\" of higher national insurance contributions, an end to charitable business rates relief and the introduction of VAT.",
      "The government had previously said it expected fees to rise by an average of around 10%.",
      "In response to the ISC figures, a Treasury spokesperson said the increase was \"not only down to VAT\", and that private school fees had risen significantly in recent decades.",
      "According to the the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank, average fees rose by 55% (after inflation) between 2003 and 2023.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period did not fall.",
      "Will the VAT changes mean the number of private pupils will fall?",
      "When it announced the VAT increase, the government said it did not expect there to be a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "According to a Treasury memo seen by the BBC, initial estimates suggested that 54,000 pupils would be displaced, with most moving to state schools within the first two years.",
      "However, the government now predicts that around 35,000 students will move to the state sector over a longer time period, and that class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which said that state system could \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The ISC says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in the number of Year 7 pupils starting school in September 2024.",
      "It believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",
      "Why was the VAT policy challenged in court?",
      "The legal challenge was brought by the ISC, a smaller group of Christian faith schools, and parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They argue that the policy goes against the legal right to an education, and claim it is discriminatory because it affects families attending low-paying faith schools.",
      "The group also cites the effect on children with Send. Those who attend private school because their needs \"cannot be adequately met in the state sector\" but who do not have an EHCP have to pay VAT.",
      "The court was told that the government had considered introducing the policy in September 2025, rather than in January.",
      "But it rejected this idea because the main objective of the VAT change was to raise additional tax revenue to support the 94% of children who attend state schools, and any delay would have undermined that.",
      "Government lawyers argued that families who wished to opt out of \"the system of universally accessible, state-funded education\" were free to send their children to private school or to educate them at home.",
      "If the legal challenge is successful, the government could consider amending the policy, but would be under no obligation to do so."

      "In a trial that is undoing the legacy of one of music's biggest moguls of the 2000s, the focus of the opening week of proceedings was not Sean \"Diddy\" Combs  himself - but his ex-girlfriend.",
      "R&B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura took the witness stand for four days, describing in emotional details the years of beatings and drug-fuelled sex encounters with prostitutes that she alleges she endured at the hands of the rap superstar, who she dated for more than a decade.",
      "But while her story clearly left an impression on those in the courtroom, which one onlooker described as an \"aura of sadness\", it is just one piece in the puzzle that prosecutors must present to prove that Mr Combs was not just an abuser, but a mastermind of a criminal, sexual enterprise.",
      "On Tuesday, gasps erupted in a Manhattan overflow courtroom when prosecutors called Ms Ventura - their star witness - to the stand. All eyes were fixed on the eight-months pregnant singer, as she strolled past her ex-boyfriend, whom she had not seen in six years.",
      "Ms Ventura was there to testify in the federal sex trafficking, racketeering and prostitution case against Mr Combs, whom she accuses of abusing her and coercing her into unwanted sex acts - so-called \"freak-offs\" - during their 11-and-a-half year relationship.",

      "An aspiring musician falls in love with a 'larger-than-life' rapper",
      "On her first day on the stand, Ms Ventura began by taking prosecutors through the start of her tumultuous relationship with Mr Combs, whom she met when she was a 19-year-old aspiring musician. Mr Combs, 17 years her senior, signed her onto his record label.",
      "Their romantic relationship began soon after, when Ms Ventura fell in love with the \"larger-than-life\" musician and entrepreneur, she said. But it was not long before she noticed a \"different\" side to him, Ms Ventura testified, at times wiping the tears from her eyes.",
      "Mr Combs, she said, wanted to control every aspect of her life. He paid for her rent, her car, and her phone, sometimes taking the items away to \"punish\" her when he was upset, she said.",
      "Eventually, the relationship turned violent. She testified about the time when he attacked her because she was sleeping, slashing her eyebrow as he threw her onto the corner of her bed as her two friends tried to stop him. The court was shown a photo of the gash that Ms Ventura said Mr Combs hired a plastic surgeon to fix secretly. There was another time at a party where he kicked her head as she cowered behind a toilet in a bathroom stall, she said.",
      "While jurors remained concentrated on her testimony and the evidence, betraying little emotion, some in the courtroom wiped away tears or looked away from the graphic photos and videos - including the viral video of Mr Combs beating and dragging Ms Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Published by CNN last year, the video has been viewed by millions - including many of the jurors before they were seated in the trial - and Ms Ventura, who was forced to rewatch the incident of abuse several times this week.",
      "Freak-offs become 'a job'",
      "Ms Ventura testified that the hotel incident took place after she tried to leave a \"freak-off\", a sexual encounter in which the couple would hire male escorts to have sex with Ms Ventura while Mr Combs watched and recorded from the corner.",
      "Ms Ventura said the rapper introduced her to freak-offs around a year into their relationship, and at first, she did it to make him happy.",
      "But over time, the encounters humiliated her, she said. They would sometimes last as long as four days, and require Ms Ventura to take countless drugs to stay awake, she said. She endured injuries like painful urinary tract infections - and once even blacked out, waking up in the shower, she said.",
      "\"It made me feel worthless,\" she told the court. \"Freak-offs became a job where there was no space to do anything else but to recover and just try to feel normal again.\"",
      "The couple would go on to have \"hundreds\" of freak-offs, Ms Ventura estimated.",
      "After years of temporary break-ups - some fuelled by Mr Combs' affairs - Ms Ventura ended her relationship with Mr Combs for good in 2018, the same year she alleges the rapper raped her in her home as she cried.",
      "Ms Ventura went on to date and marry her personal trainer, Alex Fine, with whom she has two children, but the trauma of her relationship has stayed with her.",
      "Through tears, Ms Ventura told the court of a time two years ago when she considered taking her own life, when traumatic flashbacks of her time with Mr Combs became too much to handle. Her husband helped her seek therapy to recover, she said.",

      "Mr Combs's attorneys have already conceded that the rapper was abusive - and have argued they would not have fought a domestic violence case against him. But, \"domestic violence is not sex trafficking\", Mr Combs' attorney Teny Geragos argued this week.",
      "The federal government has charged Mr Combs with transportation to engage in prostitution and sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion.",
      "He is also charged with leading a racketeering conspiracy, or directing an illegal enterprise under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The statute was created to take on mob bosses, but has since been used in other cases, including sex trafficking, such as the case against disgraced R&B singer R Kelly.",
      "Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson used parts of Ms Ventura's story to boost this case, asking her about the guns the rapper had access to and the ways he allegedly blackmailed her.",
      "Ms Ventura told the court of a time when she said Mr Combs pulled up videos he recorded of their freak-offs on his laptop, in view of others on a commercial flight. She said he told her he would release them if she didn't behave.",
      "\"I felt trapped,\" Ms Ventura said.",
      "Arick Fudali, a lawyer who represents an unnamed victim in the government's case against Mr Combs, said \"the fear of what would happen if they didn't comply\" is a crucial element of the government's case.",
      "\"Someone can consent to a sexual act of course,\" Mr Fudali told the BBC. \"But someone can also be coerced into being compliant, and that's different.\"",
      "The government has also used Ms Ventura's testimony to try to build up their racketeering argument - the allegation that Mr Combs used his loyal network of associates to run a criminal enterprise and cover up his alleged crimes.",
      "Prosecutors have asked Ms Ventura about security guards who she said stood by while Mr Combs abused her. Ms Ventura has testified about Mr Combs' employees' involvement in setting up freak-offs with supplies like baby oil, and booking travel for the male escorts they hired.",
      "Mr Combs' team says jealousy and drugs fuelled violence",
      "After a day and a half on the stand, it was Mr Combs' attorneys turn to question Ms Ventura.",
      "The rapper's lawyer, Anna Estevao, relied on hundreds of pages of text messages between Mr Combs and Ms Ventura to help push her team's broader arguments: that Ms Ventura was a willing participant in freak-offs in a toxic relationship fuelled by drugs and jealousy.",
      "Mr Combs' legal team showed messages from Ms Ventura to Mr Combs in which she said she was \"always ready\" for a freak-off, and another time when she said she wished they could have had one.",
      "Ms Ventura acknowledged writing the messages while adding that those were \"just words at that point\".",
      "Ms Estevao also kept bringing Ms Ventura back to the couple's moments of infidelity, like when Mr Combs would spend holidays with his family and former girlfriend Kim Porter, or when Ms Ventura began dating rapper Kid Cudi while she and Mr Combs were on a break.",
      "She repeatedly asked Ms Ventura about her drug use and how both she and Mr Combs struggled with opioid addiction at times.",
      "In these moments, the defence was trying to show jurors that it was a toxic, violent and complicated relationship - but not a case of racketeering or sex trafficking, former federal prosecutor Sarah Krissoff told the BBC.",
      "The defence also made efforts to try to chip away at the government's racketeering case, asking Ms Ventura whether Mr Combs' employees had actually witnessed the freak-offs, to which Ms Ventura said she did not think so.",
      "Ultimately, Mr Fudali said, the prosecution's case will hinge on this question of compliance versus consent - whether Mr Combs' girlfriends were willing participants in his sexual fantasies or acted out of fear.",
      "\"Did Ms Ventura consent or was she coerced into complying?\" Mr Fudali said. \"That seems to be the question for the jury.\"",

    "story": [
      "Few names are as synonymous with video games as Doom.",
      "First launched in 1993, the first-person shooter (FPS) remains one of the most influential - and popular - series in the industry.",
      "But even it and its superhuman protagonist, The Doom Slayer, have to contend with the pressures of the games industry in 2025.",
      "Attracting new players, competing with the new titans on the scene and the rising cost of making - and selling - blockbuster titles.",
      "BBC Newsbeat spoke to the project leaders of the latest instalment, Doom: The Dark Ages, about navigating some of these challenges.",
      "'You know exactly what you're getting'",
      "While the Doom series is famous for pitting players against colossal enemies, there are other behemoths it has to face.",
      "\"There's so much stuff competing for our attention these days, whether it's games, movies, or whatever,\" says executive producer Marty Stratton.",
      "Free-to-play (F2P) games, such as Fortnite and Roblox, and annually updated series such as Call of Duty and EA FC regularly dominate most-played charts.",
      "There's evidence to suggest players, particularly younger ones, are spending most of their time on these titles - sometimes referred to as \"forever games\".",
      "In the latest Online Nation report by UK regulator Ofcom, five of the top ten games among UK players were F2P.",
      "Fortnite recorded about 2.65m active UK users in May 2024, and Roblox 1.22m, according to the report, and global figures are much higher.",
      "Drawing those players to premium titles can be a challenge but Marty argues games such as Doom, which can be completed in under 20 hours, can \"fit into those habits\".",
      "\"It doesn't have to become your obsession for the next two years,\" he says.",
      "The Doom series - developed by Dallas-based ID Software - has an advantage over others because it's so well-known and has a large, loyal fanbase.",
      "But, as industry expert Rhys Elliot, from Alinea Analytics, tells Newsbeat, it's getting harder to rely solely on your hardcore players.",
      "Overall, he says, the number of people playing premium titles isn't increasing, but the cost of making them is.",
      "\"The people who make games - they still need to make revenues each year because, you know, capitalism,\" he says.",
      "One way of doing this is by attracting new players.",
      "Doom's director Hugo Martin says the response to Doom: The Dark Age's previews were encouraging - something he puts down in part to its new \"Medieval sci-fi\" setting and altered gameplay style.",
      "\"We see it in the comments - a lot of people are saying 'I think this is going to be my first Doom', and that's exciting for us,\" he says.",
      "The games industry has also leaned into customisation in recent years, giving players the power to finely tweak different elements and aspects of difficulty - something that's been incorporated into The Dark Ages.",
      "\"In that regard I think it's going to be a great first-time experience for a lot of fans,\" says Hugo.",
      "But there's still the small matter of the cost of entry.",
      "The debate over prices has been a feature of gaming discourse for years.",
      "In 2010, a new game cost roughly \u00a340 in the UK - and players had plenty to say about it at the time.",
      "If you take into account inflation (using this Bank of England tool), that would be about \u00a360 in today's money.",
      "Doom: The Dark Ages itself costs \u00a369.99 for a standard edition or almost \u00a3100 for a limited Premium Edition with extras included.",
      "\"When you look at the history of game pricing... it really hasn't skyrocketed,\" says Marty.",
      "The issue has been thrown back into the spotlight thanks to worries over Donald Trump's tariff plans and price announcements from the three major console makers.",
      "That could make competitors such as Fortnite - which don't require new, specialised hardware to run - even more appealing for cash-strapped players.",
      "But Doom producer Marty argues that \"free\" games can end up costing players more in the long run, while there are \"no unknown expenses\" with a one-off purchase such as Doom.",
      "\"You're not going to be asked to pay anything else, two hours in,\" he says.",
      "F2P games generate cash with in-game purchases, ranging from \"microtransactions\" equivalent to a handful of change or, in some cases, hundreds of pounds.",
      "Those costs can mount up, and a recent poll of 2,001 gamers by British bank TSB suggested dedicated players can spend about \u00a322 a month on those transactions.",
      "That's still less than a tentpole new release, but Doom's director Hugo also believes people are happy to pay more for a \"curated experience\" with \"replay value\".",
      "\"Typically, if you just make a really good game then people will want to play it again,\" he says.",
      "Analyst Rhys believes we're going to see more \"fiddling with prices\" and surcharges \"to see what customers are willing to pay\" and a wider range of RRPs for new releases.",
      "\"Hopefully there'll be more competition there. It's good for consumers,\" he says.",
      "Doom is also available on PC and Xbox via Game Pass - Microsoft's Netflix-style subscription priced at \u00a314.99 a month.",
      "There's evidence more people are turning to this, as well as Sony's PlayStation Plus - raising questions over whether they put players off paying full price.",

    "story": [
      "Ozwald Boateng, celebrating four decades of making his indelible mark on the fashion industry, got his chance to stamp his style on the Met Gala in New York earlier this month.",
      "The esteemed British-Ghanaian designer for the first time dressed celebrities - including three of Africa's biggest musicians, Tems, Burna Boy and Arya Starr, as well as actors Ncuti Gatwa and Jaden Smith - at what is seen as his industry's biggest night of the year.",
      "The theme - Superfine: Tailoring Black Style - was \"completely in my wheelhouse\", he says, as it looked at the way that style formed black identities.",
      "Given that he already has a robust legacy in the design world, the 58-year-old saw the opportunity to find fresh adherents to the Boateng look.",
      "\"I think it's, in a way, communicating to a new audience,\" he tells the BBC a few days after the showcase.",
      "Throughout his 40 years in fashion, the designer has built a reputation for challenging the norms of men's tailoring. His eponymous brand sells form-fitting, stylish suits, often accented with bold colours and West African-inspired patterns.",
      "The son of Ghanaian immigrants, Boateng reimagined the country's iconic kente cloth to produce his signature \"tribal\" pattern.",
      "\"It's all about having a strong concept, having a thorough idea of what you want to achieve from the textiles,\" he says.",
      "The Met Gala perfectly matched his outlook. \"Being a theme about black culture and black cultural influence, I mean, how can you do that without Africa?\" he asks.",
      "Considering the link to Ghana, Boateng explains: \"When we were colonised by the Europeans or the Brits, we kept our traditional dress, but tailoring was a big part of how we dressed to look more... effectively more European.",
      "\"My father always wore tailored suits. You had to be smart at all times, that was something I was taught.\"",
      "As if producing outfits for 16 celebrities for fashion's premier event was not stressful enough, Boateng switched up Burna Boy's outfit less than 24 hours before the event.",
      "\"We did his fitting quite literally the night before the Met Gala,\" Boateng says, adding that everyone in the room got \"really excited\" when they saw the Grammy-award winning musician in the finished product.",
      "The look -  a red suit paired with a buttercup yellow shirt and eel-skin cape - was partly inspired by Burna Boy's Nigerian roots.",
      "The musician told Vogue: \"As a waterside pikin [Pidgin for \"child\"] from the Niger Delta, the eel and fish in general are the lifeblood of my people - they symbolise survival, spirit and the flow of tradition through generations.\"",
      "The Met Gala was \"not unusual\", Boateng says, explaining that Africa has been part of his \"message\" throughout his career.",
      "Back in 1995, Boateng was the first black designer to open a shop on Savile Row, a London street famed for fine tailoring.",
      "\"When I first started as a designer, Savile as a street was a dying street,\" Boateng recalls.",
      "\"The concept, it was dying. I effectively moved there in the early 90s and breathed new life into it.\"",
      "Boateng was dubbed the \"peacock of Savile Row\" - with his flamboyance, 6ft-something frame and modelesque facial features, he stood out among his neighbours.",
      "Colour and flair had long been part of Boateng's psyche. At five years old his favourite outfit was a purple, mohair suit made by his mother, who was a seamstress.",
      "Young Boateng commandeered his mother's sewing machine and although he initially chose to study computing at college, he switched to fashion after realising menswear was his future.",
      "As a teenager, Boateng was greatly inspired by tailoring titan Giorgio Armani - and decades later, Armani would praise the London designer for his \"elegance\" and \"cutting edge\" designs.",
      "Boateng opened his first studio in his early 20s, dressing the likes of Mick Jagger, Jimmy Paige and Spike Lee.",
      "He then opened his Savile Row store - at the age of 28 he was the youngest to ever do so.",
      "The burgeoning designer captivated London's fashion scene initially, but in 1998 he went bankrupt when an economic downturn in east Asia scuppered a major order.",
      "Both his professional and personal life descended into disarray - in just 12 months an entire collection was stolen from his studio and his marriage broke down.",
      "But the peacock strutted his way back. Boateng gradually rebuilt his business and in 2002 moved into bigger premises on Savile Row.",
      "Since then, he has served as Givency's creative director for menswear, been awarded an OBE, designed staff uniforms for British Airways and branched out into womenswear.",
      "While racking up professional and charitable commitments, Boateng was raising two children.",
      "Now adults, Oscar and Emilia Boateng accompanied their father to the Met Gala, dressed in the suits that made their surname one of the most famous in contemporary British tailoring.",
      "They are not, however, keen to follow their father into fashion design.",
      "\"I'm trying to slowly but surely seduce them into the fashion business,\" Boateng jokes.",
      "\"It is ultimately their decision to decide what they want from their life. If they find something they're passionate about in a way I have, I am happy.\"",
      "And what is next for his own passion? Boateng might have a brain brimming with concepts, but he has a clear vision of where he wants his brand to go next.",
      "\"The future is expansion,\" he says, \"raising capital to really, really push the brand globally\".",
      "\"I think it's the moment in time - and it's the right moment.\"",

      "Sir Salman was on stage speaking before an audience in August 2022, when he was stabbed multiple times in the face and neck. The attack left him blind in one eye, with damage to his liver and a paralysed hand caused by nerve damage to his arm.",
      "The attack came 35 years after Sir Salman's controversial novel The Satanic Verses, which had long made him the target of death threats for its portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.",
      "Matar received the maximum 25-year sentence for the attempted murder of Sir Salman.",
      "He was also found guilty of assault for wounding the person who was interviewing Sir Salman, Henry Reese, and sentenced to seven years plus three years post-release for that assault.",
      "The sentences must run concurrently because both victims were injured in the same event, Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said on Friday.",
      "Before being sentenced, Matar stood and made a statement about freedom of speech in which he called Rushdie a hypocrite, according to the Associated Press.",
      "\"Salman Rushdie wants to disrespect other people,\" said Matar, clad in white-striped jail clothing and wearing handcuffs. \"He wants to be a bully, he wants to bully other people. I don't agree with that.\"",

      "He said his assailant's eyes \"were dark and seemed very ferocious\".",
      "Sir Salman told the court he initially did not realise he had been stabbed, thinking instead that he had been punched.",
      "Matar stabbed Sir Salman 15 times in total including to his cheek, chest, eye, neck and thigh.",
      "Prosecutors argued that the attack was targeted.",
      "\"There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted,\" prosecuting lawyer Jason Schmidt then told the jury.",
      "Defence lawyer Andrew Brautigan had argued that prosecutors failed to prove Matar intended to kill Sir Salman.",
      "Matar, who pleaded not guilty, did not testify in his defence. His lawyers did not call any witnesses of their own.",
      "\"I don't think he's a very good person,\" Matar said about the author in a 2022 New York Post story. \"He's someone who attacked Islam.\"",
      "Matar praised Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, for calling for Sir Salman's execution.",
      "The attack took place some 35 years after Sir Salman's controversial novel The Satanic Verses was published.",
      "The novel, inspired by the life of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad, sparked outrage among some Muslims, who considered its content to be blasphemous.",

      "Local resident Rebekah Shaman took legal action, arguing that council did not have the correct planning permission - with a judge ruling in her favour.",
      "A Lambeth Council spokesperson said: \"We are currently assessing the impact of this judgment and determining next steps.\"",
      "Ms Shaman's argument centred around planning laws prohibiting a change of use of parks for more than 28 days each year without additional planning consent.",
      "Presiding over the case, Mr Justice Mould found that parts of the park would be used for these events for as many as 37 days.",
      "The judge said his ruling was only about the lawfulness of the council's decision to grant permission for the additional days - a decision he described as \"irrational\".",
      "Ms Shaman told BBC London: \"We are feeling elated, it's been a long time coming. It's regrettable we had to take Lambeth Council to court; it isn't what we wanted to do but we felt they were not engaging with us.",
      "\"This has been going on for years, it isn't a one-off situation and it has been a consistent deterioration of the park, to the point where the community had to speak up to protect the park for future generations.\"",
      "She added: \"We are hoping to come to an agreement where events can still continue, but on a much lower level and also much more connected to the community.\"",
      "Lawyers for Lambeth Council and festival organisers Summer Events Limited both asked for permission to challenge his decision but the judge refused.",
      "However, they are still able to ask the Court of Appeal for permission to challenge the decision directly.",

      "Matt, who has lived in the area for the past 12 years, said: \"I'm really happy with the outcome because it's a win for the local community who've been fighting Lambeth Council for a long time.\"",
      "However, local resident Lucy told BBC London: \"I think it's brilliant to bring festivals to Brockwell Park, I think it's a great celebration of culture, we need to give opportunities to young people and we need to keep art alive.\"",
      "Richard Harwood KC, for Ms Shaman, had argued that Brockwell Park had \"increasingly\" been used for large commercial events in recent years, with \"substantial\" parts of the park being fenced off from the public during the events with damage caused to the ground.",
      "\"Due to inclement weather over the weekend of one of the commercial events, the park effectively became a mudbath,\" Mr Harwood added, referring to one event last year.",
      "Matthew Reed KC, for Lambeth Council, said the \"majority\" of the park remained unfenced and available for the public to use during the events.",
      "He also said that the council was able to lawfully decide how often the park was used for festivals and would grant special permission if needed.",
      "However, Mr Justice Mould found in his ruling that Lambeth Council's planning officer had \"erred in taking into account the mere prospect of planning permission being granted\".",
      "The Protect Brockwell Park group has previously said it is \"not anti-festival\" and supports \"well-run, inclusive events\".",

      "\"There's a lot of expectations,\" they explain.",
      "\"The media at home is like, 'Oh, we're not happy with this entry, it's going to fail.'",

      "Nemo remembers that feeling well.",
      "This time last year, they were the bookmakers' third favourite, but saw off frontrunners Croatia and Israel with a high-risk performance that saw them dancing on a tilted, spinning platform, while hitting improbable high notes for three long minutes.",

      "\"And then I got lucky seven times, because you're rehearsing, then you have the jury show, and it all leads up to the final performance.",
      "\"I was like, 'It's gone right seven times. What are the chances that, in this moment, it will go wrong?'",
      "\"So I trusted in the moment, and everything went fine, but I could have been the biggest loser in the history of Switzerland!\"",

      "In recent weeks, broadcasters in Spain, Ireland and Slovenia have called for a debate on Israel's involvement, and there have been small protests in the streets of Basel, Switzerland where this year's contest is taking place.",
      "The incident during Thursday's dress rehearsal did not disrupt Raphael's performance, and her appearance in the televised semi-final passed without further demonstrations.",
      "Speaking to the BBC earlier this week, Raphael said her team had played audience noises over her rehearsals, \"so I can practise when there is distractions in the background.\"",

      "\"We call it the Formula 1 tyre change,\" says Richard van Rouwendaal, the affable  Dutch stage manager who makes it all work.",
      "\"Each person in the crew can only do one thing. You run on stage with one light bulb or one prop. You always walk on the same line. If you go off course, you will hit somebody.",
      "\"It's a bit like ice skating.\"",
      "The stage crew start rehearsing their \"F1 tyre change\" weeks before the contestants even arrive.",
      "Every country sends detailed plans of their staging, and Eurovision hires stand-ins to play the acts (in Liverpool 2023, it was pupils from the local performing arts school), while stagehands start shaving precious seconds off the changeovers.",
      "\"We have about two weeks,\" says Van Rouwendaal, who's normally based in Utrecht but is in Basel for this year's contest.",
      "\"My company is around 13 Dutchies and 30 local guys and girls, who rock it in Switzerland.",
      "\"In those two weeks, I have to figure out who's right for each job. Someone's good at running, someone's good at lifting, someone's good at organising the backstage area. It is a bit like being good at Tetris because you have to line everything up in a small space, in the perfect way.\"",
      "As soon as a song finishes, the team are ready to roll.",
      "As well as the stagehands, there are people responsible for positioning lights and setting pyrotechnics; and 10 cleaners who sweep the stage with mops and vacuum cleaners between every performance.",
      "\"My cleaners are just as important as the stage crew. You need a clean stage for the dancers  - but also, if there's an overhead shot of somebody lying down, you don't want to see shoeprints on the floor.\"",
      "The attention to detail is clinical. Backstage, every performer has their own microphone stand, set to the correct height and angle, to make sure every  performance is camera perfect.",
      "\"Sometimes the delegation will say the artist wants to wear a different shoe for the grand final,\" says Van Rouwendaal. \"But if that happens, the mic stand is at the wrong height, so we've got a problem!\"",
      "Spontaneously changing footwear isn't the worst problem he's faced, though. At the 2022 contest in Turin, the stage was 10m (33ft) higher than the backstage area.",
      "As a result, they were pushing heavy stage props \u2013 including a mechanical bull \u2013 up a steep ramp between every act.",
      "\"We were exhausted every night,\" he recalls. \"This year is better. We've even got an extra backstage tent where we prepare the props.\"",
      "Props are a huge part of Eurovision. The tradition started at the second ever contest in 1957, when Germany's Margot Hielscher sang part of her song Telefon, Telefon into (you guessed it) a telephone.",
      "Over the intervening decades, the staging has become ever more elaborate. In 2014, Ukraine's Mariya Yaremchuk trapped one of her dancers in a giant hamster wheel, while Romania brought a literal cannon to their performance in 2017.",

      "What if it all goes wrong?",

      "Her performance was briefly interrupted when the feed from an on-stage camera froze, but producers simply cut to a wide shot until it was fixed. (If it had happened in the final, she'd have been offered the chance to perform again.)",
      "\"There's actually lots of measures that are being taken to make sure that every act can be shown in the best way,\" says Reist.",
      "\"There are people who know the regulations by heart, who have been playing through what could happen and what we would do in various different situations.",

      "It's no surprise to learn that staging a live three-hour broadcast with thousands of moving parts is incredibly stressful.",
      "This year, organisers have introduced measures to protect the welfare of contestants and crew, including closed-door rehearsals, longer breaks between shows, and the creation of a \"disconnected zone\" where cameras are banned.",
      "Even so, Reist says she has worked every weekend for the past two months, while Van Rouwendaal and his team are regularly pulling 20-hour days.",
      "The shifts are so long that, back in 2008, Eurovision production legend Ola Melzig  built a bunker under the stage, complete with a sofa, a \"sadly underused\" PS3 and two (yes, two) espresso machines.",
      "\"I don't have hidden luxuries like Ola. I'm not at that level yet!\" laughs Van Rouwendaal",
      "\"But backstage, I've got a spot with my crew. We've got stroopwafels there and, last week, it was King's Day in Holland, so I baked pancakes for everyone.",
      "\"I try to make it fun. Sometimes we go out and have a drink and cheer because we had a great day.",
      "\"Yes, we have to be on top, and we have to be sharp as a knife, but having fun together is also very important.\"",

      "The rules of the European Broadcasting Union \u2013 which is in charge of Eurovision \u2013 means no political statements can be made.

      "Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 asked the EBU for a discussion on Israel's inclusion. Its director general, Kevin Bakhurst, said he was \"appalled by the ongoing events in the Middle East and by the horrific impact on civilians in Gaza, and the fate of Israeli hostages\". Spain and Slovenia's broadcasters also asked for a discussion.",
      "Last week, more than 70 former Eurovision contestants signed a letter calling on the organisers to ban Israel from the competition.",

      "In previous years, other countries have been banned from the contest. Belarus was suspended in 2021 after submitting an overtly political entry and a year later Russia was barred over the war in Ukraine.",
      "Ms Raphael said she was trying not to deal with those who say her country shouldn't be competing. \"Everybody has opinions,\" she said. \"I'm really putting everything aside and just concentrating on the most important thing. The slogan this year is 'united by music' and that's what we are here for.\"",
      "Eurovision said it understood the concerns and views about the current situation in the Middle East, but insisted members should ensure Eurovision remained a \"universal event that promotes connections, diversity and inclusion through music\".",

      "Eurovision offers chance to change that. They head to Basel, Switzerland this week, hoping to erase the memories of Olly Alexander and Mae Muller, who both finished at the bottom end of the table.",
      "It helps that Remember Monday's song is a certified banger - full of glittery glam-pop flourishes and sizzling harmonies that (crucially) they can pull off live.",
      "Just before they set off for Euroland, we sat down with the trio to discuss quitting their jobs, overcoming phobias, and the dreaded \"nul points\".",

      "How many air miles have you racked up in that time?",
      "Lauren: Honestly, I feel bad about our carbon footprint.",
      "Charlotte: The thing is, I'm a nervous flyer. I always put an eye mask on, put my headphones in and avoid looking out the window. Then we had to catch a propellor plane from Reykjavik in Iceland, and as it was taking off, the whole thing was shaking from side to side.",
      "Lauren: It was really treacherous\u2026 but then, the next Easyjet flight we had to catch, Charlotte was like, 'What a breeze'.",

      "What are your hopes for the result?",
      "Holly-Anne: We do have a preference. And I think the closer we get to it, the more hungry we are for a good result. A placement in the single digits would be nice.",
      "You have loads of festival performances booked for the summer \u2013 so life won't   grind to a halt afterwards.",
      "Lauren: That's so true. And actually, every experience that we're having in the lead-up to May 17, that's Eurovision as well.",

      "The Eurovision Song Contest was watched by around 163 million people last year \u2013 meaning there are potentially 163 million different opinions on what makes a perfect entrant.",
      "Do you go for a soulful ballad, guaranteed to leave Europe misty-eyed and full of love and peace?",
      "Or do you opt for a cheesy extravaganza, complete with saucy takes on regional costumes and eye-popping staging that will have the entire continent (and Australia) raving in their living rooms?",
      "The perfect song",
      "Forensic musicologist at Boston's Berklee College of Music Joe Bennett has analysed hundreds of Eurovision finalists, identifying two dominant musical styles.",
      "One is the \"Euro-banger\" - high-energy, 120+ BPM songs with kick drums and synth-heavy production, like Sweden's winning entries Euphoria (Loreen, 2012) and Heroes (M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w, 2015).",
      "The other is the slow-burning ballad - typically around 70 BPM, such as Portugal's Amar Pelos Dois (Salvador Sobral, 2017) and the Netherlands' Arcade (Duncan Laurence, 2019).",
      "There is a clich\u00e9 that Eurovision songs are only about love and peace \u2013 reinforced by a song performed during the 2016 contest's interval about writing a perfect Eurovision song, called Love Love Peace Peace.",
      "According to Bennett, there is some validity to this, with every Eurovision song falling under six broad lyrical themes: \"love, unity, self-assertion, partying, history and songs about making music\".",
      "He adds that \"songs of self-assertion or lyrical self-empowerment do very well\" - as seen with Austria's 2014 winner Rise Like a Phoenix (Conchita Wurst).",
      "Keep staging simple and effective",
      "Acts might be tempted to go over the top on staging, but this may not be the way to secure victory, according to our experts.",
      "Songwriter Thomas Stengaard co-wrote Denmark's 2013 winner Only Teardrops (as well as this year's UK entry What the Hell Just Happened by Remember Monday). He puts his success down, in part, to its simple staging, which he says made it easy to remember.",
      "\"If you asked a kid to draw that staging, they could. It was a girl with no shoes on, two guys playing the drums and a flute guy. Very simple, but it worked.\"",
      "What time is the Eurovision 2025 final and who is in it?",
      "Vocal coach Carrie Grant, who led the UK's jury in 2014 and came sixth in the contest as part of Sweet Dreams in 1983, agrees.",
      "\"There is nothing worse than having an artist whose stage has lots of money but their performance doesn't warrant it,\" she says. \"It makes that performance seem worse.\"",
      "The 2014 winner (and Carrie's personal favourite) was Conchita Wurst \u2013 the first act to win the contest without backing singers or dancers on stage since 1970.",
      "What made Conchita stand out was that she was a bearded drag queen. Carrie believes Eurovision fans love things that are quirky and that \"embrace the LGBT community\".",
      "But she adds that Conchita wasn't a gimmick but instead \"a brilliant singer who could deliver what we call in vocal coaching 'money moments'\".",
      "The key is key",
      "Minor-key songs increasingly dominate Eurovision.",
      "Bennett debunks the idea that \"major equals happy, minor equals sad\", adding that \"minor keys are more a shorthand for emotional depth\".",
      "In 2023, 85% of finalists performed in minor keys, according to the Press Association. In the last 20 years, only two major-key songs have won - 2011's Running Scared (for Azerbaijan) and 2017's Amar Pelos Dois.",
      "Professor Elizabeth Hellmuth Margulis, a researcher in music cognition at Princeton, highlights source sensitivity \u2013 our instinct to associate a song's sound with its intended context. A few bars of a techno song, for example, and we have a mental image of a dark nightclub, and of the sort of DJ who might perform there.",
      "This means certain minor keys now immediately signal \"Eurovision-ness\" to audiences.",
      "Remember Monday's What the Hell Just Happened was written at a songwriting camp, with multiple songwriters working together at a countryside retreat to write the perfect song for this year's UK act.",
      "The song was intentionally written in a major key to stand out in a sea of minor-key songs - similar to the UK's 2022 second-place entry, Spaceman by Sam Ryder (B Major).",

      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 of this year\u2019s Eurovision songs",
      "Have a surprise up your sleeve",
      "Repetition is important to make a song stick in the mind, says Margulis. But songs should avoid being too repetitive. Margulis says that what particularly makes a song catchy is \"not only when they are heard repeatedly, but also when they throw in some kind of surprise twist\".",
      "Bucks Fizz's 1981 winner for the UK, Making Your Mind Up, is a classic example. First, the song changes key, quickly followed by a memorable costume change in which the female singers' skirts were ripped off to reveal shorter skirts \u2013 a joint visual and musical twist.",
      "Earlier Eurovision winners were often mocked for their nonsense lyrics, like Sweden's 1984 winner Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley, but Bennett argues this highlights Eurovision's strong focus on melody.",
      "\"Eurovision really needs big melodic hooks. You want people across Europe to be singing that melody. The need for a very accessible, catchy chorus is essential.\"",
      "Key changes have long been a way to introduce novelty into Eurovision songs. The 2000s saw multiple winners follow this formula, including Olsen Brothers' Fly on the Wings of Love for Norway (2000), and Serbia's Molitva in 2007.",
      "But as Bennett points out, though they are still present in around a fifth of finalists, no song with a final chorus key change has won since Molitva almost 20 years ago.",
      "Stengaard's song for this year's UK act Remember Monday is certainly full of surprises. BBC music correspondent Mark Savage said the song featured \"a dizzying array of key changes and tempo shifts\".",
      "The song is the songwriter's answer to the question he asks himself whenever he writes for Eurovision: \"How do you stand out in a contest where everyone wants to stand out?\"",

    "story": [
      "The Swiss city of Basel is going into party mode this weekend, as it prepares to welcome the Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "It's been 36 years since Switzerland last hosted the contest, after Celine Dion won in 1988, so the wait to roll out Eurovision's famous turquoise carpet has been long.",
      "Switzerland hosted the first ever Eurovision at Lugano in 1956, but its record since Dion's victory in Dublin has been mixed.",
      "Between 2007 and 2010, and again between 2015 and 2018, its entries failed to even qualify for the final. Swiss singer Nemo finally won last year with The Code.",
      "Perhaps because of that, Basel is determined to make this contest memorable for all the right reasons. At 1.3km (0.8 miles), its turquoise carpet will be Eurovision's longest ever, stretching from Basel town hall, across the river Rhine all the way to the Eurovision village.",
      "The head of Basel's government, Conradin Cramer, believes his city of just 175,000 residents is the natural home for Eurovision's estimated half a million visitors.",
      "Because of its borders with both France and Germany, Basel is \"the heart of Europe\", he says. What's more, he points out, the city has a long humanist tradition; when other cities in medieval Europe were cracking down on free thinkers, Basel welcomed them.",
      "So Basel, with its geographic location and its history of tolerance, and Eurovision with its tradition of inclusivity and diversity are, he says \"the perfect match\".",
      "How to win Eurovision, according to the experts",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 Eurovision songs",
      "Ireland asks Eurovision organisers for discussion over Israel",
      "Last year's contest in Malmo attracted thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators and further protests against the war in Gaza are expected in Basel too.",
      "Police have not yet released their plans to manage this, but have said that everyone should have the right to express their opinion, as long they stay within the law, and do not risk the safety of others.",
      "Throughout the contest they say 1,300 officers will be on duty. Basel has also unveiled a security operation to ensure visitors can enjoy the song contest safely. They are promising \"mobile awareness teams\", safe retreats for victims of violence or hostility and a 24-hour hotline. The concept, which Basel officials describe as unique, aims to prevent violence, sexual assault or harassment, and racist aggression and insults.",
      "The awareness teams, recognisable by their pink jackets, will be available 24 hours a day across the city. Basel's security director Stephanie Eymann said the teams were a \"low-threshold\" measure to give visitors a chance to report harassment or assaults, and seek protection, even if some might not want to approach the police.",
      "The entire town appears to have embraced the event, with turquoise welcome flags now waving from every lamp post. Tickets for the contest itself sold out in minutes, but Basel is promising that there will be \"something for everyone\", ticket or no ticket, and most of it will be free.",
      "\"There will be concerts all over the city, there will be art projects,\" says tourism director Letizia Elia. Basel has 40 museums and galleries in a space of just 37 square kilometres, a record for a European city, and they are all getting involved.",
      "An exhibition featuring works by Andy Warhol, Mark Rothko, Wassily Kandinsky, and Pablo Picasso has opened at the Beyeler Foundation, where Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone's We are Poems rainbow sculpture sits on the roof. There's also a Glitz and Glam exhibition at Basel's museum of natural history.",
      "The celebrations have spread across Switzerland, with competitions across the country for the best school band \u2013 the top four will get a spot on stage in Basel.",
      "But hosting an event like Eurovision is never hitch-free, and this one is no exception. The final choice of Basel as a venue was only made at the end of August last year, allowing just over seven months to organise everything.",
      "Then came objections from evangelical Christian groups, who claimed Eurovision undermined traditional family values and that performers regularly sang about satanism and the occult. They gathered enough signatures to force a referendum aimed at banning public money for the event.",
      "But on 24 November voters gave a huge yes to the song contest; with 66.6% approving Basel's budget of almost $40m. Conradin Cramer had expected a referendum, because \"that's how Switzerland works, it's perfectly fine.\" But he was still delighted at the size of the vote in favour: \"It shows this is a city where people really want to do this.\"",
      "He is very conscious that the global debate around diversity and inclusion has changed in the year since Swiss singer Nemo became the first non-binary person to win Eurovision.",
      "The overriding message of Basel, Mr Cramer says, is \"everyone is welcome\".",
      "On-stage and in the dressing rooms though, things are stricter. EBU, which runs the contest itself, has stuck to its rules saying performers can only bring their own national flags onstage or into the green rooms. This means that they will not be able to fly the Pride flag or that of any other gender identity or sexuality.",
      "Fans, however, will be able to bring whatever flags they like into the arena.",

      "Two Pints was first performed in 2017 in, appropriately, a pub in Dublin, before embarking on a tour of watering holes across Ireland.",
      "Doyle wrote it soon after his father's death.",
      "\"The plot was inspired by the experience of visiting the hospital to see him, and dreading it,\" he explained. \"Wanting to go, but dreading it.",
      "\"So the rhythm of that time \u2013 visiting the hospital, going up for the last time to say goodbye to him, and then the funeral \u2013 is the plot of the play, really.\"",
      "The experience made Doyle reflect on the way men - especially men of a certain age - confide in one another.",

    "story": [
      "The line-up for UK's celebrity edition of The Traitors has finally been revealed - with enough star power to rival Graham Norton's chat show sofa.",
      "The 19-strong roundtable of stars joining Claudia Winkleman at Ardross Castle in Scotland boasts household names across sport and the arts.",
      "Among them are comedians Stephen Fry and Alan Carr, chat show host Jonathan Ross and Olympic diver Tom Daley - all vying to win the game of deception.",
      "Singers Paloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church will also be there, alongside others including historian David Olusoga, broadcaster Clare Balding, actress Celia Imrie and Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed.",
      "The third series of The Traitors, which aired in January, attracted more than 10 million viewers.",
      "The show's format is deceptively simple. A handful of contestants, known as traitors, pick off their castmates, the faithful, with nightly \"murders\" - while the faithful try to work out their identity. If any traitors remain at the end, they nab the cash prize (though this time the money goes to a charity of the winner's choosing).",
      "The celebrity season, which airs this autumn, will bring a unique mix of fame, ego and public image to the popular format. BBC News speaks to psychologists to uncover likely faithfuls, traitors and frontrunners.",
      "The comedians",
      "Alan Carr, Jonathan Ross, Stephen Fry, Joe Wilkinson and Lucy Beaumont",
      "Comedians are likely to be \"the obvious frontrunners to go the distance\", says Susie Masterson, a psychotherapist registered with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).",
      "Humour can be a highly adapted defence mechanism, she says, which can make comedians more opaque than other contestants.",
      "Comics are also quick on their feet, used to presenting a persona and masking in public - this makes them well-equipped traitors, notes Masterson.",
      "\"I think Alan Carr could well be a frontrunner,\" she says. \"There is an affability about him, but he's also not afraid of stirring the pot. He's very authentic and has a big personality without necessarily dominating the space.\"",
      "But fame could disadvantage the high-profile names in the group, like Jonathan Ross. Status, explains consultant counselling psychologist Dr Ritika Suk Birah, can create a power imbalance.",
      "\"It can make others feel threatened or suspicious of their motives, even when there's no evidence,\" she says.",
      "This may be a particular challenge for those understood as both intelligent and articulate, like Stephen Fry.",
      "This perception can lead others to assume strategic manipulation, potentially forcing early elimination out of fear rather than logic, adds Dr Birah.",
      "Unfortunately, Masterson also believes Fry could fit into the category of contestants who \"struggle with criticism or scrutiny\".",
      "\"He might struggle with banishing people as well as any potential heat he might receive,\" she says.",
      "The singers",
      "Paloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church",
      "Stage performers like Cat Burns are used to high-pressure situations, interacting with a variety of people in a live environment. \"This could help at the round table,\" says Masterson.",
      "She adds that Paloma Faith and Charlotte Church are both \"big personalities and have direct communication styles\". While this may make them good motivators, Masterson is unsure whether they can appear contained or measured enough to endure as traitors.",
      "The sports stars",
      "Tom Daley, Joe Marler and Clare Balding",
      "Sports people will likely make good faithfuls, says Masterson, as strong physical types tend to do better in most of the challenges and can also both lead and motivate the rest of the group. They are also usually goal-driven and able to handle pressure.",
      "\"They are quite different personalities in this group, and I'm interested to see how it might play out,\" says Masterson.",
      "\"Clare Balding is very practical and pragmatic, but we have also seen her emotional side on TV recently\".",
      "She feels Tom Daley, and to a lesser extent Balding, could well be \"golden retriever types\" - loyal and supportive - whereas rugby star Joe Marler may be less likely to want to talk things through.",
      "As for the in-built competitive edge, she says success depends on whether they can \"play as a team rather than against each other.\"",
      "The actors",
      "Nick Mohammad, Mark Bonnar, Tameka Empson, Ruth Codd, Celia Imrie",
      "Actors, like comics, may also face distrust depending on how much their castmates expect them to be naturally deceptive.",
      "However, among the group of actors, there is a good mix of ages, types of acting and levels of fame - from soap star Tameka Empson to established film names like Mark Bonnar and Celia Imrie. This could \"balance out this superficial disadvantage\" by muddying the threat level, says Masterson.",
      "She says cast members with lesser-known personalities, like Ruth Codd and Nick Mohammed, might be harder to read.",
      "The media personalities",
      "David Olusoga, Niko Omilana and Kate Garraway",
      "Presenters like Kate Garraway will be used to live interactions, giving them a potential advantage at the roundtable, notes Masterson.",
      "Historian David Olusoga, as a heavyweight intellect, will likely face the same preconception struggle as Fry, she says.",
      "Masterson also adds that quiet people can struggle to go the distance on the show, as they can either be perceived as threatening or unsupportive by the group.",
      "But the show's history has shown this isn't always the case. Last year's contestant Francesca was hardly visible in the first few episodes, even prompting memes about her supposed irrelevancy, before growing into the show and making it to the final.",
      "One dark horse is YouTube prankster Niko Omilana, says author Eloise Skinner, who holds a diploma in psychotherapy.",
      "His career in social media and online content might offer an edge in the game, as someone fluent in an online world that is hyper-aware of perception."

    "summary": "Senior figures in the UK TV industry are contemplating how best to secure its future",
    "story": [
      "Just before Christmas, in a private dining room in the upmarket Charlotte Street Hotel in the heart of London's Fitzrovia area, the BBC's director general gathered some of the UK's leading TV creatives and executives for lunch. As they ate, surrounded by kaleidoscopic-patterned wallpaper and giant artworks, they were also chewing over the future survival of their own industry.",
      "As solutions were thrown around to what many see as an acute funding crisis in the age of global streaming, one of the invitees suggested, in passing, that BBC Studios (the corporation's commercial content-producing arm) could merge with Channel 4 to create a bigger, more powerful force to compete with the likes of Disney Plus, Netflix and Amazon.",
      "As another diner knocked down the idea, I'm told that Tim Davie, the BBC's DG, asked why it was so ridiculous.",
      "I relate that not because it has come to fruition. It hasn't. Nor even to suggest that the Director General supports the idea.",
      "Instead the story illustrates the belief, among some within the broadcasting industry, that nothing should be off the table when it comes to contemplating how to ensure the survival of British-originated and British-focused TV as we know it.",
      "Many of the people I spoke to for this piece didn't want to be quoted. But Sir Peter Bazalgette, the former Chairman of ITV, told me that what he termed the current \"generous spread\" of British broadcasters (BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5) will need some consolidation or, at the very least, more cooperation in future.",
      "\"We're in danger of having no public service broadcasting within a decade, certainly within 20 years,\" he says. \"We don't have a strategy for their survival. It's that serious. The regulators need to start thinking about it.",
      "\"Mergers may well be part of the answer. There should be fewer companies in the future.\"",
      "Lord Vaizey, who was Culture Minister under David Cameron, put it baldly. \"ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 should merge.",
      "\"The UK only has room for two domestic broadcasters.\"",
      "Others, however, argue that distinctiveness is good for viewers. Channel 5 President Sarah Rose told me she \"couldn't disagree with Ed Vaizey more\" \u2013 calling it a \"Doomsday prophecy\".",
      "Channel 5 is profitable, she tells me; it invests in smaller production companies and offers plurality for British audiences. By having just one commercial channel, \"You're taking the funnel from three to one types of content for British audiences.\"",
      "Channel 4 also rejects the suggestion of any merger. Its outgoing CEO Alex Mahon argues that, \"The unique structure of competition between our publicly funded and commercially funded broadcasters\" is what makes UK public service TV \"so excellent\".",
      "And yet the days of turning on your TV and finding an electronic programme guide listing channels \u2013 with BBC1 and BBC2 at the top, then ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 \u2013 are disappearing. The proposed date for the dawn of a new era is 2035; the end of traditional terrestrial TV as we know it.",
      "When the increasingly expensive contracts to provide broadcast channels and digital terrestrial services like Freeview come to an end, the UK's broadcasters are likely to pivot to offering digital-only video on demand. (However this won't happen without a campaign to ensure older people are protected, as well as rural and low-income households who may not have high quality internet access.)",
      "But if the aerials are turned off in 2035, is this the moment TV as we know it changes forever? If it becomes a battle between online-only British streamers and their better-funded US rivals, can the Brits survive? And, crucially, what will audiences be watching?",
      "How TV could look by 2035",
      "Flash forward to switching on the television in 2035 and there will of course have been certain technological transformations \u2013 perhaps more immersive viewing experiences or some shows viewed through augmented reality glasses. What's highly likely, though, is that the communal big screen will still be a staple, (albeit probably voice-activated by then).",
      "It's a shift that has already begun with YouTube viewers changing their viewing habits and moving to the bigger screen. In 2024, for the first time, TV sets were the most-used device for watching content on the video sharing site at home, according to recent data from Barb Audiences. In all, 41% of YouTube viewing was done on TV sets, ahead of 31% on smartphones.",
      "With YouTube an apparently unstoppable force, in ten years' time it could well become the go-to viewing for the majority.",
      "\"We are likely to continue to see a shift in the share of viewing time and advertising revenue towards globally-scaled players and user-generated content platforms like YouTube and TikTok,\" all within the next five years, according to Kate Scott-Dawkins, Global President for Business Intelligence at media investment company Group M.",
      "There'll also likely be Netflix, Disney, Apple, Amazon. In other words, the global players, based in the US, many of which also have other revenue streams (whether parks, computer hardware or a vast shopping platform).",
      "Kate Scott-Dawkins tells me the UK broadcasters are facing what could be an \"existential\" battle against US-based media companies with \"wildly different business models\".",
      "The shift to streaming TV has, she says, \"enabled large globally-scaled players to get even bigger and pour money into content that they can put in front of worldwide audiences\".",
      "The \"big players with big pockets\" already pay for a bespoke button on certain remote controls, or their own content tile front and centre on the homepage on smart TVs.",
      "Ms Scott-Dawkins believes that in the future it will be \"a position of strength\" to own the operating systems themselves, as well as the media that people are watching on them. Examples include Apple showing its films and television series on Apple TVs and iPhones, or Amazon showing its own productions via its Fire devices, or Google through its own computers and phones.",
      "Questions of revenue",
      "Part of the problem is that the UK terrestrial channels can't compete financially with the streamers. Netflix, for example, is valued at $472bn (\u00a3356bn).",
      "The BBC has lost 30% of its income \u2013 or \u00a31bn a year \u2013 in real terms since 2010, as the licence fee has become worth less. ITV's share price hasn't yet recovered since the advertising downturn in 2022, despite its vast production arm, ITV Studios, boosting its earnings before tax to \u00a3299m.",
      "Meanwhile, Channel 4's recorded a deficit of \u00a352m for 2023. Alex Mahon told Parliament last month, \"We will pretty much break even in the year\".",
      "Some TV insiders think the solution will be one gateway or app for all public service content: one place to find all shows from BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and 5.",
      "Alex Mahon recently told a newspaper that there needs to be \"more collaboration\" between the UK broadcasters \u2013 a way of \"making sure we're not duplicating the same technology\".",
      "ITV has spent hundreds of millions to create ITVX, its streaming platform for the Netflix-age. Channel 4 took a pioneering approach to its own digital transformation, launching 4oD back in 2006; the first broadcaster in the world to offer television content on-demand.",
      "But while its current \u00a31bn a year revenue enables it to compete as a significant content creator, this may not be enough to sustain a modern distribution platform with all the associated investment costs into the long term, according to some insiders.",
      "Lord Hall, the former BBC Director General, is among those arguing that it's not sustainable for individual broadcasters to continue going it alone. \"The notion that everyone has their own portals when you are competing against the huge streamers is not going to survive into the future,\" he says.",
      "'One big streamer under iPlayer'?",
      "Could the solution be for BBC iPlayer, which has been built with public money, to become the portal for the other British public service media content, too? It would be a single place where viewers could find ITV's The Chase, Channel 4's The Great British Bake Off and Channel 5 News, alongside BBC's The Traitors. This was one idea suggested to me by multiple TV insiders. \"One big streamer under iPlayer\", as one TV executive described it to me, \"a modern public service streaming service\".",
      "Part of their argument is that it's the fastest growing streaming service in the UK \u2013 and the only existing platform of plausible scale to compete.",
      "With political support and the right deal, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 could potentially get behind sharing tech (after all, the streaming service Freely, which launched last year, already hosts their content with the BBC's and others).",
      "But the idea of branding this all under the BBC iPlayer is \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 not something that commercial broadcasters would likely entertain, according to conversations I've had.",
      "Lord Hall believes, \"It could be branded differently... It would be a very good step.\"",
      "He says: \"The public would have to get used to the fact that BBC material would be free of advertising, and other parts of the platform would have adverts.\"",
      "If the idea of a shared streaming service sounds familiar, that's because it was proposed years ago. Project Kangaroo was a plan by BBC Worldwide, ITV and Channel 4 for a UK video-on-demand joint venture. Think an early rival to Netflix.",
      "But the UK's Competition Commission blocked the project in 2009 because of concerns it could harm competition in the emerging VoD market.",
      "Other regulators across Europe have also blocked mergers: In France, the TFI and M6 channels were prevented from merging. Two of the largest TV and radio broadcasters in the Netherlands, which would have combined eight national TV channels and four national radio stations, were also stopped for competition reasons.",
      "Any form of merger between different public service broadcasters would be subject to the same scrutiny. It's perhaps why Sir Peter Bazalgette is calling on UK politicians and regulators to focus on creating a strategy \u2013 or risk the end of British TV as we know it.",
      "Should the audiences care?",
      "The BBC remains the most watched of the traditional broadcasters. Today, people in the UK spend more time watching traditional broadcasters than they do streaming services. Figures show 87% of people age four and above watch the traditional broadcasters each month and they spend an average of 137 minutes a day doing so. By comparison, 78% of people watch a streaming service and they spend only 40 minutes a day doing so.",
      "If this does shift and the pattern reverses, TV producers and executives may be worried. But does it really matter to audiences?",
      "Netflix is already making the types of shows that may have previously been made by the likes of the BBC (Adolescence, Toxic Town and Baby Reindeer are all very British stories made by the streamer). So what is the problem? (Aside from the obvious point that you need a subscription to watch Netflix.)",
      "Ms Rose argues that the picture is \"much more complex\". Creatives involved in those shows often cut their teeth in public service TV, she says \u2013 one of benefits of the traditional broadcasters is, she believes, that it is a pipeline of talent.",
      "Sir Peter Bazalgette argues that they're needed more than ever in our AI age to serve as \"a gold standard of trusted news for our democracy, amid the online Tower of Babel.\"",
      "He also argues for programmes that reflect \"our shared values and national conversation\". Would a US-based streamer have chosen to make Mr Bates v the Post Office (ITV), for example, or 'Wolf Hall' (BBC) or 'It's A Sin' (Channel 4) \u2013 stories that are uniquely British and reflect who we are?",
      "Backing producers to take risks is, says Lord Hall, \"exactly what the BBC should be doing \u2013 but of course [it] has been doing less because the licence fee has been consistently cut\".",
      "Start of the 'martini streaming age'",
      "Ultimately, the American streamers are here to stay; they're spending billions and their UK operations are often led by British executives who are supportive of Britain's public service broadcasting scene.",
      "I have also picked up a sense from those inside Netflix that the company is often used as a battering ram to persuade the government that the UK's traditional broadcasters need more protections.",
      "Some have also been critical of the BBC for, as they see it, wanting everything on its own terms: \"'We want you to give us your money for co-productions, but the BBC will make all the creative decisions',\" is how one insider put it to me, unfairly or not.",
      "In 2018, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos was invited to the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. Invitees recall that he talked warmly about how influential the BBC's iPlayer had been to the success of Netflix, describing how impressed he had been by a piece of kit that had got British viewers used to getting their video on demand.",
      "With more than 17 million Brits now subscribed to Netflix, there is a certain irony to that.",
      "Today, as the BBC's Director General Tim Davie starts to position the BBC ahead of the renewal of the corporation's charter after 2027, the TV landscape is changing fast. And the challenges are clear.",
      "Lord Hall tells me: \"Our lives will be enriched by having not only what the streamers can offer, but also what the public service broadcasters can bring. It's unthinkable not to build on what the BBC and others can deliver\".",
      "Sir Peter Bazalgette predicts that, \"Small doesn't cut it,\" adding that, \"The winners will have to be big enough to [both] afford high end dramas for winning subscribers and maintain large back catalogues to keep subscribers happy.\"",
      "He says we now live in \"the 'martini' streaming age - any time, any place, anywhere\".",
      "The question is whether the leaders of the public service broadcasters can forge the right plan to safeguard their industry in that age.",
      "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",
      "The divides behind the scenes in the Vatican ahead of the conclave",

    "story": [
      "No one would be forced to help with the process of assisted dying against their wishes, under changes approved by MPs.",
      "A bill which would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales, expected to die within six months, to seek help to end their own life is currently being considered by Parliament.",
      "The legislation passed its first stage in the House of Commons last November \u2013 but since then the details have been pored over and dozens of amendments added by both sides.",
      "On Friday MPs debated further potential changes, which also included preventing medical staff from raising the option of assisted dying with a patient first.",
      "However, MPs ran out of time to vote on more changes, so further debate and voting will take place on 13 June.",
      "That would be followed by a vote on whether to pass the bill as a whole to its next stage or reject it, either on the same day or a future date.",
      "The government is neutral on the bill and MPs have been given a free vote, meaning they can decide based on their conscience rather than having to follow a party line.",
      "The original bill stated that no registered medical practitioner or other health professional would be under any obligation to participate in the process of assisted dying and they could not be discriminated by their employer if they did not wish to do so.",
      "Under a change proposed by Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, and approved by MPs, this has been expanded say no one would have to take part in the process, giving protections to any staff who might be involved.",

      "Assisted dying law could take four years to implement",
      "MPs scrap judge sign-off in assisted dying bill",
      "During an emotionally charged - and at times ill-tempered - debate, supporters of the bill argued it had been strengthened by earlier changes.",
      "Opening the proceedings, Leadbeater said many people had \"lost loved ones in deeply difficult and traumatic circumstances\".",
      "The MP for Spen Valley added: \"Put simply, if we do not vote to change the law, we are essentially saying that the status quo is acceptable.\"",
      "But opponents said the bill had been rushed through and needed stronger protections for people who could be vulnerable to coercion.",
      "Conservative MP Rebecca Paul argued there should be a focus on improving end-of-life care, rather than assisted dying.",
      "\"[The bill] will harm far more people than it will help,\" Paul said.",
      "\"And those people who will be harmed are among the most vulnerable in our communities and I'm not willing to accept this collateral damage.\"",
      "At points the debate became tetchy, with some criticising how the process had been conducted.",
      "Labour MP Jess Asato accused campaigner and broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen of being \"distasteful and disrespectful\" for accusing the bill's opponents of having \"undeclared personal religious beliefs which mean no precautions would satisfy\" their concerns.",
      "However, Dame Esther's daughter, Rebecca Wilcox, told BBC Breakfast she was worried about the \"scaremongering\", \"blatant lies\" and \"myths\" circulating about the bill.",
      "She said that while she appreciated there were concerns over coercion and how the proposed legislation could affect vulnerable or disabled people, the bill was \"full of safeguards\".",

      "Several MPs raised concerns people with anorexia could be considered terminally ill and eligible for assisted dying if they refuse to eat or drink.",
      "However, Leadbeater argued this risk was \"negligible\".",
      "\"Not only would someone with severe anorexia be highly unlikely to be assessed to have capacity to make a decision about assisted dying, the other tragic reality is that if a patient was so ill as a result of not eating and drinking for whatever reason, they would die before the process of assisted dying would be able to take place,\" she told MPs.",
      "A proposal from Labour MP Naz Shah would amend the bill so an individual would not meet the requirements for an assisted death \"solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking\".",
      "Leadbeater indicated she would support this but suggested further changes may be needed to make the proposal workable.",
      "Leadbeater's Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle by 330 to 275 votes back in November.",
      "Since then, the bill has gone through six months of intense scrutiny by a parliamentary committee and several changes, including removing the need for a High Court judge to sign off each request for an assisted death. Instead, a panel of experts - including a legal professional, psychiatrist and social worker - would oversee the process.",
      "The issue has split Parliament, with strong opinions on both sides.",
      "Those opposed to assisted dying say the mood has altered among MPs, but so far only a handful have said they have changed their minds since November and it would take dozens to block the bill.",
      "Labour MP Jonathan Hinder is the latest to reveal he will no longer support the bill, saying his concerns have \"deepened\" as it has progressed.",
      "He gave the example of removing the role of a High Court judge as one reason he had changed his mind, adding that more work was needed to make the bill \"practicable and safe\".",
      "If assisted dying does become legal in England and Wales, it would be a historic change for society.",
      "Current laws prevent medics from helping any patient to carry out their wish to die.",

      "\"Rather than acknowledge they couldn't do it, because that would have indicated a mistake in their overall strategy, they remained silent.\"",

      "Hospitals and care homes",
      "In the first six months of Covid, there was a frantic drive to increase testing for the disease. Matt Hancock set a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April 2020 in England.",
      "By this time it had become clear to scientists across the world that Covid could be spread by people who had not developed symptoms, such as a cough or fever.",
      "Sir Paul Nurse, Sir Peter Ratcliffe and their colleague Dr Sam Barrell wrote to Mr Hancock on 14 April 2020 saying they had \"grave concerns\" about \"asymptomatic transmission\" between healthcare staff and patients.",

      "Lighthouse labs",
      "The Frances Crick Institute, headquartered in north London, is one of the largest biomedical research centres in the world.",
      "As Covid hit, a team of 300 volunteers started using the organisation's laboratory space and equipment to process Covid tests for dozens of hospitals, GP surgeries and care homes in the local area.",
      "It had the capacity to carry out 4,000 tests a day and to increase that to 10,000 with more funding, according to Prof Nurse.",
      "In March 2020, he wrote to the government offering to help with the national testing effort.",
      "Instead ministers decided to set up a network of giant privately-run Lighthouse laboratories.",
      "In his evidence, Prof Nurse accepted that the larger sites were needed, but said \"insufficient attention\" was paid to universities and other publicly-funded institutions, which could have quickly processed tests for healthcare workers, particularly in the early stages of the pandemic.",

      "\"The right to die becomes a duty to die for those who feel a burden on family,\" said one GP.",
      "Another common concern was patients might be coerced. Some told us they had treated elderly people with family members they suspected of being more focussed on their inheritance than their relatives.",
      "More than half of the group who opposed a law change said it would be against their religious beliefs.",
      "They spoke about life being \"sacred\" and called assisted dying \"sinful\". Some referred to the commandment \"thou shalt not kill\".",
      "Another argument from those who said they were against assisted dying was the health system should instead focus on improving end-of-life care.",
      "One GP said creating an assisted dying law was \"scandalous\" when hospices were largely funded by charities rather than by the state.",
      "Separately, on Tuesday the Royal College of Psychiatrists said that while the group \"remains neutral\" on the principle of assisted dying, it \"just cannot support this bill\".",
      "In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, the college's president Dr Lade Smith cited a lack of requirements concerning the \"unmet needs\" of patients, and a shortage of psychiatrists to process requests.",
      "\"We're concerned that there isn't a requirement to think about any unmet needs a person might have. A person with a terminal illness... they may be in pain, they have difficulty with their housing, their finances because they haven't been able to work, they might feel lonely, isolated,\" Dr Smith said.",
      "Dr Gordon Macdonald, CEO of Care Not Killing said there was a \"black hole\" in the hospice budget and \"we need better care not killing\".",
      "Dying with dignity",
      "More than 400 GPs told us they supported a law change, with some describing feeling \"traumatised\" and \"haunted\" by watching people die in \"severe pain or distress\".",
      "Of those who said they were in favour, more than nine in 10 respondents believed it could allow patients to have a dignified death.",
      "Some shared personal experiences: telling us about watching their parents losing dignity or begging to die. One said their sick wife prayed every evening to not wake up in the morning.",
      "Those who backed assisted dying often spoke about patient choice, arguing it was patronising not to let people decide how they wanted to die.",
      "Wanting the option of an assisted death for themselves or their loved ones was another common reason for supporting the law.",
      "\"Personally, I would find this a comfort and I resent those who take this choice away from me,\" one told us.",
      "'Unpredictable' timeframe",
      "If assisted dying does become law in England and Wales, it would apply to certain terminally ill patients who were reasonably expected to die within six months.",
      "But more than a quarter of all the GPs who responded told us they would rarely, or never be confident assessing if a patient was expected to die in that time frame.",
      "\"It's unpredictable even in the severely frail,\" one said.",
      "No doctor would be obliged to work in assisted dying. Of the 1,000 GP respondents, more than 500 told us they would be willing to discuss assisted dying with a patient.",
      "Nearly 300 would assess if a patient was eligible and 161 said they would prepare a substance for a patient to take to end their own life.",
      "Legal risks",
      "Prof Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the BBC's research showed GPs had \"real concerns about the practical and legal implications of a change in the law on assisted dying\".",
      "\"These must be acknowledged and addressed, so that any legislation is watertight,\" she said.",
      "Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said GPs and other medics will \"rightly be considering how they will navigate\" the proposed law.",
      "She said evidence from assisted dying laws in Australia and the US showed it could be carried out \"safely and effectively, with far reaching benefits for end-of-life care and robust protections for both patients and doctors\".",

    "story": [
      "If you ask these three doctors about being GPs, their answers are remarkably similar.",
      "\"It can be the best job in the world,\" one tells me. It's \"a privilege\" another says. They all talk about how they love getting to know their patients and their families.",
      "But all three have different views on assisted dying.",
      "Right now, the law here is clear: medics cannot help patients to take their own lives. But that could change.",
      "The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill is being debated in Parliament. And if it goes through, it will give some terminally ill patients in England and Wales the option of an assisted death.",
      "Here, three doctors - Abdul Farooq, Susi Caesar and Gurpreet Khaira, who all have a different view on assisted dying - tell us how they feel about the proposals. The three were among more than 1,000 GPs to respond to a BBC questionnaire on assisted dying.",
      "'A red line I would never cross'",
      "Dr Abdul Farooq is 28 and relatively new to his career as a GP.",
      "We meet at his home in east London. He gives his baby daughter a bottle of milk before heading around the corner to pray in his local mosque.",
      "His religion is absolutely key to his views on assisted dying.",
      "\"I believe in the sanctity of life. As a Muslim, I believe that life is a gift from God, and that no one has the right to take that away,\" he says.",
      "Dr Farooq feels taking your own life is wrong, and so, he says, it would be \"sinful\" for him to be involved in that process - even indirectly.",
      "If this law passed - and a patient came to him asking for help to die - he would refer them to another doctor.",
      "He says anything beyond that would be \"a red line I would never cross\".",
      "Dr Farooq's objections are also informed by his professional experience, particularly his time working in a hospital.",
      "He describes seeing \"undignified deaths\" - people passing away on busy wards - and says the health system is not getting the basics right in end-of-life care.",
      "\"There is so much we can do to make patients comfortable, if we have the right resources available,\" he tells me.",
      "\"We have a whole field of medicine called palliative medicine that is there to help people towards the end of their life. So why are we not throwing all our resources and money into that and actually making the process of death less scary?\"",
      "He's also concerned about specific parts of the proposed law. Doctors would have to assess if terminally ill patients are expected to die within six months before they are approved for an assisted death.",
      "Dr Farooq sees this as problematic. The final day or so is easy to predict, he says, but adds that some patients he's expected to die within six months can still be alive a year later.",
      "Is there anything that could change his mind on assisted dying?",
      "\"No,\" Dr Farooq says without hesitation. \"I'm strongly against it. Personally and professionally, I think it's the wrong thing to do for patients.\"",

      "'I could live 30 years but plan to die': How assisted dying law is dividing Canadians",
      "'I'll be at the front of the queue to help'",
      "Dr Susi Caesar has been a GP for 30 years and thinks she probably wouldn't have previously been so vocal in her support of assisted dying.",
      "Now, she says she is ready to \"stick her head above the parapet\".",
      "Recently she lost her beloved dad, Henning. We meet at a lake near Cirencester because being near water reminds her of him.",
      "\"My father was the most amazing person and this is so evocative of everything he loved,\" she says. \"The outdoors, walks, sailing, boats, kayaking, swimming.\"",
      "She thinks Henning would be proud of her for talking to us about her views because he was a long-term believer in assisted dying.",
      "When he was diagnosed with a terminal illness, Dr Caesar says he became \"terribly scared about the manner of his dying\".",
      "\"My father was a very proud man, and the thing that was unbearable to him was the idea that he would lose control at the end of his life - of his bodily functions, of his mind, of his ability to be the person that he was.\"",
      "By the end, Dr Caesar says her father's \"medication never quite kept up with his symptoms.\" For her, the argument over assisted dying comes down to patient choice.",
      "\"Everybody is going to die. Every individual deserves the comfort of choice about how they die. I would want it for myself,\" she tells me.",
      "She acknowledges that many of her colleagues have \"very, very reasonable concerns\" about assisted dying. But she says \"we have the wisdom to set up systems that will work and get over some of these hurdles.\"",
      "I ask if Dr Caesar's support for assisted dying would translate into her working in this area.",
      "\"I will be at the front of the queue to help people to have the death that they wanted,\" she says. \"I think that's the core joy of my job - being with people to the very end of their health journey.\"",
      "'A very guilty place'",
      "Dr Gurpreet Khaira doesn't have any of the certainty of Dr Farooq and Dr Caesar.",
      "She describes herself as \"pretty conflicted about the whole subject\" of assisted dying.",
      "Dr Khaira is a GP in Birmingham but also has first-hand experience as a patient.",
      "In 2017, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She found chemotherapy gruelling and says if the cancer ever came back, she wouldn't want to go through it again.",
      "\"I remember feeling very passionate that I should have the choice of whether I go through this kind of treatment, or to say 'that's enough now',\" she says.",
      "She says it felt very important for her to have a choice about the end of her life.",
      "Now, she's a picture of health, striding along a hillside with ease.",
      "As a GP with decades of experience, she worries that vulnerable patients might opt for assisted dying rather than be a burden to their loved ones. Or that some families might coerce vulnerable patients into it.",
      "\"That is one of my biggest areas of personal conflict. I know that there are lots of plans to put safeguards in.",
      "\"You can be the best doctor or advocate in the world, but you may not pick up where someone is being controlled or manipulated.\"",
      "For her, there's a fundamental conflict between her personal and professional experiences.",
      "But, she adds: \"As a doctor, I'd be very reluctant to be handing over a syringe for a patient to make that choice.\"",
      "Balancing up these two sides leaves her \"in a very guilty place\", she says, but adds that it's not a weakness to be open minded. For her, making this decision is an \"evolving process\".",
      "Personal experience shaping opinions",
      "It's striking when talking to Dr Farooq, Dr Caesar and Dr Khaira, how much their views on assisted dying reflect their core belief systems.",
      "In that respect, GPs are possibly much like the rest of us.",
      "If this bill does pass into law, doctors will have to consider whether they are willing to work in the area of assisted dying, or not. They could be asked to be involved in the process - whether that's holding preliminary discussions with patients who want to die, to prescribing a substance for someone to end their own life.",
      "If they don't want to, no-one will force them.",

      "The government is abolishing NHS England without a clear plan for how it will be achieved and how it will benefit frontline care, a cross-party group of MPs has warned.",
      "Ministers announced in March that the body responsible for overseeing the health service in England would go, with its functions brought into the Department of Health and Social Care.",
      "But the Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned about the uncertainty being caused and urged the government to set out a clear plan within the next three months.",
      "The government said the move would eliminate \"wasteful duplication\" and that detailed planning had started.",
      "Alongside the changes at a national level, the 42 local health boards responsible for planning services are also having to shed around half of their 25,000 staff.",
      "The MPs also raised concerns about the \"jaw-dropping\" amount of money lawyers are making from clinical negligence claims. Of the \u00a32.8bn paid out in 2023-24, nearly a fifth went on legal costs.",
      "It said this was unacceptable and more must be done to improve safety.",
      "Huge pressure",
      "Committee chair and Tory MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said the changes to NHS England and local health boards amounted to a major structural reform.",
      "He said strong decision-making and experienced staff would be vital to manage a period of \"huge pressure\" for the NHS.",
      "\"It has been two months since the government's decision to remove what, up until now, has been seen as a key piece of machinery, without articulating a clear plan for what comes next \u2013 and the future for patients and staff remains hazy,\" he added.",
      "NHS England, which employs nearly 15,000 staff, is in charge of \u00a3193bn of public sector money this year.",
      "The reduction in staffing of abolishing NHS England is expected to save \u00a3400m, while the cut in local health board staff is expected to add another \u00a3700-750m.",
      "A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said the changes would eliminate \"wasteful duplication\" and a joint board was already working on detailed plans.",
      "\"Serious reform is needed to tackle the challenges facing the NHS,\" she added.",
      "Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts, said the changes \"marked the biggest reshaping of the NHS in a decade\".",
      "He said that while many managers in the NHS understood the need for change, the lack of detail and how the plans fitted in with the forthcoming 10-year plan were \"a cause for concern\" for those running the health service.",

      "For men with BRCA mutations, the risks of developing breast cancer are much lower.",
      "Olaparib is the first targeted drug treatment for cancers with mutations in the BRCA genes and is given as a tablet. It works by stopping cancer cells from being able to repair their DNA by blocking a protein called PARP, which causes the cancerous cells to die.",
      "The trial, named Partner, took place at 23 sites in England, Scotland and Wales. Before surgery, 39 women with early stage breast cancer were given olaparib, also known as Lynparza, together with chemotherapy.",
      "They started olaparib tablets 48 hours after each chemotherapy infusion. After three years, all had survived.",
      "By contrast there were six deaths among 45 women in the study who received chemotherapy before surgery but did not get olaparib.",

      "\"It is rare that you see 100% survival at 36 months for this subtype of breast cancer.  We're incredibly excited about the potential of this new approach.\"",

      "Prof Abraham said: \"From a cost perspective, it would save the NHS a considerable amount of money because it's a fraction of the time and dose of the drug.\"",
      "Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: \"While this research is still in its infancy, it is an exciting discovery that adding olaparib at a carefully-timed stage of treatment can potentially give patients with this specific type of breast cancer more time with their loved ones.\"",
      "Although the trial involved only women, Prof Abraham said the olaparib results would also apply to the much smaller number of men with the BRCA mutation who get breast cancer.",
      "The trial was funded by Cancer Research UK and AstraZeneca, and was supported by the National Institute of Health and Care Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Centre and Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust (ACT)."

    "summary": "Many care workers say it is a rewarding job, so the task is how to get more people in the UK to apply.",
    "story": [
      "Care providers have said the government is taking away the \"lifeline\" of overseas recruitment without fixing the problems that make it difficult to recruit UK staff.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister, announced sweeping reforms to immigration on Monday, including plans to end the recruitment of care workers from overseas.",
      "Even with staff being brought in from other countries, official estimates show there were 131,000 vacancies in social care in England last year.",
      "Care companies said some services will struggle to survive without international recruits.",
      "\"The sector has been propping itself up with dwindling resources, rising costs, and mounting vacancies,\" said Prof Martin Green of Care England, which describes itself as the largest representative body for independent care providers.",
      "\"Taking (international recruitment) away now with no warning, no funding, and no alternative, is not just short-sighted - it's cruel,\" he said.",
      "Sir Keir said the visa changes were part of a drive \"to reduce immigration significantly\" and that the government wanted to create \"a migration system that is controlled, selective and fair\".",
      "The government said care providers could extend visas for existing staff and recruit migrants already in the UK who have yet to find a job. It also promised a new fair pay agreement for care staff and wanted companies to recruit and train more people from UK.",
      "However, Dr Jane Townson of the Homecare Association said the government was introducing the changes \"in a vacuum\" as a fair pay agreement is a long way off and there is \"no plan to deliver the care workers our country needs.\"",
      "Social care has been in crisis for years, with council funding of services squeezed, significant staff-shortages and growing demand from an ageing population. Plans for reform have been delayed time and again.",
      "While care workers were clapped along with health workers during the pandemic, that did not translate into an improvement in pay or status.",
      "About 1.7 million people work in social care in England, according to Skills for Care, the official body that monitors the workforce. It is often a minimum or just above minimum wage job, with little recognition of the increasing responsibility and complexity of the support staff provide to older and disabled people.",

      "Care staff shortages pile pressure on NHS",
      "How many people come to work and study in the UK?",
      "Putting it bluntly, if someone can earn more working, for instance, in a supermarket for fewer, less strenuous hours, then that is the option many will chose.",
      "Post-Covid, some staff left care work because they felt burnt out while others who still loved the job felt they could not afford the increases in the cost of living.",
      "Between April 2021 and March 2022, social care vacancies reached a record high of 165,000, a 52% increase on the year before.",
      "By December 2021, the warnings of imminent collapse prompted Boris Johnson's Conservative government to make care work a shortage occupation, making it easier for companies to look overseas for staff.",
      "Recruits had to earn a minimum of \u00a320,480 a year to qualify for the visa, and they could bring family with them.",
      "There was a rapid rise in overseas recruitment \u2013 in 2022/23 80,000 people arrived in the UK to work in care and in 23/24, there were another 105,000 visas.",
      "Many care companies said bringing in those staff was the difference between providing services and collapsing. However, there was also abuse of this new route into the UK. For instance, some people were exploited, ending up paying middlemen thousands for travel and sponsorship certificates.",
      "The Home Office says 470 care companies have had their licence to recruit international staff revoked since 2022. It estimates that has led to about 40,000 staff being displaced. Companies say many will have already found alternative care work.",
      "In March 2024, Rishi Sunak's Conservative government tightened the visa requirements. This included saying recruits could no longer bring family with them. It has led to a significant fall in the number of care workers arriving from abroad.",
      "In the year up to December 2024, 9,500 visas were granted to people entering the UK to provide \"caring personal services\", according to the government.",
      "However, in the four years since staff shortages were most acute, relatively little has changed to encourage more UK people to work in care. There has been an ongoing government funded recruitment campaign and talk of the need to improve the pay and status of staff, but many workers fear solutions remain a long way off.",
      "The independent Casey Commission started work last month to draw up plans for adult social care. It has been described by ministers as a \"once in a generation opportunity to transcend party politics and build consensus on the future of the sector\". Its first update is due next year and its final report by 2028.",
      "At a time when the NHS is struggling, social care is more important than ever as it can keep vulnerable people out of hospital and support patients when they return home.",
      "Many care workers will say it is an incredibly rewarding job and with overseas recruitment being closed, the question is what needs to change to encourage more UK people to take on the role?"

      "Now, a new hearing will examine Dr Dixon's records. He is accused of dishonestly creating patient records long after he was involved in their care, something he \"strongly denies\".",
      "The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) will begin Monday. It will examine claims medical records for seven patients contained false information, and were not created at the correct time.",
      "A spokesperson for Dr Dixon said: \"[He] always endeavoured to provide the highest standard of care to his patients.",
      "\"He strongly disputes falsifying any medical records and will provide his detailed evidence about those serious allegations to the tribunal, initially by way of a detailed witness statement which he has provided to the General Medical Council.\"",

      "He used a technique known as mesh rectopexy to treat bowel problems.",
      "Through the procedure, mesh implants are placed into the body to treat pelvic organ prolapse which can occur after childbirth.",
      "The mesh, which is usually made from synthetic polypropylene, is intended to repair damaged or weakened tissue.",
      "At the point of his suspension in 2024, the MTPS said Dr Dixon's \"misconduct was so serious that action needed be taken to protect members of the public\".",
      "But, the tribunal considered that a longer period of suspension would be unduly punitive, especially taking into account the period that Dr Dixon had already been the subject of fitness to practise proceedings.",
      "As founder of the Pelvic Floor Society, he drew heavily on claims he had made in medical publications about the success rates of the rectopexy mesh surgery he pioneered.",
      "But now questions are being raised by the MPTS about the honesty his follow-up data which has to be written contemporaneously.",
      "A BBC Inside Out investigation in 2017 first revealed Dr Dixon had carried out unnecessary operations and raised questions about whether he provided adequate medical follow.",
      "Two investigations at Southmead Hospital and Spire Bristol subsequently found Mr Dixon caused harm to hundreds of people by carrying out operations that were not necessary.",
      "Both hospitals apologised to victims after his suspension.",

      "Listen to the latest news for Bristol",
      "The BBC has discovered that all of Dr Dixon's papers in the journal Diseases of the Colon and Rectum, now have an 'expressions of concern' in the relevant papers in Colorectal Disease.",
      "They centre on concerns about the honesty of his claimed follow up on patients.",
      "Prof Susan Galandiuk, editor in chief of the journal Diseases of the Colon and Rectum, which has published two papers with Tony Dixon's data said: \"Many people will read journal articles and will act based on their conclusions, in terms of practicing surgeons.",
      "\"Many other surgeons who are writing articles will cite these articles and base their conclusions on these.",
      "\"Sometimes or often these papers are used when guidelines are formulated or referred to. So their conclusions can go on to influence many different things .\"",
      "The BBC has separately approached more than 40 former mesh patients of Dr Dixon via the Rectopexy Mesh Victims and Support group.",
      "None of them recognise the follow up form which he had claimed to have used in publications for up to five years post operative follow up.",
      "They include Debbie Cooper Jones, a dentist from Gloucester.",
      "She said: \"He seemed to have done quite a lot of research from the papers that were on his website.",
      "\"So I was a bit surprised at my lack of follow-up because he was quoting so many statistics.",
      "\"Perhaps, in hindsight it seems a little bit odd that there wasn't that close monitoring of us given the nature of the surgeries we were having and maybe even the novelty of them that it was ground-breaking work.\"",
      "It will take several weeks for the tribunal decide on the new allegations.",
      "That decision is crucial when it comes to eventually deciding whether Dr Dixon will eventually be able to reapply to go back on the medical register again.",

      "Celebrities are getting in on the act too. Khloe Kardashian unveiled Khloud Protein Popcorn a fortnight ago, which she described as \"the perfect combination of a tasty snack and a boost of protein to fuel your day\", while Zac Efron promoted a protein-rich porridge in January.",
      "But is this increased advertising of protein just a marketing gimmick or are these products actually useful if you're trying to build muscle or live a healthy life? And is it worth the extra cost?",
      "Sales of them are rising; figures shared with BBC News by the research agency Mintel show that, excluding sports nutrition items, 8.3% of food product launches made claims about being a source of protein, or having high levels of it, in the first three months of 2025.",
      "That was up from 6.1% in 2024 and 4.6% the year before.",
      "Kiti Soininen, a research director at Mintel, says protein claims are being added to food with naturally high levels of the nutrient, like chicken breasts and pulses, but also on products you wouldn't expect.",
      "\"Mousses, desserts, granola, pancakes, even the odd pizza, are coming through with a high-protein claim,\" she says. \"Protein is enjoying a bit of a 'health halo' at the moment.\"",

      "\"I'm a huge believer that there is nothing better than whole foods,\" he says. \"You can get the protein that you need from vegetables and lean meats.\"",
      "He believes the convenience of high-protein snacks, combined with the positive perception of the nutrient among customers, has led to manufacturers using protein as a marketing tool.",
      "For manufacturers to claim their product is a source of protein, they must show regulators at least 12% of its energy value is provided by protein. To make a claim that a product is high in protein, the figure is 20%.",
      "To help reach these scores they can add protein-rich ingredients to their products, like nuts and pulses, or make them more dense by removing water.",
      "\"When someone in a rush is getting a meal deal for lunch, you can see why they would reach for a protein bar or drink instead of two boiled eggs,\" he says. \"In my 12 years as a personal trainer, I've never seen as much hype around the benefits of protein as I am now.\"",
      "The benefits of protein range from muscle building and sports performance to helping with weight loss by suppressing appetite and helping women during pregnancy.",
      "If you're trying to build muscle you need to consume around 1.6g of protein per kilogram of your body weight each day, says Dr Paul Morgan, a university lecturer in human nutrition.",
      "He says for the average person trying to ensure their general health, this figure should be around 1.2g.",
      "He thinks many of the supermarket products advertising their protein content are \"gimmicky\" and warns they might not be as good for you as advertised.",

      "Nature Valley's protein peanut and chocolate bars have 489kcal per 100g, while Cadbury's peanut brunch bars, which also contain chocolate, have 485kcal at the same weight.",
      "Dr Morgan dismisses theories that eating too much protein can damage your bones or harm your kidneys, though there are exceptions if you have a pre-existing health condition.",

      "So is it worth buying these protein advertised products?",
      "It might be if you're someone who needs more protein to maintain your health or if you're trying to build muscle and need just a little bit extra to meet your daily protein goal, says Ethan.",

      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has given his strongest signal yet that a youth mobility scheme could form part of a new deal with the EU.",
      "Speaking to the Times ahead of a summit on Monday between the bloc and the UK, he insisted such a scheme would not amount to a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement.",
      "While Sir Keir said it would be a \"reciprocal\" arrangement in which young people would be able to move abroad for up to two years, no specific details about the ages of those who could be eligible and whether there would be a cap on numbers were given.",
      "Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has described the possible scheme as \"free movement through the back door\".",
      "\"We're not against youth mobility schemes. We're against uncapped migration schemes,\" she wrote on X.",

      "An agreement is expected to be announced at Monday's summit, which is being held at London's Lancaster House.",
      "The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg has been told that it will only be an agreement in principle, not the final deal.",

      "The prime minister has pointed to reciprocal youth mobility schemes (YMS) that the UK already has with the likes of Australia - where people between the ages of 18 and 35 are allowed to work in each other's countries.",
      "The UK currently offers visas allowing young people from 12 non-EU countries including Japan, South Korea and Uruguay to study or work in the UK for up to two years. Those from Australia, Canada or New Zealand can extend by a further year.",
      "These visas are subject to annual quotas, ranging from 100 visas for Andorra to 42,000 for Australia, with ballots held where they are oversubscribed.",
      "The former Tory government last year rejected an EU offer that would have made it easier for people aged between 18 and 30 to study and work abroad in the wake of Brexit.",
      "Labour at the time said it had \"no plans for a youth mobility scheme\" if it won the general election.",
      "London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the BBC's Newsnight programme on Friday that the current government was giving \"mixed messages\" and that he wanted to hear it \"speaking in one voice and say they would like a youth mobility scheme\".",
      "He said such a scheme would \"put rocket boosters up businesses in London\", where there are gaps in sectors including hospitality, creative industries, health and social care.",
      "The Liberal Democrats have also welcomed the idea of a new form of youth mobility scheme, with Europe spokesperson James MacCleary calling it a \"welcome step in the right direction\".",
      "He added: \"This news is a glimmer of hope for young people who have been so badly let down by Brexit. The Government now need to follow through.\"",
      "The UK's European relations minister, Nick Thomas-Symonds, publicly confirmed last week that the government was considering setting up a youth mobility scheme as part of a new partnership agreement with the EU.",
      "He told the Financial Times that \"a smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people\" - provided the government's red lines are respected.",
      "Asked whether the UK might in the future consider re-joining the Erasmus student scheme, Thomas-Symonds said there were not currently plans to do so but added the government was \"always open to listening to sensible proposals from the EU\".",

    "summary": "The move is among several tweaks to the assisted dying bill which were debated by MPs.",
    "story": [
      "No one would be forced to help with the process of assisted dying against their wishes, under changes approved by MPs.",
      "A bill which would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales, expected to die within six months, to seek help to end their own life is currently being considered by Parliament.",
      "The legislation passed its first stage in the House of Commons last November \u2013 but since then the details have been pored over and dozens of amendments added by both sides.",
      "On Friday MPs debated further potential changes, which also included preventing medical staff from raising the option of assisted dying with a patient first.",
      "However, MPs ran out of time to vote on more changes, so further debate and voting will take place on 13 June.",
      "That would be followed by a vote on whether to pass the bill as a whole to its next stage or reject it, either on the same day or a future date.",
      "The government is neutral on the bill and MPs have been given a free vote, meaning they can decide based on their conscience rather than having to follow a party line.",
      "The original bill stated that no registered medical practitioner or other health professional would be under any obligation to participate in the process of assisted dying and they could not be discriminated by their employer if they did not wish to do so.",
      "Under a change proposed by Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, and approved by MPs, this has been expanded say no one would have to take part in the process, giving protections to any staff who might be involved.",
      "It specifically mentions social care workers and pharmacists as among those covered.",
      "How could assisted dying laws change across the UK?",
      "Assisted dying law could take four years to implement",
      "MPs scrap judge sign-off in assisted dying bill",
      "During an emotionally charged - and at times ill-tempered - debate, supporters of the bill argued it had been strengthened by earlier changes.",
      "Opening the proceedings, Leadbeater said many people had \"lost loved ones in deeply difficult and traumatic circumstances\".",
      "The MP for Spen Valley added: \"Put simply, if we do not vote to change the law, we are essentially saying that the status quo is acceptable.\"",
      "But opponents said the bill had been rushed through and needed stronger protections for people who could be vulnerable to coercion.",
      "Conservative MP Rebecca Paul argued there should be a focus on improving end-of-life care, rather than assisted dying.",
      "\"[The bill] will harm far more people than it will help,\" Paul said.",
      "\"And those people who will be harmed are among the most vulnerable in our communities and I'm not willing to accept this collateral damage.\"",
      "At points the debate became tetchy, with some criticising how the process had been conducted.",
      "Labour MP Jess Asato accused campaigner and broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen of being \"distasteful and disrespectful\" for accusing the bill's opponents of having \"undeclared personal religious beliefs which mean no precautions would satisfy\" their concerns.",
      "However, Dame Esther's daughter, Rebecca Wilcox, told BBC Breakfast she was worried about the \"scaremongering\", \"blatant lies\" and \"myths\" circulating about the bill.",
      "She said that while she appreciated there were concerns over coercion and how the proposed legislation could affect vulnerable or disabled people, the bill was \"full of safeguards\".",
      "Labour former minister Anneliese Dodds was among those to raise fears people could feel under pressure to go through with an assisted death because they do not want to be a \"burden\".",
      "Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier argued doctors should not be allowed to raise the option of assisted dying with patients first.",
      "She told the Commons this \"presents a serious risk that terminally ill patients already highly vulnerable will feel pressured into ending their lives\".",
      "But Conservative MP Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst, a former surgeon, said \"highly trained\" medical professionals must be trusted \"to have the difficult and complex conversations that they do every day\".",
      "Several MPs raised concerns people with anorexia could be considered terminally ill and eligible for assisted dying if they refuse to eat or drink.",
      "However, Leadbeater argued this risk was \"negligible\".",
      "\"Not only would someone with severe anorexia be highly unlikely to be assessed to have capacity to make a decision about assisted dying, the other tragic reality is that if a patient was so ill as a result of not eating and drinking for whatever reason, they would die before the process of assisted dying would be able to take place,\" she told MPs.",
      "A proposal from Labour MP Naz Shah would amend the bill so an individual would not meet the requirements for an assisted death \"solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking\".",
      "Leadbeater indicated she would support this but suggested further changes may be needed to make the proposal workable.",
      "Leadbeater's Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle by 330 to 275 votes back in November.",
      "Since then, the bill has gone through six months of intense scrutiny by a parliamentary committee and several changes, including removing the need for a High Court judge to sign off each request for an assisted death. Instead, a panel of experts - including a legal professional, psychiatrist and social worker - would oversee the process.",
      "The issue has split Parliament, with strong opinions on both sides.",
      "Those opposed to assisted dying say the mood has altered among MPs, but so far only a handful have said they have changed their minds since November and it would take dozens to block the bill.",
      "Labour MP Jonathan Hinder is the latest to reveal he will no longer support the bill, saying his concerns have \"deepened\" as it has progressed.",
      "He gave the example of removing the role of a High Court judge as one reason he had changed his mind, adding that more work was needed to make the bill \"practicable and safe\".",
      "If assisted dying does become legal in England and Wales, it would be a historic change for society.",
      "Current laws prevent medics from helping any patient to carry out their wish to die.",
      "On Tuesday, a separate bill to legalise assisted dying in Scotland passed an initial vote.",

    "summary": "The summit between the UK and EU on 19 May will be the first since Brexit - the very idea of it has polarised opinions",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Damian read this article",
      "On a warm morning earlier this month, a group of Metropolitan Police diplomatic protection officers sat in an anteroom off the ornate entrance hall in London's Lancaster House, sipping tea and nibbling chocolate biscuits, while upstairs a core group of European politicians discussed the future of European cooperation.",
      "It was an apt setting: everywhere you look in Lancaster House, there is evidence of the long, entangled histories of the UK and Europe. The double sweep of its grand staircase deliberately echoes the Palace of Versailles. Queen Victoria sat in these rooms listening to Frederic Chopin play the piano in 1848. Tony Blair hosted Russian President Putin here for an energy summit in 2003.",
      "The important issues on the agenda at the Lancaster House meeting, which was hosted by the Foreign Secretary David Lammy, included the latest developments in the war in Ukraine, Europe's response to ensure the continent's security, and \u2013 for the first time since Brexit \u2013 a summit between the UK and the European Union, which will take place on 19 May.",
      "The British government believes it's a significant moment.",
      "Before Brexit, British prime ministers would travel to Brussels four times a year or more for summits with the heads of the EU's institutions and its 27 member states. The haggling would go on late into the night. After Brexit those large summits stopped.",
      "Now, the Labour government, elected last year on a manifesto that promised \"an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners\", envisages new and regular interactions with the EU. Monday's marks the first.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer will host the most senior EU leaders to launch a new \"partnership\".",
      "Pedro Serrano, the EU ambassador to London, has described it as the \"culmination of enhanced contacts at the highest levels since the July 2024 [UK] elections\". But what will it amount to?",
      "Is what's coming a \"surrender summit\" as the Conservatives warn; \"the great British sellout\" undoing bits of Brexit that Reform UK fear; or \"a huge opportunity\" the UK may be about to squander, as Liberal Democrats say? Or could it be an example of how, in Sir Keir Starmer's words, \"serious pragmatism defeats performative politics\" by delivering practical things that will improve people's lives?",
      "Questions around a security pact",
      "In those long, drama-filled nights of 2020, when the then-prime minister Boris Johnson was negotiating Brexit, the possibility of a Security and Defence Partnership was discussed. But the UK's main priority was diverging from Brussels. So nothing was agreed \u2013 a notable omission, some think.",
      "Now a new UK-EU security pact has been worked on for months, the plan is for it to be the centrepiece of what's agreed.",
      "Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, who is overseeing negotiations, was at the early talks at Lancaster House. \"Our relationship has had some difficulties,\" she told me, but \"considering what is going on in the world [\u2026] we need to move forward with this partnership.\"",
      "Yet some think the UK should not seize this outstretched hand.",
      "\"The cornerstone of our defence is Nato,\" Alex Burghart, a Conservative frontbencher, told the Commons this week. \"We know of no reason why Nato is insufficient.\"",
      "Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice has his own view. \"There's no value at all,\" he argues. \"We do not want to be constrained by a bungling top-down bureaucratic military structure. Our defence is guaranteed by Nato.\"",
      "The government fires back on that point, arguing that a partnership will in no way undermine Nato; rather it will complement it, they say, because it will stretch to areas beyond defence, like the security of our economies, infrastructure, energy supplies, even migration and transnational crime.",
      "Some industry experts also believe that a security pact could boost the UK economy. Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS Group, a UK trade association that represents aerospace, defence and security firms, is among them.",
      "Take, for example, the SAFE (Security Action For Europe) programme that is being set up by the EU, aiming to provide up to \u20ac150bn (\u00a3126bn) in loans for new projects. If the UK strikes a security partnership with the EU, then British weapons manufacturers could potentially access some of that cash.",
      "\"There is a huge amount of interest from European partners,\" says Mr Craven. \"One of the challenges for defence companies in the last couple of years, since the advent of Ukraine, is being able to scale up their own capacity to meet demand.\" He estimates the UK could boost the EU's defence output by a fifth.",
      "The Liberal Democrat's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Calum Miller, similarly believes that a security pact is a huge opportunity for the British defence industry - but, he adds, \"as importantly, it's a new strategic opportunity for the UK to be part of that ongoing conversation about how we arm as a continent\".",
      "Others point out that the UK has already been working with the EU on defence ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine \u2013 at Nato, and most recently via the so-called Coalition of the Willing.",
      "So, in practice, does it make huge amounts of difference to the UK's place in Europe?",
      "No, argues Jill Rutter, a former senior civil servant who is now a senior fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. \"Because relations [on defence] have already been improving quite a long way.\"",
      "Some of those working on the partnership, however, argue that it will set in train new ways for the UK to engage and cooperate with its neighbours.",
      "Delays at the border",
      "More contentious is the UK's desire to sign what's called a 'veterinary' deal to remove some border checks on food and drink. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister leading these negotiations, told the Commons this week that the objective to lower food and drink costs is in the manifesto, so there is a mandate for it.",
      "Inside the food industry, calls for reform have been growing. Julianne Ponan, whose firm Creative Nature makes vegan snack bars, exports to 18 countries but only a small proportion goes to the EU. She says this is because of the paperwork and inspections since Brexit.",
      "One of her employees had to carry samples in her luggage on a passenger flight to Spain for a meeting to make sure the food wasn't held up at the border, she says.",
      "\"I think this will open up huge opportunities for businesses like mine.\"",
      "It would also make a big difference for Northern Ireland. After Brexit, special arrangements were put in place to keep the land border it shares with the Republic of Ireland free of new impediments. But at the same time, new paperwork and inspections were put in place on food, drink, animals and plants being transported from mainland Britain across the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland. They're bitterly opposed by Unionist politicians and complicate life for many businesses.",
      "But a veterinary deal may carry political danger. It would require the UK to align some of its rules on food and drink with EU ones, and move in-step with Brussels over time. And those rules are subject to oversight by EU courts.",
      "\"I call it the surrender summit,\" says Andrew Griffith, the Conservative Shadow Business and Trade Secretary. Under this deal the UK would lose \"our freedom to set our own rules\", he adds.",
      "The Conservatives say they \"fought long and hard\" to \"take back control of our laws, our borders, our money\" \u2013 and that this should not now be reversed.",
      "Step change or 'sell out'?",
      "Reform UK has not held back in its language: \"We think prepare for the Great British sell out. That's the bottom line, and it will be dressed up as a reset,\" Richard Tice says.",
      "\"Why would you want to reset and get closer to a patently failing economic model? The EU is struggling even more than we are. We should be diverging as fast as we can away from that.\"",
      "But Labour's Thomas-Symonds dismisses these views as a \"rehash of the arguments of the past\".",
      "On the other end of the spectrum is the accusation that Sir Keir is far too cautious. Calum Miller of the Liberal Democrats says he knows of businesses \"gnashing their teeth in frustration that they just can't exploit opportunities to work with and trade with Europe\".",
      "His party wants the UK to explore a Customs Union with the EU. It would make moving goods easier, but mean we couldn't sign our own trade deals.",
      "David Henig, a former senior trade negotiator, has been talking to both sides \"hoping to help, to sort of navigate them in\".",
      "\"The summit is a step forward, not a step change,\" he says, \"A slight deepening of the trade ties, rather than something dramatically new.\"",
      "A deal on food and drink checks would deliver very little, he believes, because food and drink is such a limited part of trade. \"If you were, for example, aligning UK and EU rules on industrial products, you'd get a much bigger economic impact\".",
      "Jill Rutter thinks that a veterinary deal would not prove \"economically earth shattering\" \u2013 but if it goes well, she argues that it could provide \"early proof of concept\" for further UK-EU cooperation.",
      "'Tough it out' on fishing?",
      "After Brexit, many British fishermen were disappointed when Boris Johnson's government agreed to let EU boats continue much as before, taking significant catches from UK waters. Those arrangements expire next year. The EU wants them extended.",
      "David Davis who, as Brexit minister, led some of the original negotiations for the UK, told me fishing was \"totemic\" for Brussels. London conceded too easily, he thinks.",
      "\"Europeans got what they wanted first, and then we had a haggle from a weak position.\"",
      "So he adds, \"If I was giving advice to the government, I would say, tough it out\" and use fishing as a lever to seek concessions.",
      "But, as the UK found before, Brussels has cards to play. Much of the fish caught by British fishermen is sold to buyers on the Continent and the UK needs access to that market.",
      "Some EU coastal states, like France and Denmark, are prepared to drive a hard bargain, demanding that London concedes on fishing rights in return for things it wants. Early on, even signing the Security Partnership was being linked to agreement on a fishing deal. The haggling will be tough.",
      "Immigration and youth mobility",
      "And finally, there's an idea that has prompted much interest in recent months: a youth mobility deal, through which under-30s from the UK and EU could live and work in each other's countries.",
      "For a long time the government said there were \"no plans\" for such a deal \u2013 but earlier this month they changed course, with Labour's Thomas-Symonds saying that \"A smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people\".",
      "It's likely that would mean very limited numbers allowed to enter the UK, and only with a visa, for a limited time.",
      "Under those conditions, ministers hope it would not inflate net migration numbers. It's far from what the EU would like.",
      "The UK already has similar schemes with 13 countries, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan.",
      "\"When we are comfortable having those relationships, why are we so averse to having it with our nearest neighbours?\" Calum Miller asks, \"It just doesn't really make sense\".",
      "Paula Surridge, a professor of political sociology at Bristol University, argues that public views on immigration are more nuanced than many people think. \"Voters care most about what they perceive as illegal migration \u2013 small boat crossings and so on,\" she says, \"People coming here to study or to work, particularly young people, are not a particular cause for concern\" for most.",
      "\"There will definitely be a group of voters that are upset [about potential deals], but they were never going to vote Labour.\"",
      "Of those who backed Labour in 2024, she adds, about three quarters previously voted Remain in the Brexit referendum. The political risk to the government of signing pacts with the EU is \"smaller than it appears\", she adds.",
      "Conservative pollster Lord Hayward is more cautious \u2013 and is concerned that a deal may pose a \"bear trap\" for the government if it's seen as providing free movement to young Europeans. \"It will provide serious difficulties for them to come to an agreement on something which could easily be portrayed as EU membership 2.0.\"",
      "'Making Brexit work'",
      "Even before Sir Keir's upcoming summit on Monday, his opponents are raising that spectre.",
      "\"All of his muscle memory has been to get closer to the European political union,\" says Mr Griffith. \"I am worried about our prime minister, with that baggage, with those preconceived ideas, [\u2026] trying to negotiate a better deal with the EU.\"",
      "Richard Tice says his party could simply undo any deals with the EU. \"If I'm right about our fears, and we win the next general election, we will just reverse the lot. The whole lot.\"",
      "But Mr Thomas-Symonds is of the view that Monday will show the government is \"not returning to the Customs Union, Single Market, or Freedom of Movement\", all red lines it has pledged not to cross.",
      "Instead it will be about \"making Brexit work in the interests of the British people\".",
      "Labour to unveil big immigration plans next week - but will they win back votes?",
      "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military",
      "Sir John Curtice: The map that shows Reform's triumph was much more than a protest vote",
      "Back at Lancaster House, the politicians have moved on, heading to more meetings in Albania and Turkey to grapple with the issues facing the continent. But in a quiet hallway in the house is a painting from the 1850s of the Duke of Wellington inspecting troops in London's Hyde Park.",
      "In it, he sits on a black stallion, raising his white-feathered hat to salute the cavalry - a tribute to the prime minister and military hero who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.",
      "The upcoming summit won't be as momentous an event in the UK's complicated history with Europe. But a modern British leader about to plunge into the fray of European politics might pause for thought here \u2013 perhaps, for just a moment.",

    "story": [
      "Farm inheritance tax changes should be delayed by a year and alternative schemes that will not harm small family businesses need to be properly considered, a committee of MPs has warned.",
      "Government plans to tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m at a rate of 20% \u2013 half the usual rate \u2013 saw protests across the UK after they were announced in the Autumn Budget.",
      "In a report released on Friday, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee said the changes were made without \"adequate consultation, impact assessment or affordability assessment\".",
      "The government said its inheritance tax reforms were \"vital\" and its commitment to farmers was \"steadfast\".",
      "How are the inheritance tax rules changing?",
      "Efra's report said the tax reforms \"threaten to affect the most vulnerable\" but delaying the implementation of the policy until April 2027 would give those farmers more time to seek \"appropriate professional advice\".",

      "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has since announced it will allow SFI applications that were in progress within two months of its closure.",

      "The CLA, which represents 28,000 farmers and rural businesses, urged the government to rethink its \"current disastrous policy\" on inheritance tax.",
      "It said the government should consider an alternative \"clawback\" scheme, under which 100% agricultural and business property reliefs would remain but inheritance tax would be applied to assets if sold within a certain period of time post-death, payable out of the proceeds of the sale.",

      "Downing Street insisted its own deal with Albania was \"never planned as part of the discussions.\"",
      "In short, though, they had failed to ensure the most eye-catching idea they were talking about matched the pictures, the backdrop, the stage they were on.",
      "Cue the Conservatives, whose own record on small boat crossings was poor, but who can point to that specific success with Albania, seizing on Sir Keir's awkward juxtaposition and branding it an \"embarrassment\".",
      "It is another episode that serves as a reminder of just how hard it is finding workable, practical, deliverable solutions to a massive and complex issue, which plenty in government acknowledge they simply have to get a grip of.",

      "The change would not apply to those who commit a serious further offence \u2013 or are deemed to pose a high risk, she said.",
      "In usual circumstances, these offenders would go in front of a parole board before being confirmed for release, but the government has decided to skip that part of the process, arguing they would have already been released if it was not for a backlog in parole assessments.",
      "The changes are expected to be introduced in the coming weeks.",
      "Mahmood warned that despite plans to start work on three prisons this year, it would not be possible to \"build our way out of this crisis\" and the government otherwise faced running out of spaces for male offenders by November.",
      "The latest prison-building initiative will be funded by a capital investment of \u00a34.7bn over the five years after 2026.",

      "\"And that's because there is still [an] outstanding question of why so many people maybe looked the other way, or why this wasn't picked up and given the prominence that was needed, and so that's why justice might technically have been delivered --  But there's still a moment of reckoning to come.\"",
      "Prof Jay's seven-year investigation found tens of thousands of victims had been failed by institutions across the country, including in children's services and the police.",

      "\"Whether local authorities, children's services, police officers, all sorts of people you would feel you can trust, and that trust has been fundamentally shaken, if not totally broken, in some of these places,\" she said.",

      "This higher threshold will not apply to those already in the UK renewing their visa - but ministers say it will prevent new visa applications for around 180 jobs, reducing immigration by around 39,000 a year by 2029.",

      "But loosened for others",
      "At the same time, the government wants to expand eligibility for its dedicated work visa for graduates of elite universities outside the UK.",
      "It says a \"targeted and capped\" expansion of the scheme could see the number of qualifying institutions double, from around 40 currently.",
      "The visa for international students who plan to set up a business in the UK will also be reviewed, and ministers say they want to make it easier for \"top scientific and design talent\" to apply for the global talent visa.",
      "Longer residency waits",
      "Immigrants will typically have to live in the UK for 10 years before applying for the right to stay indefinitely \u2013 double the current five-year period.",
      "Under the plans, this period could be reduced through a new \"earned settlement\" system, under which people would be awarded points to reflect their contribution to the UK \"economy and society\".",
      "It is not yet clear when this longer qualifying period will kick in - details of the new system, along with a similar scheme that will apply to applications for citizenship, will be consulted on later this year.",

      "Ministers say the visa, which was tightened last year, was a key driver of increased immigration in the years after Brexit, and better pay in the sector can solve longstanding recruitment problems.",
      "Visa extensions will be permitted until 2028, and those who already have working rights will be able to switch sponsor during the term of their visa.",
      "Stricter student rules",
      "Overseas graduates will only be able to stay in the UK for 18 months after their studies, instead of two years currently.",

      "Ministers say this will build on a three-year EU-sponsored pilot project that saw around 100 skilled refugees and their families allowed to work in specified sectors such as IT, construction and engineering.",
      "Tougher English tests",
      "Language requirements for all work visas will increase, whilst adult dependents of visa-holders will be required to demonstrate a basic understanding of English to come on a spousal and partner route.",
      "The government says those extending visas will be required to demonstrate a higher level of English when applying to settle in the UK.",
      "Skills and training",

      "These will also be determined by official migration advisers, but government sources say IT, construction and healthcare are likely to feature.",

      "Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - reached a record 906,000 in the year ending in June 2023 and then fell to 728,000 in the year ending in June 2024.",
      "The continued high levels persist, despite previous government efforts to bring the numbers down. For example, in 2010 the Conservatives pledged to reduce net migration to the \"tens of thousands\".",

      "That's according to the central forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent body that scrutinises the public finances.",
      "That estimate, however, would still be higher than most years in the past decade.",
      "What's been driving immigration?",
      "The vast majority of migrants come to the UK for study or work.",
      "And many of the work visas have been for people coming to do jobs in health and social care.",
      "However, applications for health and social care visas have come down sharply in the past two years after the rules were tightened by the last Conservative government and this decline will ultimately feed into the official net migration statistics in the coming years.",
      "Does immigration help economic growth?",
      "There's been much discussion about the link between immigration and economic growth.",
      "The White Paper - which sets out the government's plan - says the UK economy needs to wean itself off a reliance on cheap overseas labour.",
      "While taking questions from journalists, the prime minister claimed the idea immigration leads to higher economic growth \"doesn't hold\".",
      "Economists do not agree about the exact impact that simply adding more people to an economy has on growth and prosperity.",
      "New arrivals might increase the country's overall level of economic activity - measured by GDP. But on a per-person basis, GDP could be stagnant or falling. Also a larger population puts more pressure on demand for public services and housing.",
      "However, if immigrants are filling important gaps in the labour market which would otherwise not be filled - especially jobs that require specific skills - then economists generally think that immigrants can boost GDP per head and general prosperity.",
      "The OBR says that increased migration generally increases economic growth but \"the size of this impact and the effect on per person living standards is highly uncertain\".",
      "The OBR's point about growth per person is important because the government has made growth of this measure a key priority.",
      "Growth per person fell in 2023 and was flat in 2024.",
      "What about social care?",
      "There are gaps in our labour market which have been substantially filled by migrants in recent years, most notably social care.",
      "And there were still estimated to be 131,000 vacant posts in adult social care in England in 2023.",
      "Care providers argue stopping them recruiting from overseas will likely make that gap bigger.",
      "Non-immigrants could theoretically fill many of these posts and working-age people who are economically inactive could potentially be deployed in this sector if they could be encouraged and helped into work.",

      "Problems with social care recruitment were also highlighted by Madeleine Sumption, deputy chair of the Migration Advisory Committee.",
      "\"We've seen widespread reports of exploitation, people coming in who are quite vulnerable earning very low wages.",
      "\"So I am not surprised the government has chosen to close overseas recruitment because it's caused them so much difficulty,\" she said.",
      "What about universities?",
      "Overseas students have been a major contributor to levels of net migration in recent years.",
      "But they are also a significant source of funding for UK universities.",
      "A large reduction in overseas students numbers would undermine the finances of many universities and a number are already in severe financial difficulties.",
      "The government wants to monitor more closely how universities recruit international students.",
      "It is also proposing a limit on the time international students can remain in the UK after graduating. Foreign students would only have 18 months to look for a job, down from 2-3 years previously.",
      "Universities UK - which represents 141 universities - has urged the government \"to think carefully\" about the impact of its measures.",
      "If overseas student numbers did fall, the government could make up the shortfall in universities' revenue by increasing central government grants but, again, that could require an increase in taxes.",
      "Alternatively, it could further increase domestic students' tuition fees, although that would also be contentious.",
      "What about skilled migrants?",
      "The government says it still wants to attract high-skilled individuals \"who play by the rules and contribute to the economy\".",
      "However, the PM also stressed that some parts of the economy are \"addicted\" to importing cheap labour, rather than investing in training UK workers.",

    "story": [
      "Garfield, Puss in Boots,  Aristocats' Toulouse \u2013 cultural icons maybe, ginger most certainly.",
      "And now scientists across two continents have uncovered the DNA mystery that has given our furry friends, particularly males, their notable colour.",
      "They discovered that ginger cats are missing a section of their genetic code, which means the cells responsible for their skin, eye and fur tone produce lighter colours.",
      "The breakthrough has brought delight to the scientists but also the thousands of cat lovers that originally crowdfunded the research.",
      "The scientists hope solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange coloured cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions.",
      "It has been known for decades that it is genetics that gives orange tabby cats their distinctive colouring, but exactly where in the genetic code has evaded scientists till now.",
      "Two teams of scientists at Kyushu University in Japan and Stanford University in the US have now revealed the mystery in simultaneous papers published on Thursday.",
      "What the teams found was that in the cells responsible for giving a cat its skin, hair follicles and eyes their colour - melanocytes - one gene, ARHGAP36, was much more active.",
      "Genes are made up of pieces of DNA which give instructions to a cat's cells, like other living creatures, on how to function.",
      "By comparing the DNA from dozens of cats with and without orange fur they found that those with ginger colouring had a section of DNA code missing within this ARHGAP36 gene.",
      "Without this DNA the activity of the ARHGAP36 is not suppressed i.e. it is more active. The scientists believe that the gene instructs those melanocytes to produce lighter pigment.",
      "Ginger cats mostly male",
      "For decades scientists have observed that cats with completely ginger colouring are far more likely to be male. This tallies with the fact that the gene is carried on the X chromosome.",
      "Chromosomes are larger sections of DNA, and male cats like other mammals have an X and a Y chromosome, which carry different number of genes.",
      "As it is a gene only on the X chromosome, in this case controlling the pigment production, then one missing piece of DNA is enough to turn a cat fully ginger.",
      "In comparison female cats have two X chromosomes so the DNA needs to be missing in both chromosomes to increase lighter pigment production to the same extent - it means a mixed colouring is more likely.",
      "\"These ginger and black patches form because, early in development, one X chromosome in each cell is randomly switched off,\" explains Prof Hiroyuki Sasaki, geneticist at Kyushu University.",
      "\"As cells divide, this creates areas with different active coat colour genes, resulting in distinct patches.\"",
      "Although couched in science, the study originally started off as a passion project for Professor Sasaki.",
      "He had retired from his university post, but as a cat lover said he wanted to continue working to uncover the orange cat gene in the hope it could \"contribute to the overcoming of cat diseases\".",
      "He and his team raised 10.6m yen (\u00a355,109) via crowdfunding for the research from thousands of fellow cat lovers across Japan and the world.",
      "One contributor wrote: \"We are siblings in the first and third grades of elementary school. We donated with our pocket money. Use it for research on calico cats.\"",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is also active in many other areas of the body including the brain and hormonal glands, and is considered important for development.",
      "The researchers think it is possible that the DNA mutation in the gene could cause other changes in these parts of the body linked to health conditions or temperament.",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is found in humans and has been linked to skin cancer and hair loss.",
      "\"Many cat owners swear by the idea that different coat colours and patterns are linked with different personalities,\" said Prof Sasaki.",

      "Almost all of the UK is expected to have below normal or low river levels in May, apart from the south-west of England and southern Wales.",
      "The Environment Agency has said that the UK is at medium risk of drought and warned households of the risk of water restrictions.",
      "The next 2-3 weeks will be \"crucial\" in determining whether the country goes into drought, says Mark Owen, head of fisheries for the Angling Trust and a member of the National Drought Group.",
      "That is the committee, led by the government, that declares if and when a drought is officially under way.",
      "The country is not now in drought, but the impacts of the exceptionally dry weather are already being felt.",
      "Some farmers are being forced to water their crops instead of relying on rainfall, which is something that normally happens later in the year.",
      "\"We are having a drought now from an agricultural point of view,\" arable farmer Nick Deane told BBC News from his farm in Norfolk.",
      "He had to start irrigating his fields in March.",
      "\"We have to ration our water and decide which areas we are going to put that water on in order to keep the crops growing,\" he said.",

      "The dry and sunny weather this year has led to a larger area of the UK burned by wildfires this year compared with any other entire year.",
      "The last drought was in June-August 2022, which was the joint hottest summer (with 2018) and fifth driest since the 1890s.",
      "Five companies introduced hosepipe bans, affecting 19 million people, and waterways had restricted navigation.",
      "That drought was preceded by six months of very dry weather.",
      "However, the wet summer in 2024 and moderately-wet winter means water supplies are in a better place now and water companies have larger reserves to rely on.",
      "But dry weather earlier in the year has risks. It does \"potentially pose a greater risk to water resources later on in the year, particularly if the dry weather continues,\" says Stephen Turner, hydrologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.",
      "Last week, Richard Thompson, chair of the National Drought Group, warned that water companies may need to bring in water restrictions to protect supplies if the dry weather continues.",

      "There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week.",
      "Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions.",
      "Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies.",
      "By contrast, the north of England quickly enters drought and quickly gets out because reservoirs are more heavily used for water supplies.",
      "Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas.",
      "If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes.",
      "In an extreme scenario, it could ration the amount of water available to homes and businesses but that has not happened since 1976.",
      "Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought.",
      "Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed.",
      "And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms.",
      "Mr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than \u00a31m.",
      "It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions.",
      "But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult.",
      "A government spokesman said it was working with the agricultural sector to improve its water supply resilience and establish more groups of farmers who could work together to develop their own reservoirs.",
      "He added: \"Over \u00a3104bn of private sector investment has been secured to fund essential infrastructure, including nine new reservoirs, to help secure our future water supply for farmers.\"",

    "summary": "The BBC meets astronaut Rosemary Coogan who is training at Nasa\u2019s Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas.",
    "story": [
      "Rosemary Coogan is surrounded by a team of people pushing, pulling, squishing and squeezing her into a spacesuit.",
      "It takes about 45 minutes to get all her gear on before a helmet is carefully lowered over her head.",
      "The British astronaut is about to undergo her toughest challenge yet \u2013 assessing whether she is ready for a spacewalk. The test will take place in one of the largest pools in the world: Nasa's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.",
      "The pool \u2013 which is 12m deep (40ft) \u2013 contains a life-sized replica of the International Space Station (ISS), and a \"spacewalk\" here is as close as it gets to mimicking weightlessness on Earth.",
      "\"It's a big day,\" Rosemary says before the dive, which is going to last more than six hours. \"It's very physically intense \u2013 and it's very psychologically intense.\"",
      "But Rosemary doesn't seem too fazed. She smiles and waves as the platform she's standing on is slowly lowered into the water.",
      "Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach.",
      "\"At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,\" Rosemary says. \"You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories.\"",
      "So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people.",
      "ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015.",
      "Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.",
      "She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.",
      "\"It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside \u2013 to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.\"",
      "Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.",
      "\"The lower part is where you put your solid waste,\" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. \"And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.\"",
      "Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.",
      "\"There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.\"",
      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",
      "The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.",
      "\"It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,\" she tells us, \"But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.\"",
      "Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" Rosemary says, \"If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.\"",

      "Wounded orangutan seen using plant as medicine",
      "Lead researcher Elodie Freymann explained there was \"a whole behavioural repertoire that chimpanzees use when they're sick or injured in the wild - to treat themselves and to maintain hygiene\".",
      "\"Some of these include the use of plants that can be found here,\" she explained. \"The chimpanzees dab them on their wounds or chew the plants up, and then apply the chewed material to the open injury.\"",
      "The researchers studied footage of a very young, female chimpanzee chewing plant material and applying it to an injury on its mother's body.",
      "They also found records of chimpanzees tending to the wounds of other animals  they weren't related to. This is particularly exciting, explained Dr Freymann, \"because it adds to the evidence that wild chimpanzees have the capacity for empathy\".",
      "Some of the hundreds of written observations that Dr Freymann and her colleagues studied came from a log book at the field station in the forest site, which is northwest of the capital, Kampala.",
      "This record of anecdotal evidence dates back to the 1990s \u2013 local field staff, researchers and visitors have written in, describing any interesting behaviour they have observed.",
      "There are stories in that book of leaf-dabbing on injuries and chimps helping other chimps to remove snares from their limbs.",
      "There are some surprisingly human-like hygiene habits: One note describes a chimpanzee using leaves to wipe itself after defecating.",
      "This team of researchers has previously identified some of the plants that chimpanzees sought out and ate when they were injured. The scientists took samples of those plants, tested them and discovered most had antibacterial properties.",
      "Chimpanzees are not the only non-human apes with apparent knowledge of plant-based medicine. A recent study showed a wild oranguatan using chewed leaf material to heal a facial wound.",
      "Scientists think studying this wild ape behaviour - and understanding more about the plants the chimps use when they are sick or injured - could help in the search for new medicines.",
      "\"The more we learn about chimpanzee behaviour and intelligence, the more I think we come to understand how little we as humans actually know about the natural world,\" Dr Freymann told BBC News.",
      "\"If I were plopped down here in this forest with no food and no medicine, I doubt that I'd be able to survive very long, especially if I were injured or sick.\"",
      "\"But chimpanzees thrive here because they know how to access the secrets of this place, and how to find all they need to survive from their surroundings.\""

      "This will recycle scrap metal into new steel products, but requires far fewer workers on site.",
      "The changes will have a dramatic impact on direct emissions of planet-warming gases from Wales.",
      "The blast furnaces were constantly fed with coal, and their closure will have more than halved Wales' industrial emissions since 2022, according to the CCC.",
      "But environmentalists have warned the situation at Port Talbot could damage public support for climate action if it is seen to mean job losses and the demise of heavy industry.",
      "In its report, the CCC said there were \"important lessons to learn\", and that governments in both Westminster and Cardiff Bay should have been better prepared.",
      "\"The challenges facing the UK steel sector have been clear for many years and, given the significance of this site to the local economy, a more proactive and decisive transition plan should have been developed,\" they argued.",
      "The UK government should have taken steps to make industrial electricity prices more competitive, and convened \"early and collaborative\" negotiations between plant owners, workers and the community, the report said.",
      "The Welsh government could have ensured \"the right training and re-skilling programmes were in place well before closure\", it added, and developed a local industrial strategy to support alternative employment in areas like heating services and floating offshore wind.",

      "I grew up in Nepal's capital watching the Himalayas. Ever since I left, I've missed sweeping, panoramic views of some of the highest mountain peaks on Earth.",
      "Each time I visit Kathmandu, I hope to catch a glimpse of the dramatic mountain range. But these days, there's usually no luck.",
      "The main culprit is severe air pollution that hangs as haze above the region.",
      "And it's happening even during the spring and autumn months, which once offered clear skies.",
      "Just last April, the international flight I was in had to circle in the sky nearly 20 times before landing in Kathmandu, because of the hazy weather impacting visibility at the airport.",
      "The hotel I checked in at was at a reasonable height from which mountains are visible on a clear day \u2013 but there was no such day during my two-week stay.",
      "Even from the major vantage point of Nagarkot, just outside Kathmandu, all that could be seen was haze, as if the mountains did not exist.",
      "\"I no longer brand the place for views of 'sunrise, sunset and Himalayas' as I did in the past,\" said Yogendra Shakya, who has been operating a hotel at Nagarkot since 1996.",
      "\"Since you can't have those things mostly now because of the haze, I have rebranded it with history and culture as there are those tourism products as well here.\"",
      "During an earlier trip a year ago, I was hopeful I would be able to see the mighty Himalayan peaks on a trek in the mesmerising Annapurna region \u2013 but had hardly any luck there either.",
      "Scientists say hazy conditions in the region are becoming increasingly intense and lasting longer, reducing visibility significantly.",
      "Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change.",
      "June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low.",
      "Traditionally, March to May and October to November were the best times for business because that was when skies remained clear and visibility was best.",
      "But with rising temperatures and a lack of rain, and worsening air pollution, the spring months are now seeing thick haze with low visibility. Those conditions are beginning as early as December.",
      "'No sighting means no business'",
      "Lucky Chhetri, a pioneering female trekking guide in Nepal, said hazy conditions had led to a 40% decrease in business.",
      "\"In one case last year, we had to compensate a group of trekkers as our guides could not show them the Himalayas due to the hazy conditions,\" she added",
      "An Australian tourist who has visited Nepal more than a dozen times since 1986 described not seeing the mountains as a \"major let-down\".",
      "\"It wasn't like this 10 years ago but now the haze seems to have taken over and it is extraordinarily disappointing for visitors like me,\" said John Carrol.",
      "Krishna Acharya, the provincial chair of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal in the western Gandaki province, says the trekking industry is in deep trouble.",
      "\"Our member trekking operators are getting depressed because no sighting of the Himalayas means no business. Many of them are even considering changing professions,\" he told the BBC.",
      "On the Indian side, near the central Himalayas, hoteliers and tour operators say haze is now denser and returns quicker than before.",
      "\"We have long dry spells and then a heavy downpour, unlike in the past. So with infrequent rain the haze persists for much longer,\" said Malika Virdi, who heads a community-run tourism business in the state of Uttarakhand.",
      "However, Ms Virdi says tourists are persistent - with many who didn't catch the mountain range returning to try their luck again.",
      "The western Himalayas in Pakistan have been relatively less affected by the haze because the mountains are relatively far from cities.",
      "But locals say that even the ranges that were once easily visible from places like Peshawar and Gilgit are often no longer seen.",
      "\"The sheet of haze remains hanging for a longer period and we don't see the mountains that we could in the past,\" said Asif Shuja, the former head of Pakistan's environmental protection agency.",
      "Hazes and dust storms increasing",
      "South Asian cities regularly top lists of places with highest levels of air pollution in the world.",
      "Public health across the region has been badly impacted by the toxic air, which frequently causes travel disruption and school closures.",
      "Vehicular and industrial emissions, dust from infrastructure construction and dry gravel roads as well as the open burning of waste are major sources of air pollution year-round.",
      "This is compounded by soot from massive forest fires - which are increasing due to a longer dry season - and the burning of crop residues after the harvest by farmers in northern India, Pakistan and Nepal.",
      "Weather conditions keeping warmer air above cooler air trap these pollutants and limit vertical air movement - preventing pollution from dispersing.",
      "\"Hazes and dust storms are increasing in South Asia, and this trend is projected to continue due to climate change and other factors,\" Dr Someshwor Das from the South Asia Meteorological Association told the BBC.",
      "In 2024, the number of hazy days recorded at the airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in western Nepal, was 168 - up from 23 in 2020 and 84 in 2021, according to Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology.",
      "Experts believe the Himalayas are probably the worst affected mountain range in the world given their location in a populous and polluted region.",
      "This could mean the scintillating view of the Himalayas could now largely be limited to photographs, paintings and postcards.",

    "story": [
      "Rosemary Coogan is surrounded by a team of people pushing, pulling, squishing and squeezing her into a spacesuit.",
      "It takes about 45 minutes to get all her gear on before a helmet is carefully lowered over her head.",
      "The British astronaut is about to undergo her toughest challenge yet \u2013 assessing whether she is ready for a spacewalk. The test will take place in one of the largest pools in the world: Nasa's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.",
      "The pool \u2013 which is 12m deep (40ft) \u2013 contains a life-sized replica of the International Space Station (ISS), and a \"spacewalk\" here is as close as it gets to mimicking weightlessness on Earth.",
      "\"It's a big day,\" Rosemary says before the dive, which is going to last more than six hours. \"It's very physically intense \u2013 and it's very psychologically intense.\"",
      "But Rosemary doesn't seem too fazed. She smiles and waves as the platform she's standing on is slowly lowered into the water.",
      "Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach.",
      "\"At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,\" Rosemary says. \"You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories.\"",
      "So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people.",
      "ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015.",
      "Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.",
      "She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.",
      "\"It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside \u2013 to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.\"",
      "Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.",
      "\"The lower part is where you put your solid waste,\" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. \"And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.\"",
      "Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.",
      "\"There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.\"",
      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",
      "The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.",
      "\"It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,\" she tells us, \"But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.\"",
      "Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" Rosemary says, \"If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.\"",

      "AWS is the single largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world and has funded more than 40 renewable solar and wind farm projects in the UK.",
      "The UK's 500 data centres currently consume 2.5% of all electricity in the UK, while Ireland's 80 hoover up 21% of the country's total power, with those numbers projected to hit 6% and 30% respectively by 2030.",

      "Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van.",
      "All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than 120 million people worldwide in its first month.",
      "It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimed in a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a \"oner\", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming.",
      "Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry.",
      "At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again.",
      "You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator \u2013 there's a minuscule wobble \u2013 but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless.",
      "It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects.",
      "This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage.",
      "The result is \"phenomenal\", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer.",
      "He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. \"As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take.\"",
      "Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds.",
      "In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.",
      "Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes \u2013 but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.",
      "Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.",
      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",
      "The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.",
      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",
      "Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.",
      "Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.",
      "The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"",
      "There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.",
      "Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.",
      "But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take \u2013 I want to watch these things because they're good.\"",

      "After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat.",
      "\"One thing you cannot have is a puncture,\" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin.",
      "The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover.",
      "Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.",
      "As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027.",
      "Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030.",
      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",
      "Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).",
      "Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface.",
      "Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes.",
      "ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet.",
      "The work might have some useful applications here on Earth.",
      "While working on his doctorate at the University of Southern California, Dr Cole joined a Nasa entrepreneurial programme to work on commercialising some of the technology from the Mars super-elastic rover tyre.",
      "An early product this year will be nickel-titanium bicycle tyres.",
      "Priced around $150 (\u00a3120) each, the tyres are much more expensive than regular ones, but would be extremely durable.",
      "He also plans to work this year on durable tyres for motorbikes, aimed at areas with rough roads.",
      "For all this, his \"dream\" remains to play a part in humanity's return to the Moon.",

      "\"He's posing,\" the spider-keeper jests as it rears up on its back legs. It is exactly what she's trying to achieve - that way she can suck the venom from its fangs using a small pipette.",
      "Emma works from a tiny office known as the spider milking room. On a typical day, she milks - or extracts the venom from - 80 of these Sydney funnel-web spiders.",
      "On three of the four walls there are floor-to-ceiling shelves stacked full of the arachnids, with a black curtain pulled across to keep them calm.",
      "The remaining wall is actually a window. Through it, a small child stares, both fascinated and horrified, as Ms Teni works. Little do they know that the palm-sized spider she's handling could kill them in a matter of minutes.",
      "\"Sydney funnel-webs are arguably the most deadly spider in the world,\" Emma says matter-of-factly.",
      "Australia is famously full of such deadly animals - and this room at the Australian Reptile Park plays a critical part in a government antivenom programme, which saves lives on a continent where it's often joked that everything wants to kill you.",
      "'Spider girl'",
      "While the quickest recorded death from a Sydney funnel-web spider was a toddler at 13 minutes, the average is closer to 76 minutes - and first aid gives you an even better chance of surviving.",
      "So successful is the antivenom programme here at the Australian Reptile Park that nobody has been killed by one since it started in 1981.",
      "The scheme relies, however, on members of the public either catching the spiders or collecting their egg sacs.",
      "In a van plastered with a giant crocodile sticker, each week Ms Teni's team drives all over Australia's most famous city, picking up Sydney funnel-webs that have been handed in at drop-off points such as local veterinary practices.",
      "There are two reasons why these spiders are so dangerous, she explains: not only is their venom extremely potent, but they also live exclusively in a densely populated region where they're more likely to encounter humans.",
      "Handyman Charlie Simpson is one such person. He moved into his first home with his girlfriend a few months ago, and the keen gardener has already found two Sydney funnel-webs. He took the second spider to the vet, where Ms Teni picked it up shortly after.",
      "\"I had gloves on at the time, but realistically I should have had leather gloves on because their fangs are so big and strong,\" the 26-year-old says.",
      "\"I [just thought] I had better catch it because I kept getting told you're meant to take them back to be milked, because it's so critical.\"",
      "\"This is curing my fear of spiders,\" he jokes.",
      "As Ms Teni offloads one arachnid that was delivered to her in a Vegemite jar, she stresses her team isn't telling Australians to go looking for the spiders and \"throw themselves into danger\".",
      "Rather, they're asking that if someone comes across one, they safely capture it rather than kill it.",
      "\"Saying that this is the world's most deadly spider and then [asking the public to] catch it and bring it to us does sound counter-intuitive,\" she says.",
      "\"[But] that spider there now, thanks to Charlie, will\u2026 effectively save someone's life.\"",
      "All of the spiders her team collects get brought back to the Australian Reptile Park where they are catalogued, sorted by sex and stored.",
      "Any females that get dropped off are considered for a breeding programme, which helps supplement the number of spiders donated by the public.",
      "Meanwhile, the males, which are six to seven times more toxic than the females, are used for the antivenom programme and milked every two weeks, Emma explains.",
      "The pipette she uses to remove the venom from the fangs is attached to a suction hose - crucial for collecting as much venom as possible, since each spider provides only small amounts.",

      "But now she wouldn't have it any other way. Emma loves all things arachnid, and goes under various nicknames - spider girl, spider mama, even \"weirdo\", as her daughter calls her.",
      "Friends, family and neighbours rely on her for her knowledge of Australia's creepy crawlies.",

      "Spiders represent just one small part of what the Australian Reptile Park does. It's also been providing snake venom to the government since the 1950s.",
      "According to the World Health Organisation, as many as 140,000 people die across the world from snake bites every year, and three times that many are left disabled.",
      "In Australia though, those numbers are far lower: between one and four people each year, thanks to its successful antivenom programme.",
      "Removing a King Brown snake from its storage locker, Billy Collett, the park's operations manager, brings it to the table in front of him.",
      "With his bare hands, he secures its head and puts its jaws over a shot glass covered in cling film.",

      "\"That is enough to kill all of us in the room five times over - maybe more.\"",
      "Then he switches to a more reassuring tone: \"They're not looking for people to bite. We're too big for them to eat; they don't want to waste their venom on us. They just want to be left alone.\"",
      "\"To get bitten by a venomous snake, you've got to really annoy it, provoke it,\" he adds, noting that bites often occur when someone is trying to kill one of the reptiles.",
      "There's a fridge in the corner of the room where the raw venom Mr Collett is collecting is stored. It's full of vials labelled \"Death Adder\", \"Taipan\", \"Tiger Snake\" and \"Eastern Brown\".",
      "The last of these is the second-most venomous snake in the world, and the one that's most likely to bite you here, in Australia.",
      "This venom gets freeze-dried and sent to CSL Seqirus, a lab in Melbourne, where it's turned into an antidote in a process that can take up to 18 months.",
      "The first step is to produce what's known as hyper-immune plasma. In the case of snakes, controlled doses of the venom are injected into horses, because they are larger animals with a strong immune system.",
      "The venom of Sydney funnel-web spiders goes into rabbits, which are immune to the toxins. The animals are injected with increasing doses to build up their antibodies. In some cases, that step alone can take almost a year.",
      "The animal's supercharged plasma is removed from the blood, and then the antibodies are isolated from the plasma before they're bottled, ready to be administered.",
      "CSL Seqirus makes 7,000 vials a year \u2013 including snake, spider, stonefish and box jellyfish antivenoms - and they are valid for 36 months. The challenge then is to ensure everyone who needs it has supplies.",
      "\"It's an enormous undertaking,\" says Dr Jules Bayliss, who leads the antivenom development team at CSL Seqirus.",
      "\"First and foremost we want to see them in major rural and remote areas that these creatures are likely to be in.\"",
      "Vials are distributed depending on the species in each area. Taipans, for example, are in northern parts of Australia, so there's no need for their antivenom in Tasmania.",
      "Antivenom is also given to the Royal Flying Doctors, who access some of the nation's most remote communities, as well as Australian navy and cargo ships for sailors at risk of sea snake bites.",
      "Papua New Guinea also receives about 600 vials a year. The country was once connected to Australia by a land bridge, and shares many of the same snake species, so the Australian government gives the antivenom for free \u2013 snake diplomacy, if you like.",
      "\"To be honest, we probably have the most impact in Papua New Guinea, more so than Australia, because of the number of snake bites and deaths they have,\" says CSL Seqirus executive Chris Larkin. To date, they reckon they've saved 2,000 lives.",
      "Back at the park, Mr Collett jokes about the nickname of \"danger noodles\" that is sometimes given to his serpentine colleagues \u2013 a classic Australian trait of making light of something that gives so many visitors nightmares.",
      "Mr Collett, though, is clear: these animals should not put people off from visiting.",
      "\"Snakes aren't just cruising down the streets attacking Brits - it doesn't work like that,\" he jokes.",

    "story": [
      "The top US diplomat Marco Rubio has said the US is \"troubled\" by the humanitarian situation in Gaza.",
      "His comments came as at least 114 Palestinians were killed in Israeli air strikes on Thursday, health officials said.",
      "Asked by the BBC if the Trump administration remained fully behind the nature of Israel's military action given the scale of the recent Israeli attacks and its bombing of hospitals, he once again called on Hamas to surrender and release hostages and said there could be no peace so long as the group exists.",
      "\"That said, we're not immune or in any way insensitive to the suffering of the people of Gaza, and I know that there's opportunities here to provide aid for them,\" he said.",
      "Gaza has been under a complete Israeli blockade of all food and other humanitarian supplies for 10 weeks. Israeli forces have been intensifying their bombardment of what they say are Hamas fighters and infrastructure ahead of a planned expansion of their ground offensive in Gaza.",
      "Rubio's comments - made after a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Turkey - appeared to be a reference to a controversial Israeli-American proposal to use private providers to set up aid collection points in Gaza. That plan has been rejected by the UN as unethical and unworkable.",
      "They come as Donald Trump is visiting the region and indirect negotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel continue.",
      "Hamas meanwhile accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of \"undermin[ing] mediation efforts by deliberate military escalation\".",
      "An Israeli government spokesman said Israel wanted negotiations on hostage releases to succeed, but that they would take place while Hamas was under \"military pressure\".",
      "The US is Israel's main arms supplier and the language used by Rubio is unusual. Previously he has responded to questions about Palestinian civilian casualties only by calling on Hamas to surrender. It also comes amid recent reports of a rift between Trump and Netanyahu.",

      "Israeli evacuation orders issued on Wednesday afternoon also caused panic among residents of a crowded area of Gaza City, in the north.",
      "The Israeli military said a hospital, a university and several schools sheltering displaced people in the Rimal neighbourhood had become \"terrorist strongholds\" and that it would soon attack them with \"intense force\".",
      "Separately, a US-backed organisation said it would start work in Gaza within two weeks as part of a new and heavily criticised US-Israeli aid distribution plan.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said it had asked Israel to let the UN and others resume deliveries until it was set up, and also to allow it to set up aid distribution sites in the north as well as the south.",
      "Israel's UN envoy, Danny Danon, said he was \"not familiar with those requests\", but he confirmed that the \"major operation\" would start very soon.",
      "UN spokesperson Farhan Haq meanwhile reiterated that it would not participate in the plan, saying it \"does not accord with out basic principles, including those of impartiality, neutrality [and] independence\".",
      "Israel has not allowed any aid or other supplies into Gaza for 10 weeks, and an assessment by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has warned that half a million people face starvation.",

      "Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "At least 53,010 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,876 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

      "A judge in 2023 ruled that news articles alleging the Victoria Cross recipient had murdered four unarmed Afghans were true, but Mr Roberts-Smith had argued the judge made legal errors.",
      "The civil trial was the first time in history any court has assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces.",
      "A panel of three Federal Court judges on Friday unanimously upheld the original judgement, though Mr Roberts-Smith has said he will appeal the decision to the High Court of Australia \"immediately\".",
      "\"I continue to maintain my innocence and deny these egregious spiteful allegations,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Mr Roberts-Smith, who left the defence force in 2013,  has not been charged over any of the claims in a criminal court, where there is a higher burden of proof.",
      "The former special forces corporal sued three Australian newspapers over a series of articles alleging serious misconduct while he was deployed in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2012 as part of a US-led military coalition.",
      "At the time the articles were published in 2018, Mr Roberts-Smith was considered a national hero, having been awarded Australia's highest military honour for single-handedly overpowering Taliban fighters attacking his Special Air Service (SAS) platoon.",
      "The 46-year-old argued the alleged killings occurred legally during combat or did not happen at all, claiming the papers ruined his life with their reports.",
      "His defamation case - which some have dubbed \"the trial of the century\" in Australia - lasted over 120 days and is now rumoured to have cost up to A$35m ($22.5m; \u00a316.9m).",

      "In June 2023 Federal Court Justice Antony Besanko threw out the case against The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald, and The Canberra Times, ruling it was \"substantially true\" that Mr Roberts-Smith had murdered unarmed Afghan prisoners and civilians and bullied fellow soldiers.",
      "He also found that Mr Roberts-Smith lied to cover up his misconduct and threatened witnesses.",
      "Additional allegations that he had punched his lover, threatened a peer, and committed two other murders were not proven to the \"balance of probabilities\" standard required in civil cases.",
      "The \"heart\" of the appeal case was that Justice Besanko didn't given enough weight to Mr Roberts-Smith's presumption of innocence, his barrister Bret Walker, SC said.",
      "There is a legal principle requiring judges to proceed carefully when dealing with civil cases that involve serious allegations and in making findings which carry grave consequences.",
      "Mr Walker argued that meant the evidence presented by the newspapers fell short of the standard required.",

      "They argued there was a miscarriage of justice because Nick McKenzie, one of the journalists who wrote the articles at the centre of the case, allegedly unlawfully obtained details about Mr Roberts-Smith's legal strategy.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 23:01:32 GMT",
    "summary": "After seven breathless days of diplomatic hurly burly, we have a clearer idea of the US president's global ideology - and the limits of his 'art of a deal'.",
    "story": [
      "\"There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.\" So supposedly said the Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. The diplomatic whirlwind that has surrounded US President Donald Trump this week suggests the old Bolshevik might have been onto something.",
      "For the protectionist president, who promises always to put America First, has in recent days instead been busy bestriding the world stage.",
      "He and his team have done business deals in the Gulf; lifted sanctions on Syria; negotiated the release of a US citizen held by Hamas; ended military strikes on Houthi fighters in Yemen; slashed American tariffs on China; ordered Ukraine to hold talks with Russia in Turkey; continued quiet negotiations with Iran over a nuclear deal; and even claimed responsibility for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan...",
      "The pace has been breathless, leaving allies and opponents alike struggling to catch up as the US diplomatic bandwagon hurtled from issue to issue.",
      "\"Just, wow!\" remarked one London-based ambassador. \"It is almost impossible to stay on top of everything that's going on.\"",
      "So what is going on? What have we learned in this frantic week about the US president's emerging foreign policy? Is there something approaching a Trump doctrine - or is this just a coincidental confluence of global events?",
      "Pomp and flattery in Saudi",
      "A good place to start, perhaps, is the president's visit to the Gulf where he set out - in word and deed - his vision for a world of interstate relations based on trade, not war. In a speech in Riyadh, Trump said he wanted \"commerce not chaos\" in the Middle East, a region that \"exports technology not terrorism\".",
      "His was a prospect of a breezy, pragmatic mercantilism where nations did business deals to their mutual benefit, a world where profit can bring peace.",
      "As he enjoyed the flattery of his Saudi hosts and the obeisance of visiting dignitaries, the president signed - with his fat felt tip pen - deals that the White House claimed represented $600bn of investment in the US.",
      "This was Trump in all his pomp; applauded and rewarded with immediate wins he could sell back home as good for American jobs.",
      "Some diplomats privately questioned the value of the various memorandums of understanding. But the show, they said, was more important than the substance.",
      "A 'none of our business' approach",
      "Absent from Trump's speech was any mention of possible collective action by the US and other countries; no talk of multilateral cooperation against the threat of climate change, no concerns about challenges to democratic or human rights in the region. This was a discourse almost entirely without reference to ideology or values except to dismiss their significance.",
      "Rather, he used his speech to Saudi leaders to make his clearest argument yet against Western interventionism of the past, attacking what he called \"the so-called nation-builders and neo-cons\" for \"giving you lectures on how to live or how to govern your own affairs\".",
      "To the applause of his Arab audience, he said these \"Western interventionists\" had \"wrecked more nations than they built\", adding: \"Far too many American presidents have been afflicted with the notion that it's our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use US policy to dispense justice for their sins.",
      "\"I believe it's God's job to sit in judgement. My job is to defend America.\"",
      "That reluctance to intervene was on show in recent days when it came to the fighting between India and Pakistan. In the past, the US has often played a key role seeking to end military confrontations in the subcontinent. But the Trump White House was initially cautious about getting involved.",
      "Vice-President JD Vance told Fox News the fighting was \"fundamentally none of our business\u2026 We can't control these countries\".",
      "In the end, both he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio did make calls, putting pressure on both nuclear powers to de-escalate. So too did other countries.",
      "When the ceasefire was agreed, Trump claimed US diplomacy had brokered the deal. But that was flatly dismissed by Indian diplomats who insisted it was a bilateral truce.",
      "Pros of policy in one man's hands",
      "The centrality of Trump to US foreign policy has also become apparent this week. This is more than just a simple truism. On show was the lack of involvement of other parts of the US government that traditionally help shape US decision-making overseas.",
      "Take the president's extraordinary decision to meet Syria's new president and former jihadist, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and lift sanctions on Syria. This showed the potential advantage of having foreign policy in one man's hands: it was a decisive and bold step. And it was clearly the president's personal decision, after heavy lobbying by both Turkey and Saudi Arabia.",
      "It was seen by some diplomats as the quid pro quo for the diplomatic fawning and investment deals Trump received in Riyadh. Not only did the decision surprise many in the region but it also surprised many in the American government.",
      "Diplomats said the State Department was reluctant to lift sanctions, wanting to keep some leverage over the new Syrian government, fearful it was not doing enough to protect minorities and tackle foreign fighters.",
      "Diplomats say this pattern of impulsive decision-making without wider internal government discussion is common in the White House. The result, they say, is not always positive.",
      "This is due, in part, to Trump's lack of consistency (or put simply, changing his mind).",
      "Take the decision this week to do a deal with China to cut tariffs on trade with the US. A few weeks ago Trump imposed 145% tariffs on Beijing, with blood thirsty warnings against retaliation. The Chinese retaliated, the markets plunged, American businesses warned of dire consequences.",
      "So in Geneva, US officials climbed down and most tariffs against China were cut to 30%, supposedly in return for some increased US access to Chinese markets. This followed a now-familiar pattern: issue maximalist demands, threaten worse, negotiate, climb down and declare victory.",
      "Limitations of his 'art of a deal'",
      "The problem is that this \"art of a deal\" strategy might work on easily reversible decisions such as tariffs. It is harder to apply to longer term diplomatic conundrums such as war.",
      "Take Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On this, Trump's policy has been fluid, to put it mildly. And this week was a case in point.",
      "Last Saturday the leaders of the UK, France, Poland and Germany visited Kyiv to put on a show of support for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. And in a group call with Trump on French President Emmanuel Macron's phone, they spelled out their strategy of demanding Russia agree an immediate 30-day ceasefire or face tougher sanctions.",
      "This was Trump's policy too. The day before he wrote on social media: \"If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions.\" But then on Sunday, President Vladimir Putin suggested instead there should be direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey on Thursday. Trump immediately went along with this, backtracking on the strategy he had agreed with European leaders a day earlier.",
      "\"Ukraine should agree to (these talks) immediately,\" he wrote on social media. \"I am starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin.\"",
      "Then on Thursday, Trump changed his position again, saying a deal could be done only if he and Putin were to meet in person.",
      "This puzzles some diplomats. \"Does he genuinely not know what he wants to do about the war in Ukraine?\" one remarked to me. \"Or does he just grasp at what might offer the quickest resolution possible?\"",
      "A snub to Netanyahu?",
      "Into this puzzling mix fell two other decisions this week. First, Trump agreed a ceasefire after a campaign bombing Houthi fighters in Yemen for almost two months. There have been questions about the effectiveness of the hugely expensive air strikes, and the president's appetite for a long military operation. He repeatedly told his Arab hosts how much he disliked war.",
      "Second, Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, held his fourth round of talks with Iran over efforts to curb their nuclear ambitions. Both sides are hinting that a deal is possible, although sceptics fear it could be quite modest. Talk of joint US-Israeli military action against Iran seems to have dissipated.",
      "What unites both issues is that the United States was acting directly against the wishes of Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu may have been the first world leader invited to the Oval Office after Trump's inauguration, but in recent days, he seems to have been snubbed. Trump toured the Middle East without visiting Israel; he lifted sanctions on Syria without Israel's support. His Houthi ceasefire came only days after the group attacked Tel Aviv airport.",
      "Diplomats fear Netanyahu's reaction. Could the spurned prime minister respond with a more aggressive military operation in Gaza?",
      "Capitalism to overcome conflict",
      "So after this week of diplomatic hurly burly, how much has changed? Perhaps less than might appear.",
      "For all the glitz of Trump's tour through the Middle East, the fighting and humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues unresolved. A fresh Israeli offensive seems imminent. One of Trump's chief aims \u2013 the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia - remains distant.",
      "For all the talks about ending the war in Ukraine, there is no greater likelihood of the guns falling silent. Putin's ambitions seem unchanged. And for all the deals to cut US tariffs, either with the UK or China, there is still huge global market instability.",
      "We do have a clearer idea of Trump's global ideology, one that is not isolationist but mercantilist, hoping optimistically that capitalism can overcome conflict. We also have a clearer idea of his haste, his desire to clear his diplomatic decks \u2013 in the Middle East, Ukraine and the subcontinent \u2013 so he can focus on his primary concern, namely China.",
      "But that may prove an elusive ambition.\u202fIf there are weeks when decades happen, there are also weeks when nothing happens.",
      "Joe Biden on Trump: 'What president ever talks like that? That's not who we are'",
      "Americans used to be steadfast in their support for Israel. Those days are gone",

      "The Framji Dadabhoy Alpaiwalla Museum documents the history and legacy of the ancient Parsi community - a small ethnic group that's fast dwindling and resides largely in India.",
      "Now estimated at just 50,000 to 60,000, the Parsis are believed to be descendants of Persians who fled religious persecution by Islamic rulers centuries ago.",
      "Despite their significant contributions to India's economic and cultural fabric, much about the Parsi community remains little known to the mainstream population and the wider world.",
      "\"The newly-renovated museum hopes to shake off some of this obscurity by inviting people to explore the history, culture and traditions of the Parsi community through the rare historical artefacts on display,\" says Kerman Fatakia, curator of the museum.",
      "Some of these include cuneiform bricks, terracotta pots, coins and other objects sourced from places like Babylon, Mesopotamia, Susa and Iran and are dated to 4000-5000 BCE.",
      "These are places where Zoroastrian Iranian kings once ruled, like the Achaemenian, Parthian and Sasanian dynasties.",
      "There are also artefacts from Yazd, a city in central Iran which was once a barren desert and the place where many Zoroastrians settled after fleeing other regions of Iran after the Arab invasion in 7th Century BCE.",
      "One of the notable artefacts on display is a replica of a clay cylinder of Cyrus the Great, a Persian king who was the founder of the Achaemenid empire.",
      "Fatakia says the clay cylinder - also known as the \"Edict of Cyrus\" or the \"Cyrus Cylinder\" - is one of the most important discoveries of the ancient world. Inscribed in cuneiform script, it outlines the rights granted by Cyrus to his subjects in Babylon. Widely seen as the first human rights charter, a replica is also displayed at the United Nations.",
      "Then there are maps that trace the migration routes of thousands of Iranian Zoroastrians who fled their home country fearing persecution and travelled to India in the 8th to10th centuries, and again in the 19th century.",
      "The collection also features furniture, manuscripts, paintings, and portraits of prominent Parsis - among them Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, founder of the iconic Tata Group, which owns brands like Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley tea.",
      "Another striking section showcases artefacts collected by Parsis who grew wealthy in the early 19th century trading tea, silk, cotton - and notably, opium - with China. The exhibits include traditional Parsi sarees influenced by designs from China, France, and other regions shaped by these global trade ties.",
      "Two of the museum's most compelling exhibits are replicas of a Tower of Silence and a Parsi fire temple.",
      "The Tower of Silence, or dakhma, is where Parsis leave their dead to be returned to nature - neither buried nor cremated. \"The replica shows exactly what happens to the body once it's placed there,\" says Fatakia, noting that entry to actual towers is restricted to a select few.",
      "The life-size replica of the fire temple is equally fascinating, offering a rare glimpse into a sacred space typically off-limits to non-Parsis. Modelled on a prominent Mumbai temple, it features sacred motifs inspired by ancient Persian architecture in Iran.",
      "The Alpaiwala Museum, originally founded in 1952 in what was then Bombay, is one of the city's older institutions. Recently renovated, it now features modern displays with well-captioned exhibits in glass cases. Every visitor is offered a guided tour.",

    "story": [
      "Listen to Damian read this article",
      "On a warm morning earlier this month, a group of Metropolitan Police diplomatic protection officers sat in an anteroom off the ornate entrance hall in London's Lancaster House, sipping tea and nibbling chocolate biscuits, while upstairs a core group of European politicians discussed the future of European cooperation.",
      "It was an apt setting: everywhere you look in Lancaster House, there is evidence of the long, entangled histories of the UK and Europe. The double sweep of its grand staircase deliberately echoes the Palace of Versailles. Queen Victoria sat in these rooms listening to Frederic Chopin play the piano in 1848. Tony Blair hosted Russian President Putin here for an energy summit in 2003.",
      "The important issues on the agenda at the Lancaster House meeting, which was hosted by the Foreign Secretary David Lammy, included the latest developments in the war in Ukraine, Europe's response to ensure the continent's security, and \u2013 for the first time since Brexit \u2013 a summit between the UK and the European Union, which will take place on 19 May.",
      "The British government believes it's a significant moment.",
      "Before Brexit, British prime ministers would travel to Brussels four times a year or more for summits with the heads of the EU's institutions and its 27 member states. The haggling would go on late into the night. After Brexit those large summits stopped.",
      "Now, the Labour government, elected last year on a manifesto that promised \"an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners\", envisages new and regular interactions with the EU. Monday's marks the first.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer will host the most senior EU leaders to launch a new \"partnership\".",
      "Pedro Serrano, the EU ambassador to London, has described it as the \"culmination of enhanced contacts at the highest levels since the July 2024 [UK] elections\". But what will it amount to?",
      "Is what's coming a \"surrender summit\" as the Conservatives warn; \"the great British sellout\" undoing bits of Brexit that Reform UK fear; or \"a huge opportunity\" the UK may be about to squander, as Liberal Democrats say? Or could it be an example of how, in Sir Keir Starmer's words, \"serious pragmatism defeats performative politics\" by delivering practical things that will improve people's lives?",
      "Questions around a security pact",
      "In those long, drama-filled nights of 2020, when the then-prime minister Boris Johnson was negotiating Brexit, the possibility of a Security and Defence Partnership was discussed. But the UK's main priority was diverging from Brussels. So nothing was agreed \u2013 a notable omission, some think.",
      "Now a new UK-EU security pact has been worked on for months, the plan is for it to be the centrepiece of what's agreed.",
      "Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, who is overseeing negotiations, was at the early talks at Lancaster House. \"Our relationship has had some difficulties,\" she told me, but \"considering what is going on in the world [\u2026] we need to move forward with this partnership.\"",
      "Yet some think the UK should not seize this outstretched hand.",
      "\"The cornerstone of our defence is Nato,\" Alex Burghart, a Conservative frontbencher, told the Commons this week. \"We know of no reason why Nato is insufficient.\"",
      "Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice has his own view. \"There's no value at all,\" he argues. \"We do not want to be constrained by a bungling top-down bureaucratic military structure. Our defence is guaranteed by Nato.\"",
      "The government fires back on that point, arguing that a partnership will in no way undermine Nato; rather it will complement it, they say, because it will stretch to areas beyond defence, like the security of our economies, infrastructure, energy supplies, even migration and transnational crime.",
      "Some industry experts also believe that a security pact could boost the UK economy. Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS Group, a UK trade association that represents aerospace, defence and security firms, is among them.",
      "Take, for example, the SAFE (Security Action For Europe) programme that is being set up by the EU, aiming to provide up to \u20ac150bn (\u00a3126bn) in loans for new projects. If the UK strikes a security partnership with the EU, then British weapons manufacturers could potentially access some of that cash.",
      "\"There is a huge amount of interest from European partners,\" says Mr Craven. \"One of the challenges for defence companies in the last couple of years, since the advent of Ukraine, is being able to scale up their own capacity to meet demand.\" He estimates the UK could boost the EU's defence output by a fifth.",
      "The Liberal Democrat's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Calum Miller, similarly believes that a security pact is a huge opportunity for the British defence industry - but, he adds, \"as importantly, it's a new strategic opportunity for the UK to be part of that ongoing conversation about how we arm as a continent\".",
      "Others point out that the UK has already been working with the EU on defence ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine \u2013 at Nato, and most recently via the so-called Coalition of the Willing.",
      "So, in practice, does it make huge amounts of difference to the UK's place in Europe?",
      "No, argues Jill Rutter, a former senior civil servant who is now a senior fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. \"Because relations [on defence] have already been improving quite a long way.\"",
      "Some of those working on the partnership, however, argue that it will set in train new ways for the UK to engage and cooperate with its neighbours.",
      "Delays at the border",
      "More contentious is the UK's desire to sign what's called a 'veterinary' deal to remove some border checks on food and drink. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister leading these negotiations, told the Commons this week that the objective to lower food and drink costs is in the manifesto, so there is a mandate for it.",
      "Inside the food industry, calls for reform have been growing. Julianne Ponan, whose firm Creative Nature makes vegan snack bars, exports to 18 countries but only a small proportion goes to the EU. She says this is because of the paperwork and inspections since Brexit.",
      "One of her employees had to carry samples in her luggage on a passenger flight to Spain for a meeting to make sure the food wasn't held up at the border, she says.",
      "\"I think this will open up huge opportunities for businesses like mine.\"",
      "It would also make a big difference for Northern Ireland. After Brexit, special arrangements were put in place to keep the land border it shares with the Republic of Ireland free of new impediments. But at the same time, new paperwork and inspections were put in place on food, drink, animals and plants being transported from mainland Britain across the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland. They're bitterly opposed by Unionist politicians and complicate life for many businesses.",
      "But a veterinary deal may carry political danger. It would require the UK to align some of its rules on food and drink with EU ones, and move in-step with Brussels over time. And those rules are subject to oversight by EU courts.",
      "\"I call it the surrender summit,\" says Andrew Griffith, the Conservative Shadow Business and Trade Secretary. Under this deal the UK would lose \"our freedom to set our own rules\", he adds.",
      "The Conservatives say they \"fought long and hard\" to \"take back control of our laws, our borders, our money\" \u2013 and that this should not now be reversed.",
      "Step change or 'sell out'?",
      "Reform UK has not held back in its language: \"We think prepare for the Great British sell out. That's the bottom line, and it will be dressed up as a reset,\" Richard Tice says.",
      "\"Why would you want to reset and get closer to a patently failing economic model? The EU is struggling even more than we are. We should be diverging as fast as we can away from that.\"",
      "But Labour's Thomas-Symonds dismisses these views as a \"rehash of the arguments of the past\".",
      "On the other end of the spectrum is the accusation that Sir Keir is far too cautious. Calum Miller of the Liberal Democrats says he knows of businesses \"gnashing their teeth in frustration that they just can't exploit opportunities to work with and trade with Europe\".",
      "His party wants the UK to explore a Customs Union with the EU. It would make moving goods easier, but mean we couldn't sign our own trade deals.",
      "David Henig, a former senior trade negotiator, has been talking to both sides \"hoping to help, to sort of navigate them in\".",
      "\"The summit is a step forward, not a step change,\" he says, \"A slight deepening of the trade ties, rather than something dramatically new.\"",
      "A deal on food and drink checks would deliver very little, he believes, because food and drink is such a limited part of trade. \"If you were, for example, aligning UK and EU rules on industrial products, you'd get a much bigger economic impact\".",
      "Jill Rutter thinks that a veterinary deal would not prove \"economically earth shattering\" \u2013 but if it goes well, she argues that it could provide \"early proof of concept\" for further UK-EU cooperation.",
      "'Tough it out' on fishing?",
      "After Brexit, many British fishermen were disappointed when Boris Johnson's government agreed to let EU boats continue much as before, taking significant catches from UK waters. Those arrangements expire next year. The EU wants them extended.",
      "David Davis who, as Brexit minister, led some of the original negotiations for the UK, told me fishing was \"totemic\" for Brussels. London conceded too easily, he thinks.",
      "\"Europeans got what they wanted first, and then we had a haggle from a weak position.\"",
      "So he adds, \"If I was giving advice to the government, I would say, tough it out\" and use fishing as a lever to seek concessions.",
      "But, as the UK found before, Brussels has cards to play. Much of the fish caught by British fishermen is sold to buyers on the Continent and the UK needs access to that market.",
      "Some EU coastal states, like France and Denmark, are prepared to drive a hard bargain, demanding that London concedes on fishing rights in return for things it wants. Early on, even signing the Security Partnership was being linked to agreement on a fishing deal. The haggling will be tough.",
      "Immigration and youth mobility",
      "And finally, there's an idea that has prompted much interest in recent months: a youth mobility deal, through which under-30s from the UK and EU could live and work in each other's countries.",
      "For a long time the government said there were \"no plans\" for such a deal \u2013 but earlier this month they changed course, with Labour's Thomas-Symonds saying that \"A smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people\".",
      "It's likely that would mean very limited numbers allowed to enter the UK, and only with a visa, for a limited time.",
      "Under those conditions, ministers hope it would not inflate net migration numbers. It's far from what the EU would like.",
      "The UK already has similar schemes with 13 countries, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan.",
      "\"When we are comfortable having those relationships, why are we so averse to having it with our nearest neighbours?\" Calum Miller asks, \"It just doesn't really make sense\".",
      "Paula Surridge, a professor of political sociology at Bristol University, argues that public views on immigration are more nuanced than many people think. \"Voters care most about what they perceive as illegal migration \u2013 small boat crossings and so on,\" she says, \"People coming here to study or to work, particularly young people, are not a particular cause for concern\" for most.",
      "\"There will definitely be a group of voters that are upset [about potential deals], but they were never going to vote Labour.\"",
      "Of those who backed Labour in 2024, she adds, about three quarters previously voted Remain in the Brexit referendum. The political risk to the government of signing pacts with the EU is \"smaller than it appears\", she adds.",
      "Conservative pollster Lord Hayward is more cautious \u2013 and is concerned that a deal may pose a \"bear trap\" for the government if it's seen as providing free movement to young Europeans. \"It will provide serious difficulties for them to come to an agreement on something which could easily be portrayed as EU membership 2.0.\"",
      "'Making Brexit work'",
      "Even before Sir Keir's upcoming summit on Monday, his opponents are raising that spectre.",
      "\"All of his muscle memory has been to get closer to the European political union,\" says Mr Griffith. \"I am worried about our prime minister, with that baggage, with those preconceived ideas, [\u2026] trying to negotiate a better deal with the EU.\"",
      "Richard Tice says his party could simply undo any deals with the EU. \"If I'm right about our fears, and we win the next general election, we will just reverse the lot. The whole lot.\"",
      "But Mr Thomas-Symonds is of the view that Monday will show the government is \"not returning to the Customs Union, Single Market, or Freedom of Movement\", all red lines it has pledged not to cross.",
      "Instead it will be about \"making Brexit work in the interests of the British people\".",
      "Labour to unveil big immigration plans next week - but will they win back votes?",
      "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military",
      "Sir John Curtice: The map that shows Reform's triumph was much more than a protest vote",
      "Back at Lancaster House, the politicians have moved on, heading to more meetings in Albania and Turkey to grapple with the issues facing the continent. But in a quiet hallway in the house is a painting from the 1850s of the Duke of Wellington inspecting troops in London's Hyde Park.",
      "In it, he sits on a black stallion, raising his white-feathered hat to salute the cavalry - a tribute to the prime minister and military hero who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.",
      "The upcoming summit won't be as momentous an event in the UK's complicated history with Europe. But a modern British leader about to plunge into the fray of European politics might pause for thought here \u2013 perhaps, for just a moment.",

      "But more than 30 years on, black farmers own only a small fraction of the country's best farmland, with the majority still in white hands.",
      "That has led to anger over the slow pace of change. Mr Kleinhaus acknowledges that black South Africans have suffered as well as him.",

      "The claims stem from attacks on white farmers, or misleading information circulated online.",
      "In February, a South African judge dismissed the idea of a genocide as \"clearly imagined\" and \"not real\", when ruling in an inheritance case involving a wealthy benefactor's donation to white supremacist group Boerelegioen.",
      "South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024.",
      "Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.",
      "What have Trump and Musk said?",
      "Defending his decision to give Afrikaners refugee status, Trump said that a \"genocide\" was taking place in South Africa, white farmers were being \"brutally killed\" and their \"land is being confiscated\".",
      "Trump said that he was not sure how he could attend the G20 summit of world leaders, due to be held in South Africa later this year, in such an environment.",
      "\"I don't know how we can go unless that situation's taken care of,\" he added.",

      "Referring to the first group who have moved to the US, he said: \"They are leaving because they don't want to embrace the changes that are taking place in our country and our constitution.\"",
      "The government denies that land is being confiscated from farmers, saying that a bill Ramaphosa signed into law in January was aimed at addressing the land dispossession that black people faced during white-minority rule.",
      "But the law has been condemned by the Democratic Alliance (DA), Ramaphosa's main coalition partner in government. The DA say it will challenge the law in South Africa's highest court, as it threatens property rights.",
      "Trump's close adviser Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, has referred to the country's \"racist ownership laws\", alleging that his satellite internet service provider Starlink was \"not allowed to operate in South Africa simply because I'm not black\".",
      "To operate in South Africa, Starlink needs to obtain network and service licences, which both require 30% ownership by historically disadvantaged groups.",
      "This mainly refers to South Africa's majority black population, which was shut out of the economy during the racist system of apartheid.",
      "The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) - a regulatory body in the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors - told the BBC that Starlink had never submitted an application for a licence.",

      "Racially charged row between Musk and South Africa over Starlink",
      "Why does a political party sing about shooting Boers?",
      "EFF leader Julius Malema's trademark song is \"Shoot the Boer, Shoot the farmer\", which he sings at political rallies.",
      "Afrikaner lobby groups have tried to get the song banned, saying it was highly inflammatory and amounted to hate speech.",
      "However, South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal has ruled that Malema is within his rights to sing the lyrics - first popularised during the anti-apartheid struggle - at political rallies.",
      "The court ruled that a \"reasonably well-informed person\" would understand that when \"protest songs are sung, even by politicians, the words are not meant to be understood literally, nor is the gesture of shooting to be understood as a call to arms or violence\".",
      "Instead, the song was a \"provocative way\" of advancing the EFF's political agenda - which was to end \"land and economic injustice\".",
      "Lobby group AfriForum filed an appeal against the ruling, but South Africa's highest court refused to hear the case, saying it had little chance of succeeding.",
      "In 2023, South Africa's former President Thabo Mbeki urged Malema to stop singing the song, saying it was no longer politically relevant as the anti-apartheid struggle was over.",
      "The ANC says it no longer sings it, but it cannot \"prescribe to other political parties what they must sing\".",
      "Do white people face discrimination in South Africa?",
      "Even though white-minority rule ended in 1994, its effects are still being felt.",
      "Average living standards are far higher for the white community than black people.",
      "White people occupy 62.1% of top management posts, despite only accounting for 7.7% of the country's economically active population, according to a recent report by South Africa's Commission for Employment Equity.",
      "The government has tried to change this through what it calls \"economic empowerment\" and \"employment equity\" laws.",
      "An amended version of the second act includes strict targets for companies aimed at increasing the number of non-white employees.",
      "While these laws has been welcomed by many South Africans, some members of racial minorities feel they make it harder for them to get jobs and government contracts. There has also been criticism that they can lead to corruption, for example when business opportunities are given to friends and relatives of officials.",
      "Among the critics have been the Democratic Alliance, which despite being part of the governing coalition, recently challenged the amended Employment Equity Act in court, saying it would \"make far more people marginalised in our economy than they already are\".",
      "Sports Minister Gayton McKenzie recently came under fire when a job in his department was advertised as being only open to the Coloured, Asian and white populations.",
      "He defended this move, saying he was applying the Employment Equity Act and ensuring \"all races are represented\", because most of the people in his department were black.",
      "Do most Afrikaners want to move to the US?",
      "It doesn't look like it.",
      "In March, a business group said that close to 70,000 Afrikaners had expressed interest in moving to the US following Trump's offer - from an estimated population of 2.5 million.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmj7l0lne3o",
    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 23:32:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Living along the LoC - the volatile India-Pakistan border - means life in a fragile limbo between war and peace.",
    "story": [
      "To live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict.",
      "The recent escalation after the Pahalgam attack brought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Shells rained down on both sides of the LoC, turning homes to rubble and lives into statistics. At least 16 people were reportedly killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling.",
      "\"Families on the LoC are subjected to Indian and Pakistani whims and face the brunt of heated tensions,\" Anam Zakaria, a Pakistani writer based in Canada, told the BBC.",
      "\"Each time firing resumes many are thrust into bunkers, livestock and livelihood is lost, infrastructure - homes, hospitals, schools - is damaged. The vulnerability and volatility experienced has grave repercussions for their everyday lived reality,\" Ms Zakaria, author of a book on Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said.",
      "India and Pakistan share a 3,323km (2,064-mile) border, including the 740km-long LoC; and the International Border (IB), spanning roughly 2,400km. The LoC began as the Ceasefire Line in 1949 after the first India-Pakistan war, and was renamed under the 1972 Simla Agreement.",
      "The LoC cutting through Kashmir - claimed in full and administered in parts by both India and Pakistan - remains one of the most militarised borders in the world. Conflict is never far behind and ceasefires are only as durable as the next provocation.",
      "Ceasefire violations here can range from \"low-level firing to major land grabbing to surgical strikes\", says Happymon Jacob, a foreign policy expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). (A land grab could involve seizing key positions such as hilltops, outposts, or buffer zones by force.)",
      "The LoC, many experts say, is a classic example of a \"border drawn in blood, forged through conflict\". It is also a line, as Ms Zakaria says, \"carved by India and Pakistan, and militarised and weaponised, without taking Kashmiris into account\".",
      "Such wartime borders aren't unique to South Asia. Sumantra Bose, professor of international and comparative politics at Krea University in India and author of Kashmir at the Crossroads: Inside a 21st-Century Conflict, says the  most well-known is the 'Green Line'  - the ceasefire line of 1949 - which is the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank.",
      "Not surprisingly, the tentative calm along the LoC that had endured since the 2021 ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbours crumbled easily after the latest hostilities.",
      "\"The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,\" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC.",
      "Violence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002.",
      "The 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013.",
      "Between 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. A renewed ceasefire in February 2021 led to an immediate and sustained drop in violations through to March 2025.",
      "\"During periods of intense cross-border firing we've seen border populations in the many thousands be displaced for months on end,\" says Mr Krishna. Between late September and early December 2016, more than 27,000 people were displaced from border areas due to ceasefire violations and cross-border firing.",
      "It's looking increasingly hairy and uncertain now.",
      "Tensions flared after the Pahalgam attack, with India suspending the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Pakistan responded by threatening to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, which formalised the LoC - though it hasn't followed through yet.",
      "\"This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,\" says Mr Krishna.",
      "Mr Jacob says for some \"curious reason\", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries.",
      "\"It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,\" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics.",
      "Mr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas.",
      "He argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics.",
      "The hostilities are often initiated by field commanders - sometimes with, but often without, central approval. He also challenges the notion that the Pakistan Army alone drives the violations, pointing instead to a complex mix of local military imperatives and autonomy granted to border forces on both sides.",
      "Some experts believe It's time to revisit an idea shelved nearly two decades ago: turning the LoC into a formal, internationally recognised border. Others insist that possibility was never realistic - and still isn't.",
      "\"The idea is completely infeasible, a dead end. For decades, Indian maps have shown the entire territory of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India,\" Sumantra Bose told the BBC.",
      "\"For Pakistan, making the LoC part of the International Border would mean settling the Kashmir dispute - which is Pakistan's equivalent of the Holy Grail - on India's preferred terms. Every Pakistani government and leader, civilian or military, over the past seven decades has rejected this.\"",
      "In his 2003 book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, Prof Bose writes: \"A Kashmir settlement necessitates that the LoC be transformed - from an iron curtain of barbed wire, bunkers, trenches and hostile militaries to a linen curtain. Realpolitik dictates that the border will be permanent (albeit probably under a different name), but it must be transcended without being abolished.\"",
      "\"I stressed, though, that such a transformation of the LoC must be embedded in a broader Kashmir settlement, as one pillar of a multi-pillared settlement,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Between 2004 and 2007, turning the LoC into a soft border was central to a fledgling India-Pakistan peace process on Kashmir - a process that ultimately fell apart.",
      "Today, the border has reignited, bringing back the cycle of violence and uncertainty for those who live in its shadow.",
      "\"You never know what will happen next. No one wants to sleep facing the Line of Control tonight,\" an employee of a hotel in Pakistan-administered Kashmir told BBC Urdu during the recent hostilities.",
      "It was a quiet reminder of how fragile peace is when your window opens to a battlefield.",
      "How real is the risk of nuclear war between India and Pakistan?",

    "story": [
      "When a 23-year-old Mexican influencer was shot dead while live streaming on TikTok, rumours began to swirl. Was it a cartel hit? Or another tragic example of violence against women?",
      "On Tuesday, Valeria Marquez was shot dead at Blossom The Beauty Lounge, a beauty salon owned by the victim in Zapopan, a town in the central-eastern state of Jalisco.",
      "The state prosecutor's office said it is investigating the crime as a femicide, meaning that it believes the crime was motivated by the fact the victim was a woman.",
      "The president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, said an investigation is under way: \"We're working to catch those responsible and find out why this happened.\"",
      "But the fact that the crime took place in Jalisco, the state where the feared Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (CJNG) emerged, led to speculation by some that the cartel may somehow be involved.",
      "A rising star",
      "Ms Marquez was a Mexican model who began to make a name for herself in 2021 after winning the Miss Rostro (Miss Face) beauty pageant, according to Mexican media reports.",
      "Shortly thereafter, she began creating content on social media. She would share makeup tips and personal care routines, talk about fashion and show off her travels.",
      "Photos of her on private jets and yachts can be seen on her Instagram account, which had more than 223,000 followers at the time of her death.",
      "Ms Marquez also had another 100,000 followers on TikTok.",
      "Although it is unclear exactly what happened, during her final livestream, Ms Marquez said she was waiting for a courier she knew to deliver a gift.",
      "She added that she was a bit worried, because her friend could not see the courier's face when he arrived.",
      "\"Why didn't he just drop it off (the gift)? Were they going to pick me up (kidnap me) or what?\" she wondered aloud to her followers.",
      "While holding a pink stuffed animal, Ms Marquez looked away from the camera and immediately grabbed her chest and belly before collapsing into her chair.",
      "Another woman then took the phone and ended the livestream.",
      "Police arrived at the scene around 18:30 local time (12:30 GMT) and confirmed Ms Marquez's death, according to the state prosecutor.",
      "Authorities say that at least two men on motorcycles arrived at the salon and one of them asked the victim if she was Valeria. When she replied \"yes,\" he pulled out a gun and shot her at least twice before fleeing.",

While the presence of private security and the tidyness of its streets give the impression that Zapopan is a safe area, in reality it is one of the most violent municipalities in Jalisco. In fact, shootings regularly occur in the area's luxurious shopping centres.",
      "More than half of the real estate and commercial development in the area is connected to the laundering of drug trafficking money, according to the US Department of Justice.",

      "It is also one of the Mexican states most affected by the cartels. It was here, 50 kilometres from Zapopan, that a cartel training centre was found in March, and it is here that 15,000 people have disappeared since 2018.",
      "The same day that M\u00e1rquez was killed, a former congressman named Luis Armando C\u00f3rdoba D\u00edaz was murdered just two kilometres away, according to the newspaper Reforma.",
      "According to the state of Jalisco, as many as 90% of crimes are never reported or investigated. The state attorney's office has also long been accused of having links to cartels, which it denies.",
      "The prosecutor's office said that so far they have no reason to suspect that Ms Marquez's murder was ordered or carried out by any of the organised criminal groups operating in the area.",
      "Instead, the office suggested the murderer may have been motivated to kill her because of her gender.",
      "Mexican media outlets had previously published messages in which Ms Marquez blamed her ex-partner if anything happened to her.",
      "Mayor of Zapopan Juan Jos\u00e9 Frangie said his office had no record of Ms Marquez requesting help from the authorities due to threats against her, adding \"a femicide is the worst thing\", according to news agency AFP.",
      "\"In response to claims pointing to alleged perpetrators of the femicide in Zapopan, we clarify that there are no direct accusations against any individual in the investigation file,\" the Jalisco prosecutor's office said in a statement.",

      "The plan to evacuate children was first unveiled during a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Jordan's King Abdullah in February.",
      "Jordan's stated aim is to bring 2,000 sick children to the kingdom for treatment. So far only 33 have been evacuated to Jordan, each travelling with a parent or guardian.",
      "Jordanian sources say Israel has delayed and imposed restrictions and this - along with the resumption of the war - has impeded the evacuation process. Sick Gazans have also been evacuated to other countries via Israel.",
      "We put the Jordanian concerns to the Israeli government organisation responsible -  Cogat (Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories) - who told us that since \"the beginning of the year, and especially in recent weeks, there has been a significant increase in the number of Gazans evacuated through Israel for medical care abroad.\"",
      "Cogat said thousands of patients and escorts had gone to countries, including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, the US and others. The statement said that \"the ongoing hostilities in the Gaza Strip pose a challenge to the implementation of these evacuation operations.\"",

      "At least one Russian soldier is injured, possibly dead after the strike.",
      "It's chilling to watch the live footage. It drives home the bloody consequences of the war that Russia started, in which hundreds of thousands have so far been killed, a \"never-ending bloodbath\" as US President Donald Trump calls it.",
      "We are in a rural house converted into a command centre for the 155th mechanised brigade of the Ukrainian army. It's a few miles from front-line artillery positions.",
      "The scale of the devastation that we see on the screens, homes and buildings completely flattened, is far greater than what we saw six months ago.",
      "It is evidence of the fierce battle that has been fought over the past several months to defend Pokrovsk, a crucial transport hub in the Donetsk region.",
      "This week, there's cautious optimism, even among sceptical soldiers who have witnessed hopes of a ceasefire being dashed over and over again, as diplomatic efforts from the US, Europe, Turkey and others have pushed Russia and Ukraine to direct talks for the first time in three years.",
      "\"I think something should happen since Russia was the first one to push for these talks. I mean since 2022, they have refused to go into any contact,\" says an officer who wants to be referred to with his call sign \"Kozak\".",
      "\"I want to believe this would be the beginning of the end of the war.",
      "\"But now I see, we have been successful in destroying their rear positions and their supply lines. Russia does not have the same strength and power it had at the beginning. So I think that something will happen.\"",
      "Yurii, 37, used to work in a technology company before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \"They (Russia and Ukraine) have to start talking. Us soldiers, we wish this war would end. But it's important to remember that we cannot stop it because we did not start it,\" he says.",
      "He looks up at the screen and spots Russian soldiers moving again. He and his colleagues calculate the co-ordinates of their positions and pass them on to their artillery unit.",
      "We drive from the command centre to the artillery position, on mud tracks running through a wide expanse of open fields. Clumps of mud fly in the air, our car slips and slides, as we move as fast as possible. The speed is a mitigation against strikes from drones, which have sharply increased fatalities for both Russia and Ukraine since they were deployed in large numbers in 2023.",
      "And war technology keeps evolving. Now there's a new threat \u2013 drones equipped with a real fibre optic cable which unrolls as they fly. \"We cannot detect them or neutralise them, so there are probably a lot more drones in the area right now than we know,\" says Yurii.",
      "As we drive into the artillery position hidden under trees and bushes, soldiers are already loading the gun. It's a French made self-propelled artillery gun called the \"Caesar\". Scores have been deployed in Ukraine since the start of the war, and France has been trying to ramp up production.",
      "\"I'm very impressed by its accuracy, and we can use a large range of ammunition. The most important thing is that bringing it into combat is very fast. It is much more effective than the old Soviet equipment I've used,\" says Kozak.",
      "Ukrainian soldiers fire four rounds, each one emitting a deafening sound. From around us, we also hear the sound of incoming shells. The battle rages on.",
      "\"As you can hear, there is a wave of assaults from the enemy and we need a lot of ammunition to suppress that. We hope our international partners can give us as much ammunition as possible, because if we have to start choosing priority and non-priority targets then the enemy will be successful,\" says Kozak.",
      "We ask the soldiers how they feel about suggestions that Ukraine will have to make concessions, that it might have to give up land to secure peace.",
      "\"It's painful to hear that. Even I want to go home to my family. My daughter is eight and I miss her so much. But we need to be strong. I don't believe that if we give up some territory, they will stop. In a couple of years, they will return and start over,\" says Yurii.",
      "\"A person who has not come here, who hasn't felt the consequences of Russian aggression, those armchair commentators say you can give up land and everything will be over. They will never understand how many brothers and friends we have lost. We shouldn't give up a single metre of our land,\" says Kozak.",
      "The cost Ukraine has paid to defend its land is visible everywhere, most acutely in the photos of smiling, young soldiers posted by the side of highways, on memorial walls in central city squares, and on rows and rows of freshly dug graves in the country.",
      "Yana Melnikova lovingly buys her son's favourite treats - a cup of steaming hot chocolate and a chocolate roll.",
      "Then she drives out to a cemetery in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, and places them neatly by 22-year-old Vladislav's grave. She and her daughter, 13-year-old Nicole, wipe the grave with wet tissues. Before long, they break down inconsolably into each other's arms.",
      "Vladislav was a drone operator with the Ukrainian military. He was killed in combat in a Russian strike on 21 February this year.",
      "For Yana, news of direct talks resuming bring no hope.",
      "\"It seems to me that this war is eternal. Of course, I hope they will find a solution. Because people are dying here and there (in Russia). But Putin is greedy. His hunger for our land is insatiable,\" says Yana.",

      "The Israeli government suspended food and medicine deliveries into Gaza in March.",
      "Ministers said the move, which has been condemned by UN, European and Middle Eastern leaders, was intended to put pressure on Hamas to release its remaining hostages. Israel also accused Hamas of stealing aid \u2013 an allegation the group has denied.",
      "The UN has said the blockade has caused severe shortages of food, medicines and fuel, and an assessment on Monday warned that Gaza's population of around 2.1 million people was at \"critical risk\" of famine.",
      "The US confirmed last week that it was preparing a new system for providing aid from a series of hubs inside Gaza, which would be run by private companies and protected by security contractors and Israeli forces.",
      "Images analysed by BBC Verify show that land has already been cleared, with new roads and staging areas constructed at a number of locations in southern and central Gaza in recent weeks.",
      "Israel has not publicly said where the hubs will be, but humanitarian sources - briefed previously by Israeli officials - told BBC Verify that at least four centres will be built in the southern section of Gaza and one further north near the Netzarim Corridor, a strip of land controlled by the military that effectively divides the territory.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation - an organisation set up to support the plan - initially said food, water and hygiene kits would be supplied to 1.2 million people, less than 60% of the population.",
      "On Wednesday it announced it would start operations before the end of May, and appeared to call for Israel to allow aid through normal channels until its distribution centres were fully operational. It also called for aid hubs to be built in northern Gaza, something not envisaged under the original plan and which had led to criticism that people would be forced to move south.",
      "UN agencies have insisted they will not co-operate with the plan - which is in line with one previously approved by Israel's government - saying it contradicted fundamental humanitarian principles.",
      "A spokesperson for the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) accused Israel of seeking to use \"food and fuel as leverage, as part of a military strategy\".",
      "\"All aid would be channelled through a handful of militarised hubs,\" Olga Cherevko told BBC Verify.",
      "\"That kind of arrangement would cut off vast areas of Gaza \u2013 particularly the most vulnerable, who can't move easily, or are otherwise marginalised \u2013 from any help at all.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Bushra Khalidi of Oxfam described the new plan as a \"farce\".",
      "\"No logistical solution is going to address Israel's strategy of forcible displacement and using starvation as a weapon of war. Lift the siege, open the crossings and let us do our job.\"",
      "It is understood that the proposed new system has not yet had final sign-off from the Israeli government.",
      "'Secure distribution sites'",
      "BBC Verify used satellite imagery to identify four potential sites based on the limited available information about their locations.",
      "The sites are similar in size, shape and design to existing open-air distribution sites inside Gaza, such as at Erez, Erez West and Kisufim. The largest site we've looked at is bigger - more comparable to the area inside Gaza at Kerem Shalom crossing.",
      "Our analysis of the imagery shows significant development at one of the sites in south-west Gaza, close to the ruins of a village that is now an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) base.",
      "Satellite photos since early April show the construction of a road there and a large staging area, surrounded by berms - large defensive barriers made of piled sand or earth - about 650m (2,130ft) from the border with Egypt.",
      "A high-resolution image captured on 8 May shows bulldozers and excavators working on a section of land spanning about 20 acres (8 hectares). IDF armoured vehicles are at a fortified building nearby.",
      "A photo taken on site, geolocated by BBC Verify, also shows lighting being installed on the perimeter.",
      "Further imagery from 11 and 12 May shows this, along with three other sites, continuing to expand. One site is about half a kilometre from a collection of eight UN warehouses, and 280m from another large warehouse.",
      "Stu Ray - a senior imagery analyst with McKenzie Intelligence - agreed the sites were likely to be secure distribution centres. He noted that some of the facilities are in \"close proximity to IDF Forward Operating Bases which ties in with the IDF wishing to have some control over the sites\".",
      "Analysts with another intelligence firm, Maiar, said the facilities appeared to be designed with separate entrances for trucks to move in and out, and with other gaps in the berms that would be suitable for pedestrian entrances.",
      "The IDF did not comment on the potential aid centres when approached by BBC Verify, but said that its operations in Gaza were carried out \"in accordance with international law\".  Cogat - the Israeli body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza - did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "This is an Israeli military zone that runs across the Gaza Strip and separates the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah.",
      "Since the IDF established a security zone there in early April, a six-mile (10km) road has been built covering two thirds of the width of Gaza, bordered by defensive berms and dotted with IDF outposts.",
      "This new road leads directly to one of the development sites visible in satellite imagery, and a pre-existing road connects it to two more.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v5r1erdpgo",
    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 23:48:46 GMT",
    "summary": "As one of 25 member groups on the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited, say experts.",
    "story": [
      "Last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1bn (\u00a3756m) bailout to Pakistan \u2013 a move that drew sharp disapproval from India as military hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared, before a US-led ceasefire was unexpectedly declared.",
      "Despite India's protests, the IMF board approved the second instalment of a $7bn loan, saying Islamabad had demonstrated strong programme implementation leading to a continuing economic recovery in Pakistan.",
      "It also said the fund would continue to support Pakistan's efforts in building economic resilience to \"climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters\", providing further access of around $1.4bn in funding in the future.",
      "In a strongly worded statement India raised concerns over the decision, citing two reasons.",
      "Delhi questioned the \"efficacy\" of such bailouts or the lack thereof, given Pakistan's \"poor track record\" in implementing reform measures. But more importantly it flagged the possibility of these funds being used for \"state-sponsored cross-border terrorism\" \u2013 a charge Islamabad has repeatedly denied - and said the IMF was exposing itself and its donors to \"reputational risks\" and making a \"mockery of global values\".",
      "The IMF did not respond to the BBC's request for a comment on the Indian stance.",
      "Even Pakistani experts argue that there's some merit to Delhi's first argument. Pakistan has been prone to persistently seeking the IMF's help \u2013 getting bailed out 24 times since 1958 \u2013 without undertaking meaningful reforms to improve public governance.",
      "\"Going to the IMF is like going to the ICU [intensive care unit]. If a patient goes 24 or 25 times to the ICU then there are structural challenges and concerns that need to be dealt with,\" Hussain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, told the BBC.",
      "But addressing Delhi's other concerns \u2013 that the IMF was \"rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism\" thereby sending a \"dangerous message to the global community\" \u2013 is far more complex, and perhaps explains why India wasn't able to exert pressure to stall the bailout.",
      "India's decision to try to prevent the next tranche of the bailout to Islamabad was more about optics then, rather than a desire for any tangible outcome, say experts. As per the country's own observations, the fund had limited ability to do something about the loan, and was \"circumscribed by procedural and technical formalities\".",
      "As one of the 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited. It represents a four-country group including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Pakistan is part of the Central Asia group, represented by Iran.",
      "Unlike the United Nations' one-country-one-vote system, the voting rights of IMF board members are based on a country's economic size and its contributions \u2013 a system which has increasingly faced criticism for favouring richer Western countries over developing economies.",
      "For example, the US has the biggest voting share - at 16.49% - while India holds just 2.6%. Besides, IMF rules do not allow for a vote against a proposal - board members can either vote in favour or abstain \u2013 and the decisions are made by consensus on the board.",
      "\"This shows how vested interests of powerful countries can influence decisions,\" an economist who didn't want to speak on the record told the BBC.",
      "Addressing this imbalance was a key proposal in the reforms mooted for the IMF and other multilateral lenders during India's G20 presidency in 2023.",
      "In their report, former Indian bureaucrat NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers recommended breaking the link between IMF voting rights and financial contributions to ensure fairer representation for both the \"Global North\" and the \"Global South\". But there has been no progress so far on implementing these recommendations.",
      "Furthermore, recent changes in the IMF's own rules about funding countries in conflict add more complexity to the issue. A $15.6bn loan by the fund to Ukraine in 2023 was the first of its kind by the IMF to a country at war.",
      "\"It bent its own rules to give an enormous lending package to Ukraine - which means it cannot use that excuse to shut down an already-arranged loan to Pakistan,\" Mihir Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) think tank in Delhi told the BBC.",
      "If India really wants to address its grievances,  the right forum to present them would be the United Nations FATF (Financial Action Task Force), says Mr Haqqani.",
      "The FATF looks at issues of combating terror finance and decides whether countries need to be placed on grey or black lists that prevent them from accessing funds from bodies like the IMF or the World Bank.",
      "\"Grandstanding at the IMF cannot and did not work,\" said Mr Haqqani. \"If a country is on that [FATF] list it will then face challenges in getting a loan from the IMF \u2013 as has happened with Pakistan earlier.\"",
      "As things stand though, Pakistan was officially removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2022.",
      "Separately, experts also caution that India's calls to overhaul the IMF's funding processes and veto powers could be a double-edged sword.",
      "Such reforms \"would inevitably give Beijing [rather than Delhi] more power\", said Mr Sharma.",
      "Mr Haqqani agrees. India should be wary of using \"bilateral disputes at multilateral fora\", he said, adding that India has historically been at the receiving end of being vetoed out by China in such places.",
      "He points to instances of Beijing blocking ADB (Asian Development Bank) loans sought by India for the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, citing border disputes between the two countries in the region.",

    "story": [
      "Ulrich Janse van Vuuren has made it his passion to share and showcase some of South Africa's best features with his legion of social media followers.",
      "The 38-year-old white South African often takes snapshots capturing scenes such as a cold Johannesburg morning, the purple Jacaranda trees famously associated with Pretoria or Cape Town's popular beachfronts.",
      "\"Promoting South Africa is something I am passionate about - I have no intention of taking up [US President Donald Trump's] offer because South Africa is my home,\" the proud Afrikaner tells the BBC, days after a small group of his fellow white compatriots left South Africa for their new life as refugees in the US.",
      "The US president, and his South-Africa born ally Elon Musk, says that white Afrikaners are being persecuted in their home country, and that they are being subjected to a \"genocide\".",
      "This is a claim that has been circulating for many years even though it has been widely discredited.",
      "Although some white farmers have been attacked and killed, South Africa has one of the world's highest murder rates, so this is an issue that affects all of its citizens, whatever their race.",
      "\"For me, South Africa is home. It's a place where my roots and heritage are, where I can contribute to the story of our nation and make a meaningful impact,\" said Mr Janse van Vuuren, who has more than one million followers on social media.",
      "\"I'm deeply invested in South Africa's success and I am proud to be part of its journey.\"",
      "And while he wished those who have taken up Trump's offer all the best in the US and urged them to \"not look back\", he insisted that none of them were refugees, but rather \"opportunists\".",
      "\"They've enjoyed more than their share of South Africa's resources and privileges, and none are fleeing racial persecution,\" he said.",
      "Thirty years after the end of the racist system of apartheid, average living standards among South Africa's white community remain far higher than for the black majority.",
      "Mr Janse van Vuuren said that the debate about the status of Afrikaners in South Africa had only served to make him \"more determined than ever to step up and contribute to South Africa in every way I can\".",
      "Four centuries after the first group of Dutch settlers arrived in what is now South Africa, most Afrikaners regard themselves as fully African \u2013 as seen in the name \u2013 and no longer identify with their European roots.",
      "But many are unhappy both with the high crime rate and the government's policies aimed at reducing economic inequality in the country \u2013 especially a law passed earlier this year that allowed the government to seize land without compensation \"when it is just and equitable and in the public interest\". White South Africans are 7% of the country's population, but own half of its farmland.",
      "Some Afrikaners are farmers and see the law as being aimed at them.",
      "Trump said the legislation prompted him to offer to help resettle \"Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination\".",
      "The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics.",
      "But despite numerous claims in the past of the systematic targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority group, local crime statistics figures paint a different picture.",
      "South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.",
      "On Monday, the first group of 59 Afrikaners granted refugee status arrived at the Dulles airport near Washington DC after choosing to leave their home country.",
      "The arrival of the group drew dismay and outrage across South Africa, as the country's civil society and leadership sought to dispel the claims that the white minority was being persecuted.",
      "\"They are leaving because they don't want to embrace the changes that are taking place in our country and our constitution,\" said South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.",
      "He later labelled their move a \"cowardly act\" as he addressed farmers at a convention held in the Free State province.",

      "Ms Steenkamp, 47, and her husband, both Afrikaners, were commercial farmers but said they had lost their land recently after it was invaded by people who \"took over the whole farm\" just as they were about to sell it in order to \"downscale\".",

      "The people who invaded destroyed critical infrastructure, making it impossible to sell, she said.",
      "Despite efforts to have them removed through the courts, Ms Steenkamp said they were forced to abandon the land as it was repossessed by the bank.",
      "Ms Steenkamp said that while she and her family were familiar with South Africa's high crime levels and often tried to \"not let it get us under\", this latest attack \"was the straw that broke the camel's back\".",
      "Even though her family were eager to embrace Trump's offer when it was first announced, the mother-of-three told the BBC that the decision to leave \"was very difficult because you're... leaving a whole way of life\".",
      "Asked whether it was unfair that Afrikaners were being granted refugee status at a time when the US was cracking down on refugees and asylum seekers from everywhere else in the world, Ms Steenkamp said she \"completely disagreed\".",
      "She pointed to assaults on farmers, saying there was a \"hatred that seems to go with these attacks\".",
      "\"Any farmer that has gone through that [kind of] attack and is now wanting to flee, I think should be treated as a refugee because they are fleeing from a government that will not even admit that these things are happening,\" she said.",

      "Rather, he speculated that it may be those who have been victims of a crime and \"could define their existence as an unsecure one\".",

      "While you're at home watching the introductory videos known as postcards, dozens of people swarm the stage, setting the scene for whatever comes next.",
      "\"We call it the Formula 1 tyre change,\" says Richard van Rouwendaal, the affable  Dutch stage manager who makes it all work.",
      "\"Each person in the crew can only do one thing. You run on stage with one light bulb or one prop. You always walk on the same line. If you go off course, you will hit somebody.",
      "\"It's a bit like ice skating.\"",
      "The stage crew start rehearsing their \"F1 tyre change\" weeks before the contestants even arrive.",
      "Every country sends detailed plans of their staging, and Eurovision hires stand-ins to play the acts (in Liverpool 2023, it was pupils from the local performing arts school), while stagehands start shaving precious seconds off the changeovers.",
      "\"We have about two weeks,\" says Van Rouwendaal, who's normally based in Utrecht but is in Basel for this year's contest.",
      "\"My company is around 13 Dutchies and 30 local guys and girls, who rock it in Switzerland.",
      "\"In those two weeks, I have to figure out who's right for each job. Someone's good at running, someone's good at lifting, someone's good at organising the backstage area. It is a bit like being good at Tetris because you have to line everything up in a small space, in the perfect way.\"",
      "As soon as a song finishes, the team are ready to roll.",
      "As well as the stagehands, there are people responsible for positioning lights and setting pyrotechnics; and 10 cleaners who sweep the stage with mops and vacuum cleaners between every performance.",
      "\"My cleaners are just as important as the stage crew. You need a clean stage for the dancers  - but also, if there's an overhead shot of somebody lying down, you don't want to see shoeprints on the floor.\"",
      "The attention to detail is clinical. Backstage, every performer has their own microphone stand, set to the correct height and angle, to make sure every  performance is camera perfect.",
      "\"Sometimes the delegation will say the artist wants to wear a different shoe for the grand final,\" says Van Rouwendaal. \"But if that happens, the mic stand is at the wrong height, so we've got a problem!\"",
      "Spontaneously changing footwear isn't the worst problem he's faced, though. At the 2022 contest in Turin, the stage was 10m (33ft) higher than the backstage area.",
      "As a result, they were pushing heavy stage props \u2013 including a mechanical bull \u2013 up a steep ramp between every act.",
      "\"We were exhausted every night,\" he recalls. \"This year is better. We've even got an extra backstage tent where we prepare the props.\"",
      "Props are a huge part of Eurovision. The tradition started at the second ever contest in 1957, when Germany's Margot Hielscher sang part of her song Telefon, Telefon into (you guessed it) a telephone.",
      "Over the intervening decades, the staging has become ever more elaborate. In 2014, Ukraine's Mariya Yaremchuk trapped one of her dancers in a giant hamster wheel, while Romania brought a literal cannon to their performance in 2017.",

      "\"It's choreographed to the nearest millimetre,\" he says. \"We're not invisible, but we have to be invisible.\"",
      "What if it all goes wrong?",
      "There are certain tricks the audience will never notice, Van Rouwendaal reveals.",

      "A visual glitch isn't enough to trigger the back-up tape, however - as Switzerland's Zo\u00eb M\u00eb discovered at Tuesday's first semi-final.",
      "Her performance was briefly interrupted when the feed from an on-stage camera froze, but producers simply cut to a wide shot until it was fixed. (If it had happened in the final, she'd have been offered the chance to perform again.)",
      "\"There's actually lots of measures that are being taken to make sure that every act can be shown in the best way,\" says Reist.",
      "\"There are people who know the regulations by heart, who have been playing through what could happen and what we would do in various different situations.",
      "\"I'll be sitting next to our head of production, and if there's [a situation] where somebody has to run, maybe that's going to be me!\"",
      "It's no surprise to learn that staging a live three-hour broadcast with thousands of moving parts is incredibly stressful.",
      "This year, organisers have introduced measures to protect the welfare of contestants and crew, including closed-door rehearsals, longer breaks between shows, and the creation of a \"disconnected zone\" where cameras are banned.",
      "Even so, Reist says she has worked every weekend for the past two months, while Van Rouwendaal and his team are regularly pulling 20-hour days.",
      "The shifts are so long that, back in 2008, Eurovision production legend Ola Melzig  built a bunker under the stage, complete with a sofa, a \"sadly underused\" PS3 and two (yes, two) espresso machines.",
      "\"I don't have hidden luxuries like Ola. I'm not at that level yet!\" laughs Van Rouwendaal",
      "\"But backstage, I've got a spot with my crew. We've got stroopwafels there and, last week, it was King's Day in Holland, so I baked pancakes for everyone.",
      "\"I try to make it fun. Sometimes we go out and have a drink and cheer because we had a great day.",
      "\"Yes, we have to be on top, and we have to be sharp as a knife, but having fun together is also very important.\"",

      "They were found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996, and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.",

      "The issue was put to Los Angeles County superior court Judge Michael Jesic on 13 May, who agreed.",

      "What happened at the resentencing hearing?",
      "During the hearing, family members and a former fellow inmate were among those who testified in support of the resentencing.",
      "People who worked with the brothers in prison spoke about the educational courses they had completed, and described a hospice initiative they created for the elderly and sick.",
      "The district attorney's office, which fiercely opposes a lower sentence, said the brothers have continued to \"make excuses\" for their conduct instead of taking full responsibility and were not rehabilitated.",

      "What did the Menendez brothers do?",
      "Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, on 20 August 1989 at their home in Beverly Hills.",
      "Their father, a 45-year-old Hollywood executive, was shot six times with a shotgun the brothers had purchased days before the attack.",

      "The brothers claimed they committed the murders in self defence after years of alleged physical, emotional and sexual abuse, although no molestation was ever proven in court.",
      "They said they feared their father would kill them after they threatened to expose him.",
      "However, prosecutors argued that the young men had killed their successful parents to inherit their multi-million-dollar estate.",
      "What happened during the original Menendez trials?",
      "The brothers were taken into custody in 1990, and in 1993 they were tried for the murders, first individually, with one jury for each brother.",
      "However, both juries were deadlocked in 1994, resulting in a mistrial, and the pair were later tried again together in 1995.",
      "During their joint trial the judge excluded apparent evidence of abuse from their defence case. Taped sessions with a doctor, in which the killings were discussed, were ruled admissible in court by the judge.",
      "A jury found them guilty and the pair were convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996.",
      "The brothers, who were separated during their detention after a detective who investigated the slayings said they may conspire to escape if housed together, reunited in jail in 2018.",
      "What impact has the Netflix drama had on the case?",
      "The case was thrust back into the spotlight after Netflix released a drama series about the brothers in September 2024.",
      "Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, shot to the top of the platform's streaming chart and was reported to have had more than 12 million views in the first weekend after release alone.",
      "The programme explores what might have led the siblings to kill their parents and presents the murders from different perspectives.",
      "Its creators said the series was based on extensive research.",
      "It includes the brothers' claims of abuse as well as showing things from the parents' point of view.",
      "The show introduced the case to a new generation and garnered attention from celebrities - including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O'Donnell - who called for the brothers to be released.",
      "The series was a follow-up to the controversial first Monsters series about US serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.",
      "What have the Menendez brothers said about the Netflix series?",

      "Members of the family also spoke out and said the brothers had been \"victimised by this grotesque shockadrama,\" and the show was \"riddled with mistruths\".",
      "Ryan Murphy, who created the show, told Variety that the comments were \"predictable at best\".",
      "He added that the family's response was \"interesting because I would like specifics about what they think is shocking or not shocking. It's not like we're making any of this stuff up. It's all been presented before\".",

    "summary": "Legendary India batter Virat Kohli announced retirement from international Test cricket on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Virat Kohli's retirement from Tests has left Indian cricket beleaguered and the sporting world gasping in surprise.",
      "Coming on the heels of captain Rohit Sharma quitting a few days earlier, it adds up to a double whammy for India who embark on a tough tour of England for a five-Test series come June without their two most experienced batters.",
      "Like Sharma, Kohli took to Instagram, where he commands more than 270 million followers, to make his retirement public.",
      "\"As I step away from this format, it's not easy \u2013 but it feels right\u2026'' he explained to his disconsolate fans.",
      "Tributes for Kohli have come in a deluge since: from fellow cricketers, past and present, old and young, and also legends from other disciplines like tennis ace Novak Djokovic and football star Harry Kane, which highlights the sweep and heft of Kohli's global appeal.",
      "Leading India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in 2008, Kohli was fast tracked into international cricket by the then-chairman of selectors, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar, against the judgement of others in the cricket establishment.",
      "\"Many in the Indian cricket board felt he was too young but he was scoring heavily in domestic cricket, and the hunger to succeed was palpable in him,\" recalls Vengsarkar.",
      "An example of Kohli's obsessive passion for the sport comes imbued with poignancy. Kohli was playing his second Ranji Trophy match for Delhi. His father passed away suddenly with his team in a crisis. After the funeral, he went back and scored a battling 90.",
      "Vengsarkar's approving eye earned Kohli an ODI debut in 2009. At 23, he was the youngest member of India's 2011 ODI World Cup winning team under MS Dhoni. A few weeks later, he made his Test debut in the West Indies. Some months on, during the disastrous tour of Australia with his place under threat, Kohli made a gritty maiden century and never looked back. Within a couple of years he established himself as the pre-eminent batter of his generation.",
      "Brash and provocative, without a benign muscle in his body, he was as volatile as potassium on water in his early years. He was unafraid to take on the most reputed opponents, often indulging in on-field fracases that sometimes earned him criticism.",
      "Happily, this was not to become his defining identity in cricket. Prolific run-getting in dashing style across formats provided another more compelling dimension and was to take him to the pinnacle.",
      "When his idol Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013, Kohli, allying unbridled ambition with his abundant skills, grabbed the baton hungrily and went on to sketch one of the most stellar careers in cricket history.",
      "He wielded the bat like a Jedi, with great skill and telling thrust to slay opponents, as it were. Coupled with his high-octane persona, his scintillating batting made him a cult hero whose very presence ensured blockbuster box-office returns everywhere he played.",
      "Kohli always wore his passion on his sleeve. He was always demonstrative and dramatic on the field but over a period of time, misplaced angst was sublimated into a raging inner pursuit of excellence that took him to dizzying heights.",
      "Marriage to film star Anushka Sharma made them the country's foremost power couple, putting both under the glare of even more intense spotlight.",
      "Metaphorically, Kohli's outstanding exploits, especially in the first decade of his career, epitomised the emerging India of the 21st century: unabashedly, unrelentingly ambitious, discarding all past demons, willing to take on the best in the world.",
      "His achievements across formats are monumental.",
      "In ODIs, he is third in run aggregate behind Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakarra, but boasts the best average (57.88) among batters who have played more than 100 games. His ability to win ODI matches in the most daunting run chases is the stuff of folklore, many of his record 51 centuries coming in such pursuit.",
      "In T20s, his run aggregate and centuries don't put him in the top five, but he's immortalised himself with incredible knocks, notably 82 not out in an emotion-charged, pulsating match against arch-rivals Pakistan in the 2022 World Cup and a vital 76 in the 2024 final against South Africa, which helped India win the title.",
      "He is also the highest run scorer in the history of the Indian Premier League.",
      "At one point, Kohli averaged 50-plus in all three formats, making him the most productive and versatile batter of his era - way ahead of contemporaries Joe Root, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith. The four were locked in a fascinating, long-running race for batting supremacy.",
      "When it appeared he would break all batting records, Kohli's career took an inexplicable downturn. From the start of the pandemic, the flow of runs began to ebb and centuries became a trickle. In his pomp \u2013 between 2014 and 2019 \u2013 he had been unstoppable, at one time scoring six double centuries in just 18 months.",
      "The drought of runs hit him most adversely in Test cricket where his average, from a high of 55-plus in 2019 slumped to the current 46.75. In this period, Kohli also lost the captaincy, though his stellar standing in international cricket remained untouched.",
      "Kohli finishes his Test career with 9,230 runs, which puts him 19th overall in aggregate, and fourth among Indians behind Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar, all of whom finished with a 50-plus average and more centuries. But to judge him only on this yardstick would diminish the massive impact he has had on this format .",
      "As captain, Kohli easily hurdles over Gavaskar, Tendulkar and Dravid. In Test cricket, winning 40 of the 68 matches he led in, making him the fourth most successful in the format. In the Indian context, this assumes Himalayan proportions.",
      "Former Australia captain Greg Chappell says that Kohli's energy, grit, sense of purpose and aura was \"transformative\" for Indian cricket. Chappell marks him out as the most influential Indian captain, ahead of even Sourav Ganguly and M S Dhoni.",
      "Former India captain and chief coach Ravi Shastri, who collaborated with Kohli for years, gives first-hand perspective.",
      "\"Kohli made India into a fighting unit, especially when playing overseas,\" says Shastri.",
      "The lack of ICC and IPL titles according to Shastri, is misleading as an index to his  captaincy ability.",
      "\"He always played to win, sought and nurtured fast bowlers to win overseas, demanded high intent and supreme fitness from all players, putting himself in the forefront, not as a backseat driver.\"",
      "For seven years when Kohli and Shastri collaborated, India were in the top three in ICC rankings in all formats almost continuously which is unprecedented.",
      "The most cherished and significant triumph of  this period came in 2018 when India beat Australia in its own backyard in a Test series for the first time ever.",
      "Australia is where Kohli had launched himself into batting greatness, scoring 692 runs in four Tests in 2014-15. In 2018, he contributed as captain and batter to break an hitherto unassailable psychological barrier. In 2020 touring Australia, Kohli played only one match (which was lost) returning home for the birth of his child. But India, having overcome the mental barrier two years earlier, went on to win the rubber in a melodramatic see-saw series.",
      "Australia was Kohli's happy hunting ground and his last visit Down Under in late 2024 grabbed worldwide attention. He began with a roar, hitting  a century in the first test at Perth. But his form fizzled out alarmingly and made only 190 runs in the five Tests.",
      "How much this contributed to his decision to retire is moot. Advancing years, the dislike of being constantly under harsh scrutiny, wanting to be close to his young family and behind the scene shenanigans that abound in Indian cricket have doubtless played a part too.",
      "Kohli ends his retirement post on Instagram enigmatically.",
      "\"I'll always look back at my Test career with a smile. #269 signing off,\" he wrote.",
      "The greatest ambassador for the five-day format in the last decade and a half had moved into the sunset.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 23:31:41 GMT",
    "summary": "William Ruto has the uncanny ability to attract numerous alternative handles, most are unflattering.",
    "story": [
      "Kenya's President William Ruto is a man of many nicknames.",
      "El Chapo, Kasongo, Hustler, Deputy Jesus and Chicken Seller are just some that he has acquired in recent years.",
      "As is often the case when people are given alternative monikers, some are affectionate but some are intended to mock, while others reflect a profound anger.",
      "A history of the president's aliases offer a window into how the perception of him has changed.",
      "Ruto has acknowledged the rechristening trend, joking recently that Kenyans are \"finishing\" him with the numerous labels.",
      "\"You have given me so many names. I had the name William Kipchirchir Samoei Ruto. You added Survivor\u2026 Zakayo... now you are at Kasongo [the title of a Congolese song about abandonment and heartbreak]. Will you stop at 10, or should I prepare for more?\" he recently asked.",
      "The crowd, at a rally in the capital, Nairobi, responded that they had even more.",
      "Before he was elected president in 2022, Ruto attracted handles that bolstered his reputation as a man of the people.",
      "Hustler - Kenyan parlance for someone eking out a living against the odds - helped portray him as someone who would prioritise the needs of the struggling folk.",
      "Chicken Seller, referring to his childhood when he hawked poultry on the roadside, resonated with many who saw his life as an epitome of their own.",
      "\"These were very positive [names]. They sold him to the public in terms of votes,\" political analyst Prof Herman Manyora told the BBC, arguing that they helped catapult him into the top job.",
      "\"Names really stick with Ruto,\" he added.",
      "But the president has been a high-profile figure in Kenyan politics for a long time, including serving as deputy president for nine years until 2022, and has never been far from controversy.",
      "Prof Manyora recalls the label Arap Mashamba \u2013 which translates as \"son of farms\" \u2013 coined just under a decade ago and relates to Ruto's ownership of vast tracts of land across the country. Concerns have been raised about how some of these have been acquired.",
      "In 2013, a court ordered Ruto to surrender a 100-acre (40-hectare) farm and compensate a farmer who had accused him of grabbing it during the 2007 post-election violence. He denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Ruto's penchant for quoting Bible verses also earned him the Deputy Jesus tag. He has also been given the name Nabii, or prophet.",
      "However, it is since his rise to the presidency that the nickname manufacturers have been working overtime \u2013 with at least a dozen being created - and they have become increasingly critical.",
      "One that has stood out is Zakayo - Swahili for the name Zaccheaus, a Biblical figure who is portrayed as a greedy tax collector who climbed a tree to see Jesus.",
      "The \u2018tax collector\u2019 president sparking Kenyan angerBBC identifies security forces who shot Kenya anti-tax protesters",
      "The \u2018tax collector\u2019 president sparking Kenyan anger",
      "BBC identifies security forces who shot Kenya anti-tax protesters",
      "Ruto's government introduced a raft of unpopular taxes and many Kenyans began to say that he had betrayed the \"hustlers\".",
      "\"He failed to deliver after becoming president,\" Prof Manyora said.",
      "The pain of paying more taxes, and a perception that the extra money will be wasted, is the focus of many conversations.",
      "Last year, young people came out onto the streets of Nairobi for weeks of protests, which turned deadly, against a fresh government proposal to raise taxes that was later dropped.",
      "The chant \"Ruto must go\" became a rallying call for the demonstrators and now Must Go has become another way to refer to the leader.",
      "The creative christeners have also focussed on the allegation that the president enjoys foreign travel.",
      "Hence the title Vasco da Ganya \u2013 a play on the name of the 15th Century Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, and the Swahili word danganya, which means \"to lie\".",
      "Africa's 'flying presidents' under fire",
      "Africa's 'flying presidents' under fire",
      "Ruto's honesty has also been called into question with Kaunda Uongoman, which mimics late Congolese musician Kanda Bongoman.",
      "The first part refers to the president's love for the Kaunda suit - a safari jacket with matching trousers \u2013 and Uongoman, which incorporates the Swahili word uongo, meaning \"lies\".",
      "But the president seems impervious to this volley of verbal attacks.",
      "Government spokesman Isaac Mwaura said the manifold nicknames \"don't raise concerns\" in the office of the president but simply \"capture how people view a person\".",
      "Ruto is \"very hands-on and doing his best to transform the economy... It's normal for any leader to have many nicknames as this signifies his various attributes and initiatives as a leader\", he told the BBC.",
      "Mwaura also argued that the government has had to raise taxes to pay for new projects, reduce the budget deficit and fix the economy.",
      "Nevertheless, when people have gone beyond inventing new names and used satire and forms of art to ridicule the president, there has been a negative reaction from officials.",
      "Some cartoons and AI-generated images, including showing the president in a casket, have been described as \"reckless\" and \"distasteful\".",
      "Some of the alleged producers of this online content have been victims of abductions. This, Prof Manyora said, should be seen as a sign of intolerance by the government.",
      "Lachon Kiplimo, a 23-year-old university student, said that while he supported the president, some of the promises he has made have been \"unrealistic\", which fuels the nicknames.",
      "He cited the use of El Chapo, referring to the former Mexican drug lord, after Ruto promised a machine that would produce a million chapatis (also known as chapo in Kenya) every day to feed schoolchildren in the capital.",
      "Mr Kiplimo however reckons that the way the president brushes off the monikers, and in fact seems to embrace them, shows how strong he is.",
      "Prof Manyora believes the young people who come up with the alternative labels for the president do it as a form of catharsis, a way of releasing tension.",
      "This view is backed up by 24-year-old student Margaret Wairimu Kahura, who said that many Kenyans \"are in a lot of pain\".",
      "She feels that the mockery is a way of letting Ruto know how the youth are feeling.",
      "She says that no other Kenyan president has been subjected to this level of lampooning, and \"so this is unique [but] in a bad way\".",
      "It is true that previous heads of state had nicknames but they have not been so numerous.",
      "The last President, Uhuru Kenyatta, was called Kamwana (\"young boy\"), Jayden (a Kenyan reference to a pampered or lazy child) and Wamashati (for his love of print shirts).",
      "His predecessor, Mwai Kibaki, was known as General Kiguoya (a general who is afraid) and Fence Sitter.",
      "Perhaps the age of social media, with its insatiable appetite for new content to keep people amused, has increased the trend towards name calling.",
      "But for many, like Ms Kahura, the volume of nicknames for Ruto are a genuine reflection of \"the different problems that people are facing\".",

    "title": "How real is the risk of nuclear war between India and Pakistan?",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e373yzndro",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 23:35:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Recent hostilities were a reminder of how easily a crisis could escalate into catastrophe.",
    "story": [
      "In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons.",
      "Yet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre.",
      "Even scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan.",
      "Six years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be.",
      "As the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral.",
      "President Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a \"nuclear conflict\". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats.",
      "\"Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,\" Modi added.",
      "India and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons.",
      "The bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US.",
      "\"India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,\" he told the BBC.",
      "One reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the \"time or money\" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a \"clear qualitative\" edge in naval nuclear capability.",
      "Since testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine.",
      "India, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions.",
      "Further ambiguity emerged in 2016, when then\u2013defence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel \"bound\" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)",
      "The absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Pakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation.",
      "In 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that \"nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India\", and would only be used if \"the very existence of Pakistan as a state\" was at stake.",
      "In his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India.",
      "Around the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official issuing a stark warning to India: \"I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surprise\u2026 You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region.\"",
      "During the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not \"hesitate to use any weapon\" to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment.",
      "But there is scepticism on both sides over such claims.",
      "Former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan \"knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory\" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts.",
      "\"Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,\" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC.",
      "But nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. \"This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,\" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC.",
      "In March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the \"accidental firing of a missile\".)",
      "Yet, the danger of nuclear war remains \"relatively small\" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary.",
      "\"So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,\" he said.",
      "\"In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy.\" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)",
      "Sumit Ganguly, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, believes that \"neither India nor Pakistan wants to be labelled as the first violator of the post-Hiroshima nuclear taboo\".",
      "\"Furthermore, any side that resorts to the use of nuclear weapons would face substantial retaliation and suffer unacceptable casualties,\" Mr Ganguly told the BBC.",
      "At the same time, both India and Pakistan appear to be beefing up their nuclear arsenal.",
      "With new delivery systems in development, four plutonium reactors and expanding uranium enrichment, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could reach around 200 warheads by the late 2020s, according to The Nuclear Notebook, researched by the Federation of American Scientists' Nuclear Information Project.",
      "And as of early 2023, India was estimated to have about 680kg of weapons-grade plutonium - enough for roughly 130-210 nuclear warheads, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials.",
      "Despite repeated crises and close calls, both sides have so far managed to avoid a catastrophic slide into nuclear conflict. \"The deterrent is still holding. All Pakistanis did was to respond to conventional strikes with counter-conventional strikes of their own,\" writes Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst.",
      "Yet, the presence of nuclear weapons injects a constant undercurrent of risk - one that can never be entirely ruled out, no matter how experienced the leadership or how restrained the intentions.",
      "\"When nuclear weapons can be involved, there is always an unacceptable level of danger,\"John Erath, senior policy director at the non-profit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told the BBC.",
      "\"The Indian and Pakistani governments have navigated these situations in the past, so the risk is small.  But with nuclear weapons, even a small risk is too large.\""

      "Ventura is a critical witness in the prosecution's case against Combs, who has been accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and exploiting women for decades until his\u00a0arrest\u00a0on multiple charges last September. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The music mogul could receive a lifetime prison sentence if convicted on all of them.",

      "Violence occurred \"frequently\"",
      "In her initial statements before the court, Ventura, now pregnant with her third child and married to personal trainer Alex Fine, recalled her and Combs' early interactions and how she started to see a different side of him over time. She said she met Combs when she was a newly signed singer at 19, and their burgeoning friendship became romantic two years later.",
      "She also described his alleged violence throughout their 10-year on-off relationship, recounting instances where he knocked her over, kicked and dragged her, and stomped on her head, causing black eyes and bruises on her body. When asked, Ventura said the abuse she endured happened \"frequently.\"",

      "\"Control was everything \u2014 from the way that I looked, to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to,\" she said. \"Control was an all-around thing to a certain point.\"",
      "Combs allegedly introduced Ventura to \"freak offs,\" drug-fueled events where he is accused of forcing women to perform sex acts with hired sex workers, which were a focus of the indictment outlining his alleged crimes.",
      "Ventura said Combs broached the idea of sexual encounters involving voyeurism during the first year of their relationship, and he would hire an escort or dancer with whom he would watch her engage while he directed them. The singer testified she felt confused and nervous, \"but I also loved him very much and wanted to make him happy.\"",
      "She testified she worried about making Combs angry because of how much control he had over her life and career, and the possibility that he could blackmail her by releasing images of the \"freak offs.\" Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Combs often recorded these performances with or without participants' consent.",
      "A shift in the relationship",
      "Ventura recalled Combs looking out for her when she first met him. They fell in love, she said, while spending time together in the studio or traveling elsewhere.",
      "\"I think I was just enamored by him. We were just having a good time. It was really fun at this point,\" she told the court. But as her appearance, transportation, rent and overall lifestyle came under Combs' control, Ventura said her music career \u2014 and record deal \u2014 eventually took a backseat to the alleged \"freak offs,\" which left her feeling humiliated.",
      "She testified that despite recording hundreds of songs and nine albums while she was with Combs, the work was never released because \"freak offs\" became her job. They took up too much time and energy to leave room for other pursuits, Ventura said, adding that she would stay up for several days at a time to party, drink and have sex with strangers.",
      "The \"freak offs\" could last from 36 to 72 hours at a time, she said, with the longest continuing for four days. She recalled them happening almost weekly for years.",
      "Ventura felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by \"freak offs\"",
      "Ventura began to cry during her testimony when asked whether she wanted to participate in every \"freak off.\" She said she didn't and that she felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by them, but she also didn't want to disappoint Combs.",
      "Ventura told the court Combs dismissed her when she expressed how she felt about them, calling her predictable for not wanting to engage.",
      "Testifying at length about the \"freak offs,\" Ventura said Combs provided ecstasy and cocaine, which she took to stay awake during the incidents.",
      "2016 hotel incident",
      "Ventura recalled the 2016 hotel altercation seen on video footage. After being shown a clip from the incident during the second day of her testimony, she recounted that Combs was yelling and threw something at her during the attack.",
      "She said she told Combs via text message she had a black eye from the incident and reminded him of a premiere she was supposed to attend.",
      "\"You are sick for thinking it's OK to do what you've done,\" she wrote in a text to Combs. \"Please stay far away from me.\"",
      "Ventura told the court she wore sunglasses to cover her eyes and used makeup to hide bruises on other parts of her body when she attended the premiere.",
      "Prosecutors showed several photos of Ventura at the premiere event and after party, where the injuries could be seen.",
      "Drug use",
      "Combs allegedly provided stimulant drugs, like cocaine, to keep participants awake for the length of his \"freak offs,\" Ventura said. She also testified about a time when she requested ketamine, an anesthetic that has been used recreationally for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects.",
      "Prosecutors allege Combs' \"freak offs\" involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and accuse him of using substances in part to exercise control over the people he targeted.",
      "She said Combs didn't like the drug and argued a successful \"freak off\" can be remembered, but explained ketamine was her preference because it allowed her to be less present in the moment.",
      "Rape allegation",
      "Ventura told the jury that Combs raped her in her living room in 2018. They were not together at the time and Ventura was seeing the man who is now her husband, she testified. Ventura said she remembered crying and saying no, but Combs did not stop. After, he got up and left, Ventura testified.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape in a lawsuit she filed in 2023. The lawsuit was settled the day after she filed it. Combs denied the allegation.",
      "Text messages",
      "During cross-examination Thursday and Friday, the defense asked Ventura about numerous text messages she and Combs exchanged over the course of their relationship.",
      "They included affectionate messages where Ventura told Combs she loved him and saw a future with him, potentially one that involved starting a family.",
      "Other messages related to the alleged \"freak offs,\" including one exchange allegedly coordinating one of them.",
      "\"You told him you wanted to do freak offs?\" they asked Ventura at one point, to which she replied, \"No, there's a lot more to that.\"",
      "During redirect on Friday, Ventura told prosecutors there were times Combs was kind and loving, but they didn't last.",
      "She said Combs' moods affected her life, career and how she felt about herself, and if Combs wanted a \"freak off,\" then her work would take a backseat.",
      "\"I had to do freak offs,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Bruce Springsteen gave his latest stinging criticism of President Trump and his administration, calling them \"treasonous\" and \"incompetent\" to kick off the first show of his British tour this week. The president responded in a Truth Social post that included criticism of the rocker's skin and telling him to \"keep his mouth shut\" until returning to the U.S.",
      "Springsteen, a long and prominent supporter of Democratic presidential candidates, made his remarks at a concert in Manchester, England, on Wednesday during the first of his \"Land of Hope and Dreams\" tour.",
      "\"The mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock 'n' roll in dangerous times,\" he said. \"In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\"",
      "The 75-year-old rocker, who later shared a transcript and video of his remarks on his website and YouTube channel, asked supporters of democracy to \"raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!\"",
      "Throughout the concert, Springsteen accused Mr. Trump and his administration of authoritarianism, rolling back civil rights, blocking free speech and \"taking sadistic pleasure in the pain that they inflict on loyal American workers.\"",
      "\"They're rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society,\" Springsteen said. \"They're abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom.\"",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump responded on his social media platform, saying that the rocker is \"just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.\"",
      "He added: \"Springsteen is 'dumb as a rock,' and couldn't see what was going on, or could he (which is even worse!)? This dried out 'prune' of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that's just 'standard fare.' Then we'll all see how it goes for him!\"",
      "This is not the first time Springsteen has aimed at Mr. Trump and his policies.",
      "When he endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election, Springsteen called Mr. Trump \"the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.\"",
      "\"Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually and emotionally divided as it does than at this moment. It doesn't have to be this way,\" the rock star said in\u00a0a short video\u00a0shared on social media.",
      "In a\u00a02016 interview\u00a0with Rolling Stone, Springsteen called Mr. Trump a \"moron.\" When Mr. Trump was running for reelection in 2020, Springsteen\u00a0told\u00a0The Atlantic he didn't know \"if our democracy could stand another four years of his custodianship.\"",

      "The Metropolitan Police did not name Brown but said it took a 36-year-old into custody at a Manchester hotel on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. Under British law, police cannot name suspects before charges are filed.",
      "The Sun, which first reported the story, said producer Abe Diaw told them Sunday that he was hospitalized after Brown beat him in an unprovoked attack at the Tape nightclub in the swanky Mayfair neighborhood in London in February 2023. Diaw told the Sun that Brown allegedly hit him over the head with a bottle before punching and kicking him as he lay on the floor.",
      "The tabloid said it became aware Brown was in the U.K. on Wednesday and called police to find out if he was under arrest. The newspaper said Met officers then traveled to Manchester and made the arrest.",

      "Diaw said Brown, who was on a U.K. tour at the time, cracked him on the head with a bottle and punched and kicked him on the floor. The producer has filed a 12 million pound ($16 million) lawsuit against the singer.",
      "Brown, often called by his nickname Breezy, burst onto the music scene as a teen in 2005 and has become a major hitmaker over the years with notable songs such as \"Run It,\" \"Kiss Kiss\" and \"Without You.\" He won his first Grammy for best R&B album in 2011 for \"F.A.M.E.\" then earned his second gold trophy in the same category for \"11:11 (Deluxe)\" earlier this year.",
      "Brown has a history of legal issues dating back to his felony conviction in the 2009 assault of his then-girlfriend Rihanna. He pleaded guilty to felony assault at the time. In 2014, Brown pleaded guilty to hitting a man outside a Washington, D.C., hotel. In 2024, Brown, along with his paid entourage, allegedly beat several men who attended his concert in Texas.",
      "Earlier this year, Brown sued Warner Bros. Discovery for defamation over labeling the singer as an abuser in the 2024 documentary \"Chris Brown: A History of Violence.\"",

      "The hip-hop mogul is accused of running a criminal enterprise since at least 2004 that manipulated women into participating in commercial sex acts with him, and sometimes male sex workers, during what prosecutors described as drug-fueled parties called \"freak offs.\"",
      "Combs has been jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn since his arrest last September. He\u00a0faces five counts from four different women, including Ventura.",
      "So far, jurors heard from a former security manager at the Los Angeles hotel where Combs was seen on a now infamous video attacking Ventura in 2016, along with a man who says he was hired to have sex with Ventura while Combs watched, and Ventura herself.",
      "Here's what to know about the charges and key names in the case.",
      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",
      "In her testimony, she said she signed with Bad Boy Records when she was 19, and Combs first kissed her on her 21st birthday. She and Combs dated off-and-on for more than 10 years, from about 2007 to 2018.",
      "She said she recorded hundreds of songs as part of a 10-album deal, but most were never released. She testified Combs became controlling and violent, and the \"freak offs\" became her job.",
      "Ventura spoke about years of alleged psychological and physical abuse. She also said Wednesday that he raped her after they had broken up in 2018.",
      "The security video of Combs attacking Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental hotel\u00a0is a key piece of evidence in his trial. The video,\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0by CNN last year, shows Combs throw her onto the floor before kicking and dragging her.",
      "Prosecutors allege the hotel assault happened during a \"freak off,\" but Combs' lawyers, who\u00a0sought to have the video excluded from trial, argue it was a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship.\"",
      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",
      "Combs later apologized for the behavior seen on the video, but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. In a social media post that has since been removed, he said he was \"f---ed up\" and \"hit rock bottom.\"",
      "\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"",
      "One day after the suit was filed, a settlement was announced. While the details were not disclosed, Ventura said in a statement, \"I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.\"",
      "Combs' defense attorneys said in their opening statements that he and Ventura hadn't seen each other since his ex, Kim Porter's, funeral in 2018.",
      "Ventura is now married and pregnant with her third child. Her husband and brother have both been seen in court for support.",
      "Who are Diddy's other accusers?",
      "Since 2023, dozens of women and men have filed lawsuits against Combs alleging sexual and physical abuse.",
      "Many of the accusers said they were drugged and then abused while incapacitated, and some claimed other celebrities were present or participated in the abuse.",

    "story": [
      "In honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we're taking a look back at how unfair representation in early Hollywood led to the creation of one of the first Chinese American film studios in the country.",
      "Frustrations with \"one-dimensional,\" \"demeaning\" characters",
      "Sandy Lee can trace her family's history in America back to the late 1860s. By the 1880s, her ancestors moved from San Francisco to settle in New York City's Chinatown and opened a business at 31 Pell St.",
      "That same building is now an insurance company, still owned by her family.",
      "Her grandfather, Harold Lee, became a prosperous businessman at the turn of the last century.",
      "\"He had a grocery store. He had a curio shop. He started to change people's money and it became a foreign exchange,\" she said.",
      "In the 1920s, Chinese leaders wrote to the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, disappointed by yet another unfair portrayal of their community in film.",
      "\"The representations of Chinese and Asians in early Hollywood were really like kind of one-dimensional and really demeaning,\" said Herb Tam, Director of Exhibitions at the Museum of Chinese in America.",
      "In response, the board told them to make their own movies if they wanted to change stereotypes. That's when Harold and his uncle Lee Kee Do founded and financed the Great Wall Film Company in 1921.",
      "\"In the 1920s, they had a small population here, but they still had the yearning for culture and film and art,\" Lee told Brooklyn reporter Hannah Kliger.",
      "\"'Do-it-yourself' mentality\"",
      "The streets of the city can look almost unrecognizable more than 100 years later, but researchers say I.S. 281 Joseph B. Cavallaro along Cropsey Avenue in Gravesend now stands on the site of the former studio. Some of its early films, distributed both in the U.S. and in China, were shot out of Southern Brooklyn.",
      "\"The film company the Lee family created is really reflective of a kind of 'do-it-yourself' mentality, and an entrepreneurialship within Chinese-American communities,\" Tam said.",
      "The studio eventually moved to Shanghai, producing around two dozen films in a decade. Few still remain, most were lost. The company went dark with the onset of the Great Depression, but the Lee family's impact in the world of cinema continued with the creation of the New York Chinese Film Exchange.",
      "\"My grandfather also bought a theater right on Park Row... and he renamed it the Silver Star,\" Lee said. \"It was a really big deal. On the weekends, you would go to the Chinese movies.\"",
      "Movies remain in the family's blood. A 1940s photo shows Sandy's uncle Henry Lee perched on a camera truck, shooting a news reel. Descendants include film production designers, media researchers and TV executives, still making their mark in the world of media.",

      "\"All my life I've been a chameleon. Everything is a costume,\" Simmons said in an interview for \"CBS Mornings\" that aired on Wednesday.",
      "But his devilish make-up and theatrical persona are a stark contrast to his very humble upbringing as the son of an immigrant single mother. Long before he became a KISS icon, he was known simply as Chaim Witz, meaning \"life\" in Hebrew.",
      "The road to KISS",
      "\"You want to be in a rock band?\" Simmons recalled his mother asking. \"That's not going to fly, babe.\"",
      "Before moving to New York at age 8, Simmons was born in Israel \u2013 a child of Jewish refugees from Hungary. His mother, Flora Klein, survived the Holocaust.",
      "\"After the horrific unimaginable life my mother went through where she saw her entire family, our family, wiped out in front of her face, every decision I was going to make I thought about my mother first,\" Simmons said.",

      "Eddie Kramer, who worked with The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, agreed to produce and engineer their first demo. But they struggled in obscurity until a challenge from their label's president led to one of the most famous lines in rock history.",
      "While buying frozen hot dogs and a can of beans in San Francisco, Simmons recalls Stanley turning to him and humming some of the lyrics to the song that would later become the iconic 1975 hit \"Rock and Roll All Nite.\"",
      "\"We were in San Francisco, we went downstairs to buy frozen hotdogs and a can of beans. And Paul said, what do you think of this?\"",
      "\"That's really good. What do you got? He goes, 'That's all I've got,'\" said Simmons after Stanley sang the chorus. They eventually put more verses together.",

    "summary": "During a 40-year screen career, Robert Benton received six Oscar nominations and won three times.",
    "story": [
      "Robert Benton, the Oscar-winning filmmaker who helped reset the rules in Hollywood as the co-creator of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" and later received mainstream validation as the writer-director of \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and \"Places in the Heart,\" has died at age 92.",
      "Benton's son, John Benton, said that he died Sunday at his home in Manhattan of \"natural causes.\"",
      "During a 40-year screen career, the Texas native received six Oscar nominations and won three times: for writing and directing \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and for writing \"Places in the Heart.\" He was widely appreciated by actors as attentive and trusting, and directed Oscar-winning performances by Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and Sally Field. Although severe dyslexia left him unable to read more than a few pages at a time as a child, he wrote and directed film adaptations of novels by Philip Roth, E.L. Doctorow and Richard Russo, among others.",
      "Benton was an art director for Esquire magazine in the early 1960s when a love for French New Wave movies and old gangster stories \u2014 and news that a friend got $25,000 for a Doris Day screenplay \u2014 inspired him and Esquire editor David Newman to draft a treatment about the lives of Depression-era robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, imagining them as prototypes for 1960s rebels.",
      "Their project took years to complete as Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard were among the directors who turned them down before Warren Beatty agreed to produce and star in the movie. \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" directed by Arthur Penn and starring Beatty and Faye Dunaway, overcame initial critical resistance in 1967 to the film's shocking violence and became one of the touchstones of 1960s culture and the start of a more open and creative era in Hollywood.",
      "The original story by Benton and Newman was even more daring: they had made Clyde Barrow bisexual and involved in a 3-way relationship with Bonnie and their male getaway driver. Beatty and Penn both resisted, and Barrow instead was portrayed as impotent, with an uncredited Robert Towne making numerous other changes to the script. \"I honestly don't know who the 'auteur' of 'Bonnie and Clyde' was,\" Benton later told Mark Harris, author of \"Pictures at a Revolution,\" a book about \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and four other movies from 1967.",
      "Over the following decade, none of Benton's films approached the impact of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" although he continued to have critical and commercial success. His writing credits included \"Superman\" and \"What's Up, Doc?\" He directed and co-wrote such well-reviewed works as \"Bad Company,\" a revisionist Western featuring Jeff Bridges, and \"The Late Show,\" a melancholy comedy for which his screenplay received an Oscar nomination.",
      "His career soared in 1979 with his adaptation of the Avery Corman novel \"Kramer vs. Kramer,\" about a self-absorbed advertising executive who becomes a loving parent to his young son after his wife walks out, only to have her return and ask for custody. Starring Hoffman and Streep, the movie was praised as a perceptive, emotional portrait of changing family roles and expectations and received five Academy Awards, including best picture. Hoffman, disenchanted at the time with the film business, would cite \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and Benson's direction for reviving his love for movie acting.",
      "Five years later, Benton was back in the Oscars race with a more personal film, \"Places in the Heart,\" in which he drew upon family stories and childhood memories for his 1930s-set drama starring Fields as a mother of two in Texas who fights to hold on to her land after her husband is killed.",
      "\"I think that when I saw it all strung together, I was surprised at what a romantic view I had of the past,\" Benton told The Associated Press in 1984, adding that the movie was in part a tribute to his mother, who had died shortly before the release of \"Kramer vs. Kramer.\"",
      "Benton was born in Waxahachie, Texas, outside of Dallas. He owed his early love for movies to his father, telephone company employee Ellery Douglass Benton, who, instead of asking about homework, would take his family to the picture shows. The elder Benton would also share memories of attending the funerals of outlaws Barrow and Parker, Texas natives who grew up in the Dallas area.",
      "Robert Benton studied at the University of Texas and Columbia University, then served in the U.S. Army from 1954 until 1956. While at Esquire, Benton helped start the magazine's long-standing Dubious Achievement Award and dated Gloria Steinem, then on staff at the humor magazine Help! He married artist Sallie Rendigs in 1964. They had one son.",
      "Between hits, Benton often endured long dry spells. His latter films included such disappointments as the thrillers \"Billy Bathgate,\" \"The Human Stain\" and \"Twilight.\" He had much more success with \"Nobody's Fool,\" a wry comedy released in 1994 and starring Paul Newman, in his last Oscar-nominated performance, as a small-town troublemaker in upstate New York. Benton, whose film was based on Russo's novel, was nominated for best adapted screenplay.",
      "\"Somebody asked me once when the Academy Award nominations came out and I'd been nominated, 'What's the great thing about the Academy Awards?'\" Benton told Venice magazine in 1998. \"I said, 'When you go to the awards and you see people, some of whom you've had bitter fights with, some of whom you're close friends with, some people you haven't seen in ten years, some people you just saw two days before \u2014 it's your family.' It's home. And home is what I've spent my life looking for.\"",

Kardashian testified that one member of the gang pulled her to him while she was in just a bathrobe.",
      "\"I was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,\" Kardashian said. \"I absolutely did think I was going to die,\" she added.",
      "\"I thought about my sister, thought she would walk in and see me shot dead and have that memory in her forever,\" she told the court, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Kardashian testified the robbery happened at around 3 a.m. at her hotel. She was in bed about to fall asleep when she heard people stomping up the stairs and then entering her bedroom wearing police uniforms.",
      "Kardashian said that once they got inside her suite, the masked thieves pointed a gun at her.",
      "\"Then I heard one of the gentlemen forcefully say, 'Ring! Ring!' in English, with an accent, pointing,\" she told the court, according to Reuters, apparently referring to the $4 million diamond ring given to her by her then-husband Kanye West, now known as Ye. The couple\u00a0settled for divorce\u00a0in 2022.",
      "\"It was at the end of the bed, so he grabs my leg and pulls me toward him on the bed so the robe is opened and everything is exposed,\" Kardashian said. \"And that was the moment when I thought he would rape me. But he ended up tying me up and closed my legs.\"",

      "\"I forgive you,\" Kardashian told Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the man alleged to be the brains behind the robbery, after his lawyer read a letter to the court sent by his client to the celebrity a year after the robbery, in which he said he was sorry.",

      "Dressed in black, with her hair up in a chignon, the celebrity was accompanied by her mother, Kris Jenner.",
      "The hearing was not broadcast publicly, as France rarely allows cameras in courtrooms. Some 400 reporters applied to attend the trial, but there were only 40 places allocated for media inside the courtroom. A side room was set up for 200 more journalists to watch a live transmission from inside the courtroom.",
      "After giving evidence all afternoon, Kardashian left the courthouse with her mother and bodyguards, without speaking to the crowds of fans and press waiting for her.",

Ten people \u2014 nine men and a woman \u2014 face charges including robbery and kidnapping against the American media personality and the concierge of the residence where she was staying on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "Before the celebrity took the stand herself, her longtime friend-turned-stylist Simone Harouche told the court on Tuesday that she heard Kardashian begging for her life during the attack in the hotel suite they were sharing.",
      "\"'I have babies and I need to live!' That is what she kept on saying, 'Take everything. I need to live,'\" Harouche told the court. \"I was scared that she was raped or violated. I thought the worst.\"",
      "Prosecutors have told the court that when the gang, dressed as police officers, arrived at the luxury suites hotel known only as \"The No Address\" where Kardashian was staying, they demanded that the concierge, at gunpoint, guide them to \"the rapper's wife,\" a reference to her then-husband.",
      "In interviews and on her family's reality TV show, Kardashian has described being terrified during the intrusion, thinking she was going to be raped and killed.",
      "\"They dragged me out to the hallway on top of the stairs, that's when I saw the gun, like clear as day,\" she said on her show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" adding: \"It makes me so upset thinking about it.\"",
      "The robbers, some of whom escaped on bicycles, have been dubbed \"the Grandpa robbers\" as most of the suspects were in their 60s at the time of the heist.",

      "\"We want to find out not just does Psilocybin therapy work, but if it does, how does it work? That mechanistic piece is so important,\" she said. \"Can it change the brain's ability to adapt to its environment and to rewire itself?\"",

      "Senate Democrats and the Biden administration dropped plans to set drug price caps based on the amount paid in other high-income countries, during talks years ago to push through the law that empowered Medicare to negotiate down the cost of prescription medications.",
      "A version of the idea was revived by President Trump in the executive order signed Monday, which called on the Department of Health and Human Services next month to draw up regulations to impose price restrictions tied to lower amounts paid in other developed nations, if drugmakers did not voluntarily reduce what they were charging in the U.S.",
      "\"Democrats could have done this a long time ago. They have fought like hell, for the drug companies. And they knew they were doing the wrong thing,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking at a White House event to announce the move.",
      "For Democrats on Capitol Hill, this kind of approach to price controls has roots in a bill their own party successfully passed under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.",
      "As part of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate the price of costly drugs it covered, the bill passed by House Democrats wanted the maximum price to be tied to an average based on prices paid in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.",
      "\"We were hoping to get Trump. Trump said, 'I want to negotiate.' But then Republicans in Congress got to him,\" said Wendell Primus, who served for nearly two decades as Pelosi's top aide on health policy.",
      "The bill did not make it through the Senate at the time, which was controlled by Mr. Trump's party. After Democrats flipped control of the Senate, the idea ran into headwinds years later, as Biden aides and lawmakers tried to incorporate the measure into the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Multiple Democrats involved in the talks on Capitol Hill at the time blamed a series of meetings in early 2021 with the staff from the Senate Finance Committee and party leadership for scuttling the idea.",
      "Staff on the committee said that they were worried that moderate Democrats like then-Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would not support the bill if it included the measure, Primus said. Menendez and Sinema are no longer in the Senate.",
      "\"Members did not want to have something referencing foreign countries. They wanted it to make a function of the manufacturer's price here, what drug companies were offering to commercial insurers,\" Primus said.",
      "One former Biden White House aide involved in the talks said that there were several senators who understood that drug prices were too high, but they worried those price caps could undercut innovation from drugmakers in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the deal struck by lawmakers and White House aides to pass the law in 2022 ultimately turned to a different formula: capping them using calculations based on the price previously paid by Medicare and a fixed discount off the list price in the private U.S. market.",
      "\"President Biden and Democrats in Congress cared about getting something done, and so there was a compromise on the table that wasn't perfect, but it was going to make a huge amount of difference. And so that's the law they ultimately enacted,\" said Christen Linke-Young, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Mr. Biden.",
      "Medicare has gone on to implement the law, resulting in talks that are continuing under the current Trump administration to lower the maximum price that the federal insurance program will pay for a growing list of costly drugs.",
      "\"It's a good thing for prescription drug costs in this country to be lower, we need to continue to work on that. And one of the ways to do that is actually put a proposal before Congress and get it enacted, so it has the force of law,\" said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, as the White House was working with their allies in Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration moved to formally scrap a bid by Mr. Trump to impose caps tied to lower prices in other high-income countries using executive power during his first term.",
      "Called the \"most favored nation\" model, Trump officials had directed Medicare to only reimburse hospitals and clinics for some costly drugs based on the lowest price paid for in other high-income countries.",
      "CMS under Mr. Biden ultimately rescinded that move in 2022, after a legal fight that had blocked the proposal on the grounds that the Trump administration had unlawfully shortcutted the normal rulemaking steps to finalize the policy.",
      "\"The proposal was always pretty transparently illegal. The statute says that Medicare has to pay for prescription drugs in one particular way, and the Trump administration proposal was that we are going to ignore the statute and pay for drugs in an entirely different way. If the statute allowed that, a president before Donald Trump would have done it,\" Linke-Young said.",
      "A White House official under Mr. Trump disagreed with the accusation that their initial proposal was unlawful, arguing that the initial authority they used for the \"demonstration\" model in Medicare used powers that were broadly written by Democrats.",
      "While they are not planning to go down the exact same path, the official said, saying that they \"learned certain things from that first demonstration,\" the Trump administration believes they \"absolutely have that authority in our pocket.\"",
      "\"We are confident that we have authorities within our government programs to do this. And any dispute from the Biden administration is an intentional misinterpretation of the statute for political reasons, because they are the ones that walked away,\" the White House official said.",
      "Trump administration officials have painted their second run at the \"most favored nation\" idea as even broader in scope than their first term, which had been limited to only some costly drugs administered by healthcare providers through Medicare Part B.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday that they \"firmly believe\" they have the ability to pursue wider actions to push drugmakers to lower their prices within Medicare. They cited other authorities in the law being considered like section 402, which affords HHS powers to \"develop and engage in experiments\" which could affect payment rates in Medicaid as well.",
      "Asked this week on Fox Business Network whether the president's promise of steep drug price cuts would also extend to Medicare Part D, which covers the broad swath of prescriptions filled at drug store pharmacies, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said \"they absolutely will.\"",
      "\"They'll apply to Medicare, and they'll apply in the private market as well,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Asked Tuesday whether he supported the president's plan, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he thought \"it'll be the subject of probably multiple lawsuits, and I think the courts will probably have something to say about it.\"",

    "story": [
      "The head of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and a handful of teams at the agency had their layoff notices rescinded Tuesday, multiple officials say, and several worker safety programs that had been eliminated by layoffs last month are being restored.",
      "Letters reversing the layoffs arrived in the inboxes of some NIOSH staff a day ahead of House and Senate hearings Wednesday with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. where he was expected to face questions about the layoffs.",
      "Health officials and scientists being brought back to work include everyone in NIOSH's respiratory health division, division of safety research, division of compensation and analysis support and National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy has been working hard to ensure that the critical functions under NIOSH remain intact. The Trump Administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters, and under the Secretary's leadership, NIOSH's essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations,\" HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email.",
      "A handful of NIOSH staff working in the agency's World Trade Center Health Program previously had their layoffs reversed, after a second round of cuts at the agency earlier this month.",
      "\"While we celebrate with those who received a rescission letter from HHS, I am mindful that others did not. I am hopeful that we can continue to make the case for reinstating everyone at NIOSH,\" the agency's now-reinstated director, Dr. John Howard, wrote in the email.",
      "The reinstatements mean that some NIOSH programs might soon be able to resume, after they were previously hobbled by the layoffs.",
      "For example, the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory had been forced to suspend new approvals of equipment like new N95 respirators and protective gear for firefighters after the initial round of cuts on April 1. Investigations of workplace health risks through NIOSH's Health Hazard Evaluation program were also upended by the layoffs, but staff working in those probes have now been reinstated.",
      "But many workers also remain effectively laid-off at the wide-ranging agency, which functions as the research and testing counterpart to the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration.",
      "In NIOSH's Spokane and Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, laid-off scientists and engineers were called back to work, but only for a few more weeks to wind down their laboratories and research before their layoff notices take effect. Those NIOSH employees have not received letters formally rescinding their layoffs, unlike some of their colleagues.",
      "Part of their work includes overseeing miner safety programs like the personal dust monitors, or PDM, required by the Department of Labor for coal miners. NIOSH is responsible for testing PDM's accuracy. The monitors are needed to reduce the risk of black lung disease.",
      "NIOSH had also been in the process of developing similar monitors for miners exposed to silica dust, before the layoffs gutted the teams overseeing that work.",
      "Other NIOSH teams like the Health Effects Laboratory Division were also not listed among the reinstatements.",
      "Other parts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which currently houses NIOSH, also remain off the job, despite calls from states and lawmakers for their reinstatements. HHS previously said it was planning on moving what remained of NIOSH into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "Among the CDC scientists still laid-off include the agency's laboratories for investigating STD and viral hepatitis, which upended work helping states investigate outbreaks. Staff in the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for a range of issues including lead poisoning and cruise ship outbreaks, also have not been reinstated.",
      "Other workers who have been promised by their supervisors that they would be reinstated elsewhere at HHS have also so far not received notices, like at the Food and Drug Administration's drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit.",
      "While their counterparts at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco were reinstated, multiple scientists in those labs said they had yet to receive formal written notices revoking their layoffs, weeks after they were told they would be reinstated.",

      "The provisional numbers are estimates of everyone who died of overdoses in the U.S., including noncitizens. That data is still being processed, and the final numbers can sometimes differ a bit. But it's clear that there was a huge drop last year.",
      "A CDC report late last year showed that overdose deaths in the U.S. fell 17% between July 2023 and July 2024 \u2014 credited in part to wider naloxone access. Naloxone, also sold under the brand name Narcan,  was made\u00a0available for over-the-counter purchase\u00a0in 2023 and is\u00a0standard for first responders\u00a0to carry. It's even popped up\u00a0in some classrooms.",
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting a $56 million grant that teaches first responders how to use the lifesaving overdose reversal drug naloxone, which experts have previously said could reverse progress the U.S. has made in lowering opioid overdose deaths.",
      "The grant money can be used by state and local organizations for training people on how to use naloxone, as well as administering and distributing the medication. The grant is administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
      "Experts note that there have been past moments when U.S. overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go down, only to rise again. That happened in 2018.",
      "But there are reasons to be optimistic.",
      "Drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacy chains and other businesses have settled lawsuits with state and local governments over the painkillers that were a main driver of overdose deaths in the past. The deals over the last decade or so have promised about $50 billion over time, with most of it required to be used to fight addiction.",
      "Another settlement that would be among the largest, with members of the Sackler family who own OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma agreeing to pay up to $7 billion, could be approved this year.",
      "The money, along with federal taxpayer funding, is going to a variety of programs, including supportive housing and harm reduction efforts, such as providing materials to test drugs for fentanyl, the biggest driver of overdoses now.",
      "But what each state will do with that money is currently at issue. \"States can either say, 'We won, we can walk away'\" in the wake of the declines or they can use the lawsuit money on naloxone and other efforts, said Regina LaBelle, a former acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. She now heads an addiction and public policy program at Georgetown University.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration views opioids as largely a law enforcement issue and as a reason to step up border security. That worries many public health leaders and advocates.",

She is now executive director of Broken No Moore, an advocacy organization focused on substance use disorder.",

    "summary": "The greatest benefits would go to high-income households, while low-income families would see a much more modest boost, analyses show.",
    "story": [
      "The White House on Friday touted a Republican-backed tax bill as delivering \"PERMANENT tax cuts and bigger paychecks.\" Yet experts say the legislation would disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering far more modest gains to Americans lower down the ladder.",
      "If the bill is passed, households with more than $1 million in annual income would see their after-tax earnings rise by 4.3%, according to a new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a public policy think tank. The lowest-earning 20% of Americans would receive the smallest boost \u2014 their after-tax incomes would rise 0.6%, or an average of $90 annually, CBPP found.",
      "Other analyses have reached similar conclusions. The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution,\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the bottom 20% of Americans would see a 0.6% increase in after-tax income under the House tax bill, compared with a 3.7% increase for the top 20%.",
      "The fate of the GOP tax bill is unclear after five Republican members of the House Budget Committee on Friday voted against advancing the measure, dubbed the \"one big, beautiful, bill,\" saying the legislation does not do enough to slash federal spending.",
      "Such projections don't include the impact of cuts to federal programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which support many low- and middle-income households. Under the GOP bill, those services could face steep cuts, potentially bumping millions off Medicaid by adding work requirements and cutting federal funding provided to states to support the health care program.",
      "Those cuts could leave many low-income households worse off even after accounting for lower taxes, according to another analysis released Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania research group that analyzes the fiscal impact of public policies.",
      "The bottom 20% of households, who earn up to about $17,000 annually, would see their after-tax incomes drop by $1,035 in 2026, including a reduction in government benefits, the nonpartisan group found. The top 0.1%, who earn at least $4.3 million per year, would get an annual after-tax boost of about $389,000, Penn Wharton said.",
      "The White House took issue with the CBPP and Penn Wharton analyses.",
      "\"Once again, the experts are wrong, just as they were about the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have yielded trillions in investments, record job growth, and no inflation,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These experts should be embarrassed to share their 'expertise,' considering the egg still on their faces. MAGAnomics transcends conventional wisdom, and the President's One, Big, Beautiful Bill will continue to prove the haters wrong.\"",
      "The White House pointed to an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation that estimated the average tax bill would decline 11.1% in 2027 under the GOP legislation. The nonpartisan panel, which assess the impact of legislation for Congress, found that the biggest tax decrease would go to people earning $15,000 to $30,000, with a decline of 21.1%, while those earning more than $1 million would decline 8.6%",
      "Tariff impact",
      "Because low-income households spend a bigger share of their income on basics like food and clothing than wealthier Americans, they are likely to take a bigger financial hit from tariffs, experts including the nonpartisan\u00a0Yale Budget Lab have said. That could effectively wipe out the benefits from the tax cuts, according to some analysts.",
      "If inflation rises as a result of higher tariffs and tax cuts, the bottom 20% of U.S. households would lose $100 per year, largely due to paying higher costs for consumer goods that are imported from other countries, the CBPP found. Because tariffs are taxes on imports paid by U.S. businesses, they typically pass on the cost of such duties to consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"If we add just the effects of the tariffs the Trump Administration has put in place, the plan would still boost the rich while leaving the lowest-income people worse off because their tax cuts are so small,\" Brendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the CBPP, said in a post.",
      "Counting the impact of tariffs, the top 1% of households would still see their after-tax incomes increase by 3%, or almost $45,000, the think tank estimated. That analysis doesn't include the impact of cuts to services like Medicaid or food stamps.",
      "On Thursday, Walmart said it plans to hike prices this month to offset the cost of new tariffs introduced by the Trump administration.",
      "Extending the 2017 tax cuts",
      "As well as calling for deeper cuts in federal spending, the Republican lawmakers blocking the tax bill also want to move up\u00a0work requirements\u00a0for some Medicaid recipients, which under the current bill wouldn't kick in until 2029.",
      "Other Republicans want a bigger deduction cap on state and local taxes, known as SALT, that can be applied on people's\u00a0federal tax returns. The bill increases the cap on the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000.",
      "But the bill's basic outline for cutting taxes isn't a focus of debate among Republicans, who are seeking to extend Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill would also add a host of other cuts, such as eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, while also providing a more generous standard deduction.",

      "Kroger operates roughly 2,700 stores throughout the U.S., according to the company's\u00a0website, and owns a suite of supermarkets that includes Harris Teeter, Fred Meyer, Fry's and Ralphs.",
      "To conduct the investigation, Consumer Reports, The Guardian and FERN recruited people to shop at more than two dozen Kroger and Kroger-owned stores in 14 states and the District of Columbia over a roughly three-month period this year.",
      "The investigation found that expired sales labels led to overcharges on more than 150 grocery items, with an average overcharge of $1.70 per item, or 18.4%. For instance, a bag of Mission Flour Tortillas at a Harris Teeter in Alexandria, Virginia, was advertised as on sale for $2.99, while customers were charged $4.99.",
      "Although pricing mistakes were not found at all the Kroger stores in the investigation, the probe found issues at over half of the 26 locations it examined.",
      "Kroger took issue with the findings, saying the investigation greatly overstates the pricing issues.",
      "The \"characterization of widespread pricing concerns is patently false,\" a Kroger spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, adding that the errors cited by the investigators represented only a \"few dozen examples across several years out of billions of customer transactions annually.\"",
      "Although Consumer Price Index\u00a0data shows\u00a0the rate of inflation and grocery prices eased last month, Americans continue to face higher\u00a0costs for household goods.",
      "\"Even if the incidents are careless rather than calculated, it creates a perception that Kroger is ripping people off,\" said Neil Saunders, an analyst with retail industry research firm GlobalData in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not what any grocery retailer wants or needs when the consumer is looking to maximize value for money.\"",
      "Kroger not alone in overcharging claims",
      "The overcharging problem is not unique to Kroger: Retailers like Walmart, Safeway, Albertsons and Vons have\u00a0been hit with similar allegations.",
      "Grocery giant Albertsons in October agreed to pay $4 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the California chain of selling items for more than their lowest advertised price.",
      "But the Kroger case stand out for several reasons said Derek Kravitz, an investigative journalist and author of the Consumer Reports story. One is that in states in the Midwest and the South, where the retailer has a strong foothold, Kroger is often one of just a few places to choose from for grocery shopping.",
      "Kravitz also pointed to the persistent flow of complaints from Kroger customers over out-of-date sales prices, dating back to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Ohio, for example, the attorney general's office has received nearly 60 complaints of price tag and overcharge issues at Kroger since 2021.",
      "\"Almost every single time I go in the store, the listed price of an item is NOT what rings up at the register,\" Belpre resident Allison Hadfield noted in one of three complaints she and her husband, Derek, filed against their local Kroger store, according to Consumer Reports.",
      "Shopper Elizabeth Giovanni also submitted several complaints to her local Kroger store in Millington, Tennessee. In one case, she said an entire dairy case with cheese had expired signs.",
      "\"I've recently stopped shopping there because of their lack of accountability and willingness to change the prices when they're in the wrong,\" she said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to individual complaints, customers have also filed multiple class-action lawsuits alleging pricing errors at Kroger locations, with cases ongoing in California, Ohio and Illinois, according to The Guardian.",
      "Kroger said it has taken steps to fix price discrepancies. That includes instituting a policy that gives employees the authority to fix price problems on the spot.",
      "\"Kroger is committed to affordable and accurate pricing, and we conduct robust price check processes that reviews millions of items weekly to ensure our shelf prices are accurate,\" a spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Potential staffing issues",
      "Between 2019 and 2024, the average number of employees at the Kroger-owned stores that the researchers focused on fell by 10.3%, or 17 employees per store, according to the report, which cites data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The average number of hours worked also fell by 2.7 hours per week.",
      "\"There are simply not enough employees to manually switch out price labels on shelves because some stores have tens of thousands of price tags hanging at any one time,\" Kravitz wrote in the report.",
      "Kroger denies there is a problem with understaffing. In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, the Kroger spokesperson said work hours and staffing at its stores have not been reduced.",
      "\"We intentionally staff our stores to keep them running smoothly while creating an enjoyable place to shop,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our staffing decisions are data-driven to balance workload and schedules.\"",
      "The investigation on overcharging comes as the grocery giant reports record sales and profits. Kroger reported $3.8 billion in operating profit last year, according to a March earnings\u00a0report.",

      "Revered in the South for his efforts to defend the country against Japanese encroachment, Ahn Jung-geun is best known for his dramatic, high-stakes assassination of Japan's first prime minister, Ito Hirobumi, in 1909 at a train station in Harbin. Ahn shouted \"Hurrah for Korea!\" as he was arrested, according to the Association for Asian Studies based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.",
      "He was hanged for the killing by Japanese authorities in 1910, just months before Tokyo formally annexed the Korean Peninsula, ushering in a brutal period of occupation that lasted until the end of World War II.",
      "Now, more than a century after his death, the calligraphy Ahn created in his prison cell during his final days \u2014 typically at the request of Japanese officials \u2014 is drawing fresh attention in Seoul's glitzy art scene.",
      "In South Korea, Ahn's life has long inspired artists across generations, giving rise to a highly celebrated musical, multiple novels, and films \u2014 including one starring \"Crash Landing on You\" actor Hyun Bin.",
      "Ahn was held in his prison cell in China for about 40 days leading up to his execution and he kept himself busy writing an autobiography and making hundreds of calligraphy pieces, including one requested by his own prison guard.",
      "\"The court and prison officials, saying they wanted to keep my calligraphy as a memento, brought me hundreds of sheets of silk and paper and asked me to create for them,\" Ahn wrote in his autobiography. \"I ended up spending several hours each day doing calligraphy, even though I wasn't particularly skilled in it.\"",
      "Even though Ahn had assassinated their top official Ito, the Japanese who took his calligraphy preserved them with care, and some of their descendants have donated them to the South Korean government, which subsequently designated them as national treasures.",
      "Now, more of the calligraphies are surfacing in the private art market, with the latest being auctioned last month in Seoul for 940 million won ($674,098) \u2014 more than three times its opening bid.",
      "The piece, which says \"green bamboo\" \u2014 a traditional symbol of integrity \u2014 had been owned by a Japanese individual who did not wish to be identified, and they had done an impeccable job preserving it, said Kim Jun-seon, art valuation specialist at Seoul Auction.",

      "Moves to honor Ahn by Seoul and Beijing have previously strained ties with Tokyo, even briefly sparking a diplomatic row in 2013.",
      "In 2014, Japan criticized a memorial built in China to commemorate Ahn, BBC News reported. A Japanese government spokesman branded him a terrorist after the Chinese-Korean memorial hall opened in China's Harbin city, where Ito was shot.",
      "The fact that his Japanese captors preserved his calligraphy \"reflects the cultural and political contradictions of early 20th century East Asia,\" said Eugene Y. Park, a history professor at University of Nevada, Reno.",
      "At his trial, Ahn identified himself as a soldier for Korea, defined his assassination of Ito as a military operation, and envisioned a united East Asia \u2014 comprising Korea, China and Japan \u2014 somewhat akin to today's European Union.",
      "\"Some Japanese may have seen him as a misguided but principled idealist,\" Park told AFP.",
      "His calligraphy, which focused on values such as peace and ethics, \"resonated culturally, even if he opposed them politically,\" he said.",
      "\"At a time when Japan's own imperial identity was unsettled, preserving his works revealed deeper tensions between respect for moral courage and the pursuit of colonial domination.\"",
      "In 2023, the Global Sae-A Group, a South Korean conglomerate, purchased one of Ahn's calligraphies for a record-breaking 1.95 billion won (nearly $1.4 million).",
      "The piece \"Green Bamboo\" was sold at auction last month to the family of South Korea's LS Group.",
      "\"We expressed our intention to bring the piece back to Korea and share it with the public,\" Joung Tae-hee at Seoul Auction said, adding that the Japanese owner agreed to sell after hearing their proposal.",
      "Lee Sang-hyun, of the LS Group family, told AFP that his mother \"hopes many citizens will be able to see this piece and that it will also be studied,\" and they are considering donating it to a national institution.",

      "The priest \u2014 who had also baptized Ahn and was a longtime friend \u2014 was disciplined for his trip, and was later forced to return to France.",

      "The House Republican bill to enact President Trump's domestic policy agenda contains a provision that has prompted opposition from the Mexican government \u2014 a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries.",
      "The payments, known as remittances, would be subject to a 5% excise tax that would encompass more than 40 million people, including green card holders and nonimmigrant visa holders, such as people on H-1B, H-2A and H-2B visas. U.S. citizens would be exempt.",
      "In a May 13 letter to the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, Esteban Moctezuma Barrag\u00e1n, Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., urged Chairman Jason Smith and Ranking Member Richard Neal to reconsider the proposal.",
      "\"We respectfully urge you to reconsider this section of the legislative proposal, and we remain available to continue dialogue on the matter,\" wrote Barrag\u00e1n and Robert Velasco Alvarez, Mexico's chief officer for North America.",
      "Spokespeople for both Smith and Neal did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In April, President Trump hinted at a crackdown on remittances, announcing in a Truth Social Post\u00a0that the administration was \"finalizing a presidential memorandum to shut down remittances sent by illegal aliens outside of the United States.\" But details on the presidential proposal were unclear.",
      "The remittance tax provisions in the bill have become an international flashpoint. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has also criticized the plan and urged Republican lawmakers to reconsider it.",
      "At a press briefing this week, Sheinbaum warned that the proposal \"would damage the economy of both nations and is also contrary to the spirit of economic freedom that the U.S. government claims to defend.\"",
      "\"Remittances are the fruit of the efforts of those who, through their honest work, strengthen not only the Mexican economy but also the United States', which is why we consider this measure to be arbitrary and unjust,\" she said.",
      "An estimate by the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies, which is cited in the letter, found that Mexican migrant workers sent on average 16.7% of their labor income as remittances.",
      "\"In other words, more than 80% of the income generated by this community remains in the U.S. economy,\" the letter says.",
      "The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, however, that the proposal would generate a little more than $1 billion in tax revenue in fiscal year 2026, and rise to about $3 billion by 2034.",
      "In the letter to lawmakers, Barrag\u00e1n said the proposal would amount to double taxation, \"since migrants already pay taxes in the country where they work.\"",
      "\"Imposing a tax on these transfers would disproportionately affect those with the least, without accounting for their ability to pay,\" he added and also warned of other unintended consequences.",
      "\"Many migrants might seek informal or unregulated means to do so, complicating oversight and control of these financial flows. This would not only reduce the expected revenue but also increase risks related to financial security, tax evasion and money laundering,\" he wrote.",
      "Barrag\u00e1n has been meeting with lawmakers in recent days and discussing the matter with them. On Tuesday, he hosted a dinner for members of Congress, including Texas Rep. Tony Gonzalez, whose district spans the length of much of the state's border with Mexico and is home to many migrant workers. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast and Florida Rep Maria Elvira Salazar attended the dinner.",
      "Salazar said, when asked about the proposal, she was still assessing the legislation and who exactly it will affect, noting that banks already charge fees for such transactions.",
      "\"I just want what's fair, what's just and what's Christian,\" she said.",
      "Separately, Barragan met with Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick and also discussed the remittance measure.",

      "High temperatures projected across the U.S. summer could take a toll on Americans' budgets by driving up the price of keeping homes cool.",
      "Home electricity bills are expected to rise to an average of $784 for the summer period, up more than 6% from $737 in 2024 and marking a 12-year record, according a new analysis from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).",
      "The growing expense comes on the heels of a cold winter that drove up heating costs for many Americans, and as consumers continue to grapple with higher prices on everyday goods. Consumers are also increasingly expressing concerns about how tariffs\u00a0could affect their day-to-day costs, Gallup polling has found.",
      "\"We found that it's going to be another expensive summer for air conditioning because temperatures will stay high, and electricity prices have been rising faster than inflation,\" energy economist Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The anticipated spike in residential electricity costs from June through September is due to the combination of rising cost of electricity, which is outpacing inflation, with higher temperatures, NEADA said. Those trends mean that households are not only expected to pay higher prices for electricity, but will likely consume more of it than they did last summer because of the need for more cooling.",
      "\"It's not just temperatures that are going up, but the cost of cooling is going up,\" Wolfe said. \"And when electricity prices go up, they tend to stay high. So even if temperatures moderate, your bill might go up because of the cost of electricity.\"",
      "Unpaid bills",
      "Energy costs eat up a larger share of low-income families' budgets compared to higher-earners. Low-income households spend roughly 8.6% of their incomes on energy costs, compared to 3% for those that are higher up the income ladder, according to NEADA.",
      "Worryingly, the lowest earners could struggle to afford to keep their homes cool, Wolfe noted. The most recent Census Household Pulse Survey found that 37% of low- and moderate-income households could not afford their energy bills for at least one month between April 2023 and April 2024.",
      "If those households find themselves in a financial crunch this summer, they may opt to turn off their air conditioning, which could pose serious health risks, noted Wolfe.",
      "\"Last winter was cold, so they're just getting over paying their heating bills, and are now facing higher summer cooling costs,\" Wolfe explained. \"And while people understand that if you don't use heat in the winter, your pipes will freeze, that won't happen in the summer.\"",
      "Reluctance to turn on one's air conditioning can have adverse health effects like heat stroke. \"While this won't do damage to your building, it will do damage to you,\" Wolfe said.",
      "Extreme heat and health",
      "Public assistance programs haven't kept pace with the evolving climate, according to Wolfe. \"We're having heat waves that are lasting longer, and the systems in place to protect families have not kept up,\" he said.",
      "This summer's cooling cost forecast should be taken as a sign that state and federal assistance programs require modernization, according to Wolfe. Only 26 states offer summer cooling assistance to help Americans pay their bills. Thirty-three states have no protections in place to prevent utilities company from shutting off customers' access to electricity when they're behind on payments.",
      "Extreme heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Wolfe says that taking steps to modernize your home can actually help households save money. For example, adding insulation to your house can help control energy bills.",

The American dream is not that it's given to you \u2014 it's that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead and achieve the things in life that you want to achieve. It's not living in a tent, not having to steal.\"",
      "The Ludwig Institute also says that the nation's official\u00a0unemployment rate of 4.2%\u00a0greatly understates the level of economic distress around the U.S. Factoring in workers who are stuck in poverty-wage jobs and people who are unable to find full-time employment, the U.S. jobless rate now tops 24%, according to LISEP, which defines these groups as \"functionally unemployed.\"",
      "Peering beneath the surface",
      "By those standards, the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short of what they need to maintain a decent standard of living, according to LISEP. These households, which in 2023 earned an average of $38,000 per year, would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes the cost of professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "\"Traditional headline economic indicators like GDP and unemployment tell us the economy is thriving, but they don't reflect the lived reality of most Americans,\" Ludwig said in a statement. \"Americans are working harder than ever, fueling our economic growth, but the benefits of that hard work are not being distributed in a way that supports upward mobility for too many middle- and low-income Americans.\"",
      "From 2001 to 2023, the cost of affording what amounts to a basic level of economic security doubled, according to LISEP's analysis. Housing and health care costs surged, while the amount of savings required to attend an in-state, public university soared 122%.",
      "Meanwhile, median earnings for the bottom 60% of income earners fell 4% over that span when adjusting for the cost of goods tracked by the group's index, according to LISEP. Income growth for these households has also lagged, rising 0.37% per year during the same period \u2014 less than half as much as for the top 40% of earners, the group found.",
      "The gap between how much low-income families earn and how much they need to afford a minimum cost of living is expected to keep widening, Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Unfortunately, it is growing because the items that go into the basket of goods and services that make the minimal quality of life are inflating at a higher rate than wages are inflating,\" he said.",

      "The Trump administration has been negotiating with the U.K., China and other major trading partners in recent weeks over his April 2 tariffs, which set historically high duties on imported goods for almost every country on the globe.",
      "U.S. companies such as Walmart and Target, along with many small businesses, pay the tariffs on imports \u2014 not the nations that produce the goods \u2014 and those companies typically pass off the costs to American consumers in the form of higher prices.",

It has a strong foothold in states spanning from California to Virginia. Charter Communications, known more widely as Spectrum, has more than 32 million customers in 41 states.",
      "The cable industry has been under assault for years from streaming services like Disney, Netflix, Amazon and HBO Max, as well as internet plans offered by mobile phone companies. Comcast, which is of nearly equal size to Charter, spun off many of its cable television networks in November as as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms.",

    "story": [
      "Flying can be a hassle even under the best of circumstances. When trips are marred by delays, cancellations and mishandled luggage, air travel can become a nightmare.",
      "In 2024, customers lodged a record 66,675 complaints against U.S. airlines, according to a new report from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy group, based on data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. Passenger complaints have surged since the pandemic, rising every year since 2021, according to PIRG.",
      "\"When you file a complaint, the DOT asks if you talked to airline, so it's not like the DOT complaint line is your first stop,\" U.S. PIRG consumer watchdog director Teresa Murray told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When people try to get their money back and the airline hasn't done it, that's when people file complaints.\"",
      "For example, some customers sought refunds they were due related to flight cancellations or delays, while others sought reimbursement they were owed for lost or damaged piece of luggage. Airlines now face added pressure under new rules\u00a0adopted in 2024 that require them to provide automatic refunds to customers when their flights are canceled or significantly delayed.",
      "In recent years, the top customer complaints have been related to cancellations and delays, refunds, lost or damaged baggage, reservations, fares, customer service, disabilities, involuntary bumping and more.",
      "Notably, in 2024, total complaints against U.S. airlines rose 9%, while passenger volume only rose 4%.",
      "\"Passengers are ticked off, and they know now that voicing their concerns gets results, because we saw ton of consumer protections passed last year,\" Murray said.",
      "Pandemic impact",
      "Prior to 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in the U.S., annual complaints against all airlines hovered below 20,000. That year, they jumped to more than 102,000 during what was a catastrophic period for air carriers, given travel restrictions and plummeting demand for flying. Airlines struggled to ramp capacity back up in 2021 and 2022, resulting in plenty of cancellations and delays.",
      "At the top 10 U.S. airlines, cancellations rose from 1.28% of flights in 2023 to 1.36% last year, resulting in a total of 102,908 canceled flights in 2024, according to the report. Delays also worsened, with 78.1% of flights arriving on time last year, down from 78.3% in 2023. In total, roughly 1.7 million flights were either delayed or canceled in 2024.",
      "Nationwide air traffic controller shortages could lead to more snarls in schedules for the remainder of 2025, PIRG said.",
      "One relative bright spot in the report: Airlines mishandled fewer bags and wheelchairs in 2024 compared to the previous year. While that showed some modest improvement, 2.7 million bags were still lost or damaged, as were 11,357 wheelchairs and scooters.",
      "The carrier with the highest rate of complaints per 100,000 passengers: Frontier Airlines, which had the worst cancellation record, worst record for on-time arrivals and worst record for involuntary bumping, PIRG found. It ranked second-worst for the share of wheelchairs that it mishandled.",
      "\"That's a lot of worsts,\" Murray said.",
      "There are steps consumers can take to make travel less painful, Murray noted. For one, she recommends that passengers always download an airline's app for up-to-date flight schedule information.",
      "She also suggests putting an AirTag or similar device in both checked and carry-one luggage in case an airline requires that it be checked at the gate.",

      "The go-to store for brides on a budget has launched a higher-end, bricks-and-mortar chain called Diamonds & Pearls that offers dresses ranging from $700 to more than $5,000. David's expansion into the luxury segment comes two years after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2023, citing inflation and pressures.",
      "The first Diamonds & Pearls store opened Thursday in Delray Beach, Florida. David's operates 193 stores across the U.S., selling gowns that range in cost from $500 to $3,000.",

      "\"We found that 90% of all brides were in David's funnel, but we didn't have products to serve the couture bride, or the budget bride. We only had products to serve the middle,\" Cook said. \"Affordable luxury is the fastest-growing segment we have.\"",
      "Cook explained that brides are under pressure as tariffs weigh on the cost of weddings, which stands at $37,500 on average, she said. An\u00a0estimate from Fidelity pegs the average cost of a wedding in 2024 at $33,000.",
      "David's solved the budget consumer's end of the equation first. In March, it began selling wedding dresses for as little as $99, under the DB Studio label. And in December 2024, David's partnered with delivery service DoorDash to let customers order dresses on the app and have them delivered in minutes \u2014 along with dessert.",
      "Roughly 17% of David's brides are shopping for dresses for weddings that are within three weeks, \"So we have to serve the last-minute brides,\" Cook said.",
      "Now, it's moving up the luxury scale, offering made-to-order dresses, including gowns from designers like Marchesa and Viola Chan, and serving champagne to brides-to-be at its Diamonds & Pearls store. The company has plans to open at least one more Diamonds & Pearls store this year, Cook said.",
      "Cook's ultimate goal for the company is to serve every type of consumer \u2014 including grooms \u2014 along every step of the wedding planning process. That includes launching its own AI-powered wedding planning tools, video content and more.",
      "The company is now in a growth spurt, undeterred by President Trump's evolving tariff program\u00a0that is dissuading some companies from investing in growth. Mr. Trump had imposed tariffs of as high as 145% on Chinese imports, which now stand at 30% for a period of 90 days.",
      "Although it previously produced 67% of its own line of dresses in China, David's plans to move all of its production out of China by the end of June, according to Cook, adding that its factories in Myanmar, India and Vietnam will pick up the slack.",

      "When his new shipments began arriving two weeks ago, he was hit with President Trump's 145% tariff on Chinese goods. The duty tax bills he received from U.S. Customs ranged from $9,000 to $21,000.",
      "Prior to the tariff hike, Djavaheri said he would have paid \"a couple hundred dollars\" on a shipment.",
      "\"People need to understand that when you have a very low-margin business, it makes it almost impossible to do business,\" Djavaheri said.",
      "But now, just two weeks later \u2014 with the tariff on Chinese imports reduced to 30% for at least 90 days following a truce Monday between the United States and China \u2014 Djavaheri said he has had to pivot again.",
      "He said the 30% tariff is still \"not cheap,\" especially on higher-priced goods.",
      "\"We've increased prices on everything,\" Djavaheri said.",
      "He's now rushing to order products for the holiday shopping season.",
      "\"Shipping prices have already tripled,\" Djavaheri added.",
      "The situation leaves many U.S. businesses facing a dilemma: They can either pay more to ship at the current 30% tariff rate on China, or wait in the hope that the Trump administration will lower the tariffs further.",
      "\"The duties are a huge outlay of cash that these businesses are facing,\" Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a logistics company that helps businesses move goods, told CBS News. \"And a lot of them are in a position where they don't want to just pay that right away. They'd rather leave the goods here until the last minute when they need them.\"",

      "One week into a new job, Lisa Grouette discovered something missing come Sunday night: the sinking feeling of dread she used to experience before going to work every Monday.",
      "Grouette spent 10 years at an insurance agency with a boss whom she alleges screamed at her, slammed his hands on the desk, insulted her appearance and punched things. He falsely accused her of taking money and threatened to withhold an employment recommendation if she quit, she says.",
      "Fearing she wouldn't land another job if she left the toxic workplace, she stayed. \"It was this implied, 'You're stuck,'\" Grouette, 48, recalled.",
      "Indeed, despite the unemployment rate still hovering at a historic low\u00a0at 4.2%, for an increasing number of out-of-work Americans, it's taking longer to find a new job. Meanwhile, the gap between what Americans earn and how much they need to bring in to achieve a basic standard of living is growing, according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0by the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity.",
      "Grouette, however, eventually found a way out of her toxic workplace. When a full-time job opened up at a newspaper where she was working a part-time photography job, she resigned from the insurance agency. The new position paid $400 less per month, but Grouette reduced her expenses to make it work.",
      "\"You can't put a price tag on it,\" she said. \"It was the best 400 bucks a month I've ever spent, worth every penny. I was a little tight at first, but it didn't matter because I was happy.\"",
      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes unhealthy behavior and the kinds of treatment people will not \u2014 or should not \u2014 tolerate for a steady paycheck.",
      "\"We're developing language now around things like toxic workplaces,\" said Jennifer Tosti-Kharas, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College in Massachusetts.",
      "Disagreement vs. abuse",
      "Younger generations entering the workforce, including millennials and members of Generation Z, are less willing to endure bullying behavior from colleagues and managers, and better at establishing boundaries, she said.",
      "At the start of her own career, \"if I encountered toxicity in the workplace, I had more of a 'Suck it up' attitude,\" said Tosti-Kharas, who identifies as a member of Generation X. \"I don't think we were as vocal about taking care of our mental health as we should have been.\"",
      "Conflicts and difficult relationships may be inevitable in any work environment. But there's a difference between an occasional disagreement and persistent abuse.",
      "\"What makes something toxic: It's more pervasive, more consistent over time,\" Tosti-Kharas said. \"You may have tried some things and it's not getting better. ... It's very deeply entrenched.\"",
      "Possible indications of an emotionally harmful workplace include a widespread lack of trust and fear of being shot down if you speak up, she said.",
      "Loud screamers aren't the only kind of toxic co-workers and supervisors. There are quieter forms of toxicity, such as passive-aggressive behavior by leaders who use sarcasm, backhanded compliments, indirect criticism and exclusion to control their employees, according to Alana Atchison, a clinical psychologist based in Chicago.",
      "\"It is a relationship where you can't communicate clearly or directly, so you have to silence yourself. You can't say truly what you need to say and feel safe,\" Atchison said.",
      "Follow your gut",
      "To spot a potentially toxic environment when applying for a new job, follow your gut instincts and consider warning signs. For example, frequent ads for the same position may reflect high turnover resulting from a negative environment. You can also search employee reviews online.",
      "\"I'm reading Glassdoor reviews like crazy to see what the environment is like, what the culture is like, on anyplace I'm applying to, because I can't lose my hair again over a job,\" said Grouette, who recently was laid off after several successful years at the newspaper.",
      "When on the receiving end of toxicity, consider whether the offending behavior says more about the person perpetuating it than the recipient.",
      "\"It's almost like a smokescreen to hide their deficits,\" Atchison said. \"If someone feels insecure about their role or fears being overshadowed, they might resort to undermining others, gossiping or sabotaging projects to regain a sense of control or safety.\"",
      "More complaints since COVID-19",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Atchison's clients have increasingly complained about toxic work environments. She attributes that in part to the social isolation that accompanied lockdowns and restrictions on public activities.",
      "\"Socializing is a skill set, and that skill set has declined,\" she said.",
      "If you find yourself in a toxic work situation, talking about it with a trusted friend or professional therapist can help you process what is happening and develop a plan to deal with it, instead of letting it fester in your mind.",
      "Stephanie Strausser, 42, a video production manager, said she sought support from friends and family members when she worked under an extreme micromanager who made her feel unsafe and whose decisions she considered unethical.",
      "Document your concerns",
      "\"Don't hide it or keep it in. Talk to people. Even if you're talking to ChatGPT,\" Strausser advises those who find themselves in similar circumstances. \"Don't internalize it. And don't take someone's perception as fact.\"",
      "Amanda Szmuc, a Philadelphia lawyer who considers some of her past work environments to have been toxic, recommends documenting your concerns in case it becomes necessary to escalate them.",
      "Writing down the details of troubling interactions as they happen and keeping copies of inappropriate messages or approved meeting recordings may come in handy if the human resources department gets involved, for example.",
      "Maintaining a record may also help you avoid gaslighting and reinforce your determination to protect yourself.",
      "If leaving a toxic environment isn't financially possible or you want to try to make your circumstances more bearable, think about exploring ways to limit your interaction with the difficult party may be an option.",
      "Possibilities may include negotiating a role that puts distance between you and the toxic person, such as working different shifts or on different projects, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "You can also set deadlines for yourself to keep things from deteriorating, according to Szmuc. Examples: \"I'm going to give this two weeks. Is there any improvement?\" she said. \"Is there a way internally where I can maybe change my circumstances or get someone else's opinion?\"",
      "Human resources may or may not help",
      "Ideally, an employee who feels mistreated could appeal to someone from human resources or the offending employee's manager with evidence to show a pattern of conduct violations and disciplinary action would be taken, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "But that doesn't always happen, leaving the reporting party in close proximity with the person they reported. \"In the real world, you may realize they are unlikely to go anywhere, and it's you who has to go somewhere,\" Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "In extreme situations, it's best to look for another job, she said.",
      "If an inspector found radon in your house, \"you wouldn't say, 'Let me try to work with the radon,' or 'How can I keep it there but maybe lessen the effects?'\" she said. \"You would get the toxin out of the situation or you would get yourself out of the situation.\"",
      "Most people can't afford to leave their jobs without another one lined up. Carving out time to apply for different jobs is difficult when you feel under assault but also is empowering and may lead to a better situation.",
      "\"If somebody gives you an impression that you're not able to leave this job, that's just not true,\" Grouette said. \"Those sorts of people don't have the reach or respect that they claim to have, because if they're volatile to you, they're volatile to others.\"",

    "summary": "Seniors are unlikely to get a break on paying taxes on their Social Security benefits, an issue that impacts more people each year.",
    "story": [
      "Republican-backed legislation now winding its way through the House includes a number of\u00a0tax breaks promised by President Trump during the campaign, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay, as well as sharply lowering lowering rates on corporations. One tax break that isn't in the bill: Mr. Trump's\u00a0suggestion\u00a0last year that seniors shouldn't have to pay income taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security and they won't,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0while during an August campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",
      "A provision to eliminate taxes on Social Security isn't included in the bill approved by the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday. If the measure passes the House, it would then move to the Senate. The bill would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other temporary reductions.",
      "The reason for the Social Security exclusion boils down to a prohibition on making changes to the retirement program through the so-called reconciliation process, a legislative procedure Republicans are relying on to pass the bill, said Maria Freese, the senior legislative representative at the The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. That process represents a fast-track option that obviates the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance a bill in the Senate, she said.",
      "Trying to change the Social Security program through reconciliation would have violated what is known as the\u00a0Byrd rule, a rule (named after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what can be included in reconciliation bills, she explained.",
      "Instead of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, the House bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older.",
      "Called an \"enhanced deduction for seniors,\" it would be available to people who both itemize and those who take the standard deduction. That could help lower taxes for the roughly 56 million people in the U.S. who are 65 or older.",
      "Currently, about 40% of Social Security recipients \u2014 or about 27 million people \u2014 pay federal income taxes on their benefits, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"I'm sure there are a lot of seniors who would be quite disappointed they will continue to pay taxes\" on their benefits, Freese said.",
      "Social Security's fiscal outlook",
      "Social Security benefits were excluded from income taxes until 1984, when changes signed into law by President Ronald Reagan introduced taxes on Social Security income above a certain threshold.",
      "Because that threshold wasn't indexed to inflation, the number of older Americans who are required to pay income taxes on their benefits has steadily risen. The share of seniors who pay taxes on their benefits is now 40%, up from was 26% in 1998,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Those taxes directly support the Social Security and Medicare programs, providing about $50 billion in annual revenue,\u00a0according to the latest\u00a0annual report\u00a0from Social Security's board of trustees.",
      "Meanwhile, eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would hurt the long-term outlook of both the retirement program and of Medicare, the health insurance program for people 65 and older, according the Peter G. Peterson Institute, a think tank focusing on fiscal policy.",
      "Without that source of revenue, the trust fund for Social Security would be depleted in 2032, one year earlier than currently projected, while Medicare's trust fund would be depleted in 2030, six years earlier than forecast now, the group added.",
      "The result would be \"automatic cuts for millions of beneficiaries,\" the institute noted.",
      "Scrapping taxes on Social Security might sound appealing to many senior citizens in the near-term, but over the long term that would weaken the stability of the program, Freese said.",
      "\"We viewed it as a bait and switch,\" she said. \"You give some seniors a benefit upfront, but don't tell them that all seniors would run the risk of across-the-board cuts sooner than they would under current law.\"",

Container bookings from China to the U.S. dropped as much as 60% following the pre-tariff spike in imports according to Flexport, a supply chain management company.",
      "Powell acknowledged at the conference that the economic environment has changed since the Fed's last strategy meeting in 2020, when interest rates were far lower than they are today.",
      "\"Longer-term interest rates are a good deal higher now, driven largely by real rates given the stability of longer-term inflation expectations,\" Powell said on Thursday, referring to interest rates adjust for inflation.",
      "The federal funds rate currently sits at 4.25% to 4.50%. The Fed last week decided to hold that rate steady \u2014 \u00a0a sign it is still weighing the economic risks posed by the Trump administration's tariffs. The central bank is scheduled to meet again in mid-June, where it's expected to maintain its benchmark rate at its current range, according to\u00a0predictions from CME FedWatch.",

      "On Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of the bill, which would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other reductions.",
      "The extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions would mean that most taxpayers wouldn't see much of a change because their tax brackets would remain at the same levels they've been at since the cuts took effect in 2018. Without an extension, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "Aside from extending the 2017 tax cuts, the proposed bill would provide taxpayers with an average $1,300 tax reduction, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. Some of the additional tax cuts include those promised on the campaign trail by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on overtime pay, as well as new provisions that would lower taxes for senior citizens and parents.",
      "The proposed bill is likely to change as it moves through the legislative process, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, aiming to send it to the Senate by Memorial Day. Democratic lawmakers have opposed the bill for its proposed cuts to Medicaid\u00a0and food stamps, part of the GOP's goal to find $880 billion in savings to help pay for the tax cuts.",
      "Some Democrats also pointed out that some of the tax cuts promised by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on tips, would expire after 2028, limiting the benefits.",
      "\"[T]hey made provisions like addressing taxes on tips and overtime pay temporary, as opposed to the cuts for the richest 1%, which they made permanent,\" said Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, in a statement.",
      "Still, the bill released Wednesday by the House's tax panel provides a laundry list of tax breaks that could soon become law. Here's what the legislation would do:",
      "Adds a new $4,000 deduction for people 65 and older",
      "Senior citizens who are 65 and older would get a new tax benefit \u2014 an extra deduction of $4,000 per filer.",
      "The new deduction could be used by people who either itemize or take the standard deduction. But there would be an income limit, with the $4,000 deduction available for people with a modified adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for single filers and $150,000 for married couples who file joint returns.",
      "The tax break would be available starting in the current 2025 tax year and extend through 2028.",
      "By contrast, for seniors the latest version of the House bill has one notable omission: There's no plan to eliminate taxes on Social Security income, as Mr. Trump promised in his campaign.",
      "Proposing to scrap income taxes on Social Security proved controversial because those taxes directly fund the retirement program. That would likely hasten the\u00a0insolvency of its trust funds, policy experts have warned.",
      "Increases the standard deduction for all taxpayers",
      "The current standard deduction, which was expanded under the 2017 tax bill, is set to expire on Dec. 31. The House GOP bill would make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's bigger deduction permanent, as well as give it a boost.",
      "Starting in the current 2025 tax year through 2028, here's how the standard deduction would increase:",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000",
      "Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000",
      "Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "The standard deduction reduces your tax liability because it lowers your taxable income by that amount. For instance, single taxpayers earning $50,000 would reduce their taxable income to $34,000 for the 2025 tax year under the proposed standard deduction.",
      "Extends and increases the Child Tax Credit",
      "The House bill also extends the $2,000 Child Tax Credit, which otherwise would revert to its pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act level of $1,000 per eligible child starting in 2026. That change would be permanent, the House Ways and Means Committee said.",
      "The proposal would also increase the Child Tax Credit to $2,500 per child for the current 2025 tax year through 2028, after which it would drop back to $2,000.",
      "Eliminates the 1099-K reporting rule",
      "The proposed legislation would also abolish a\u00a0controversial rule that would have required payment platforms like Venmo or Paypal to send 1099-K tax forms to anyone receiving over $600.",
      "Previously, such payment services only had to report users' income to the Internal Revenue Service if they had more than 200 transactions, exceeding $20,000 in revenue. The IRS had delayed the implementation of the $600 rule after pushback from some online platforms as well as from Republican lawmakers.",
      "Increases the pass-through deduction for small businesses",
      "The pass-through deduction for small businesses, which was enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, also would increase under the House bill.",
      "The deduction allows small businesses, including partnerships, sole proprietorships (who are often gig workers) and S corporations, to subtract 20% of their qualified business income from their taxes, lowering their tax liability. Under the new bill, the deduction would rise to 23%.",
      "Eliminates taxes on tips",
      "This follows Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to eliminate taxes on tipped income, but it would apply only from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "The provision would create \"an above-the-line deduction for qualified tips received by an individual in an occupation which traditionally and customarily receives tips during a given taxable year,\" according to a summary of the bill from the House Ways and Means Committee.",
      "Eliminates taxes on overtime pay",

    "story": [
      "Ford Motor is recalling 273,789 Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition vehicles because of a poorly installed front brake line that may lead to reduced brake function increasing the risk of crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u00a0said in recall dated May 9.",
      "Affected vehicles may have \"a bent brake line\" that could come into contact with the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, which is a hose used to transfer filtered air from the car's air filter to it engine. As a result, the outlet pipe may become damaged, resulting in a brake fluid leak, causing the vehicle's front brakes to stop working, recall documents\u00a0state.",
      "\"A brake line leak may cause a longer-than-expected brake pedal travel and result in a reduction in the rate of deceleration. If there is a rapid loss of brake fluid or the brake fluid is completely depleted, this can extend the distance required to stop the vehicle, increasing the risk of a crash,\" the NHTSA states in its report.",

      "The cause of the bent brake line stems from faulty assembly during the vehicles' engine installation process at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant. An internal review of plant records conducted by the U.S. carmaker's Critical Concern Review Group earlier this year, discovered that modifications to the engine installation process had been make by the Louisville plant in November in order to prevent damage to the brake line.",

This modification was done to prevent the brake line from being bent and was made starting on Nov. 20, 2024 to ensure proper clearances were met,\" the recall documents say.",

      "Homeownership is considered a mainstay of the American dream, but a shortage of affordable homes is blocking that pathway for many middle-income families, according to a new analysis from the National Association of Realtors.",
      "Only about 1 in 5 listed homes in March were affordable for households with $75,000 in annual income, down from about half of all listings before the pandemic, according to the analysis of property listings in the nation's biggest 100 cities. To get back to that pre-pandemic level of affordable homes, the U.S. would have to add more than 400,000 new listings priced at $255,000 or below, it found.",
      "The median sale price in the first-quarter of 2025 was almost $420,000, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many homes out of the price range for middle-class households, said Nadia Evangelou, senior economist and director of real estate research at the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The affordability gap has its roots in the housing crisis that started in 2006, which caused new construction to dry up for years afterward, she added.",
      "The lack of affordable homes is partly responsible for driving up prices even higher, as would-be buyers often bid up home prices to secure a property, Evangelou said. The result: More middle-income families are getting shut out of the housing market in many regions.",
      "\"It's discouraging for many people now,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We hear from people who are earning a good income, and still feel homeownership is out of reach.\"",
      "These households represent people in careers such as nursing and teaching and in trades like plumbing, she added. \"The middle-income buyers are the backbone of the housing market, so we need homes they can actually afford,\" Evangelou said.",
      "Where the affordability gap is worst",
      "Twenty-six of the biggest 100 cities have affordability gaps that are worsening, the NAR research found. The cities with the worst affordability gaps are frequently in regions with zoning or permitting restrictions that make it difficult to construct new properties, Evangelou added.",
      "They range from high-cost cities like Los Angeles to more affordable areas like the Harrisburg-Carlisle and Scranton in Pennsylvania, the report found.",
      "Partly because of restrictive zoning rules, Pennsylvania ranked 44th out of all U.S. states in the pace of new housing built from 2017 to 2023, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit foundation that conducts research on areas that shape public policy.",
      "Even though Pennsylvania isn't seeing the same type of population growth as states like Texas or Florida, housing costs in the state have surged due to its lack of building over the past several years, Pew added. The biggest increases were in the state's northeastern region, which includes Scranton and Philadelphia, it noted.",
      "Where housing availability is improving",
      "Thirty cities are showing improvements in affordable listings, including metropolitan areas such as Raleigh-Cary, North Carolina and Columbia, South Carolina, the research found. These areas saw the availability of affordable listings increase by 5% in the last year.",
      "Columbia, for one, has seen an increase in construction, with more properties such as townhomes built in the last few years, according to South Carolina's The State publication.",
      "Another 44 cities are stuck in the middle, neither improving nor decreasing in their share of affordable listings, the NAR analysis found.",
      "Both federal and local initiatives could help spur more homebuilding, helping relieve the affordability crunch in many regions, Evangelou said. For instance, easing zoning and building regulations could encourage more builders to construct new homes, while the federal and state governments could bolster downpayment assistance programs.",
      "Innovative forms of housing could also help, according to new research from Pew Charitable Trusts. For instance, it singled out so-called micro-apartments, which are small, co-living designs where residents share kitchens and bathrooms \u2014 like a college dormitory \u2014 as a low-cost way to provide more housing.",

      "\"Sports and sports culture continue to be incredibly powerful, and with this acquisition, we'll create a new global platform that serves those ever evolving needs through iconic concepts consumers know and love, enhanced store designs and omnichannel experiences, as well as a product mix that appeals to our different customer bases,\" Dick's CEO Lauren Hobart said in a statement.",
      "Skechers announced that it was being taken private earlier this month by the investment firm by 3G Capital in a transaction worth more than $9 billion.",
      "Foot Locker shareholders can choose to receive either $24 in cash or 0.1168 shares of Dick's common stock for each Foot Locker share that they own.",

      "Shares of sporting goods and athletic shoe companies have been under pressure all year. Before the Dick's deal, Foot Locker's stock price has tumbled more than 40% this year. Foot Locker shares surged $10.90, or nearly 85%, to $23.78 after the start of trade on Thursday.",
      "About 97% of the clothes and shoes purchased in the U.S. are imported, predominantly from Asia, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Using factories overseas has kept labor costs down for U.S. companies, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb price increases due to new tariffs.",
      "Foot Locker offers Dick's a lot of potential, namely its huge real estate footprint, and would give the Pittsburgh company its first foothold overseas.",
      "\"The addition of Foot Locker, with its 4.3% share of the sporting goods market, would produce an immediate boost,\" retail industry analysts Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, said in an email. \"It would also give Dick's substantially more bargaining power with national brands, especially in the sneaker space. As the chains operate in a similar segment there would also likely be scope for synergistic savings.\"",
      "Foot Locker has about 2,400 retail stores across 20 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. It also has a licensed store presence in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The company had global sales of $8 billion last year.",
      "\"While there is some overlap between the locations, the nature of the stores is different, and Foot Locker would give Dick's access to a wider selection of malls and customers,\" Saunders said.",
      "Dick's said that it expects to close the Foot Locker deal in the second half of the year. The transaction still needs approval from Foot Locker shareholders.",

      "Patriot Front and other white nationalist groups are fueling the expansion of extremist groups in the U.S. \u2013 and control at least a dozen clubs nationwide. Since 2023, there has been a\u00a014% increase\u00a0in hate groups, according to the SPLC, which says it tracks 1,430 hate and antigovernment groups across the country.",
      "Active Clubs have had a presence since 2023 in at least 34 states, including Arizona, California, Ohio, Kansas, Montana, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Florida,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Counter Extremism Project. The SPLC says white nationalists use active clubs for recruitment. The groups host training sessions, create propaganda videos and participate in demonstrations and flash rallies, according to experts. They push male supremacy ideology, share workout selfies and encourage each other to reach peak physicality in preparation for marches or possible future conflicts, experts say.",
      "Robert Rundo, the founder of a white supremacist group based in Southern California, is credited with introducing the idea of Active Clubs, according to the Anti-Defamation League. In 2021, Rundo began hosting a podcast called \"Active Club Podcast,\" where he and his co-host encouraged listeners to establish their own clubs. He hawked what he called \"white nationalism 3.0\" \u2014 a more local, decentralized approach to the white nationalist movement.",
      "Rundo was arrested in Romania in 2023 after the U.S. requested his extradition on federal rioting charges. He was sentenced to two years and effectively received a time-served sentence, being released in December 2024.",
      "The shift to \"white nationalism 3.0\" is similar to leaderless resistance concepts across the far right ecosystem, said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University.",
      "\"I think a lot of these groups really function more like brands,\" he said.",
      "Audio messages and a leaked internal memo obtained by the SPLC confirmed direct affiliations between Patriot Front and certain Active Clubs. The founder of a Texas active club was berated for recruiting \"non-European\" members.",
      "\"Is our organization something you are totally committed to, or are you going to be the active club guy doing your own thing?\" The Patriot Front member asked, according to the SPLC report.",
      "The new recruitment method has coincided with Patriot Front's faltering brand, the SPLC says, after years of controversies stemming from various lawsuits and acts of vandalism. In January, Patriot Front was\u00a0ordered to pay\u00a0$2.7 million in damages to a Black musician the group attacked during a march in Boston in 2022. In February, a\u00a0settlement\u00a0was reached between Patriot Front and two North Dakota nonprofits over allegations that the group intimidated immigrant business owners.",
      "Patriot Front has also faced scrutiny from within the right-wing movement. \"In some sections of this larger far right, Patriot Front is branded as federal agents,\" Tischauser said. \"So to avoid that accusation, they use Active Clubs and start trying to groom people into Patriot Front membership from there.\"",
      "The conspiracy theory even gained enough traction on social media to reach Elon Musk. Last year, he posted on\u00a0X, \"This does seem odd. Why no mask removal after arrest?\" in reaction to a post of Patriot Front members being detained, where an X user dubbed the group \"Fed Front.\"",
      "The conspiracy that FBI agents pose as right-wing activists goes beyond Patriot Front. A Washington Post-University of Maryland\u00a0poll\u00a0found that a quarter of Americans believe the FBI instigated the\u00a0Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the FBI and Patriot Front's founder and leader, Thomas Rosseau, via email.",
      "Lewis said that there has been a mainstreaming of conspiracy theories and hateful beliefs once confined to neo-Nazi forums and considered to be fringe.",
      "\"Today, you have the richest man in the world,\u00a0members of Congress\u00a0tweeting this out, as if it's like a real thing that's happening,\" Lewis said. \"That just broadens out the aperture of disaffected young, predominantly white men who are looking for someone to blame, something to blame.\"",
      "Since these clubs are scattered, unaffiliated entities, Patriot Front has faced challenges in its recruitment efforts.",
      "\"They want to project themselves as much larger and much more serious than they actually are,\" said Lewis.",

    "published": "Sat, 17 May 2025 07:59:44 -0400",
    "summary": "Former President Joe Biden's speech is marked with long pauses and a halting delivery in a recording of his interview about classified documents released Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Snippets from a 2023 interview that led Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur to describe former President Joe Biden as an \"elderly man with a poor memory\" were obtained and published by Axios Friday, showing Biden's halting tone of voice and difficulty remembering dates.",
      "CBS News has confirmed the audio matches the transcript of the interview released by the Biden White House in 2024.",
      "In one four-minute clip, Biden was asked by Hur's team \u2014 which was investigating Biden's handling of classified records \u2014 about where he kept his documents shortly after leaving office as vice president. Biden's response is marked by long pauses, and his voice appears hoarse at times. His speech is especially halting as he describes the period around his son Beau's death.",
      "In the audio obtained by news outlet Axios, Biden can also be heard struggling to remember the year when Beau died or the year when President Trump was first elected. Members of his staff can be heard correcting him or reminding him of the date.",
      "A written transcript of the five-hour interview was released last year, but portions of the audio released Friday provide context on Biden's demeanor and memory problems at certain points in the session.",
      "In response to the audio, Biden spokesperson Kelly Scully told CBS News in a statement, \"The transcripts were released by the Biden administration more than a year ago. The audio does nothing but confirm what is already public.\"",
      "Biden's verbal delivery was a key part of Hur's report. The special counsel wrote in February 2024 that Biden sounded like a \"sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" Hur said it's a view jurors may share, making it hard to convict Biden of knowingly holding sensitive documents at his home and office. Hur's report noted \"significant limitations\" to Biden's memory, including his difficulty remembering when his son died.",
      "Hur recommended against charging Biden with a crime, though he did conclude that Biden \"willfully\" retained government documents.",
      "At the time, Biden and his allies reacted furiously to Hur's report \u2014 especially the \"elderly man with a poor memory\" line and the comment about Beau Biden's death.",
      "\"There's even a reference that I don't remember when my son died. How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself it wasn't any of their damn business,\" Biden said last year. \"I don't need anyone to tell me when he passed away.\"",
      "Biden's personal attorney Bob Bauer called the report a \"shabby piece of work\" filled with \"totally inappropriate and pejorative comments.\" The Biden White House counsel's office asked Hur's team to revise the report, calling its references to Biden's memory \"inflammatory.\"",
      "The report was released as concerns swirled about Biden's age and fitness to run for another term, though at the time, Democratic officials publicly backed Biden and slammed Hur. Republicans, meanwhile, cited the report as evidence of Biden's fading cognitive abilities and pushed for audio of the interview to be released. Biden was 80 years old at the time of Hur's interview.",
      "But months later, Biden's rocky June debate against Mr. Trump \u2014 in which he repeatedly struggled to complete his sentences \u2014 reignited worries about his age, leading to Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race amid pressure from his party.",
      "Biden's decisions during that period have drawn new scrutiny in recent weeks, as books that offer glimpses inside his campaign hit the shelves. Some of the books describe Biden's struggles with age, his aides' maneuvers to keep him in the race and the abrupt shift from Biden to eventual nominee Kamala Harris weeks after the Trump-Biden debate.",
      "Biden has strongly denied any lapses in his cognitive ability, telling \"The View\" last week, \"there's nothing to sustain that.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump suggested Friday his swipe at Taylor Swift last year has hurt her popularity.",
      "\"Has anyone noticed that, since I said 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,' she's no longer 'HOT?',\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post Friday, as he flew back from the Middle East to the U.S. after the first major overseas trip of his second term.",
      "A White House official told CBS News: \"As a business and entertainment mogul President Trump is highly qualified to comment on the rise and fall of various celebrities,\" including Swift.",
      "Mr. Trump posted \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" last fall, days after the singer endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris. Swift's Eras tour was still in progress at the time. The post was quickly overshadowed by news of a second assassination attempt against Mr. Trump hours later.",
      "It wasn't clear what prompted Mr. Trump's mid-air musing about Swift. The pop megastar has been keeping a lower public profile in recent weeks. Her Eras tour has ended, and boyfriend Travis Kelce's football season is over. Swift fans caught a glimpse of her at a Mother's Day brunch in Philadelphia with the Kelce family, but she's been photographed less frequently, except for the occasional date night, since the Kansas City Chiefs lost their Super Bowl bid.",
      "Mr. Trump lashed out at Bruce Springsteen less than an hour later, calling him \"Highly Overrated\" and mocking what he called his \"atrophied\" skin, days after Springsteen called the Trump administration \"treasonous\" at a concert in the U.K.",
      "The president's digs at Swift and Springsteen came at the tail end of a four-day tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. During the trip, Mr. Trump met with allied Arab leaders, pledged to drop sanctions against Syria in a surprise move and announced a set of economic deals with Gulf states. Shortly before the trip started, reports emerged that Qatar would donate a Boeing 747 for Mr. Trump's use, drawing ethics concerns \u2014 though Mr. Trump defended the move.",
      "The bad blood between Swift and the president extends back years. Swift has only occasionally waded into politics, but has endorsed Mr. Trump's opponents twice, backing former President Joe Biden in 2020 and Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024. Last year, she suggested she endorsed Harris in part because Mr. Trump had shared images on Truth Social that implied Swift supported him.",
      "In endorsing Harris, Swift said she was \"a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\"",
      "Swift also endorsed Democrat Phil Bredesen in his unsuccessful 2018 race against Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, whom Swift called \"Trump in a wig\" in a documentary released in early 2020.",
      "Mr. Trump responded to the 2018 endorsement by saying, \"I like Taylor's music about 25% less now,\" adding that Swift \"doesn't know anything about\" Blackburn.",
      "Mr. Trump called Swift \"unusually beautiful\" and said, \"I hear she's very talented\" in a 2023 interview with Variety editor Ramin Setoodeh \u2014 but questioned her stated political views.",
      "\"She's legitimately liberal? It's not an act? It surprises me that a country star can be successful being liberal,\" Mr. Trump said of the crossover star to Setoodeh, according to excerpts published by Variety last year.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency is \"not ready\" for hurricane season in June, according to an internal review obtained by CBS News\u2014 as FEMA contends with staff cuts and a push by President Trump to eliminate the nation's disaster relief agency.",
      "The powerpoint presentation was created after FEMA's new acting leader, David Richardson, ordered the agency to review hurricane preparedness, with storm season roughly two weeks away. In a series of slides, dated May 12, FEMA identified apparent problems at the disaster relief agency, including a need to \"refocus on its core mission while preparing for the 2025 Hurricane Season.\"",
      "\"As FEMA transforms to a smaller footprint, the intent for this hurricane season is not well understood, thus FEMA is not ready,\" said one of the slides.",
      "Elsewhere in the presentation, it says most of FEMA's readiness process for hurricane season \"has been derailed this year due to other activities like staffing and contracts\" \u2014 an apparent reference to layoffs of probationary workers and sweeping changes to FEMA's contract workforce.",
      "\"It has not been normal hurricane season preparedness yet,\" the slides read.",
      "CNN was first to report on the internal document.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, an official at the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 which oversees FEMA \u2014 called the story \"grossly out of context\" and said FEMA is \"fully activated in preparation for Hurricane Season.\" The DHS official described the review's comments on hurricane season as \"one line in a nineteen-page slide deck and the unsubstantiated opinion of one official inside the agency.\"",
      "\"The slide was used during a daily meeting Acting Administrator David Richardson has held every day titled Hurricane Readiness Complex Problem Solving. In other words, exactly what the head of an emergency management agency should be doing before Hurricane Season,\" the statement read.",
      "In a 30-minute town hall meeting with staff Thursday, Richardson would not say whether the agency is ready for hurricane season when asked, according to multiple FEMA employees. Richardson, who has been on the job for less than a week, responded that he's still working on it and should have a better idea within a couple of weeks.",
      "The official start of Atlantic hurricane season is June 1.",
      "The internal presentation also cites \"culture issues,\" staffing shortages and challenges coordinating with other federal agencies.",
      "Parts of the document seem to reference Mr. Trump's plan to shift more emergency response duties to the states. The slides say there's a perception that state officials are \"passing [the] buck\" to FEMA, and cite the need for \"managing expectations and understanding what FEMA's role is\" \u2014 suggesting the federal agency should offer \"supplemental assistance\" in some cases.",
      "During Thursday's town hall, Richardson cited California and Texas as examples of states that are capable of responding to their own natural disasters, multiple FEMA employees said. The comment raised eyebrows among several FEMA staff members who deployed to Texas' deadly winter cold snap in February 2021, causing hundreds of thousands to lose power.",
      "FEMA has faced a turbulent few months as it prepares for the Atlantic hurricane season. Mr. Trump has criticized the agency's handling of prior natural disasters, and has floated either scrapping FEMA or transforming it into a \"support agency\" that largely defers to the states.",
      "The agency laid off hundreds of probationary employees earlier this year. And in March, the agency indicated a large share of its workforce would be required to apply for contract extensions through DHS. The move could impact more than half of FEMA's workers, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "The agency's former acting head, Cameron Hamilton, was fired by the Trump administration last week and replaced by Richardson after Hamilton told lawmakers he doesn't believe eliminating FEMA is in the country's \"best interests\" \u2014 clashing with Mr. Trump's views.",
      "In his first all-hands meeting last week, Richardson told staff, \"Don't get in my way\u2026 I will run right over you,\" according to a recording obtained by CBS News.",
      "Richardson, a former Marine who attained the rank of lieutenant colonel, backed Mr. Trump's plan to shrink FEMA, and said he plans on looking for ways to \"push things down to the states\" and \"do more cost sharing with the states.\"",
      "\"I am as bent on achieving the President's intent as I was on making sure that I did my duty, where I took my Marines to Iraq, eleven of them,\" he said at last week's meeting.",

      "Comey was interviewed Friday by Secret Service agents investigating the post at their field office in Washington, D.C., two officials familiar with the matter told CBS News. The interview wrapped at approximately 7 p.m. ET, roughly 90 minutes after it was slated to begin, two sources familiar said.",
      "The image shared by Comey \u2014 a longtime Trump foe \u2014 showed seashells in sand arranged to form the numbers \"86 47,\" according to screenshots shared by Trump administration officials.",
      "He did not make his meaning clear, but administration officials and some of his supporters interpreted the numbers as referring to Mr. Trump's status as the 47th president and the slang term \"eighty-six,\" which has often been used to mean \"eject\" or \"remove.\"",
      "Comey later deleted the image. In a follow-up Instagram post Thursday night, Comey wrote that he \"posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message. I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.\"",

      "In a post Friday night on X, Noem confirmed that Secret Service agents had interviewed Comey, writing, in part: \"I will continue to take all measures necessary to ensure the protection of @POTUS Trump. This is an ongoing investigation.\"",
      "Current FBI Director Kash Patel said in a separate statement that, \"We are aware of the recent tweet by former FBI Director James Comey, directed at President Trump. We are in communication with the Secret Service and Director (Sean) Curran. Primary jurisdiction is with SS on these matters and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support.\"",
      "A Secret Service spokesperson told CBS News in a statement Thursday it \"vigorously investigates anything that can be taken as a potential threat against our protectees. We are aware of the social media posts by the former FBI Director and we take rhetoric like this very seriously. Beyond that, we do not comment on protective intelligence matters.\"",
      "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich wrote in his own social media post Comey's message \"can clearly be interpreted as 'a hit' on the sitting President of the United States,\" and said it is \"being taken seriously.\"",
      "Trump responds",
      "In an interview with Fox News, the president claimed Comey knew \"exactly what that meant\" when he posted the image on Instagram. \"That meant assassination, and it says it loud and clear,\" Mr. Trump told Fox's Bret Baier. He also called the post \"a terrible thing\" and Comey a \"dirty cop.\"",

      "That firing ultimately set into motion Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced those allegations as a \"hoax.\"",
      "For his part, Comey has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump since his firing, calling him \"morally unfit\" to be president in a 2018 interview.",
      "Mr. Trump was the target of two assassination attempts during his presidential campaign last year. During a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a 20-year-old gunman opened fire on Mr. Trump, grazing his ear with a bullet. One rally attendee was killed and two more were wounded.",
      "On Sept. 14, a man was arrested on allegations he attempted to assassinate Mr. Trump at his golf course in West Palm Beach by aiming a rifle through shrubbery.",

    "summary": "President Trump announced this week he will drop sanctions on Syria \u2014 surprising some senior Treasury officials, sources tell CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 For the leaders of Syria's transitional government, President Trump's announcement earlier this week that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on the country came as a relief after months of intense lobbying for a reprieve.",
      "\"I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,\" Mr. Trump said at an investment forum in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday.",
      "But inside the Treasury Department, which administers and enforces sanctions policy, the announcement came as a surprise to senior officials, sources tell CBS News.",
      "The announcement was also short on specifics, including which measures would be rolled back, and at what pace. The lack of clarity sent senior officials at Treasury scrambling to understand what he meant.",
      "Now, there are discussions inside Treasury to determine the speed and extent to which the decades-old sanctions \u2014 which restrict economic activity within Syria and its dealings with other countries \u2014 can be rolled back.",
      "A Treasury Spokesperson said Friday, \"President Trump is the Commander-in-Chief and the Treasury Department is in lockstep to execute his historic vision to bring peace and stability back to the Middle East.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers that he was with Mr. Trump when he decided to include the announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria in his speech in Riyadh. Rubio did not say when the president made the decision.",
      "\"This is something that had been discussed, worked on, options considered for many weeks leading up to this announcement and that we are going to be implementing what the president has announced as an administration,\" State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Some work was underway at Treasury before the president's announcement for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979.",
      "Indeed, Syria's transitional government \u2014 led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa \u2014 has pushed the Trump administration for sanctions relief in recent months.",
      "The new government has blamed sanctions \u2014 which include penalties on third countries for doing business in Syria \u2014 for its inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct sizable chunks of war-ravaged cities and rebuild a health-care system decimated by war.",
      "Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two U.S. allies in the region, have backed normalizing relations with Syria's new government. Both countries have provided aid to Syria, and Saudi Arabia has offered to pay off some of the country's debts, two activities that could run afoul of sanctions. The Saudis see an opportunity to win the new Syrian government over to their side, after decades of the country being allied with their top regional rival, Iran, while the Assad regime was in power.",
      "Relief was a key topic in meetings between Syrian officials, including its Central Bank Governor Abdelkadir Husrieh, and other world leaders at the IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings last month in Washington.",
      "Some of the most punitive measures were imposed over the last two decades on the former regime of Bashar al-Assad for human rights abuses and support for groups designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations. The Assad government collapsed in December as rebel groups, including fighters led by Sharaa, swept into Damascus, ending a 13-year-long civil war.",
      "In 2003, then-President George W. Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act into law, which centered on Syria's support for U.S.designated terror groups like Hezbollah, Syria's military presence in Lebanon, alleged development of weapons of mass destruction, oil smuggling and backing of armed groups in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion.",
      "In 2011, the Obama administration led an international effort to isolate Syria \u2014 culminating in multiple rounds of sanctions \u2014 as Assad's army fought a bloody civil war against rebel forces that led to half a million dead Syrians.",
      "Another package of sanctions were imposed in 2019 as part of the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, also known as the \"Caesar Act\" which Mr. Trump signed into law. The bill imposed stiff sanctions on Assad's government and companies or governments that worked with it, further crippling Syria's already isolated economy.",
      "Rubio indicated in his remarks in Turkey that relief may come in the form of waivers that give permission to do business in Syria without facing penalties for evading sanctions, which the administration can issue under authorities in the \"Caesar Act.\"",
      "\"I think we want to start with the initial waiver, which will allow foreign partners who wanted to flow in aid to begin to do so without running the risk of sanctions,\" Rubio said. He also suggested that the Trump Administration may be in a position \"soon\" to ask lawmakers to permanently repeal some sanctions."

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 18:37:44 -0400",
    "summary": "The greatest benefits would go to high-income households, while low-income families would see a much more modest boost, analyses show.",
    "story": [
      "The White House on Friday touted a Republican-backed tax bill as delivering \"PERMANENT tax cuts and bigger paychecks.\" Yet experts say the legislation would disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering far more modest gains to Americans lower down the ladder.",
      "If the bill is passed, households with more than $1 million in annual income would see their after-tax earnings rise by 4.3%, according to a new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a public policy think tank. The lowest-earning 20% of Americans would receive the smallest boost \u2014 their after-tax incomes would rise 0.6%, or an average of $90 annually, CBPP found.",
      "Other analyses have reached similar conclusions. The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution,\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the bottom 20% of Americans would see a 0.6% increase in after-tax income under the House tax bill, compared with a 3.7% increase for the top 20%.",
      "The fate of the GOP tax bill is unclear after five Republican members of the House Budget Committee on Friday voted against advancing the measure, dubbed the \"one big, beautiful, bill,\" saying the legislation does not do enough to slash federal spending.",
      "Such projections don't include the impact of cuts to federal programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which support many low- and middle-income households. Under the GOP bill, those services could face steep cuts, potentially bumping millions off Medicaid by adding work requirements and cutting federal funding provided to states to support the health care program.",
      "Those cuts could leave many low-income households worse off even after accounting for lower taxes, according to another analysis released Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania research group that analyzes the fiscal impact of public policies.",
      "The bottom 20% of households, who earn up to about $17,000 annually, would see their after-tax incomes drop by $1,035 in 2026, including a reduction in government benefits, the nonpartisan group found. The top 0.1%, who earn at least $4.3 million per year, would get an annual after-tax boost of about $389,000, Penn Wharton said.",
      "The White House took issue with the CBPP and Penn Wharton analyses.",
      "\"Once again, the experts are wrong, just as they were about the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have yielded trillions in investments, record job growth, and no inflation,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These experts should be embarrassed to share their 'expertise,' considering the egg still on their faces. MAGAnomics transcends conventional wisdom, and the President's One, Big, Beautiful Bill will continue to prove the haters wrong.\"",
      "The White House pointed to an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation that estimated the average tax bill would decline 11.1% in 2027 under the GOP legislation. The nonpartisan panel, which assess the impact of legislation for Congress, found that the biggest tax decrease would go to people earning $15,000 to $30,000, with a decline of 21.1%, while those earning more than $1 million would decline 8.6%",
      "Tariff impact",
      "Because low-income households spend a bigger share of their income on basics like food and clothing than wealthier Americans, they are likely to take a bigger financial hit from tariffs, experts including the nonpartisan\u00a0Yale Budget Lab have said. That could effectively wipe out the benefits from the tax cuts, according to some analysts.",
      "If inflation rises as a result of higher tariffs and tax cuts, the bottom 20% of U.S. households would lose $100 per year, largely due to paying higher costs for consumer goods that are imported from other countries, the CBPP found. Because tariffs are taxes on imports paid by U.S. businesses, they typically pass on the cost of such duties to consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"If we add just the effects of the tariffs the Trump Administration has put in place, the plan would still boost the rich while leaving the lowest-income people worse off because their tax cuts are so small,\" Brendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the CBPP, said in a post.",
      "Counting the impact of tariffs, the top 1% of households would still see their after-tax incomes increase by 3%, or almost $45,000, the think tank estimated. That analysis doesn't include the impact of cuts to services like Medicaid or food stamps.",
      "On Thursday, Walmart said it plans to hike prices this month to offset the cost of new tariffs introduced by the Trump administration.",
      "Extending the 2017 tax cuts",
      "As well as calling for deeper cuts in federal spending, the Republican lawmakers blocking the tax bill also want to move up\u00a0work requirements\u00a0for some Medicaid recipients, which under the current bill wouldn't kick in until 2029.",
      "Other Republicans want a bigger deduction cap on state and local taxes, known as SALT, that can be applied on people's\u00a0federal tax returns. The bill increases the cap on the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000.",
      "But the bill's basic outline for cutting taxes isn't a focus of debate among Republicans, who are seeking to extend Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill would also add a host of other cuts, such as eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, while also providing a more generous standard deduction.",

    "story": [
      "A pregnant woman in Georgia who was declared brain dead after a medical emergency has been on life support for three months to let the fetus grow enough to be delivered, a move her family says a hospital told them was required under the state's strict anti-abortion law.",
      "With her due date still more than three months away, it could be one of the longest such pregnancies. Her family is upset that Georgia's law, which restricts abortion once cardiac activity is detected, doesn't allow relatives to have a say in whether a pregnant woman is kept on life support.",
      "Georgia's\u00a0\"heartbeat law\" is among the restrictive abortion statutes that have been put in place in many conservative states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade\u00a0three years ago.",
      "Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old mother and nurse, was declared brain-dead - meaning she is legally dead - in February, her mother, April Newkirk, told Atlanta TV station WXIA.",
      "Newkirk said her daughter had intense headaches more than three months ago and went to Atlanta's Northside Hospital, where she received medication and was released. The next morning, her boyfriend woke to her gasping for air and called 911. Emory University Hospital determined she had blood clots in her brain and she was declared brain-dead.",
      "Newkirk said Smith is now 21 weeks pregnant. Removing breathing tubes and other life-saving devices would likely kill the fetus.",
      "A spokesperson for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said in a statement to CBS News on Friday, \"There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death.\"",
      "\"Removing life support is not an action 'with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,'\" the spokesperson said, quoting part of the law.",
      "Gov. Brian Kemp's office declined to comment on Smith's case and referred CBS News to the statement from the attorney general's spokesperson.",
      "Northside did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Emory Healthcare said it could not comment on an individual case because of privacy rules, but released a statement saying it \"uses consensus from clinical experts, medical literature, and legal guidance to support our providers as they make individualized treatment recommendations in compliance with Georgia's abortion laws and all other applicable laws. Our top priorities continue to be the safety and well-being of the patients we serve.\"",
      "Smith's family says Emory doctors have told them they are not allowed to stop or remove the devices that are keeping her breathing because state law bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected \u2014 generally around six weeks into pregnancy.",
      "The law was adopted in 2019 but not enforced until after Roe v. Wade\u00a0was overturned in the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling, opening the door to state abortion bans. Twelve states are enforcing bans on\u00a0abortion\u00a0at all stages of pregnancy and three others have bans like Georgia's that kick in after about six weeks.",
      "Like the others, Georgia's ban includes an exception if an abortion is necessary to maintain the woman's life. Those exceptions have been at the heart of legal and political questions, including a major Texas Supreme Court ruling last year that found the ban there applies even when there are major pregnancy complications.",
      "Smith's family, including her five-year-old son, still visit her in the hospital.",
      "Newkirk told WXIA that doctors told the family that the fetus has fluid on the brain and that they're concerned about his health.",
      "\"She's pregnant with my grandson. But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he's born,\" Newkirk said. She has not said whether the family wants Smith removed from life support.",
      "Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging Georgia's abortion law, said the situation is problematic.",
      "\"Her family deserved the right to have decision-making power about her medical decisions,\" Simpson said in a statement. \"Instead, they have endured over 90 days of retraumatization, expensive medical costs, and the cruelty of being unable to resolve and move toward healing.\"",
      "Lois Shepherd, a bioethicist and law professor at the University of Virginia, said she does not believe life support is legally required in this case.",
      "But she said whether a state could insist that Smith remains on life support is uncertain since the overturning of Roe, which found that fetuses do not have the rights of people.",
      "\"Pre-Dobbs, a fetus didn't have any rights,\" Shepherd said. \"And the state's interest in fetal life could not be so strong as to overcome other important rights, but now we don't know.\"",
      "The situation echoes a case in Texas more than a decade ago when a brain-dead woman was kept on life support for about two months because she was pregnant. A judge eventually ruled that the hospital was misapplying state law, and life support was removed.",
      "Brain death in pregnancy is rare. Even rarer still are cases in which doctors aim to prolong the pregnancy after a woman is declared brain-dead.",
      "\"It's a very complex situation, obviously, not only ethically but also medically,\" said Dr. Vincenzo Berghella, director of maternal fetal medicine at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.",
      "A 2021 review that Berghella co-authored scoured medical literature going back decades for cases in which doctors declared a woman brain-dead and aimed to prolong her pregnancy. It found 35.",
      "Of those, 27 resulted in a live birth, the majority either immediately declared healthy or with normal follow-up tests. But Berghella also cautioned that the Georgia case was much more difficult because the pregnancy was less far along when the woman was declared brain dead. In the 35 cases he studied, doctors were able to prolong the pregnancy by an average of just seven weeks before complications forced them to intervene.",
      "\"It's just hard to keep the mother out of infection, out of cardiac failure,\" he said.",
      "Berghella also found a case from Germany that resulted in a live birth when the woman was declared brain dead at nine weeks of pregnancy - about as far along as Smith was when she died.",
      "Georgia's law confers personhood on a fetus. Those who favor personhood say fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses should be considered people with the same rights as those already born.",
      "Georgia state Sen. Ed Setzler, a Republican who sponsored the 2019 law, said he supported Emory's interpretation.",
      "\"I think it is completely appropriate that the hospital do what they can to save the life of the child,\" Setzler said. \"I think this is an unusual circumstance, but I think it highlights the value of innocent human life. I think the hospital is acting appropriately.\"",
      "Setzler said he believes it is sometimes acceptable to remove life support from someone who is brain dead, but that the law is \"an appropriate check\" because the mother is pregnant. He said Smith's relatives have \"good choices,\" including keeping the child or offering it for adoption.",
      "Georgia's abortion ban has been in the spotlight before.",
      "Last year, ProPublica reported that two Georgia women died after they did not get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills. The stories of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller\u00a0entered into the presidential race, with Democrat Kamala Harris saying the deaths were the result of the abortion bans that went into effect in Georgia and elsewhere after Dobbs.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Friday said it will continue to block the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan men detained in northern Texas.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday said it will continue to block the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan men detained in northern Texas while they pursue a challenge to their removals under the wartime Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The order from the high court grants an emergency injunction sought by lawyers for a group of Venezuelan migrants who they said faced \"imminent\" risk of removal under President Trump's March proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. It maintains an early directive issued by the Supreme Court last month that temporarily prohibited the government from removing the Venezuelan migrants held at the Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Anson, Texas, under the 18th-century law. Some migrants removed under the law have been sent to a prison in El Salvador.",
      "The Supreme Court's April order, issued overnight, blocked the deportations \"until further order of this court.\"",
      "Shortly after the ruling Friday, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"THE SUPREME COURT WON'T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!\"",
      "Lee Gelernt, lead counsel in the ACLU's lawsuit against the administration over the deportations, said in a statement: \"The court's decision to stay removals is a powerful rebuke to the government's attempt to hurry people away to a Gulag-type prison in El Salvador.\"",
      "Friday's order was unsigned, and two justices dissented: Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas.",
      "The order said the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals was wrong to dismiss the detainees' appeal over lack of jurisdiction, vacating its judgement and remanding the case back to the court for further proceedings.",
      "The high court also said the plaintiffs in the case didn't receive enough notice to challenge their deportations under the Alien Enemies Act in court, pointing to the Trump administration's stated plan earlier in the case to deport them within about a day. But the justices did not specify exactly what kind of notice possible deportees should be granted, and said the Fifth Circuit should address that question.",
      "\"To be clear, we decide today only that the detainees are entitled to more notice than was given on April 18,\" the order read.",
      "The high court did not address whether the Trump administration has the legal right to deport Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act, and said lower courts should handle cases over the law \"expeditiously.\" It also noted that the government can use \"other lawful authorities\" other than the wartime law to remove the plaintiffs.",
      "\"We recognize the significance of the Government's national security interests as well as the necessity that such interests be pursued in a manner consistent with the Constitution. In light of the foregoing, lower courts should address AEA cases expeditiously,\" the court said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh concurred with the ruling, but argued the Supreme Court should have addressed the underlying questions immediately instead of sending it back down to lower courts. He pointed to conflicting rulings on whether the government can use the Alien Enemies Act and how much notice must be given to detainees \u2014 including a ruling in Pennsylvania earlier this week that became the first to rule Mr. Trump can use the 1798 law.",
      "\"The circumstances call for a prompt and final resolution, which likely can be provided only by this Court,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"At this juncture, I would prefer not to remand to the lower courts and further put off this Court's final resolution of the critical legal issues.\"",
      "In his dissent, Alito argued the high court didn't have jurisdiction to grant relief and should have allowed lower courts to handle the issue first. Thomas joined his dissent.",
      "The emergency appeal to the Supreme Court came in a fast-moving dispute that intensified after the American Civil Liberties Union said last month that it learned Venezuelan migrants being held at the facility in Anson had received notices informing them that they were subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU said that the notices classified the migrants as members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua who must be removed from the U.S., and the men were informed they may be deported within hours.",
      "Lawyers for the Venezuelan migrants said that the Trump administration's actions violated the Supreme Court's early April decision in a different case involving removals under the Alien Enemies Act. In that ruling, the high court said migrants subject to removal under the 1798 law must receive notice that they faced deportation \"within a reasonable time\" and be allowed to bring habeas claims to challenge their removals.",
      "The Supreme Court's earlier decision also said judicial relief had to be sought in the district where the migrants are being held, which led the ACLU to file petitions in New York, southern Texas and Colorado on behalf of Venezuelan migrants who faced deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. The three judges overseeing those cases agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from using the wartime authority to deport migrants in custody within their districts.",
      "On May 1, the judge in southern Texas permanently blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants living or detained in the district, finding that the president's proclamation exceeded the scope of the law and was contrary to its terms.",
      "The ACLU had asked U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix of the Northern District of Texas to block the \"imminent\" removal of Venezuelan migrants detained at the Bluebonnet facility in Anson without adequate notice. The group alleged the Trump administration moved Venezuelan men from detention centers in Louisiana, Minnesota and California to Anson \"without meaningful explanation.\" The government also hadn't indicated the type of notice it planned to provide those covered by Mr. Trump's Alien Enemies Act proclamation or how much time it would give them before deporting them to El Salvador or another country, according to the ACLU.",
      "But Hendrix declined to issue temporary relief, finding two Venezuelan men detained in northern Texas who risked deportation under the Alien Enemies Act were not in impending danger of removal. A second federal judge in Washington, D.C., also refused to intervene in an 11th-hour bid by the ACLU to more broadly block the removals.",
      "After Hendrix declined the temporary restraining order, the ACLU said in court papers that the government gave detainees the notices, in English only, designating them for removal under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU also said officials told the men they would be removed within 24 hours.",
      "The group then sought relief simultaneously from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit and the Supreme Court.",
      "The ACLU argued that the government's actions do not give Venezuelan migrants in northern Texas who are at risk of removal under the Alien Enemies Act a \"realistic opportunity\" to pursue judicial relief and warned that without intervention, dozens or hundreds of Venezuelan men were at risk at being removed to a notorious prison in El Salvador, where they would have no chance to contest their designation as an \"alien enemy\" or their removal.",
      "\"The public has a critical interest in preventing wrongful removals, especially where it could mean a lifetime sentence in a notorious foreign prison,\" they wrote.",
      "But the Trump administration said the ACLU's request for an injunction is \"unprecedented,\" and argued it is too early for the Supreme Court to intervene. Solicitor General John Sauer told the court in a filing that the government had agreed not to use the Alien Enemies Act to remove detainees who have filed habeas petitions.",
      "Trump invokes Alien Enemies Act",
      "Signed last month, the president's proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act has already sparked significant clashes with the federal courts. The 1798 law has been used only three times before, and each time during a period of war.",
      "Mr. Trump's proclamation provides that all Venezuelan nationals ages 14 and older who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents are subject to swift apprehension and removal as alien enemies. The president claimed that migrants with alleged ties to the gang were invading or staging an incursion into the U.S.",
      "Shortly after the proclamation was signed in mid-March, the administration used the Alien Enemies Act to remove more than 100 Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they have been detained at its Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT.",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts to deport the Venezuelan migrants using the authority set off a legal battle in Washington, D.C. The judge overseeing that case, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt over what he said was its defiance of an order involving the removals of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.",
      "The case that gave rise to that extraordinary order landed before the Supreme Court in late March. The high court divided 5-4 in finding that Mr. Trump could carry out deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, but unanimously agreed that judicial review must be available to people subject to removal under the law.",

    "story": [
      "An undocumented immigrant who resides in Florida is facing a more than $1.82 million fine for failing to leave the country after receiving a removal order 20 years ago, CBS News has learned.",
      "According to the notice sent May 9 by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's civil fines department and provided to CBS News, the 41-year-old Florida woman and mother of three, who CBS News has chosen not to name, was charged $500 for every day she has remained in the U.S. since the removal order was issued in April 2005, running up a total of $1,821,350.",
      "CBS News has reached out to ICE for comment.",
      "This case represents an enforcement of the civil fines listed under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which also requires undocumented immigrants to register with the U.S. government, according to Michelle Sanchez, the Florida-based immigration attorney representing the Honduran immigrant.",
      "In February, the Trump administration announced its plans to penalize those living in the U.S. illegally under that immigration act. It encompasses a range of regulations but has historically rarely been enforced since its implementation.",
      "According to Sanchez, the removal order was issued after the woman failed to show up to a court hearing in 2005.",
      "In 2024, Sanchez filed a motion to reopen her client's case and have the removal order lifted, arguing the Honduran woman was eligible to apply for U.S. residency because she had resided in the U.S. for more than 10 years with no criminal record.",
      "Sanchez said her client is also a mother of three U.S. citizen children who would be qualifying relatives as they would suffer extreme and exceptionally unusual hardships if she were deported.",
      "Under the Biden administration, ICE attorneys were given discretion to reopen cases to lift removal orders. Hundreds of thousands of these requests were left pending, however, according to Sanchez. In March, ICE notified the Florida immigration lawyer they could not reopen her client's case because the Trump administration did not offer guidance on such prosecutorial discretion.",
      "Sanchez told CBS News she has seen an uptick in ICE issuing fines to her clients who remain in the country illegally, but the million dollar civil fine marks a first.",
      "\"ICE is terrorizing individuals without even having to go pick them up,\" Sanchez said. \"They are terrorizing them by sending these notices where they are fining individuals an exorbitant amount of money that a person sometimes doesn't even make that amount in their lifetime.\"",
      "The notice sent to the Florida mother of three indicates that the fine can be contested, and that requesting a personal interview to do so is an option.",
      "\"They're going into the lion's den,\" Sanchez said, adding that anyone who receives such a notice should first reach out to their immigration lawyer before showing up in person to contest fines.",
      "Sanchez indicates she will be appealing her client's fine as the Honduran mother was never advised of the consequences of failing to depart the U.S. once the removal order was issued.",
      "\"I welcome the orderly application of immigration law and I welcome CBP protecting us,\" Sanchez said, \"but the laws have to be respected and if rights are trampled, there has to be consequences.\"",

    "summary": "CBS News reported in March that the defense secretary ordered a pause in cyber operations against Russia. Rep. Don Bacon disclosed its duration during a hearing.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said the U.S. government halted cyber operations against Russia for one day in February as President Trump was trying to negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, confirming CBS News reporting at the time and undercutting statements of denial from the Defense Department.",
      "\"I actually dug into this whole matter. I just want to address it: It was a one-day pause, which is typical for negotiations,\" said Bacon, chair of the House Armed Services cyber subcommittee, during a\u00a0hearing on Capitol Hill on Friday. \"That's just about as much as I can say. It was a one-day pause.\"",
      "In March, multiple U.S. officials\u00a0told CBS News that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had issued a directive to U.S. Cyber Command to pause cyber operations against Russia, including those that were the most provocative. At the time, the duration of the pause was unknown.",
      "In response to reports about the pause, the Pentagon's rapid response team\u00a0posted on March 4 on X that Hegseth \"has neither canceled nor delayed any cyber operations directed against malicious Russian targets and there has been no stand-down order whatsoever from that priority.\"",
      "Two sources familiar with Hegseth's order said the pause directive lacked specificity. It's not clear how the order about planning was interpreted. Multiple officials also told CBS News in March that strategizing for future operations was never paused and that U.S. cyber policy on Russia \"is very much intact\" and remains at the same level, one of the officials said.",
      "Bacon's remarks are the first on-the-record acknowledgment of the directive's existence, which was first reported in February by\u00a0The Record, a cybersecurity news publication.",
      "It's not uncommon for certain military operations to be paused during sensitive negotiations between countries. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have halted operations to prevent U.S. intentions from being misconstrued and to keep diplomacy on track.",
      "In addition to the Pentagon's statement on X, the Trump administration stonewalled inquiries on the matter and continued to deny any pause was ordered.",
      "A senior U.S. defense official at the Defense Department declined to answer questions from CBS News at the time when asked about the reported pause.",
      "In Friday's House hearing, the statement from DOD Rapid Response was called out by Army veteran and Democratic Rep. Eugene Vindman, who accused the Pentagon of lying about the pause directive.",
      "\"What I would like to do is basically point out that that statement by DOD Rapid Response was an outright lie,\" said the Virginia congressman. \"It was at least misleading. And that is not what the American people deserve, and that will be something that I intend to follow up with the secretary when he actually shows up.\"",
      "The Pentagon\u00a0created the DOD Rapid Response account in February, and it is\u00a0overseen by conservative podcaster and Army veteran Graham Allen, who is now the Pentagon's digital media director.",
      "The account commonly attacks news publications and posts comments criticizing reporting about Hegseth and the Defense Department. The X account has omitted context from its statements, touting an\u00a0increase in U.S. military recruiting numbers between February 2024 through February 2025, even though much of the period showing improved recruitment numbers occurred during the Biden administration, as CBS News' Confirmed team found.",
      "Trump administration officials have promised to run \"the most transparent Defense Department in history,\" but to date, the Pentagon has\u00a0held just one formal briefing. Instead of regular press engagements, the Pentagon's modus operandi for official Defense Department communications is often to bypass legacy news media outlets and attack their reporting. Questions to the Pentagon were referred to U.S. Cyber Command, which told CBS News Friday that \"due to operational security concerns, we do not comment nor discuss cyber intelligence, plans, or operations.\"",

      "A military parade to mark the Army's anniversary next month \u2014 coinciding with President Trump's birthday \u2014 is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million, an Army spokesperson told CBS News. The price estimate encompasses the whole festival, including the events leading up to the parade.",
      "The parade in Washington, D.C., is expected to include over 100 vehicles and thousands of soldiers who will be housed in federal buildings. It could also involve 50 helicopters, prompting \"extensive coordination\" with the Federal Aviation Administration, the spokesperson said.",
      "The event will also feature Abrams tanks, and the military plans to lay down metal plates on the streets of Washington to avoid damaging the pavement with the 120,000-pound armored vehicles, a defense official said.",
      "The event will take place as part of the Army's 250th anniversary celebrations on June 14 \u2014 the same day as Mr. Trump's 79th birthday.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement that the cost will be \"shared by the Department of the Army and the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission.\"",
      "\"President Trump will commemorate the United States Army's birthday with a military parade that honors all who served since our great nation was founded 250 years ago,\" Kelly said. \"There is no event grand enough to adequately capture our gratitude for the millions of heroes who laid down their lives defending our freedom, but this parade will be a fitting tribute to the service, sacrifice, and selflessness of all who have worn the uniform.\"",
      "Reports about a possible military parade began circulating last month. Initial plans obtained by The Associated Press two weeks ago called for more than 6,600 soldiers, seven bands and 150 vehicles, including tanks as well as Stryker and Bradley fighting vehicles \u2014 though at the time, the Army said the plans had not been finalized.",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed the plans earlier this month: \"We're going to have a big, beautiful parade,\" the president told NBC's \"Meet The Press.\"",
      "The president also said the event isn't tied to his birthday. When asked about the price tag, Mr. Trump said it would be \"peanuts compared to the value of doing it.\"",
      "\"We have the greatest missiles in the world. We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And we're going to celebrate it,\" Mr. Trump told NBC News.",
      "The plans have drawn some criticism from Democrats. Earlier this month, Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee called the plan wasteful, writing in a statement, \"The egotist-in-chief wants taxpayers to foot the bill for a military parade on his birthday.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in the pageantry of a military parade dates back years. During a 2017 visit to France during his first term, the president praised the country's annual Bastille Day parade and suggested \"we're going to have to try and top it\" on the Fourth of July.",
      "A year later, the administration began drawing up plans for a parade to recognize Veterans Day. But after reports circulated that the event could cost as much as $92 million \u2014 and some Democratic lawmakers blasted the idea as \"self-aggrandizing\" \u2014 Mr. Trump postponed the event and blamed local elected officials for driving up the price.",
      "\"The local politicians who run Washington, D.C. (poorly) know a windfall when they see it. When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it,\" Mr. Trump posted on X, then known as Twitter, in 2018.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge grew frustrated with the Trump administration Friday as it pushed to withhold details on what it has done to reverse the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was sent to a prison in El Salvador as the result of an \"administrative error.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. last month \u2014 and has sparred with the administration since then, ordering government lawyers to produce details on their efforts and accusing them of failing to adequately comply.",
      "Attorney Andrew Rossman said he and the rest of the legal team seeking to return Abrego Garcia have hit a \"roadblock\" in discovery efforts, as the Justice Department has invoked the state secrets privilege and other privileges to withhold information in the case. Rossman cited a \"paltry\" number of documents provided during court-ordered fact-finding.",
      "\"We have no case without knowing what steps they've taken or what steps they have not taken,\" to return Abrego Garcia, Rossman said Friday. He pointed to a \"dichotomy\" between Justice Department filings saying they are complying with a court order to return him and public statements from President Trump and other top administration officials saying they will not return the man.",
      "Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn argued the government has properly invoked the state secrets privilege in this case and has cooperated with all discovery efforts by Abrego Garcia's attorneys. He said Abrego Garcia's lawyers are \"seeking a categorical piercing\" of the state secrets privilege to get the answers they want.",
      "Xinis rejected the argument, saying, \"you can't tell me that these depositions are a good faith effort\" to answer questions about what operations were or are underway to return Abrego Garcia. \"This is about good faith versus bad faith,\" she added.",
      "\"I'm like the cat with the ball of string, and I'm just trying to keep up with the string.\" Xinis said about her attempts to keep up with the Justice Department's various privilege arguments in the case.",
      "Xinis allowed an expedited discovery process to begin last month after Abrego Garcia's legal team accused the Trump administration of failing to follow her order to facilitate his return to the U.S. The Supreme Court had agreed that the administration had to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "Xinis said Friday that the depositions undertaken so far of Trump administration officials resulted in a \"goose egg\" and had no new knowledge in them, citing numerous \"I don't knows\" provided in answers to questions from Abrego Garcia's attorneys.",
      "Rossman said that he and the rest of the legal team representing Abrego Garcia have only received 32 new documents in their discovery efforts, and 1,140 documents submitted in discovery are being withheld from them under \"any manner of privilege\" the Justice Department could invoke.",
      "Rossman added that the Justice Department has promised additional documents from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but that he and his co-counsel have not received them yet.",
      "\"It's critical, a life is in the balance. Due process is in the balance,\" Rossman said about the need for a quick resolution to discovery.",
      "Guuyn said that the Justice Department got another update from El Salvador yesterday that Abrego Garcia is in \"good health\" and has \"gained weight\" since his detention there.",
      "After the two and a half hours of the hearing in open court ended, Xinis held a closed-door argument on the remaining disagreements between the sides on sealed discovery documents.",
      "Trump administration spars with judge over deportation",
      "Abrego Garcia, who was born in El Salvador, entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 and lived in Maryland after that. In 2019, he was granted a withholding of removal, a legal status that prevented the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador because of a risk of persecution by local gangs.",
      "But Abrego Garcia was among the hundreds of migrants sent by the Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious Terrorism Confinement Center prison, or CECOT, in March.",
      "A federal immigration official acknowledged in court papers his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the administration has since declined to return him to the U.S. Instead, top administration officials have claimed Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant. His lawyers argue that Abrego Garcia is not a member of MS-13 or any other gang, and has never been charged or convicted of any crimes in the U.S., El Salvador or any other country.",
      "Guynn and Xinis got into a heated back-and-forth over the legality of Abrego Garcia's removal on Friday, after Guynn said that Abrego Garcia was \"removed lawfully\" from the U.S. to El Salvador.",
      "\"That's not lawful,\" Xinis said, citing a previous court order that barred Abrego Garcia's removal specifically to El Salvador.",
      "\"He'll never walk free in the United States.\" Guynn said, saying he will be in U.S. custody if he was ever returned to the United States as removal proceedings play out.",
      "\"That sounds to me like an admission of your client that your client will not take steps\" to return Abrego Garcia, Xinis said. \"That's about as clear as it gets.\"",
      "Xinis later chastised Guynn for suggesting that Abrego Garcia's arrest was lawful, which even Erez Reuveni, a Justice Department attorney who first argued the case, admitted in court proceedings that it was not, and that the arrest was warrantless.",
      "\"It was highly publicized that Mr. Reuveni was benched,\" for honestly answering her questions, Xinis said.",
      "Mr. Trump and other top administration officials have repeatedly said it is up to El Salvador whether to release Abrego Garcia. As of April 21, he was being held at a lower-security facility in Santa Ana, according to a declaration from a State Department official.",
      "In a separate case in Washington, D.C., the Justice Department has argued in court that due to a financial agreement with the Salvadoran government, it does not have constructive custody over the detainees who were moved from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act once they are in CECOT or other Salvadoran prisons, and cannot be compelled to return Abrego Garcia or any other person detained in El Salvador under the agreement.",
      "Government claims \"state secrets\"",
      "The administration's assertion of privilege was revealed in an order last week from Xinis, which asked lawyers for Abrego Garcia and the Justice Department to file additional legal papers about the administration's \"invocations of privilege, principally the state secrets and deliberative process privileges.\"",
      "Attorneys for Abrego Garcia asked for Xinis to grant additional depositions in their discovery efforts, including potentially a deposition with someone with first-hand knowledge of efforts to return Abrego Garcia from the White House. The Justice Department called the request \"unreasonable\" and added that more depositions \"goes well beyond the limited discovery the Court granted.\"",
      "The Justice Department had indicated last month that it would invoke certain privileges to protect information regarding Abrego Garcia's removal from the U.S., citing in a filing the attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege and certain executive privileges.",
      "Administration lawyers had said that a request for documents from Abrego Garcia's legal team about the terms of any arrangement regarding the government's use of El Salvador's notorious prison to house deportees from the U.S. \"calls for the immediate production of classified documents, as well as documents that defendants may elect to assert are subject to the protections of attorney-client privilege and the state secrets privilege.\"",

    "summary": "Multiple staff members at the Kennedy Center said they are sounding the alarm that the mission and legacy of the storied arts institution are at risk.",
    "story": [
      "Staff employees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts\u00a0in Washington, D.C. announced this week an intent to unionize across departments and argue for collective bargaining rights. The effort comes amid months of layoffs and job uncertainty following major changes brought on by the Trump administration.",
      "According to multiple staff members who spoke to CBS News on the condition of anonymity, more than 150 employees that handle crucial responsibilities for the Kennedy Center \u2014 including education, donor relations, and arts programming \u2014 are sounding the alarm that the mission and legacy of the storied arts institution are at risk unless a sense of normalcy is returned to everyday operations.",
      "\"We are the ones that put the artists in the classrooms and on the stages,\" one Kennedy Center education staff member told CBS News.",
      "After multiple departments have been shuttered completely, the staff member said she is hoping unionization will restore a sense of security for those remaining, as well as improve transparency and communication from leadership, which she says has been lacking.",
      "\"We're trying to carry out the work the best we can. But anxiety and fear exist with so many departments experiencing layoffs,\" she said. \"And they happen quickly, with very little notice.\"",
      "Back in February, President Trump installed himself as the chairman of the Board of Trustees of the storied arts institution while firing then-Chairman David M. Rubenstein and 18 members of the bipartisan board, replacing the vacancies with White House appointees.",
      "Following the vote, Mr. Trump dismissed much of the Kennedy Center's executive leadership, including President Deborah Rutter, who served in the role for more than a decade.",
      "When asked in a March interview with Norah O'Donnell what the hardest part of these changes is, Rutter replied, \"I think the sting is the disregard for expertise and experience. We were working toward something extraordinary.\"",
      "The Trump administration has said an overhaul is needed because the\u00a0marquee arts center is \"woke ... and broke.\"\u00a0The White House did not immediately respond to a request by CBS News for comment on Friday.",
      "But staff members on the ground have heard little from the top on what these changes may include. Staff members told CBS News that no typical quarterly all-staff meeting has been held, and weekly departmental updates have ceased. Ticket sales are reportedly down 50% this quarter, but employees have stopped receiving regular ticket sales reports. Workers believe they are flying blind.",
      "After the initial wave of firings in February, broader layoffs have continued in recent weeks. The entire social impact team was let go in late March, and just this week, an international arm of the programming department was laid off, jeopardizing efforts to get talented artists from outside the United States booked for this season.",
      "\"These teams are small, and they're close. We're all friends. So, it's hard to see your friends lose their jobs, and they're the ones telling us,\" one programming staff member admitted. \"But more than that, there's uncertainty [over] what jobs still need to be done and what is being shelved.\"",
      "There's been intensified concern about the fundraising efforts for the non-profit organization, which brought in an estimated $141 million in grants and donations in fiscal year 2023. The development department, which operated with about 90 employees for years previously, has been reduced to about 30 presently on staff, leaving major holes in budgeting and donor cultivation duties.",
      "The petition filed with the National Labor Relations Board on Thursday indicates that 172 regular full-time and part-time employees plan to vote to unionize with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, commonly known as UAW. The workers range across departments handling development, education, marketing, programming, the National Symphony Orchestra and the Washington National Opera.",
      "\"Unionizing is a call for transparency and to protect jobs,\" said another staff member. \"We are a ground-up, employee-led movement of Kennedy Center employees. And when we win this vote, we will have secured the future of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for another 53 years, in its original non-partisan, non-political way.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was founded in 1971 as a national cultural center and memorial to President John F. Kennedy. Its annual honors ceremony, which airs on CBS, features the best in music, theater and dance.",
      "Staff believe they have well over the simple majority of 50% to unionize, and generally have overwhelming support from everyone in the building for their effort. The vote is expected to take place in the coming weeks.",

    "summary": "House Republicans have included in Trump's domestic policy bill a 5% tax on cash payments sent by non-citizens to family in their home countries.",
    "story": [
      "The House Republican bill to enact President Trump's domestic policy agenda contains a provision that has prompted opposition from the Mexican government \u2014 a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries.",
      "The payments, known as remittances, would be subject to a 5% excise tax that would encompass more than 40 million people, including green card holders and nonimmigrant visa holders, such as people on H-1B, H-2A and H-2B visas. U.S. citizens would be exempt.",
      "In a May 13 letter to the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, Esteban Moctezuma Barrag\u00e1n, Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., urged Chairman Jason Smith and Ranking Member Richard Neal to reconsider the proposal.",
      "\"We respectfully urge you to reconsider this section of the legislative proposal, and we remain available to continue dialogue on the matter,\" wrote Barrag\u00e1n and Robert Velasco Alvarez, Mexico's chief officer for North America.",
      "Spokespeople for both Smith and Neal did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In April, President Trump hinted at a crackdown on remittances, announcing in a Truth Social Post\u00a0that the administration was \"finalizing a presidential memorandum to shut down remittances sent by illegal aliens outside of the United States.\" But details on the presidential proposal were unclear.",
      "The remittance tax provisions in the bill have become an international flashpoint. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has also criticized the plan and urged Republican lawmakers to reconsider it.",
      "At a press briefing this week, Sheinbaum warned that the proposal \"would damage the economy of both nations and is also contrary to the spirit of economic freedom that the U.S. government claims to defend.\"",
      "\"Remittances are the fruit of the efforts of those who, through their honest work, strengthen not only the Mexican economy but also the United States', which is why we consider this measure to be arbitrary and unjust,\" she said.",
      "An estimate by the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies, which is cited in the letter, found that Mexican migrant workers sent on average 16.7% of their labor income as remittances.",
      "\"In other words, more than 80% of the income generated by this community remains in the U.S. economy,\" the letter says.",
      "The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, however, that the proposal would generate a little more than $1 billion in tax revenue in fiscal year 2026, and rise to about $3 billion by 2034.",
      "In the letter to lawmakers, Barrag\u00e1n said the proposal would amount to double taxation, \"since migrants already pay taxes in the country where they work.\"",
      "\"Imposing a tax on these transfers would disproportionately affect those with the least, without accounting for their ability to pay,\" he added and also warned of other unintended consequences.",
      "\"Many migrants might seek informal or unregulated means to do so, complicating oversight and control of these financial flows. This would not only reduce the expected revenue but also increase risks related to financial security, tax evasion and money laundering,\" he wrote.",
      "Barrag\u00e1n has been meeting with lawmakers in recent days and discussing the matter with them. On Tuesday, he hosted a dinner for members of Congress, including Texas Rep. Tony Gonzalez, whose district spans the length of much of the state's border with Mexico and is home to many migrant workers. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast and Florida Rep Maria Elvira Salazar attended the dinner.",
      "Salazar said, when asked about the proposal, she was still assessing the legislation and who exactly it will affect, noting that banks already charge fees for such transactions.",
      "\"I just want what's fair, what's just and what's Christian,\" she said.",
      "Separately, Barragan met with Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick and also discussed the remittance measure.",
      "Representatives for the electronic payment transfer industry also expressed concern that this proposal would harm vulnerable communities.",
      "\"Such a measure would harm the most financially vulnerable consumers, undermine small businesses, disrupt critical financial regulations, and weaken law enforcement's ability to combat illicit activity,\" the Electronic Transactions Association wrote to Smith and Neal.",
      "The group also added, \"Taxing remittances will distort behavior and could drive consumers toward unregulated, underground channels in an effort to avoid the added cost.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 14:25:56 -0400",
    "summary": "Donald Trump Jr. has maneuvered potentially lucrative business deals while also becoming a power player to his father.",
    "story": [
      "When the crypto mining firm American Bitcoin announced plans to go public on the Nasdaq stock exchange this week, the company called it a \"major milestone\" for a key stakeholder, Dominari Holdings \u2014 a little-known investment house that recently added a very recognizable name to its advisory board: Donald Trump Jr.",
      "It was the latest maneuver in a series of high-stakes, and potentially lucrative business deals Trump Jr. and his younger brother Eric, also a Dominari adviser, stand to benefit from.",
      "Since his father won the 2024 election, Trump Jr. has joined at least eight corporate boards or advisory committees, adding political clout and his famous family brand to companies that sell handguns, make drones, and offer healthcare services online.",
      "During President Trump's second term, his son Donald Jr. has morphed from a lower profile presence in Washington to what Trump first term press secretary Sean Spicer, who knows Trump Jr. well, describes as the \"most prominent non-elected representative of the MAGA base hands down, the No. 1 surrogate and power player in the ecosystem outside of his father.\" The most overt symbol of that ascendence \u2013 and of the Trump family's unique blend of governing and deal-making, went public last month, with the announcement of a highly exclusive private club, which is named\u00a0 \"Executive Branch.\"",
      "At the coming-out event, the cocktails flowed and servers passed caviar to A-list guests that included Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Attorney General Pam Bondi; Paul Atkins, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and FCC chair Brendan Carr. The Capital's buzzy newsletters revealed the club's eye-popping club membership fee: $500,000.",
      "Private clubs have long been a fixture of official Washington, where lobbyists and well-heeled donors can mingle with members of Congress and high-ranking officials.\u00a0 But this venture launched by the president's oldest son is something new \u2014 and, according to critics, serves as the latest example of how the Trump family has turbo-charged Washington's pay-to-play culture.",
      "\"I don't think there has ever been anything comparable to this use of the presidency to advance private business interests,\" said Richard Briffault, a law professor who specializes in government ethics at Columbia Law School.",
      "Critics fear a pay-to-play culture",
      "To government watchdogs, the members-only social club embodies what they say is an increasingly brazen mingling of private business interests and government policy.",
      "\"It's unseemly and it undermines the public's faith that the government is operating in the public interest,\" said Brett Kappel, a veteran Washington, D.C., election lawyer.",
      "Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor who has for years advocated for stronger ethics rules in the nation's capital, told CBS News she views the club as a blatant play to cash in with interest groups seeking access to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This is literally members bringing money into the pockets of Donald Trump Jr, and his business partners,\" Sloan said.",
      "Trump Jr.'s allies disagree. They argue the extravagant membership fee actually cuts against the claim that it is a vehicle for influence peddling \u2014 because members are already so well connected.",
      "\"If your goal was to let as many people in as possible, you'd have every lobbyist in D.C. join,\" said one source familiar with the concept behind the club, pointing out that members who could afford the sky-high admission fee would likely already be well known in Washington's power corridors.",
      "For his part, Trump Jr. disputes suggestions that he is cashing in on his father's name or testing any ethical boundaries.",
      "\"I'm a private citizen who has been a businessman my entire life,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS News. \"It's laughable that the left-wing media thinks that I should lock myself in a padded room and cease what I've been doing for over 25 years to earn a living and provide for my five children,\" Trump Jr. added.",
      "The White House calls Trump Jr.'s private sector dealings ethically sound, pointing out that President Trump's assets are held in a trust controlled by his family",
      "The \"Executive Branch\" club is only one of the ways Trump Jr. has raised his profile during his father's second term. The president's son has rapidly expanded the family's crypto profile and continued to pursue real estate investments.\u00a0 He has also been a front-facing leader of the MAGA empire, supplanting his sister Ivanka and brother-in-law, Jared Kushner, as the most high-profile \u2014 and politically astute \u2014 Trump scion in Washington.",
      "The \"Trump bump\"",
      "The family business is a global enterprise. Recently, Trump Jr. made a whirlwind tour of several foreign nations, including Serbia, Hungary and Bulgaria, where he looked in on real estate interests, delivered lucrative speeches and met with government leaders, according to The New York Times.",
      "At home, Trump Jr.'s move to join a spree of corporate boards in the role of adviser or board member traces in part to his relationship with Omeed Malik, the financier and mega Trump donor who is also Trump Jr.'s co-founder in the D.C. social club.",
      "Just days after the election, Malik brought on Trump Jr. as a partner in his venture capital firm, 1789 Capital, which says on its website that it invests in conservative companies and eschews \"woke capitalism\" and other left-wing causes, a deal a knowledgeable source said was in the works before the election. \u00a0 Trump Jr. soon joined the boards of arms retailer GrabAGun as well as the online health care company BlinkRX, both 1789 Capital properties.",
      "It is not hard to see the impact when a company adds Trump Jr. to its board. When Dominari Holdings inc., a wealth management and banking services company, announced that it was bringing on both of the president's sons, its stock price shot up 83% to a record high, eventually settling down to 30% above where it was before Trump Jr. joined. Shortly thereafter, Dominari's CEO announced that the company was planning investments in AI and data centers, growth industries where the Trump administration has been massively rolling back regulations. In a company press release, CEO Kyle Wood he cited Trump Jr.'s and Eric Trump's \"strategic insight\" in both of those sectors.",
      "And this week, the Bitcoin mining company owned partly by Trump sons Donald Jr. and Eric engineered a listing on the NASDAQ after merging with a smaller, publicly traded mining firm called Gryphon Digital Mining Inc. Dominari Holdings is effectively acting as the banker for the deal and has been reaching out to potential investors.",
      "In another example of the so-called \"Trump bump,\" the stock price of Unusual Machines, a Florida-based drone manufacturer, nearly doubled when the news hit that Trump Jr. was joining the board.",
      "Unusual Machines, which manufactures its unmanned aerial vehicles and components in the U.S., is aiming to reduce American dependence on Chinese drones. But for the time being the company is reliant on Chinese parts, which means that the Trump administration's yo-yoing tariffs on China could hurt the company's bottom line. CEO Allan Evans has said he would not ask Trump Jr. to intervene with the federal government on the company's behalf for relief.",
      "\"I would never ask him to do anything or facilitate anything like that,\" Evans told the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Trump Jr. and his defenders clap back at critics who suggest his moves to join board seats and champion business interests carry the echoes of past ventures by presidential relatives like Billy Carter, Neil Bush or Hunter Biden. They call him a skilled entrepreneur with a long record of business success who has capitalized on his position by making shrewd business decisions, cultivating lucrative connections among tech and finance leaders, all while building up a powerful political operation in Washington.",
      "The Hunter Biden comparisons, in particular, have drawn a sharp response: \"He became a 'businessman' after his dad got elected,\" Trump Jr. said in a social media post. \"I joined a Venture Capital Firm that invests in private American companies \u2014 Nothing to do with the government.\"",
      "MAGA power broker",
      "\"Don Jr. was an accomplished businessman long before his father got into politics and just continues to grow,\" said Sean Spicer, who served the president as press secretary in his first term and now hosts the Sean Spicer podcast.",
      "Today, Spicer says Trump Jr. is the man to see. Spicer, who worked closely with the president's son during the first term, says has seen the evolution up close.",
      "\"If the phone rings and it's Don Jr., you better pick it up on the first ring,\" Spicer said. During the 2020 campaign Trump Jr. emerged as a potent asset for his father, stumping on the trail and fully embodying the MAGA brand.\u00a0 He flung \"red meat\" to the rapturous crowds at Trump rallies and showed an instinct for the jugular that reminded observers of Trump senior.",
      "A big part of his success, his friends say, is an ability to blend with the grassroots MAGA world.",
      "\"Don Jr. isn't just a billionaire's son, he's one of us,\" said Andrew Kolvet, spokesman for Turning Point USA, the preeminent MAGA aligned youth organization and an associate of Trump Jr.",
      "Trump Jr.'s inside and outside game makes him a unique player in Trump's Washington, his allies say \u2014 someone with unparalleled clout within the administration who is also able to operate freely in the private sector.",
      "He has forged close ties with powerful tech titans like Elon Musk and David O. Sacks, the angel investor who was a key figure in bringing a powerful and wealthy contingent of Silicon Valley over to Trump. Sacks is currently serving as the White House Czar for both Crypto and AI. Last month, he became member #1 of the Executive Branch club.",

      "\"I think it's time for us to just do it,\" Mr. Trump told reporters as he wrapped a four-day visit to the Middle East. Later, he told reporters on Air Force One, setting off on the journey back to Washington, that he might call Putin soon.",

      "Meetings between Ukrainian and Russian delegations did get underway in Istanbul Friday, though Putin sent a lower-level delegation. This prompted accusations from Ukraine and its European partners that Moscow wasn't really interested in a negotiated resolution to the war.",
      "After the meetings concluded, Vladimir Medinsky, who led the Russian delegation, said in a statement that the two countries agreed that \"in the coming days,\" they'll hold a large-scale exchange of 1,000 prisoners of war for each side. He also said Russia has \"taken notice\" of Ukraine's request for direct talks between the heads of state, and that each side \"would present its vision of a possible future ceasefire.\" Once the detailed outlines are presented, negotiations will continue.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to take part in the talks as Mr. Trump pressed for the leaders to find a solution to the war, ongoing since Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But Putin spurned the call to meet face-to-face with Zelenskyy.",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed both sides to quickly come to an agreement to end the war. Zelenskyy has agreed to an American plan for an initial 30-day halt to hostilities, but Russia has not signed on and has continued to strike at targets inside Ukraine.",
      "\"He didn't go, and I understand that,\" Mr. Trump said Friday of Putin's decision to skip the talks in Istanbul. \"We're going to get it done. We got to get it done. Five thousand young people are being killed every single week on average, and we're going to get it done.\"",
      "The U.S. president told reporters on Thursday that a meeting between himself and Putin was crucial to breaking the deadlock.",
      "\"I don't believe anything's going to happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But we're going to have to get it solved because too many people are dying.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in Moscow on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said any meeting between Putin and Mr. Trump would have to be \"well prepared\" for, but he said such an encounter was indeed necessary in Russia's view, as \"a serious conversation on international issues is needed, including the Ukrainian crisis.\"",
      "Should the talks in Istanbul fail to make any progress, Zelenskyy said Friday that there should be a \"strong reaction,\" as it would be clear, in his view, that Russia does not have any interest in ending the war.",

    "summary": "CBS News examined federal court data on challenges against the Biden and Trump administrations and found patterns in where the cases were brought.",
    "story": [
      "Increasingly, when lawyers take divisive political issues to court, they seek out federal jurisdictions where they hope to find judges sympathetic to their worldview. This phenomenon, known as venue shopping, has been employed by both sides of the political aisle, according to a new CBS News analysis of federal court data for cases seeking nationwide impact.",
      "The analysis suggests that conservatives suing the Biden administration frequently tried to have their cases heard in tiny federal courts in Texas. The lawsuits often landed in courts with just a single judge, helping ensure the first ruling would come from Republican appointees. That the courts were in Texas also meant any Biden objections would head to the largely conservative 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The cases reviewed were filed during and appealed by the first Trump administration or the Biden administration through Dec. 31, 2024.",
      "Those Texas federal trial courts include those in Victoria and Amarillo, small cities the analysis found were the first and third most common venues for challenges against the Biden administration. The only federal judge in Amarillo is U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, largely known for issuing a nationwide injunction banning the drug mifepristone, which is used with the drug misoprostol to end pregnancies. Six of the top 10 courts where Biden challenges were filed are in the 5th Circuit, encompassing the states of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, according to the analysis.",
      "President Trump himself has a case pending in Amarillo's federal court, where he sued CBS News in October for what he alleges is \"deceitful\" editing of an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris on \"60 Minutes\" during the 2024 campaign. The network has said the interview as edited is not \"doctored or deceitful\" and has filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit.",
      "When Mr. Trump first took office, liberals filed cases in larger venues, predominantly in the 9th Circuit, which includes most western states. CBS has also been tracking more than 300 cases filed against the current Trump administration. Beyond the D.C. District Court, where nationwide cases are traditionally filed, cases during Trump's second term have increasingly been landing before judges in Massachusetts, which is the bluest district in the circuit with the bluest appeals court \u2013 the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. At least 46 cases have been filed in the 1st Circuit, among them, 34 in Massachusetts.",
      "The Supreme Court is now weighing in on the question of whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country by issuing a nationwide injunction. The case was brought in connection to a Trump administration executive order to end birthright citizenship for children whose parents are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The first birthright citizenship case was brought by The League of United Latin American Citizens and other groups in one of these blue district courts, in New Hampshire, which is also in the jurisdiction of the 1st Circuit.",
      "\"We're seeing Democrats challenging some of Trump's policies in some of these blue states,\" said Juan Proa\u00f1o, CEO of LULAC, the oldest and largest Latino civil rights organization in the U.S. \"We've never seen a president sign so many executive orders in such a short amount of time, over 150. What they're trying to do is really change the levers of power in regards to how they can actually pass their agenda.\"",
      "Proa\u00f1o said it's normal to look for a friendly court or venue.",
      "\"If you're trying to advocate for your clients and you're trying to advocate for a class, then it's our job to find the best venue and also the best arguments and the best plaintiffs as well, to make the case in the court of law,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, this is really our focus. And we will do that in any state and in any court where we really do feel like we have an advantage.\"",
      "Federal judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington State issued nationwide injunctions pausing Trump's directive on birthright citizenship, with U.S. District Judge John Coughenour calling it: \"blatantly unconstitutional.\"",
      "Far-reaching consequences possible",
      "If the justices decide to lift the nationwide pause and limit the scope of the injunctions, it could have far-reaching consequences. Trump's birthright citizenship order would go into effect in states not involved in the lawsuit. The Supreme Court's decision could also impact injunctions in other cases, too.",
      "\"There are costs,\" Vladeck said. \"Having one court go first is obviously going to be problematic if it's a hand-picked judge in a particularly one-sided forum.\"",
      "Once favored by Republicans, who sought out national injunctions to block Obama and Biden policies, Mr. Trump has now blasted the courts for issuing injunctions that interfere with his agenda, calling on the Supreme Court to intervene. He argues that one judge shouldn't be able to block presidential policy.",
      "\"STOP NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS NOW, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY, our Country is in very serious trouble!\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "A surge of lawsuits against the Trump administration have led to dozens of nationwide injunctions blocking the implementation of his policies.",
      "The more than 300 suits CBS is tracking have again favored larger venues. Outside Washington, D.C., the highest number of lawsuits were filed in Massachusetts, followed by Maryland, California and New York.",
      "J.B. McCuskey, the attorney general of West Virginia, argues that it erodes confidence in the courts when lawsuits are being brought in certain circuits, and one district judge can issue a universal injunction for the entire country.",
      "\"If you are trying to forum shop for a nationwide injunction, you are making the argument for why nationwide injunction should not be allowed \u2014 because we have a court that is designed to issue injunctions for the entire country,\" he said.",
      "\"People begin to look at circuit judges as an extension of the political process,\" said McCuskey. \"And that is fundamentally disastrous for the way that the public views the impartiality and the power of our court system \u2026 because the court is nothing if it doesn't have its integrity.\"",
      "Shopping for venue likely inevitable, but \"judge shopping is a little different\"",
      "In March of 2024, at the request of Chief Justice John Roberts, the Judicial Conference, which makes policies for the federal courts, recommended a random case-assignment policy in order to limit plaintiffs from effectively choosing judges through where they file lawsuits. Almost every federal district court now follows that guidance.",
      "\"There's really only one invisible holdout,\" Vladeck said, pointing to the Northern District of Texas, where there are district court satellites run by only a single judge or two.",
      "Notably, Massachusetts adopted the random assignment case policy only weeks after a birthright citizenship case was filed in the state. The policy applies to certain cases challenging federal policies filed in single-judge districts, according to a memo issued on February 11, 2025. The state's Springfield and Worcester divisions each have one sitting district judge, appointed by Barack Obama and Joe Biden, respectively. The memo specifies that the \"order applies to any civil action seeking to bar or mandate nationwide enforcement of a federal law.\"",
      "Vladeck acknowledges that \"forum shopping is inevitable\" but that \"judge shopping is a little different\" because litigants know exactly which judge they are going to get.",
      "\"I think sports fans would never be happy in a world in which one team got to pick the referees and the umpires and the judges in every single game,\" he said.",

    "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier this week criticized White South Africans who claimed refugee status in the U.S. as \"cowardly.\"",
    "story": [
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will visit the White House next week, his office said Thursday, days after the arrival in the U.S. of the\u00a0first group of White South Africans, having been granted refugee status under a new Trump administration policy.",
      "Ramaphosa's office said the visit will provide a \"platform to reset the strategic relationship between the two countries.\" The statement said Rampahosa, who is the current president of the G20, and President Trump will meet on Wednesday, May 21.",
      "The White House has not yet commented on the meeting.",
      "The visit comes amid renewed tensions between Ramaphosa and the White House as 59 people from South Africa's Afrikaner community\u00a0arrived in the U.S.\u00a0earlier this week. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landeau said upon their arrival in Washington that they had faced \"egregious discrimination\" in South Africa.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the Afrikaners a \"vulnerable group facing unjust racial discrimination in South Africa.\"",
      "Ramaphosa rejected the Trump administration's characterization of the treatment as \"not true,\" according to BBC News.",
      "On Tuesday, Ramaphosa called those leaving for the U.S. \"cowardly,\" saying, \"When you run away you are a coward.\"",
      "Who are Afrikaners?",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of the 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "In 1948, as South Africa was in the process of gaining independence from Britain, the White minority created the system of apartheid, allowing only White South Africans to vote and govern. As well as being denied political power, Black South Africans also faced harsh restrictions on owning land and many were forcibly segregated into settlements.",
      "That ended in 1994, when all South Africans were allowed to vote for the first time, leading to the end of minority White rule. Nelson Mandela's African National Congress won a majority, and he became the country's first Black president. The ANC has been in power since 1994, but scandals have harmed the party in recent years and it did not win a majority in the 2024 election, forcing Ramaphosa to form a coalition government.",
      "Thirty years after apartheid ended, White South Africans on average still enjoy a higher standard of living than Black South Africans, with research from the South Africa Human Rights Commission showing just 1% of White South Africans are considered poor, compared to 64% of the Black African population.",
      "Why are Afrikaners claiming refugee status?",
      "In February, Ramaphosa signed a new law that allowed the state to seize land without compensation, in situations classified under the legislation as \"just and equitable and in the public interest.\"",
      "Although the wording of the law was vague and did not reference White South Africans, many believed it was targeting them since they control most of the country's land. South Africa's government has strongly denied any land confiscations or racially motivated discrimination, saying the law targets land not being used or not serving the public interest.",
      "Some have also pointed to attacks on South African farmers in recent years. U.S Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who met the first group of Afrikaners admitted to the country, recently claimed they faced \"egregious and targeted threats.\" The South African government, however, has said those attacks were a result of border crime issues and were not racially motivated.",
      "Mr. Trump and adviser Elon Musk, who is a White South African native, have claimed the attacks and potential loss of land amounts to \"White genocide.\"",
      "In February, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to prioritize the resettlement of Afrikaners under the refugee resettlement program. Access to that program for many other groups was frozen by Mr. Trump on his first day in office, although that executive order allowed for exemptions to be considered on a case-by-case basis.",
      "While Afrikaners make up only about half of South Africa's White population, Mr. Trump's executive order granting refugee status only mentions Afrikaners.",
      "According to the U.S. embassy in South Africa, individuals who meet the following requirements can apply for refugee stays:",
      "Must be of South African nationality; and\u00a0Must be of Afrikaner ethnicity or be a member of a racial minority in South Africa; and\u00a0Must be able to articulate a past experience of persecution or fear of future persecution.",

      "There are already about 8,600 federal troops at the border. The U.S. military has recently created two National Defense Areas, narrow ribbons of land stretching around 230 miles along the border in New Mexico and Texas, which are being treated as extensions of military bases.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 13:44:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration's bid to enforce its birthright citizenship executive orders gives the Supreme Court an opportunity to address the soundness of nationwide injunctions.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday pressed an attorney for the federal government on how President Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship would be implemented amid scores of legal challenges that have gone against the administration.",
      "The bid by the Trump administration to\u00a0narrow three lower court orders\u00a0blocking Mr. Trump from ending birthright citizenship is a test of district judges' power to block a president's policies nationwide. Solicitor General D. John Sauer sought to focus on what he described as a \"bipartisan\" problem of lower-level judge's issuing nationwide injunctions, leading to \"judge shopping,\" by plaintiffs seeking a quick win.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan questioned whether \"judge shopping\" applied to the birthright citizenship issue, for which the administration has suffered a string of defeats.",
      "\"Every court is ruling against you,\" Kagan said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by Mr. Trump during his first term, peppered Sauer with questions about how a policy denying citizenship at birth could be implemented as quick as the administration wants. Mr. Trump's executive order gave the government 30 days to implement his policies.",
      "\"What do hospitals do with a newborn? What do states do with a newborn?\" Kavanaugh asked.",
      "Sauer replied that hospitals might not have to change practices, but that the government could develop a process to reject \"the wrong designation of citizenship.\"",
      "Kavanaugh noted that the executive order only gave the government about 30 days to develop a policy.",
      "\"You think they can get it together in time?\" he asked.",
      "The arguments before the court, taking place in a rare May session, were the first involving a policy rolled out by Mr. Trump in his second term. But the high court is not examining the legality of the president's birthright citizenship executive order, which seeks to deny U.S. citizenship to children born to a mother or father who are in the U.S. unlawfully or on a temporary basis.",
      "Instead, the Trump administration has said district court judges overseeing three legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policy lacked the authority to issue sweeping injunctions that extend beyond the parties involved in the litigation. The plaintiffs that brought the three lawsuits are 22 states, two organizations and seven individuals, and the Justice Department is pushing for the injunctions to apply only to them.",
      "Sauer argued that instead of trying to get nationwide injunctions, plaintiffs could bring class action cases in order to oppose policies. Justices including Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch questioned that approach. Gorsuch, who has previously expressed skepticism about nationwide injunctions, noted that it can take a long time to build and certify a class for litigation.",
      "Another justice who has voiced concerns about nationwide injunctions by lower courts, Clarence Thomas, appeared sympathetic to the government's position. He noted that they were once uncommon.",
      "\"We survived until the 1960s without universal injunctions,\" Thomas said.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito said federal appeals court panels and the Supreme Court are often better suited to issue sweeping injunctions than lower court judges. He said individual judges are \"vulnerable to an occupational disease\" of overstepping their authority.",
      "While arguments focused on injunctions, justices occasionally turned to the executive order itself. Sotomayor said it goes against previous decisions by the nation's highest court.",
      "\"As far as I see it this order violates four Supreme Court precedents,\" Sotomayor said. \"And you are claiming that not just the Supreme Court, that both the Supreme Court and no lower court, can stop an executive, universally, from violating....those holdings.\"",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson painted the government's argument as establishing a \"catch me if you can regime,\" requiring every individual whose rights are violated by a new policy to obtain a lawyer and sue.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court in favor of the administration could allow it to partially enforce the birthright citizenship measure while the litigation proceeds \u2014 but not enforce it against the plaintiffs, including residents of California, New York and 20 other states.",
      "\"This is one of a range of efforts to close the courthouse doors, to make it harder, more expensive, more complicated, slower to challenge illegal government action,\" said Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the Immigrants' Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"A case like birthright citizenship puts that in really stark relief where you have an executive order that is blatantly illegal, but the administration is asking the Supreme Court to make it harder for courts to protect people and vindicate constitutional rights.\"",
      "The fight over nationwide, or universal, injunctions has been simmering for years, and several of the justices themselves have indicated that the Supreme Court would have to clarify their legality.",
      "\"Universal injunctions are legally and historically dubious,\" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion to the Supreme Court's 2018 decision upholding the travel ban\u00a0Mr. Trump put in place during his first term. \"If federal courts continue to issue them, this court is dutybound to adjudicate their authority to do so.\"",
      "But criticisms of these broad orders reached a fever pitch this year, as the Trump administration fends off more than 200 legal challenges targeting nearly every aspect of the president's second-term agenda, and courts around the country issue injunctions that stop his policies from taking effect.",
      "Most of these decisions have been appealed, and the Trump administration has sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court in more than a dozen cases, including over his birthright citizenship executive order. The high court left the lower court injunctions preventing implementation of the birthright citizenship policy in place for now.",
      "Among the president's other plans that have been blocked were his transgender military ban, which the Supreme Court then allowed to take effect; his effort to restrict federal funding to medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care for young people; and cuts to certain federal funds.",
      "\"The pace of universal injunctions has gotten to the point where it really is an urgent issue for the court to resolve, not just because it has meant the thwarting of the president's ability to implement the policies for which he was elected, but also because it has led to an inundation of emergency petitions to the Supreme Court as a result of these universal injunctions,\" said Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America.",
      "These sweeping orders have frustrated not just Mr. Trump and his agenda, but also his predecessors. A study from the Harvard Law Review published in April 2024 found that at least 127 nationwide injunctions were issued from 1963 through 2023, though most of those, 96, were entered from 2001 through 2023.",
      "In March, the Congressional Research Service identified 86 nationwide injunctions that were issued under Mr. Trump's first four years in office and 28 during former President Joe Biden's term. But the report warned that it is \"not possible to provide a single definitive count of nationwide injunctions.\"",
      "As to Mr. Trump's second term, the Congressional Research Service identified 17 nationwide injunctions issued during his first two months back in office. The Trump administration estimates there have been at least 28 of these orders entered against it by judges.",
      "\"What universal injunction practice effectively means is that a single district court judge has a veto over the president's national policy and because there are 94 district courts in the country, that means that you have 94 opportunities in theory to shut down any given national policy,\" Alicea said. \"That is a recipe for genuine paralysis in terms of national policy-making and in a way that subverts the separation of powers because single district court judges were never supposed to have this kind of authority to stop national policy in its tracks.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have attacked by name the judges issuing these decisions, and his administration has extended that battle to the relief they are granting. In a filing in one of the birthright citizenship cases, the Justice Department said universal injunctions have reached \"epidemic\" proportions since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "\"Those injunctions thwart the executive branch's crucial policies on matters ranging from border security, to international relations, to national security, to military readiness,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. \"They repeatedly disrupt the operations of the Executive Branch up to the Cabinet level.\"",
      "Republicans in Congress have also taken up the cause against universal injunctions. The GOP-controlled House in April passed a bill that would restrict district court judges from issuing broad injunctive relief. It's unclear whether the measure will pass the Republican-led Senate, where 60 votes are needed for legislation to advance.",
      "But Wofsy, of the ACLU, said the number of lawsuits and injunctions stems from the volume of executive actions taken by the president in the opening months of his second term.",
      "\"The administration has been subject to so many nationwide injunctions and injunctions more generally because it's doing an incredible volume of illegal things, and that is not a reason to take away a tool that the judiciary has to check executive authority. It's the opposite,\" he said. \"Now more than ever it is vital that the judiciary is a strong and robust check against illegal executive actions.\"",
      "The Supreme Court may not stop universal injunctions altogether but could curtail them, as there are instances where relief naturally extends beyond the parties involved in a case. Take, for example, a landowner who sues a factory for polluting a river. In that instance, an injunction that orders the factory to stop would benefit all who live along it, not just the single plaintiff.",
      "\"The basic principle here is courts may only issue injunctions that are as broad as necessary to remedy the plaintiff's asserted harm,\" Alicea said. \"Sometimes that will require an injunction that gives protection even to nonparties as an incidental result of giving protection to the actual plaintiff.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court does curtail judges' ability to enter universal injunctions, courts could still enter tailored relief. Plaintiffs seeking to represent a broader group of people could also file class-action lawsuits. In the context of the birthright citizenship case, a class-action lawsuit could be brought by affected pregnant women in the U.S. illegally and children at risk of losing their right to U.S. citizenship, the Trump administration has argued.",
      "But Wofsy said class-action lawsuits, like nationwide injunctions, are one of many tools available to federal courts and may not be appropriate in every case.",
      "\"The existence of that tool doesn't mean courts shouldn't have other tools available,\" he said. \"The question here isn't, 'should nationwide injections be entered in every case?' The question is, 'are we going to take away the discretion that district courts have to use this as an appropriate tool to craft a remedy in a case where it's necessary?'\"",
      "He said birthright citizenship is an example of a situation in which the constitutional question is so clear, there is no reason the government needs to apply the policy to a single child while the legal challenges move forward.",
      "\"Citizenship really cuts through so many aspects of our society. It matters for so many educational, health, nutrition, other kinds of programs,\" Wofsy said. \"The idea that we would have a patchwork system where people's citizenship isn't just a matter of whether you're born in the United States, but who your parents are, what their status is, do you have documentation, are you a member of this organization, were you born in this state or that state invites confusion, chaos, discrimination and for no real purpose.\"",

      "A version of the idea was revived by President Trump in the executive order signed Monday, which called on the Department of Health and Human Services next month to draw up regulations to impose price restrictions tied to lower amounts paid in other developed nations, if drugmakers did not voluntarily reduce what they were charging in the U.S.",
      "\"Democrats could have done this a long time ago. They have fought like hell, for the drug companies. And they knew they were doing the wrong thing,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking at a White House event to announce the move.",
      "For Democrats on Capitol Hill, this kind of approach to price controls has roots in a bill their own party successfully passed under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.",
      "As part of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate the price of costly drugs it covered, the bill passed by House Democrats wanted the maximum price to be tied to an average based on prices paid in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.",
      "\"We were hoping to get Trump. Trump said, 'I want to negotiate.' But then Republicans in Congress got to him,\" said Wendell Primus, who served for nearly two decades as Pelosi's top aide on health policy.",
      "The bill did not make it through the Senate at the time, which was controlled by Mr. Trump's party. After Democrats flipped control of the Senate, the idea ran into headwinds years later, as Biden aides and lawmakers tried to incorporate the measure into the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Multiple Democrats involved in the talks on Capitol Hill at the time blamed a series of meetings in early 2021 with the staff from the Senate Finance Committee and party leadership for scuttling the idea.",
      "Staff on the committee said that they were worried that moderate Democrats like then-Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would not support the bill if it included the measure, Primus said. Menendez and Sinema are no longer in the Senate.",
      "\"Members did not want to have something referencing foreign countries. They wanted it to make a function of the manufacturer's price here, what drug companies were offering to commercial insurers,\" Primus said.",
      "One former Biden White House aide involved in the talks said that there were several senators who understood that drug prices were too high, but they worried those price caps could undercut innovation from drugmakers in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the deal struck by lawmakers and White House aides to pass the law in 2022 ultimately turned to a different formula: capping them using calculations based on the price previously paid by Medicare and a fixed discount off the list price in the private U.S. market.",
      "\"President Biden and Democrats in Congress cared about getting something done, and so there was a compromise on the table that wasn't perfect, but it was going to make a huge amount of difference. And so that's the law they ultimately enacted,\" said Christen Linke-Young, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Mr. Biden.",
      "Medicare has gone on to implement the law, resulting in talks that are continuing under the current Trump administration to lower the maximum price that the federal insurance program will pay for a growing list of costly drugs.",
      "\"It's a good thing for prescription drug costs in this country to be lower, we need to continue to work on that. And one of the ways to do that is actually put a proposal before Congress and get it enacted, so it has the force of law,\" said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, as the White House was working with their allies in Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration moved to formally scrap a bid by Mr. Trump to impose caps tied to lower prices in other high-income countries using executive power during his first term.",
      "Called the \"most favored nation\" model, Trump officials had directed Medicare to only reimburse hospitals and clinics for some costly drugs based on the lowest price paid for in other high-income countries.",
      "CMS under Mr. Biden ultimately rescinded that move in 2022, after a legal fight that had blocked the proposal on the grounds that the Trump administration had unlawfully shortcutted the normal rulemaking steps to finalize the policy.",
      "\"The proposal was always pretty transparently illegal. The statute says that Medicare has to pay for prescription drugs in one particular way, and the Trump administration proposal was that we are going to ignore the statute and pay for drugs in an entirely different way. If the statute allowed that, a president before Donald Trump would have done it,\" Linke-Young said.",
      "A White House official under Mr. Trump disagreed with the accusation that their initial proposal was unlawful, arguing that the initial authority they used for the \"demonstration\" model in Medicare used powers that were broadly written by Democrats.",
      "While they are not planning to go down the exact same path, the official said, saying that they \"learned certain things from that first demonstration,\" the Trump administration believes they \"absolutely have that authority in our pocket.\"",
      "\"We are confident that we have authorities within our government programs to do this. And any dispute from the Biden administration is an intentional misinterpretation of the statute for political reasons, because they are the ones that walked away,\" the White House official said.",
      "Trump administration officials have painted their second run at the \"most favored nation\" idea as even broader in scope than their first term, which had been limited to only some costly drugs administered by healthcare providers through Medicare Part B.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday that they \"firmly believe\" they have the ability to pursue wider actions to push drugmakers to lower their prices within Medicare. They cited other authorities in the law being considered like section 402, which affords HHS powers to \"develop and engage in experiments\" which could affect payment rates in Medicaid as well.",
      "Asked this week on Fox Business Network whether the president's promise of steep drug price cuts would also extend to Medicare Part D, which covers the broad swath of prescriptions filled at drug store pharmacies, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said \"they absolutely will.\"",
      "\"They'll apply to Medicare, and they'll apply in the private market as well,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Asked Tuesday whether he supported the president's plan, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he thought \"it'll be the subject of probably multiple lawsuits, and I think the courts will probably have something to say about it.\"",

      "These clubs are smaller, looser networks of white supremacist groups, where members train in mixed martial arts. Through sport, they bond over white nationalist ideologies, SPLC said. The clubs also maintain a robust online presence to encourage young men to become radicalized. Patriot Front is using these groups to expand their reach while maintaining a low profile, the\u00a0report\u00a0said, to evade researchers and law enforcement.",
      "\"It serves as a way to hide some of the Patriot Front's movements,\" said Jeff Tischauser, the SPLC report's author and a researcher at the not-for-profit legal advocacy organization.",

The groups host training sessions, create propaganda videos and participate in demonstrations and flash rallies, according to experts. They push male supremacy ideology, share workout selfies and encourage each other to reach peak physicality in preparation for marches or possible future conflicts, experts say.",
      "Robert Rundo, the founder of a white supremacist group based in Southern California, is credited with introducing the idea of Active Clubs, according to the Anti-Defamation League. In 2021, Rundo began hosting a podcast called \"Active Club Podcast,\" where he and his co-host encouraged listeners to establish their own clubs. He hawked what he called \"white nationalism 3.0\" \u2014 a more local, decentralized approach to the white nationalist movement.",
      "Rundo was arrested in Romania in 2023 after the U.S. requested his extradition on federal rioting charges. He was sentenced to two years and effectively received a time-served sentence, being released in December 2024.",

      "\"I think a lot of these groups really function more like brands,\" he said.",
      "Audio messages and a leaked internal memo obtained by the SPLC confirmed direct affiliations between Patriot Front and certain Active Clubs. The founder of a Texas active club was berated for recruiting \"non-European\" members.",
      "\"Is our organization something you are totally committed to, or are you going to be the active club guy doing your own thing?\" The Patriot Front member asked, according to the SPLC report.",
      "The new recruitment method has coincided with Patriot Front's faltering brand, the SPLC says, after years of controversies stemming from various lawsuits and acts of vandalism. In January, Patriot Front was\u00a0ordered to pay\u00a0$2.7 million in damages to a Black musician the group attacked during a march in Boston in 2022. In February, a\u00a0settlement\u00a0was reached between Patriot Front and two North Dakota nonprofits over allegations that the group intimidated immigrant business owners.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-hur-interview-tapes-special-counsel/",
    "published": "Sat, 17 May 2025 07:59:44 -0400",
    "summary": "Former President Joe Biden's speech is marked with long pauses and a halting delivery in a recording of his interview about classified documents released Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Snippets from a 2023 interview that led Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur to describe former President Joe Biden as an \"elderly man with a poor memory\" were obtained and published by Axios Friday, showing Biden's halting tone of voice and difficulty remembering dates.",
      "CBS News has confirmed the audio matches the transcript of the interview released by the Biden White House in 2024.",
      "In one four-minute clip, Biden was asked by Hur's team \u2014 which was investigating Biden's handling of classified records \u2014 about where he kept his documents shortly after leaving office as vice president. Biden's response is marked by long pauses, and his voice appears hoarse at times. His speech is especially halting as he describes the period around his son Beau's death.",
      "In the audio obtained by news outlet Axios, Biden can also be heard struggling to remember the year when Beau died or the year when President Trump was first elected. Members of his staff can be heard correcting him or reminding him of the date.",
      "A written transcript of the five-hour interview was released last year, but portions of the audio released Friday provide context on Biden's demeanor and memory problems at certain points in the session.",
      "In response to the audio, Biden spokesperson Kelly Scully told CBS News in a statement, \"The transcripts were released by the Biden administration more than a year ago. The audio does nothing but confirm what is already public.\"",
      "Biden's verbal delivery was a key part of Hur's report. The special counsel wrote in February 2024 that Biden sounded like a \"sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" Hur said it's a view jurors may share, making it hard to convict Biden of knowingly holding sensitive documents at his home and office. Hur's report noted \"significant limitations\" to Biden's memory, including his difficulty remembering when his son died.",
      "Hur recommended against charging Biden with a crime, though he did conclude that Biden \"willfully\" retained government documents.",
      "At the time, Biden and his allies reacted furiously to Hur's report \u2014 especially the \"elderly man with a poor memory\" line and the comment about Beau Biden's death.",
      "\"There's even a reference that I don't remember when my son died. How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself it wasn't any of their damn business,\" Biden said last year. \"I don't need anyone to tell me when he passed away.\"",
      "Biden's personal attorney Bob Bauer called the report a \"shabby piece of work\" filled with \"totally inappropriate and pejorative comments.\" The Biden White House counsel's office asked Hur's team to revise the report, calling its references to Biden's memory \"inflammatory.\"",
      "The report was released as concerns swirled about Biden's age and fitness to run for another term, though at the time, Democratic officials publicly backed Biden and slammed Hur. Republicans, meanwhile, cited the report as evidence of Biden's fading cognitive abilities and pushed for audio of the interview to be released. Biden was 80 years old at the time of Hur's interview.",
      "But months later, Biden's rocky June debate against Mr. Trump \u2014 in which he repeatedly struggled to complete his sentences \u2014 reignited worries about his age, leading to Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race amid pressure from his party.",
      "Biden's decisions during that period have drawn new scrutiny in recent weeks, as books that offer glimpses inside his campaign hit the shelves. Some of the books describe Biden's struggles with age, his aides' maneuvers to keep him in the race and the abrupt shift from Biden to eventual nominee Kamala Harris weeks after the Trump-Biden debate.",
      "Biden has strongly denied any lapses in his cognitive ability, telling \"The View\" last week, \"there's nothing to sustain that.\"",

The odds will change as bettors place their wagers leading up to Saturday's approximate post time of 7:01 p.m. EDT. Here's a list of all the 3-year-old horses in the race in order by their number with their morning-line odds:",

      "Sovereignty's trainer told Preakness organizers the bay colt was skipping the Run for the Black-Eyed Susans to prepare for the Belmont. The Derby winner arrived last week at Saratoga Race Course, the temporary home of the Triple Crown's third race, while Belmont Park on New York's Long Island is undergoing a massive redevelopment.",
      "Journalism finished the Derby 1 1/2 lengths behind Sovereignty and a neck in front of Baeza, who crossed the finish line third. The second-place result ended the colt's winning streak at four victories, the last three of which were graded-stakes races in California: the Santa Anita Derby in April, March's San Felipe Stakes and the Los Alamitos Futurity Stakes in December.",
      "Jockey Umberto Rispoli was aboard Journalism for those three wins and for the Derby. He'll have the mount again Saturday in his first Preakness.",
      "Journalism's trainer, Michael McCarthy, left the door open for a possible rematch with Sovereignty at the Belmont.",
      "\"I'd imagine, if he'd give a good account of himself here on Saturday,\" McCarthy said Wednesday, according to Preakness organizer 1/ST. \"He had three races in seven weeks as a 2-year-old. It didn't seem to bother him. Three races in five weeks is a little bit different but he's a hardy horse. \u2026 It's in the back of our minds.\"",
      "Two other horses in the Preakness \u2014 Sandman and American Promise \u2014 also ran in the Derby. Sandman finished sixth in the Run for the Roses, and American Promise came in 16th in the 19-horse field.",
      "For the Preakness, Sandman was given 4-1 odds in the morning line, the closest to Journalism. The gray colt won the Arkansas Derby in March after coming in third in February's Rebel Stakes and second in the Southwest Stakes in January.",

      "American Promise received 15-1 morning-line odds for Saturday's race. The chestnut colt has two wins this season, including the Virginia Derby in March, and finished fifth at the Risen Star Stakes in New Orleans in February.",
      "Nik Juarez, who rode American Promise in the Derby, will have the mount again for his first Preakness. But the colt's trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, is no stranger to the race, saddling a record 48 starters and winning seven times, most recently with Seize the Grey last year.",
      "River Thames was given the third-best odds in the morning line with 9-2. The bay colt won two races this year, lost to Sovereignty by a neck at Florida's Fountain of Youth Stakes in March and finished third at last month's Blue Grass Stakes in Kentucky.",
      "Irad Ortiz Jr. will be aboard River Thames for the jockey's seventh mount at the Preakness. Ortiz is looking for his first win at the race after coming in second twice, most recently with Blazing Sevens in 2023. The colt's trainer, Todd Pletcher, has saddled 10 horses at the Preakness and is still seeking his first win.",
      "Clever Again, the son of 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah, received 5-1 odds in the morning line. The bay colt has won two races this year, including Arkansas' Hot Springs Stakes in March.",
      "Jose Ortiz will ride Clever Again in the Preakness, his first mount in the race since winning aboard Early Voting in 2022. With the colt, trainer Steve Asmussen is looking for his first Preakness win since filly Rachel Alexandra's victory in 2009.",
      "Goal Oriented, with 6-1 morning-line odds, will give trainer Bob Baffert a shot at adding to his record eight Preakness victories. The dark bay colt has won two races this year, including one of the Derby's undercard races. Flavien Prat, who won the Preakness aboard Rombauer in 2021, will have the mount Saturday.",
      "With 12-1 odds in the morning line, Heart of Honor will give jockey Saffie Osborne a chance to become the first woman to win a Triple Crown race since 1993, when Julie Krone won the Belmont aboard Colonial Affair. Based in the U.K., Heart of Honor has won two races this season in the United Arab Emirates and came in second at last month's UAE Derby.",

      "\"Those could be made into flooring, into mats, into tiles,\" Hachem said. \"And we've also made a sandal from 85% sneaker foam.\"",
      "He said his goal in founding Sneaker Impact was to develop an environmentally friendly way to do business.",
      "\"This is important, there is no planet B. Sneaker Impact should be the last resort \u2014 reuse, upcycle, gift to your neighbors,\" Hachem said.  \u00a0 He said he hopes other companies replicate the type of work he's doing \u00a0 \"We have no other competition,\" Hachem said. \"The only competition we have are landfills.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's domestic policy bill hit a major snag on Friday after conservatives blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee.",
      "Republicans have yet to resolve several disputes that have threatened to derail what Mr. Trump calls his \"big, beautiful bill\" as more conservative members and blue-state Republicans dig in on their demands.",
      "Five Republicans \u2014 Reps. Chip Roy of Texas, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma and Andrew Clyde of Georgia \u2014 voted against advancing the legislation on Friday when the Budget Committee met to merge the various parts of the reconciliation package\u00a0that have been produced by other committees into a single bill.",
      "Conservatives said the legislation does not go far enough to slash federal spending. Among the demands conservative members have made are moving up the work requirements for Medicaid recipients without disabilities and children. The requirements would not set in until 2029 under the current bill and conservatives want them to kick in as soon as the legislation becomes law.",
      "\"This bill falls profoundly short. It does not do what we say it does with respect to deficits,\" Roy said during the meeting, adding that \"this bill has back-loaded savings and has front-loaded spending.\"",
      "Clyde also said the bill \"falls short\" and \"substantive improvements are needed.\"",
      "\"Sadly, I'm a hard no until we get this ironed out,\" Norman said.",
      "Smucker, who changed his vote at the last second, said he supports the bill but voted \"no\" to be able to bring up the legislation for another vote. The committee plans to return late Sunday to vote again.",
      "Rep. Jodey Arrington of Texas, the Republican chairman of the committee, defended his decision to move forward with Friday's meeting despite warnings from conservatives that it lacked enough support, saying \"you can't accomplish anything in life without having deadlines and decisions.\"",
      "\"Their hearts are in the right place. Their motives are pure. I share their convictions, and I share their desired outcomes of changing some of these policies and making the bill better. This is not the right venue to do it,\" Arrington said Friday afternoon after meeting with the holdouts.",
      "The Budget Committee can't make any changes to the bill, but it could still be updated if it comes before the Rules Committee. The plan was for the Rules Committee to meet Monday to tee it up for a floor vote later next week if it advanced out of the Budget Committee Friday.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has remained committed to putting the legislation, which would extend tax cuts from Mr. Trump's first term while temporarily enacting new ones, on the floor before Memorial Day despite the disagreements between some factions in his party. The tax measures, as well as increased spending on the military and border security, would be offset partly by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy subsidies.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, Scalise that they are considering moving up the effective date for the work requirements to get more members on board with the final product, but added that the final details have not been worked out.",
      "\"We're all in agreement on the reforms we want to make,\" Scalise said. \"We want to have work requirements. We want to phase out a lot of these green subsidies. How quickly can you get that done? It's not as quickly as saying, you just turn it off tomorrow.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a group of Republicans from blue states have threatened to withhold their support in a floor vote if the bill does not raise a cap on state and local taxes that can be written off on federal tax returns. The bill increases the cap on the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000, but several New York Republicans have insisted on raising it even further.",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, on Thursday called the cap \"unacceptable\" and said the group has made clear to leadership that \"none of us are going to support that as it currently stands.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, who is on his way back from the Middle East, called on Republicans to unite behind the bill. Scalise said Mr. Trump had been following the issue closely.",
      "\"We don't need 'GRANDSTANDERS' in the Republican Party. STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!\" Mr. Trump wrote Friday as the Budget Committee meeting was underway.",
      "Johnson spent Thursday meeting with the opposing factions and said they would continue to negotiate through the weekend to resolve the remaining differences. He can afford just three defections, if all members are voting, in a floor vote.",

      "The impact has also been felt in Columbus, where 15 churches are slated to close.",
      "\"We've kind of made up for some gaps in the priest shortage by bringing in missionary priests from other countries, but also priests from different religious orders,\" said Bishop Earl Fernandes, who leads the Columbus Diocese.",
      "About one in four Catholic priests in the U.S. is foreign-born, according to CARA. Many could soon be forced to leave unless special visas for religious workers are extended. New bipartisan legislation was introduced in the Senate last month, known as the Religious Workforce Protection Act, designed to protect foreign-born religious workers to stay in the U.S. while waiting for permanent residency.",
      "To recruit more priests in Columbus, there are retreats and monthly dinners for those considering the priesthood.",
      "The number of new seminarians at Pontifical College has grown from 17, two-and-a-half years ago, to 40 this year.",
      "Local Catholic leaders hope the election of Pope Leo XIV, the first ever American pope, will serve as an inspiration.",
      "\"I have never been happier than I am right now, on the cusp of becoming a priest, having made all of these promises: never get married, and never to do these things, it doesn't make any sense in the eyes of the world,\" Rolwing said. \"But I've answered this call, and by far, it's the best decision I've ever made.\"",

      "Former FBI Director James Comey has provoked an outcry from the Trump administration after he briefly posted a photo to Instagram that federal officials alleged was a call for violence against President Trump \u2014 a claim Comey pushed back on.",
      "Comey was interviewed Friday by Secret Service agents investigating the post at their field office in Washington, D.C., two officials familiar with the matter told CBS News. The interview wrapped at approximately 7 p.m. ET, roughly 90 minutes after it was slated to begin, two sources familiar said.",
      "The image shared by Comey \u2014 a longtime Trump foe \u2014 showed seashells in sand arranged to form the numbers \"86 47,\" according to screenshots shared by Trump administration officials.",
      "He did not make his meaning clear, but administration officials and some of his supporters interpreted the numbers as referring to Mr. Trump's status as the 47th president and the slang term \"eighty-six,\" which has often been used to mean \"eject\" or \"remove.\"",
      "Comey later deleted the image. In a follow-up Instagram post Thursday night, Comey wrote that he \"posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message. I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.\"",

      "In a post Friday night on X, Noem confirmed that Secret Service agents had interviewed Comey, writing, in part: \"I will continue to take all measures necessary to ensure the protection of @POTUS Trump. This is an ongoing investigation.\"",
      "Current FBI Director Kash Patel said in a separate statement that, \"We are aware of the recent tweet by former FBI Director James Comey, directed at President Trump. We are in communication with the Secret Service and Director (Sean) Curran. Primary jurisdiction is with SS on these matters and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support.\"",
      "A Secret Service spokesperson told CBS News in a statement Thursday it \"vigorously investigates anything that can be taken as a potential threat against our protectees. We are aware of the social media posts by the former FBI Director and we take rhetoric like this very seriously. Beyond that, we do not comment on protective intelligence matters.\"",
      "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich wrote in his own social media post Comey's message \"can clearly be interpreted as 'a hit' on the sitting President of the United States,\" and said it is \"being taken seriously.\"",
      "Trump responds",
      "In an interview with Fox News, the president claimed Comey knew \"exactly what that meant\" when he posted the image on Instagram. \"That meant assassination, and it says it loud and clear,\" Mr. Trump told Fox's Bret Baier.

      "That firing ultimately set into motion Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced those allegations as a \"hoax.\"",

      "Mr. Trump was the target of two assassination attempts during his presidential campaign last year. During a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a 20-year-old gunman opened fire on Mr. Trump, grazing his ear with a bullet. One rally attendee was killed and two more were wounded.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. credit rating was downgraded by Moody's Ratings on Friday, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "The downgrade from the top rating of Aaa to Aa1 \"reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,\" the credit rating firm said in a statement on Friday.",
      "\"Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" Moody's added.",
      "Moody's also highlighted the environment of heightened policy uncertainty driven by Mr. Trump's evolving trade priorities.",
      "Moody's is the last of the three major credit rating agencies to downgrade U.S. government debt. In August 2011, Standard and Poor's downgraded the U.S. from AAA to AA+, and in August 2023\u00a0Fitch Ratings cut the credit rating a notch from AAA to AA+.",
      "Moody's said it expects federal deficits to grow from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% of GDP by 2035, driven by \"increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending and relatively low revenue generation.''",
      "\"Even Obama economists warned the Biden administration and congressional Democrats against recklessly wasting trillions on COVID 'stimulus' bills \u2013 spending that piled on our national debt, fueled runaway inflation, and forced the Fed to raise interest rates for everyday Americans,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement Friday to CBS News in response to the downgrade. \"The Trump administration and Republicans are focused on fixing Biden's mess by slashing the waste, fraud, and abuse in government and passing The One, Big, Beautiful Bill to get our house back in order. If Moody's had any credibility, they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded.\"",
      "The credit downgrade came as the House Budget Committee on Friday rejected\u00a0President Trump's domestic policy bill, which would extend tax cuts from his first term.",
      "If the 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act is extended, it would add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit (excluding interest payments) over the next decade, Moody's said Friday.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office projects that federal debt held by the public will rise from 100% of GDP to 118% in 2035. That would exceed a previous high of 106% in 1946.",
      "Despite the debt downgrade, Moody's changed its outlook on the U.S. from negative to stable. The credit agency said the U.S. \"retains exceptional credit strengths such as the size, resilience and dynamism of its economy and the continued role of the U.S. dollar as global reserve currency.\"",
      "Another strength is the country's track record of \"very effective monetary policy led by an independent Federal Reserve,\" Moody's said.",

      "Wisconsin Historical Society Maritime Archaeologist Tamara Thomsen said that the society confirmed that Christopher Thuss found the wreck of the J.C. Ames. Thuss was fishing in Lake Michigan off the city of Manitowoc in foggy conditions on Tuesday when he noticed the wreckage in nine feet of water off a breakwater, she said in a message to The Associated Press.",
      "The society said that according to the book \"Green Bay Workhorses: The Nau Tug Line,\" the Rand and Burger shipbuilding company in Manitowoc built the J.C. Ames in 1881 to help move lumber. The tug was one of the largest and most powerful on the Great Lakes, with a 670-horsepower engine.",
      "The tug served multiple purposes beyond moving lumber, including transporting railway cars. It eventually fell into disrepair and was scuttled in 1923, as was the practice then when ships outlived their usefulness, Thomsen said.",
      "The ship had been buried in the sand at the bottom of the lake for decades before storms this winter apparently revealed it, Thomsen said. A lack of quagga mussels attached to the ship indicates it was only recently exposed, she said.",
      "Historians are racing to locate shipwrecks and downed planes in the Great Lakes before quagga mussels destroy them. Quagga have become the dominant invasive species in the lower lakes over the last 30 years, attaching themselves to wooden shipwrecks and sunken aircraft in layers so thick they eventually crush the wreckage.",
      "\"These kinds of discoveries are always so exciting because it allows a piece of lost history to resurface. It sat there for over a hundred years and then came back on our radar completely by chance,\" Thomsen said in a statement. \"We are grateful that Chris Thuss noticed the wreck and reported it so we can share this story with the Wisconsin communities that this history belongs to.\"",
      "In September, maritime historians Brendon Baillod and Bob Jaeck announced they had discovered the wreck of the John Evenson, a towing tug was lost in June 1895 while assisting a freighter as it was entering the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal in Lake Michigan.

    "summary": "The greatest benefits would go to high-income households, while low-income families would see a much more modest boost, analyses show.",
    "story": [
      "The White House on Friday touted a Republican-backed tax bill as delivering \"PERMANENT tax cuts and bigger paychecks.\" Yet experts say the legislation would disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering far more modest gains to Americans lower down the ladder.",
      "If the bill is passed, households with more than $1 million in annual income would see their after-tax earnings rise by 4.3%, according to a new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a public policy think tank. The lowest-earning 20% of Americans would receive the smallest boost \u2014 their after-tax incomes would rise 0.6%, or an average of $90 annually, CBPP found.",
      "Other analyses have reached similar conclusions. The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution,\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the bottom 20% of Americans would see a 0.6% increase in after-tax income under the House tax bill, compared with a 3.7% increase for the top 20%.",
      "The fate of the GOP tax bill is unclear after five Republican members of the House Budget Committee on Friday voted against advancing the measure, dubbed the \"one big, beautiful, bill,\" saying the legislation does not do enough to slash federal spending.",
      "Such projections don't include the impact of cuts to federal programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which support many low- and middle-income households. Under the GOP bill, those services could face steep cuts, potentially bumping millions off Medicaid by adding work requirements and cutting federal funding provided to states to support the health care program.",
      "Those cuts could leave many low-income households worse off even after accounting for lower taxes, according to another analysis released Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania research group that analyzes the fiscal impact of public policies.",
      "The bottom 20% of households, who earn up to about $17,000 annually, would see their after-tax incomes drop by $1,035 in 2026, including a reduction in government benefits, the nonpartisan group found. The top 0.1%, who earn at least $4.3 million per year, would get an annual after-tax boost of about $389,000, Penn Wharton said.",
      "The White House took issue with the CBPP and Penn Wharton analyses.",
      "\"Once again, the experts are wrong, just as they were about the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have yielded trillions in investments, record job growth, and no inflation,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These experts should be embarrassed to share their 'expertise,' considering the egg still on their faces. MAGAnomics transcends conventional wisdom, and the President's One, Big, Beautiful Bill will continue to prove the haters wrong.\"",
      "The White House pointed to an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation that estimated the average tax bill would decline 11.1% in 2027 under the GOP legislation. The nonpartisan panel, which assess the impact of legislation for Congress, found that the biggest tax decrease would go to people earning $15,000 to $30,000, with a decline of 21.1%, while those earning more than $1 million would decline 8.6%",
      "Tariff impact",
      "Because low-income households spend a bigger share of their income on basics like food and clothing than wealthier Americans, they are likely to take a bigger financial hit from tariffs, experts including the nonpartisan\u00a0Yale Budget Lab have said. That could effectively wipe out the benefits from the tax cuts, according to some analysts.",
      "If inflation rises as a result of higher tariffs and tax cuts, the bottom 20% of U.S. households would lose $100 per year, largely due to paying higher costs for consumer goods that are imported from other countries, the CBPP found. Because tariffs are taxes on imports paid by U.S. businesses, they typically pass on the cost of such duties to consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"If we add just the effects of the tariffs the Trump Administration has put in place, the plan would still boost the rich while leaving the lowest-income people worse off because their tax cuts are so small,\" Brendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the CBPP, said in a post.",
      "Counting the impact of tariffs, the top 1% of households would still see their after-tax incomes increase by 3%, or almost $45,000, the think tank estimated. That analysis doesn't include the impact of cuts to services like Medicaid or food stamps.",
      "On Thursday, Walmart said it plans to hike prices this month to offset the cost of new tariffs introduced by the Trump administration.",
      "Extending the 2017 tax cuts",
      "As well as calling for deeper cuts in federal spending, the Republican lawmakers blocking the tax bill also want to move up\u00a0work requirements\u00a0for some Medicaid recipients, which under the current bill wouldn't kick in until 2029.",
      "Other Republicans want a bigger deduction cap on state and local taxes, known as SALT, that can be applied on people's\u00a0federal tax returns. The bill increases the cap on the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000.",
      "But the bill's basic outline for cutting taxes isn't a focus of debate among Republicans, who are seeking to extend Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill would also add a host of other cuts, such as eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, while also providing a more generous standard deduction.",

      "With her due date still more than three months away, it could be one of the longest such pregnancies. Her family is upset that Georgia's law, which restricts abortion once cardiac activity is detected, doesn't allow relatives to have a say in whether a pregnant woman is kept on life support.",
      "Georgia's\u00a0\"heartbeat law\" is among the restrictive abortion statutes that have been put in place in many conservative states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade\u00a0three years ago.",
      "Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old mother and nurse, was declared brain-dead - meaning she is legally dead - in February, her mother, April Newkirk, told Atlanta TV station WXIA.",
      "Newkirk said her daughter had intense headaches more than three months ago and went to Atlanta's Northside Hospital, where she received medication and was released. The next morning, her boyfriend woke to her gasping for air and called 911. Emory University Hospital determined she had blood clots in her brain and she was declared brain-dead.",
      "Newkirk said Smith is now 21 weeks pregnant. Removing breathing tubes and other life-saving devices would likely kill the fetus.",
      "A spokesperson for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said in a statement to CBS News on Friday, \"There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death.\"",
      "\"Removing life support is not an action 'with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,'\" the spokesperson said, quoting part of the law.",
      "Gov. Brian Kemp's office declined to comment on Smith's case and referred CBS News to the statement from the attorney general's spokesperson.",
      "Northside did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Emory Healthcare said it could not comment on an individual case because of privacy rules, but released a statement saying it \"uses consensus from clinical experts, medical literature, and legal guidance to support our providers as they make individualized treatment recommendations in compliance with Georgia's abortion laws and all other applicable laws. Our top priorities continue to be the safety and well-being of the patients we serve.\"",
      "Smith's family says Emory doctors have told them they are not allowed to stop or remove the devices that are keeping her breathing because state law bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected \u2014 generally around six weeks into pregnancy.",
      "The law was adopted in 2019 but not enforced until after Roe v. Wade\u00a0was overturned in the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling, opening the door to state abortion bans. Twelve states are enforcing bans on\u00a0abortion\u00a0at all stages of pregnancy and three others have bans like Georgia's that kick in after about six weeks.",
      "Like the others, Georgia's ban includes an exception if an abortion is necessary to maintain the woman's life. Those exceptions have been at the heart of legal and political questions, including a major Texas Supreme Court ruling last year that found the ban there applies even when there are major pregnancy complications.",
      "Smith's family, including her five-year-old son, still visit her in the hospital.",
      "Newkirk told WXIA that doctors told the family that the fetus has fluid on the brain and that they're concerned about his health.",
      "\"She's pregnant with my grandson. But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he's born,\" Newkirk said. She has not said whether the family wants Smith removed from life support.",
      "Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging Georgia's abortion law, said the situation is problematic.",
      "\"Her family deserved the right to have decision-making power about her medical decisions,\" Simpson said in a statement. \"Instead, they have endured over 90 days of retraumatization, expensive medical costs, and the cruelty of being unable to resolve and move toward healing.\"",
      "Lois Shepherd, a bioethicist and law professor at the University of Virginia, said she does not believe life support is legally required in this case.",
      "But she said whether a state could insist that Smith remains on life support is uncertain since the overturning of Roe, which found that fetuses do not have the rights of people.",
      "\"Pre-Dobbs, a fetus didn't have any rights,\" Shepherd said. \"And the state's interest in fetal life could not be so strong as to overcome other important rights, but now we don't know.\"",
      "The situation echoes a case in Texas more than a decade ago when a brain-dead woman was kept on life support for about two months because she was pregnant. A judge eventually ruled that the hospital was misapplying state law, and life support was removed.",
      "Brain death in pregnancy is rare. Even rarer still are cases in which doctors aim to prolong the pregnancy after a woman is declared brain-dead.",
      "\"It's a very complex situation, obviously, not only ethically but also medically,\" said Dr. Vincenzo Berghella, director of maternal fetal medicine at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.",
      "A 2021 review that Berghella co-authored scoured medical literature going back decades for cases in which doctors declared a woman brain-dead and aimed to prolong her pregnancy. It found 35.",
      "Of those, 27 resulted in a live birth, the majority either immediately declared healthy or with normal follow-up tests. But Berghella also cautioned that the Georgia case was much more difficult because the pregnancy was less far along when the woman was declared brain dead. In the 35 cases he studied, doctors were able to prolong the pregnancy by an average of just seven weeks before complications forced them to intervene.",
      "\"It's just hard to keep the mother out of infection, out of cardiac failure,\" he said.",
      "Berghella also found a case from Germany that resulted in a live birth when the woman was declared brain dead at nine weeks of pregnancy - about as far along as Smith was when she died.",
      "Georgia's law confers personhood on a fetus. Those who favor personhood say fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses should be considered people with the same rights as those already born.",
      "Georgia state Sen. Ed Setzler, a Republican who sponsored the 2019 law, said he supported Emory's interpretation.",
      "\"I think it is completely appropriate that the hospital do what they can to save the life of the child,\" Setzler said. \"I think this is an unusual circumstance, but I think it highlights the value of innocent human life. I think the hospital is acting appropriately.\"",
      "Setzler said he believes it is sometimes acceptable to remove life support from someone who is brain dead, but that the law is \"an appropriate check\" because the mother is pregnant. He said Smith's relatives have \"good choices,\" including keeping the child or offering it for adoption.",
      "Georgia's abortion ban has been in the spotlight before.",
      "Last year, ProPublica reported that two Georgia women died after they did not get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills.

      "Out of 4,509 drowning deaths reported in 2022, the CDC's modeling found that 51 likely could have been prevented by better pool fencing, and 297 could have been prevented by victims wearing a life jacket during a boating accident.",
      "That adds up to thousands of dollars in medical spending and an economic cost to the country of $4.5 billion, the CDC researchers estimated.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has greenlit Japan-based test manufacturer Fujirebio to begin marketing its blood test for helping doctors diagnose Alzheimer's disease in some patients, clearing the way for wider availability of the approach.",
      "Fujirebio's test works with the company's Lumipulse equipment, which the company says is already \"widely available in clinical laboratories\" around the U.S. Fujirebio describes Lumipulse as a \"fully automated\" system that can run 120 tests an hour on blood and other samples.",
      "The test works by measuring two kinds of proteins in the blood that are associated with whether the brain has built up amyloid plaques, which research has linked to Alzheimer's disease.",
      "\"Today's clearance is an important step for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, making it easier and potentially more accessible for U.S. patients earlier in the disease,\" Dr. Michelle Tarver, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement.",
      "Not all people should take Fujirebio's new test. The FDA says that it is \"intended for patients presenting at a specialized care setting with signs and symptoms of cognitive decline\" and is limited for adults ages 55 and older.",
      "The agency says that Fujirebio submitted data from a study of 499 blood plasma samples of adults who had cognitive impairment, comparing the results from the blood test with the alternative ways that doctors can check for amyloid plaques building up in the head: brain scans and tests of spinal fluid.",
      "In 91.7% of studied patients who tested positive in their blood, they also had amyloid plaques that showed up in a brain scan or a test of spinal fluid. The share of negative results that matched with these other tests was also high, at 97.3% of patients.",
      "\"We designed our Lumipulse G pTau 217/\u03b2-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio test to help physicians and patients with signs and symptoms of cognitive decline obtain an AD diagnosis much earlier when interventions are more effective,\" Fujirebio said in a release last year, after it submitted its regulatory filing to the FDA for the test.",
      "The FDA's sign-off on marketing for Fujirebio's test comes years after other blood tests for Alzheimer's have already begun sales, without this kind of approval from the agency.",
      "Experts have been wary about some previous blood tests for diagnosing Alzheimer's, which were being sold under different regulations that govern tests that are created by individual laboratories doing high complexity testing.",
      "Last year under the Biden administration, the agency had sought to crack down on these other \"laboratory developed tests\" being sold to diagnose Alzheimer's and other health issues, which FDA officials argued should be subject to stricter federal oversight.",
      "\"The FDA's approach was developed half a century ago when tests made and used in single labs were generally simple, often made to address local individual needs, and mostly manufactured in small volumes,\" federal health officials said in January.",
      "In defending the move, the FDA cited as an example a past submission from a test that failed to earn the agency's marketing authorization for helping to diagnose Alzheimer's, but was still able to be sold in the U.S. market by the laboratory.",
      "\"Many treatable conditions have symptoms similar to AD or another form of dementia. Without sufficient information to demonstrate adequate validation, a test's performance is unknown, which may put patients at risk of harm due to inaccurate results,\" the agency said.",
      "A lawsuit backed by the American Clinical Laboratory Association successfully challenged the FDA's new rule on the laboratory developed tests, persuading a federal judge in Texas earlier this year to toss out the regulation.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge grew frustrated with the Trump administration Friday as it pushed to withhold details on what it has done to reverse the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was sent to a prison in El Salvador as the result of an \"administrative error.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. last month \u2014 and has sparred with the administration since then, ordering government lawyers to produce details on their efforts and accusing them of failing to adequately comply.",
      "Attorney Andrew Rossman said he and the rest of the legal team seeking to return Abrego Garcia have hit a \"roadblock\" in discovery efforts, as the Justice Department has invoked the state secrets privilege and other privileges to withhold information in the case. Rossman cited a \"paltry\" number of documents provided during court-ordered fact-finding.",
      "\"We have no case without knowing what steps they've taken or what steps they have not taken,\" to return Abrego Garcia, Rossman said Friday. He pointed to a \"dichotomy\" between Justice Department filings saying they are complying with a court order to return him and public statements from President Trump and other top administration officials saying they will not return the man.",
      "Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn argued the government has properly invoked the state secrets privilege in this case and has cooperated with all discovery efforts by Abrego Garcia's attorneys. He said Abrego Garcia's lawyers are \"seeking a categorical piercing\" of the state secrets privilege to get the answers they want.",
      "Xinis rejected the argument, saying, \"you can't tell me that these depositions are a good faith effort\" to answer questions about what operations were or are underway to return Abrego Garcia. \"This is about good faith versus bad faith,\" she added.",
      "\"I'm like the cat with the ball of string, and I'm just trying to keep up with the string.\" Xinis said about her attempts to keep up with the Justice Department's various privilege arguments in the case.",
      "Xinis allowed an expedited discovery process to begin last month after Abrego Garcia's legal team accused the Trump administration of failing to follow her order to facilitate his return to the U.S. The Supreme Court had agreed that the administration had to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "Xinis said Friday that the depositions undertaken so far of Trump administration officials resulted in a \"goose egg\" and had no new knowledge in them, citing numerous \"I don't knows\" provided in answers to questions from Abrego Garcia's attorneys.",
      "Rossman said that he and the rest of the legal team representing Abrego Garcia have only received 32 new documents in their discovery efforts, and 1,140 documents submitted in discovery are being withheld from them under \"any manner of privilege\" the Justice Department could invoke.",
      "Rossman added that the Justice Department has promised additional documents from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but that he and his co-counsel have not received them yet.",
      "\"It's critical, a life is in the balance. Due process is in the balance,\" Rossman said about the need for a quick resolution to discovery.",
      "Guuyn said that the Justice Department got another update from El Salvador yesterday that Abrego Garcia is in \"good health\" and has \"gained weight\" since his detention there.",
      "After the two and a half hours of the hearing in open court ended, Xinis held a closed-door argument on the remaining disagreements between the sides on sealed discovery documents.",
      "Trump administration spars with judge over deportation",
      "Abrego Garcia, who was born in El Salvador, entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 and lived in Maryland after that. In 2019, he was granted a withholding of removal, a legal status that prevented the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador because of a risk of persecution by local gangs.",
      "But Abrego Garcia was among the hundreds of migrants sent by the Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious Terrorism Confinement Center prison, or CECOT, in March.",
      "A federal immigration official acknowledged in court papers his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the administration has since declined to return him to the U.S. Instead, top administration officials have claimed Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant. His lawyers argue that Abrego Garcia is not a member of MS-13 or any other gang, and has never been charged or convicted of any crimes in the U.S., El Salvador or any other country.",
      "Guynn and Xinis got into a heated back-and-forth over the legality of Abrego Garcia's removal on Friday, after Guynn said that Abrego Garcia was \"removed lawfully\" from the U.S. to El Salvador.",
      "\"That's not lawful,\" Xinis said, citing a previous court order that barred Abrego Garcia's removal specifically to El Salvador.",
      "\"He'll never walk free in the United States.\" Guynn said, saying he will be in U.S. custody if he was ever returned to the United States as removal proceedings play out.",
      "\"That sounds to me like an admission of your client that your client will not take steps\" to return Abrego Garcia, Xinis said. \"That's about as clear as it gets.\"",
      "Xinis later chastised Guynn for suggesting that Abrego Garcia's arrest was lawful, which even Erez Reuveni, a Justice Department attorney who first argued the case, admitted in court proceedings that it was not, and that the arrest was warrantless.",
      "\"It was highly publicized that Mr. Reuveni was benched,\" for honestly answering her questions, Xinis said.",
      "Mr. Trump and other top administration officials have repeatedly said it is up to El Salvador whether to release Abrego Garcia. As of April 21, he was being held at a lower-security facility in Santa Ana, according to a declaration from a State Department official.",
      "In a separate case in Washington, D.C., the Justice Department has argued in court that due to a financial agreement with the Salvadoran government, it does not have constructive custody over the detainees who were moved from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act once they are in CECOT or other Salvadoran prisons, and cannot be compelled to return Abrego Garcia or any other person detained in El Salvador under the agreement.",
      "Government claims \"state secrets\"",
      "The administration's assertion of privilege was revealed in an order last week from Xinis, which asked lawyers for Abrego Garcia and the Justice Department to file additional legal papers about the administration's \"invocations of privilege, principally the state secrets and deliberative process privileges.\"",
      "Attorneys for Abrego Garcia asked for Xinis to grant additional depositions in their discovery efforts, including potentially a deposition with someone with first-hand knowledge of efforts to return Abrego Garcia from the White House. The Justice Department called the request \"unreasonable\" and added that more depositions \"goes well beyond the limited discovery the Court granted.\"",
      "The Justice Department had indicated last month that it would invoke certain privileges to protect information regarding Abrego Garcia's removal from the U.S., citing in a filing the attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege and certain executive privileges.",
      "Administration lawyers had said that a request for documents from Abrego Garcia's legal team about the terms of any arrangement regarding the government's use of El Salvador's notorious prison to house deportees from the U.S. \"calls for the immediate production of classified documents, as well as documents that defendants may elect to assert are subject to the protections of attorney-client privilege and the state secrets privilege.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 16:34:13 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump is now seeking to implement the idea through an executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats and the Biden administration dropped plans to set drug price caps based on the amount paid in other high-income countries, during talks years ago to push through the law that empowered Medicare to negotiate down the cost of prescription medications.",
      "A version of the idea was revived by President Trump in the executive order signed Monday, which called on the Department of Health and Human Services next month to draw up regulations to impose price restrictions tied to lower amounts paid in other developed nations, if drugmakers did not voluntarily reduce what they were charging in the U.S.",
      "\"Democrats could have done this a long time ago. They have fought like hell, for the drug companies. And they knew they were doing the wrong thing,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking at a White House event to announce the move.",
      "For Democrats on Capitol Hill, this kind of approach to price controls has roots in a bill their own party successfully passed under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.",
      "As part of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate the price of costly drugs it covered, the bill passed by House Democrats wanted the maximum price to be tied to an average based on prices paid in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.",
      "\"We were hoping to get Trump. Trump said, 'I want to negotiate.' But then Republicans in Congress got to him,\" said Wendell Primus, who served for nearly two decades as Pelosi's top aide on health policy.",
      "The bill did not make it through the Senate at the time, which was controlled by Mr. Trump's party. After Democrats flipped control of the Senate, the idea ran into headwinds years later, as Biden aides and lawmakers tried to incorporate the measure into the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Multiple Democrats involved in the talks on Capitol Hill at the time blamed a series of meetings in early 2021 with the staff from the Senate Finance Committee and party leadership for scuttling the idea.",
      "Staff on the committee said that they were worried that moderate Democrats like then-Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would not support the bill if it included the measure, Primus said. Menendez and Sinema are no longer in the Senate.",
      "\"Members did not want to have something referencing foreign countries. They wanted it to make a function of the manufacturer's price here, what drug companies were offering to commercial insurers,\" Primus said.",
      "One former Biden White House aide involved in the talks said that there were several senators who understood that drug prices were too high, but they worried those price caps could undercut innovation from drugmakers in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the deal struck by lawmakers and White House aides to pass the law in 2022 ultimately turned to a different formula: capping them using calculations based on the price previously paid by Medicare and a fixed discount off the list price in the private U.S. market.",
      "\"President Biden and Democrats in Congress cared about getting something done, and so there was a compromise on the table that wasn't perfect, but it was going to make a huge amount of difference. And so that's the law they ultimately enacted,\" said Christen Linke-Young, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Mr. Biden.",
      "Medicare has gone on to implement the law, resulting in talks that are continuing under the current Trump administration to lower the maximum price that the federal insurance program will pay for a growing list of costly drugs.",
      "\"It's a good thing for prescription drug costs in this country to be lower, we need to continue to work on that. And one of the ways to do that is actually put a proposal before Congress and get it enacted, so it has the force of law,\" said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, as the White House was working with their allies in Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration moved to formally scrap a bid by Mr. Trump to impose caps tied to lower prices in other high-income countries using executive power during his first term.",
      "Called the \"most favored nation\" model, Trump officials had directed Medicare to only reimburse hospitals and clinics for some costly drugs based on the lowest price paid for in other high-income countries.",
      "CMS under Mr. Biden ultimately rescinded that move in 2022, after a legal fight that had blocked the proposal on the grounds that the Trump administration had unlawfully shortcutted the normal rulemaking steps to finalize the policy.",
      "\"The proposal was always pretty transparently illegal. The statute says that Medicare has to pay for prescription drugs in one particular way, and the Trump administration proposal was that we are going to ignore the statute and pay for drugs in an entirely different way. If the statute allowed that, a president before Donald Trump would have done it,\" Linke-Young said.",
      "A White House official under Mr. Trump disagreed with the accusation that their initial proposal was unlawful, arguing that the initial authority they used for the \"demonstration\" model in Medicare used powers that were broadly written by Democrats.",
      "While they are not planning to go down the exact same path, the official said, saying that they \"learned certain things from that first demonstration,\" the Trump administration believes they \"absolutely have that authority in our pocket.\"",
      "\"We are confident that we have authorities within our government programs to do this. And any dispute from the Biden administration is an intentional misinterpretation of the statute for political reasons, because they are the ones that walked away,\" the White House official said.",
      "Trump administration officials have painted their second run at the \"most favored nation\" idea as even broader in scope than their first term, which had been limited to only some costly drugs administered by healthcare providers through Medicare Part B.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday that they \"firmly believe\" they have the ability to pursue wider actions to push drugmakers to lower their prices within Medicare. They cited other authorities in the law being considered like section 402, which affords HHS powers to \"develop and engage in experiments\" which could affect payment rates in Medicaid as well.",
      "Asked this week on Fox Business Network whether the president's promise of steep drug price cuts would also extend to Medicare Part D, which covers the broad swath of prescriptions filled at drug store pharmacies, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said \"they absolutely will.\"",
      "\"They'll apply to Medicare, and they'll apply in the private market as well,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Asked Tuesday whether he supported the president's plan, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he thought \"it'll be the subject of probably multiple lawsuits, and I think the courts will probably have something to say about it.\"",

      "\"Unfortunately, Israeli reaction to this was a mass bombing the next day,\" said al-Thani, adding that, along with \"statements coming out of the Israeli government\" about not ending the war \"is basically sending the signal that we [Israel] are not interested in negotiations.\"",
      "The top Qatari diplomat stressed that the country's negotiating team remained engaged with all parties in the conflict, and \"we hope to see some progress,\" but he cautioned: \"I'm not sure if this progress will be something seen very soon with this continuing behavior.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 19:07:03 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced this week he will drop sanctions on Syria \u2014 surprising some senior Treasury officials, sources tell CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 For the leaders of Syria's transitional government, President Trump's announcement earlier this week that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on the country came as a relief after months of intense lobbying for a reprieve.",
      "\"I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,\" Mr. Trump said at an investment forum in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday.",
      "But inside the Treasury Department, which administers and enforces sanctions policy, the announcement came as a surprise to senior officials, sources tell CBS News.",
      "The announcement was also short on specifics, including which measures would be rolled back, and at what pace. The lack of clarity sent senior officials at Treasury scrambling to understand what he meant.",
      "Now, there are discussions inside Treasury to determine the speed and extent to which the decades-old sanctions \u2014 which restrict economic activity within Syria and its dealings with other countries \u2014 can be rolled back.",
      "A Treasury Spokesperson said Friday, \"President Trump is the Commander-in-Chief and the Treasury Department is in lockstep to execute his historic vision to bring peace and stability back to the Middle East.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers that he was with Mr. Trump when he decided to include the announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria in his speech in Riyadh. Rubio did not say when the president made the decision.",
      "\"This is something that had been discussed, worked on, options considered for many weeks leading up to this announcement and that we are going to be implementing what the president has announced as an administration,\" State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Some work was underway at Treasury before the president's announcement for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979.",
      "Indeed, Syria's transitional government \u2014 led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa \u2014 has pushed the Trump administration for sanctions relief in recent months.",
      "The new government has blamed sanctions \u2014 which include penalties on third countries for doing business in Syria \u2014 for its inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct sizable chunks of war-ravaged cities and rebuild a health-care system decimated by war.",
      "Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two U.S. allies in the region, have backed normalizing relations with Syria's new government. Both countries have provided aid to Syria, and Saudi Arabia has offered to pay off some of the country's debts, two activities that could run afoul of sanctions. The Saudis see an opportunity to win the new Syrian government over to their side, after decades of the country being allied with their top regional rival, Iran, while the Assad regime was in power.",
      "Relief was a key topic in meetings between Syrian officials, including its Central Bank Governor Abdelkadir Husrieh, and other world leaders at the IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings last month in Washington.",
      "Some of the most punitive measures were imposed over the last two decades on the former regime of Bashar al-Assad for human rights abuses and support for groups designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations. The Assad government collapsed in December as rebel groups, including fighters led by Sharaa, swept into Damascus, ending a 13-year-long civil war.",
      "In 2003, then-President George W. Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act into law, which centered on Syria's support for U.S.designated terror groups like Hezbollah, Syria's military presence in Lebanon, alleged development of weapons of mass destruction, oil smuggling and backing of armed groups in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion.",
      "In 2011, the Obama administration led an international effort to isolate Syria \u2014 culminating in multiple rounds of sanctions \u2014 as Assad's army fought a bloody civil war against rebel forces that led to half a million dead Syrians.",
      "Another package of sanctions were imposed in 2019 as part of the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, also known as the \"Caesar Act\" which Mr. Trump signed into law. The bill imposed stiff sanctions on Assad's government and companies or governments that worked with it, further crippling Syria's already isolated economy.",
      "Rubio indicated in his remarks in Turkey that relief may come in the form of waivers that give permission to do business in Syria without facing penalties for evading sanctions, which the administration can issue under authorities in the \"Caesar Act.\"",
      "\"I think we want to start with the initial waiver, which will allow foreign partners who wanted to flow in aid to begin to do so without running the risk of sanctions,\" Rubio said. He also suggested that the Trump Administration may be in a position \"soon\" to ask lawmakers to permanently repeal some sanctions."

      "Calligraphy by a South Korean independence hero, created while awaiting execution for assassinating a Japanese leader, is breaking new auction records in Seoul, as the country's ultra-rich seek to bring historic artwork home.",
      "Revered in the South for his efforts to defend the country against Japanese encroachment, Ahn Jung-geun is best known for his dramatic, high-stakes assassination of Japan's first prime minister, Ito Hirobumi, in 1909 at a train station in Harbin. Ahn shouted \"Hurrah for Korea!\" as he was arrested, according to the Association for Asian Studies based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.",
      "He was hanged for the killing by Japanese authorities in 1910, just months before Tokyo formally annexed the Korean Peninsula, ushering in a brutal period of occupation that lasted until the end of World War II.",
      "Now, more than a century after his death, the calligraphy Ahn created in his prison cell during his final days \u2014 typically at the request of Japanese officials \u2014 is drawing fresh attention in Seoul's glitzy art scene.",
      "In South Korea, Ahn's life has long inspired artists across generations, giving rise to a highly celebrated musical, multiple novels, and films \u2014 including one starring \"Crash Landing on You\" actor Hyun Bin.",
      "Ahn was held in his prison cell in China for about 40 days leading up to his execution and he kept himself busy writing an autobiography and making hundreds of calligraphy pieces, including one requested by his own prison guard.",
      "\"The court and prison officials, saying they wanted to keep my calligraphy as a memento, brought me hundreds of sheets of silk and paper and asked me to create for them,\" Ahn wrote in his autobiography. \"I ended up spending several hours each day doing calligraphy, even though I wasn't particularly skilled in it.\"",
      "Even though Ahn had assassinated their top official Ito, the Japanese who took his calligraphy preserved them with care, and some of their descendants have donated them to the South Korean government, which subsequently designated them as national treasures.",
      "Now, more of the calligraphies are surfacing in the private art market, with the latest being auctioned last month in Seoul for 940 million won ($674,098) \u2014 more than three times its opening bid.",
      "The piece, which says \"green bamboo\" \u2014 a traditional symbol of integrity \u2014 had been owned by a Japanese individual who did not wish to be identified, and they had done an impeccable job preserving it, said Kim Jun-seon, art valuation specialist at Seoul Auction.",
      "\"It wasn't even mounted and was still rolled up, but when we opened the case, the scent of ink still lingered in the air,\" she told AFP.",
      "\"Misguided but principled idealist\"",
      "Japan said Ahn was a criminal and terrorist and refused to hand over his remains. They have never been located.",
      "Moves to honor Ahn by Seoul and Beijing have previously strained ties with Tokyo, even briefly sparking a diplomatic row in 2013.",
      "In 2014, Japan criticized a memorial built in China to commemorate Ahn, BBC News reported. A Japanese government spokesman branded him a terrorist after the Chinese-Korean memorial hall opened in China's Harbin city, where Ito was shot.",
      "The fact that his Japanese captors preserved his calligraphy \"reflects the cultural and political contradictions of early 20th century East Asia,\" said Eugene Y. Park, a history professor at University of Nevada, Reno.",
      "At his trial, Ahn identified himself as a soldier for Korea, defined his assassination of Ito as a military operation, and envisioned a united East Asia \u2014 comprising Korea, China and Japan \u2014 somewhat akin to today's European Union.",
      "\"Some Japanese may have seen him as a misguided but principled idealist,\" Park told AFP.",
      "His calligraphy, which focused on values such as peace and ethics, \"resonated culturally, even if he opposed them politically,\" he said.",
      "\"At a time when Japan's own imperial identity was unsettled, preserving his works revealed deeper tensions between respect for moral courage and the pursuit of colonial domination.\"",
      "In 2023, the Global Sae-A Group, a South Korean conglomerate, purchased one of Ahn's calligraphies for a record-breaking 1.95 billion won (nearly $1.4 million).",
      "The piece \"Green Bamboo\" was sold at auction last month to the family of South Korea's LS Group.",
      "\"We expressed our intention to bring the piece back to Korea and share it with the public,\" Joung Tae-hee at Seoul Auction said, adding that the Japanese owner agreed to sell after hearing their proposal.",
      "Lee Sang-hyun, of the LS Group family, told AFP that his mother \"hopes many citizens will be able to see this piece and that it will also be studied,\" and they are considering donating it to a national institution.",
      "Ahn became a Catholic as a teenager and ends his autobiography with the words of Nicolas Joseph Marie Wilhelm, a French priest and missionary stationed in Korea, who traveled to his prison to see the activist and give him confession.",
      "The priest \u2014 who had also baptized Ahn and was a longtime friend \u2014 was disciplined for his trip, and was later forced to return to France.",

      "\"I think it's time for us to just do it,\" Mr. Trump told reporters as he wrapped a four-day visit to the Middle East. Later, he told reporters on Air Force One, setting off on the journey back to Washington, that he might call Putin soon.",
      "\"He and I will meet, and I think we'll solve it or maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said. \"At least we'll know. And if we don't solve it, it'll be very interesting.\"",
      "The president reiterated that he wasn't surprised by Putin's decision to skip the talks taking place Friday in Turkey. Putin didn't want to go because he's not there, Mr. Trump said.",
      "Meetings between Ukrainian and Russian delegations did get underway in Istanbul Friday, though Putin sent a lower-level delegation. This prompted accusations from Ukraine and its European partners that Moscow wasn't really interested in a negotiated resolution to the war.",
      "After the meetings concluded, Vladimir Medinsky, who led the Russian delegation, said in a statement that the two countries agreed that \"in the coming days,\" they'll hold a large-scale exchange of 1,000 prisoners of war for each side.

      "\"I would actually leave here and go,\" he said, noting that his daughter Tiffany just gave birth to her first child. \"I do want to see my beautiful grandson.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to take part in the talks as Mr. Trump pressed for the leaders to find a solution to the war, ongoing since Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But Putin spurned the call to meet face-to-face with Zelenskyy.",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed both sides to quickly come to an agreement to end the war. Zelenskyy has agreed to an American plan for an initial 30-day halt to hostilities, but Russia has not signed on and has continued to strike at targets inside Ukraine.",
      "\"He didn't go, and I understand that,\" Mr. Trump said Friday of Putin's decision to skip the talks in Istanbul. \"We're going to get it done. We got to get it done. Five thousand young people are being killed every single week on average, and we're going to get it done.\"",
      "The U.S. president told reporters on Thursday that a meeting between himself and Putin was crucial to breaking the deadlock.",
      "\"I don't believe anything's going to happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But we're going to have to get it solved because too many people are dying.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in Moscow on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said any meeting between Putin and Mr. Trump would have to be \"well prepared\" for, but he said such an encounter was indeed necessary in Russia's view, as \"a serious conversation on international issues is needed, including the Ukrainian crisis.\"",
      "Should the talks in Istanbul fail to make any progress, Zelenskyy said Friday that there should be a \"strong reaction,\" as it would be clear, in his view, that Russia does not have any interest in ending the war.",

      "The grisly murder of 23-year-old Valeria M\u00e1rquez on Tuesday shocked the Latin American nation, igniting rumors about the motive behind her killing in a region that's been eclipsed by cartel violence in recent years. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her administration is working with local investigators to track down the killer and extended her condolences to M\u00e1rquez's family.",

      "Rodr\u00edguez said that early Tuesday afternoon, hours before the shooting, a masked man posing as a delivery driver arrived at the beauty salon on the outskirts of Guadalajara, accompanied by another man on a motorcycle. According to a woman in the salon, the men said they had a \"very expensive\" gift for M\u00e1rquez that they had to deliver in person.

    "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier this week criticized White South Africans who claimed refugee status in the U.S. as \"cowardly.\"",
    "story": [
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will visit the White House next week, his office said Thursday, days after the arrival in the U.S. of the\u00a0first group of White South Africans, having been granted refugee status under a new Trump administration policy.",
      "Ramaphosa's office said the visit will provide a \"platform to reset the strategic relationship between the two countries.\" The statement said Rampahosa, who is the current president of the G20, and President Trump will meet on Wednesday, May 21.",
      "The White House has not yet commented on the meeting.",
      "The visit comes amid renewed tensions between Ramaphosa and the White House as 59 people from South Africa's Afrikaner community\u00a0arrived in the U.S.\u00a0earlier this week. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landeau said upon their arrival in Washington that they had faced \"egregious discrimination\" in South Africa.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the Afrikaners a \"vulnerable group facing unjust racial discrimination in South Africa.\"",
      "Ramaphosa rejected the Trump administration's characterization of the treatment as \"not true,\" according to BBC News.",
      "On Tuesday, Ramaphosa called those leaving for the U.S. \"cowardly,\" saying, \"When you run away you are a coward.\"",
      "Who are Afrikaners?",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of the 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "In 1948, as South Africa was in the process of gaining independence from Britain, the White minority created the system of apartheid, allowing only White South Africans to vote and govern. As well as being denied political power, Black South Africans also faced harsh restrictions on owning land and many were forcibly segregated into settlements.",
      "That ended in 1994, when all South Africans were allowed to vote for the first time, leading to the end of minority White rule. Nelson Mandela's African National Congress won a majority, and he became the country's first Black president. The ANC has been in power since 1994, but scandals have harmed the party in recent years and it did not win a majority in the 2024 election, forcing Ramaphosa to form a coalition government.",
      "Thirty years after apartheid ended, White South Africans on average still enjoy a higher standard of living than Black South Africans, with research from the South Africa Human Rights Commission showing just 1% of White South Africans are considered poor, compared to 64% of the Black African population.",
      "Why are Afrikaners claiming refugee status?",
      "In February, Ramaphosa signed a new law that allowed the state to seize land without compensation, in situations classified under the legislation as \"just and equitable and in the public interest.\"",
      "Although the wording of the law was vague and did not reference White South Africans, many believed it was targeting them since they control most of the country's land. South Africa's government has strongly denied any land confiscations or racially motivated discrimination, saying the law targets land not being used or not serving the public interest.",
      "Some have also pointed to attacks on South African farmers in recent years. U.S Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who met the first group of Afrikaners admitted to the country, recently claimed they faced \"egregious and targeted threats.\" The South African government, however, has said those attacks were a result of border crime issues and were not racially motivated.",
      "Mr. Trump and adviser Elon Musk, who is a White South African native, have claimed the attacks and potential loss of land amounts to \"White genocide.\"",
      "In February, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to prioritize the resettlement of Afrikaners under the refugee resettlement program. Access to that program for many other groups was frozen by Mr. Trump on his first day in office, although that executive order allowed for exemptions to be considered on a case-by-case basis.",
      "While Afrikaners make up only about half of South Africa's White population, Mr. Trump's executive order granting refugee status only mentions Afrikaners.",
      "According to the U.S. embassy in South Africa, individuals who meet the following requirements can apply for refugee stays:",
      "Must be of South African nationality; and\u00a0Must be of Afrikaner ethnicity or be a member of a racial minority in South Africa; and\u00a0Must be able to articulate a past experience of persecution or fear of future persecution.",

      "Brown has a history of legal issues dating back to his felony conviction in the 2009 assault of his then-girlfriend Rihanna. He pleaded guilty to felony assault at the time. In 2014, Brown pleaded guilty to hitting a man outside a Washington, D.C., hotel. In 2024, Brown, along with his paid entourage, allegedly beat several men who attended his concert in Texas.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump met Wednesday in Saudi Arabia with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, highlighting the stunning reversal in fortunes for a former Islamist militant with ties to al Qaeda who spent years with a U.S. government bounty on his head. Al-Sharaa's rebel forces led the charge on Damascus last year that toppled the decades-long, iron-fisted rule of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and he has since installed himself as the head of a government presenting itself to the world as inclusive and democratic.",
      "Mr. Trump's decision to meet with al-Sharaa, after some European leaders have done the same, could be a huge boost to the new Syrian government as it tries to rebuild ties with the Western world. Those relationships have been marked by blistering sanctions and acrimony during and after the Middle Eastern nation's bloody civil war, which started in 2011.",
      "\"Young, attractive guy, tough guy, strong past,\" Mr. Trump told reporters of al-Sharaa   aboard Air Force One following the meeting.",
      "In a readout on the two leaders' meeting in Saudi Arabia, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump had told the Syrian leader that \"he has a tremendous opportunity to do something historic in his country,\" and urged him to join Saudi Arabia in signing onto the U.S.-backed Abraham Accords, to normalize ties with Israel.",
      "Mr. Trump also told al-Sharaa he should \"tell all foreign terrorists to leave Syria; Deport Palestinian terrorists; help the United States to prevent the resurgence of ISIS,\" and \"assume responsibility for ISIS detention centers in Northeast Syria,\" according to Leavitt.",
      "They were joined in their meeting by the host of Mr. Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, and on the phone by the President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "The meeting came a day after Mr. Trump announced on his visit to the Saudi capital Riyadh that his administration would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, \"to give them a chance at greatness.\"",
      "\"The sanctions were brutal and crippling, and served ... an important function, nevertheless, at the time, but now it's their [Syrians'] time to shine,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech on Tuesday. \"I say good luck, Syria. Show us something very special.\"",
      "In her readout on Wednesday, Leavitt said \"President Erdogan praised President Trump for lifting sanctions on Syria and committed to working alongside Saudi Arabia to encourage peace and prosperity in Syria. The Crown Prince also commended President Trump for his decision to lift the sanctions, calling it courageous.\"",
      "She said al-Sharaa had thanked Mr. Trump, along with MBS and Erdogan, \"for their efforts to put together the meeting, and recognized the significant opportunity presented by the Iranians leaving Syria, as well as shared U.S.-Syrian interests in countering terrorism and eliminating chemical weapons.\"",
      "The \"Iranians\" referred to by the White House appeared to be a reference to the ousted Assad regime's backers in Tehran.",
      "\"President Al-Sharaa concluded with his hope that Syria would serve as a critical link in facilitating trade between east and west, and invited American companies to invest in Syrian oil and gas,\" Leavitt said.",
      "The White House said Tuesday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would also meet with the Syrian foreign minister in Turkey later this week.",
      "Mr. Trump became on Wednesday the first U.S. president to meet with a Syrian leader since Bill Clinton met with Assad's father Hafez al-Assad.",
      "A former insurgent, al-Sharaa ascended to power last year as Assad's government rapidly crumbled in the span of several days \u2014 bringing an abrupt end to the more than decadelong civil war that devastated Syria.",
      "Al-Sharaa previously led Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamist rebel group that fought the Assad regime and had its roots in the al Qaeda-allied Nusra Front. Al-Sharaa also participated in the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq in the 2000s.",
      "Until last year, the U.S. had a $10 million bounty on al-Sharaa due to his leadership of HTS, which is designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "Syrian-American activist Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the nonprofit Syrian Emergency Task Force, is helping rebuild severed ties, and claims al-Sharaa is \"100% a changed man.\"",
      "\"I want to say, well, let's judge him by his actions,\" Mustafa told CBS News Wednesday. \"I'm not here to say any of these decisions in his checkered past is nonexistent. But the fact is, this is a changed man. And this is a person who is not interested in anything but rebuilding the country, and wants to see peace with all of the neighbors, wants to stay out of war with everyone in the Middle East.\"",
      "Despite the collapse of Assad's government, many of the intense U.S. sanctions placed on Syria during the last 13 years of Assad's reign have remained in place. The Trump administration appears to be pushing for normalized relations with the new government in Syria in the hope it can help curb Iranian influence in the country and the wider Middle East, despite al-Sharaa's roots in extremism.",
      "Saudi Arabia has also started building a relationship with al-Sharaa's government, a move that could also be aimed at limiting the influence of the kingdom's archrival Iran, which along with Russia, aided Assad in his fight against rebels during the civil war.",
      "Key U.S. ally Israel has been more wary of al-Sharaa, however, and has continued airstrikes against targets inside Syria \u2014 angering al-Sharaa's government.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham urged caution and said the White House should go through the proper congressional channels in to ease sanctions against Syria. Graham arrived in Turkey on Tuesday to meet with U.S. and Turkish officials about the situation in Syria.",
      "\"I am very inclined to support sanctions relief for Syria under the right conditions,\" Graham said in a statement. \"However, we must remember that the current leadership in Syria achieved its position through force of arms, not through the will of its people. I know the Trump administration has provided guidance to Syrian officials about conditions that need to be met before any sanctions can be relieved.\"",
      "Graham said he was \"certain that Congress would need to be informed of changes in conditions placed on Syria and how they have met those conditions before Congress can make an informed decision on whether or not it should approve the change in designation.\" He also said Israeli officials were \"extremely concerned\" about the \"state of play in Syria.\"",
      "\"Waiving congressionally passed sanctions is a complicated process,\" Graham said. \"While I would like to empower the new players in Syria, it has to be done in a coordinated fashion with our allies \u2014 especially our friends in Israel \u2014 so that numerous security concerns can be addressed.\"",

      "How do GLP-1 RAs affect cancer risk?",
      "Niketa Patel, professor of molecular medicine with the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine in Tampa, Florida, noted that obesity is associated with chronic inflammation.",
      "\"GLP1-RAs are shown to reduce inflammation and thus decrease the risk of developing ORC,\" she told Fox News Digital. (Patel was not involved in the study.)",
      "\"The anti-inflammatory properties of these medications address a known risk factor for various cancers.\"",
      "\"Bottom line: Obesity can cause certain cancers, and treatment of obesity with GLP1-RA reduces the risk of only obesity-related cancers.\"",
      "Dr. Britta Reierson, MD, medical director of knownwell, a provider of metabolic health services, said there are several ways in which GLP-1 RAs could have cancer mitigation properties.",
      "\"First, the anti-inflammatory properties of these medications address a known risk factor for various cancers,\" the Minnesota-based doctor, who also was not part of the research, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Overall, the study determined that \"the direct effect of GLP1-RAs compared to BMS on the risk for ORC beyond their effects on weight-loss is estimated as 41% relative risk reduction.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Second, the metabolic regulation and improvement in metabolic health from these medications, including lowering blood glucose levels and decreasing insulin resistance, can reduce cancer risk.\"",
      "Emerging evidence also suggests that GLP-1 RAs may have direct anti-tumor effects, Reierson noted \u2014 \"potentially through modulation of immune responses and epigenetic changes (changes that occur to gene expression and are passed down to future generations).\"",
      "FIRST GLP-1 PILL FOR WEIGHT LOSS, DIABETES SHOWS SUCCESS IN LATE-PHASE TRIAL",
      "Research suggests that GLP-1 medications help reduce inflammation not just through weight loss, but also in other organs of the body, such as the heart, according to Dr. Susan Savery, MD, a board-certified obesity medicine and primary care physician with PlushCare, a virtual health platform offering primary care, therapy and weight management services.",
      "\"Over time, chronic inflammation can be a risk factor for cancer development, as it may damage cell DNA,\" San Francisco-based Savery, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The metabolic regulation and improvement in metabolic health from these medications, including lowering blood glucose levels and decreasing insulin resistance, can reduce cancer risk.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Our fat cells (adipose tissue) naturally produce inflammatory cells, and GLP-1 medications, similar to bariatric surgery, help reduce this inflammation by decreasing the amount of adipose tissue through weight loss.\"",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The study did have some limitations, the researchers acknowledged.",
      "\"First, it is an observational study. It means that our comparison groups (persons who had surgery versus those who received GLP1-RAs) may still have some residual differences, despite our methodological efforts,\" Sagy told Fox News Digital.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"However, only this type of real-life observational study can provide the long follow-up period that is necessary to evaluate the risk of developing cancer, which often has very long latency periods.\"",
      "Another limitation is that the primary drug included in the study was liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza), with smaller numbers of people taking exenatide (Byetta) and dulaglutide (Trulicity).",
      "While GLP-1 RAs are \"wonderful tools\" that can support people on weight-loss journeys, Savery pointed out that maintaining a healthy lifestyle through nutritious eating and regular physical activity is \"the foundation for cancer prevention and better overall health.\" (iStock)",
      "\"It will be important to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the newer GLP1-RA drugs, which are expected to have a larger effect,\" Sagy said.",
      "\"Although the direction of the results is promising, we should wait and see if and how clinical guidelines will consider it.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Reierson agreed that much more research is needed before GLP-1 RAs could ever be considered as cancer prevention options.",
      "\"Larger, randomized, controlled trials are necessary to confirm the observed effects and better understand the underlying mechanisms,\" she said.",
      "\"It will also be important to investigate the impact of GLP-1 RAs on different types of cancer and assess the long-term safety and potential side effects of using GLP-1 RAs as a cancer therapy.\" (American Cancer Society/Getty Images)",
      "\"It will also be important to investigate the impact of GLP-1 RAs on different types of cancer and assess the long-term safety and potential side effects of using GLP-1 RAs as a cancer therapy.\"",
      "Savery agrees that it\u2019s likely too early to predict FDA approval for cancer therapy, but noted that \"weight reduction plays an important role in cancer prevention, and GLP-1s seem to offer an additional benefit through inflammation reduction.\"",

    "summary": "Democratic Party faces record low favorability, but Democratic strategist James Carville highlights recent election wins and future prospects as signs of potential recovery.",
    "story": [
      "Veteran Democratic Party strategist James Carville warned Democrats that they need to ditch jargon that confuses or even offends persuadable voters.",
      "Despite a flurry of polling so far this year indicating the Democratic Party's favorability sinking to record lows, veteran Democratic strategist and pundit James Carville remains optimistic, as he points to recent ballot box victories by his party.",
      "\"You can't discount people winning elections,\" Carville told Fox News Digital this week.",
      "Carville spoke the day after a new survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research was the latest to spell trouble for the Democratic Party, six months after they suffered setbacks up and down the ballot at the hands of now-President Donald Trump and Republicans.",
      "The Democratic Party has been in the political wilderness since last November's elections, when Republicans won back control of the White House and the Senate and defended their fragile House majority. And Republicans made gains among Black and Hispanic voters as well as younger voters, all traditional members of the Democratic Party's base.",

      "Then-Vice President Kamala Harris delivers her presidential nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 22, 2024. The latest public opinion polls indicate the Democratic Party sinking to new favorability lows. (Fox News - Paul Steinhauser)",
      "According to the survey, only about one-third of Democrats are very or somewhat optimistic about the future of the Democratic Party. That's a steep decline from last July, when around six in 10 Democrats said they were optimistic. The survey, conducted May 1-5, points to an increase in optimism among Republicans, with 55% more optimistic about the future of the GOP, up from 47% last summer.",
      "HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING",
      "Since Trump's return to power earlier this year, an increasingly energized base of Democrats is urging party leaders to take a stronger stand in pushing back against the president's sweeping and controversial agenda during the opening months of his second administration. And their anger is directed not only at Republicans, but also at Democrats they feel aren't vocal enough in their opposition to Trump.",
      "And that's fueled the plunge in the Democratic Party's favorable ratings, which have hit historic lows in several recent surveys.",
      "The Democrats' ratings stood underwater in the most recent Fox News national poll at 41% favorable and 56% unfavorable in a survey conducted April 18-21.",
      "(Fox News\u00a0)",
      "That's an all-time low for the Democrats in Fox News polling. And for the first time in a decade, the party's standing was lower than that of the GOP, which stood at 44% favorable and 54% unfavorable.",
      "The figures were reversed last summer, when Fox News last asked the party favorability question in one of its surveys.",
      "The Democratic Party's favorable ratings were well in negative territory in a Pew Research national survey \u2014 38% favorable, 60% unfavorable \u2014 conducted in early April and at 36% favorable, 60% unfavorable in a Wall Street Journal poll in the field a couple of weeks earlier.",
      "And national polls conducted in February by Quinnipiac University and in March by CNN and by NBC News also indicated the favorable ratings for the Democratic Party sinking to all-time lows.",
      "Confidence in the Democratic Party's congressional leadership sunk to an all-time low, according to a Gallup poll conducted early last month.",
      "The confidence rating for Democrats' leadership in Congress stood at 25% in the survey, which was nine points below the previous low of 34% recorded in 2023.",
      "And the semi-annual Harvard Youth Poll, which was released late last month, indicated that approval ratings for Democrats in Congress among Americans aged 18-29 nosedived.",
      "\"I don\u2019t doubt any of that\u2019s true,\" Carville told Fox News. \"But there\u2019s one thing: We\u2019re winning elections left and right as we\u2019re talking about how the Democratic number or image is low.\"",

      "Last month, the Democrat-aligned candidate comfortably defeated the Republican-aligned candidate in a Wisconsin state Supreme Court election. The high-profile and expensive campaign grabbed plenty of national attention and outside money.",

      "\"Let's see what's going to happen in Virginia,\" said Carville, who first grabbed national attention for his work as a lead strategist on former President Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign.",
      "And Carville predicted that \"we\u2019re going to win that.\"",

      "Sens. Tommy Tuberville, left, John Cornyn, center, John Kennedy, right (Getty)",
      "In a Fox News Opinion piece this week, Kennedy noted \"universal injunctions\" have been around since the 1960s, when judges began enjoining the government from enforcing certain policies against \"anyone, anywhere\" \u2013 adding they let a judge say \"sayonara\" to laws, regulations or even whims of a president they don\u2019t like.",
      "Kennedy noted that there have only been 27 such injunctions from JFK through Y2K.",
      "A review showed none was lodged against Presidents George H.W. Bush or Bill Clinton \u2013 but began to creep in during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations.",
      "With nearly 100 rulings against President Donald Trump in his one-and-an-eighth terms, Kennedy said some judges seem to want to \"rewrite the Constitution every other Thursday, to advance some social or economic agenda that they can't get by the voters: But the law is the law.\"",
      "\"And a universal injunction was created out of whole cloth. There's no statutory basis for a universal injunction,\" the Louisianan said, echoing the analysis in his op-ed.",
      "Given his penchant for often colorful and probing questions of judiciary appointees, Kennedy was also asked how an unfavorable ruling from the Supreme Court could affect nominee choices and further politicize the process.",
      "\"All the nominees in front of us are going to be asked about universal injunctions, I can tell you. And if they try to dodge and bob and weave and run like a hound on the treeline, when it's my turn to question them I'm not going to let them. I'm not asking how they would rule in a particular case, but I want to know what they think the legal basis is for a universal injunction, because there is none: I want to hear what they had to say.\"",
      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville \u2013 who joined Kennedy and others in supporting Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley\u2019s Judicial Relief Clarification Act (JCRA) to end the practice \u2013 said such \"woke\" judges should consider retiring their robes.",

      "\"President Trump campaigned on a promise to deport dangerous criminals and won in a landslide. In just four months, he has already delivered the most secure border in American history,\" Tuberville told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we have radical left judges who are allowing their personal beliefs to supersede the will of 77 million Americans who voted for President Trump and his agenda,\" the former Auburn football legend added.",
      "\"If a judge wants to make political decisions, they should run for office. Otherwise, they should focus on upholding the Constitution and enforcing the law.\"",

      "Most cloud services provide a certain amount of free storage (typically between 2GB and 15GB) before upgrading to a paid plan. For instance,\u00a0Google Drive offers 15GB of free storage shared across Google services, while\u00a0Dropbox\u00a0provides 2GB for free with options to upgrade for more space.\u00a0OneDrive provides 5GB for free, but Microsoft users can get additional storage through Office 365 subscriptions, granting access to the Microsoft Office suite.",
      "Additionally, cloud storage services come with features like automatic syncing and backup, making it easier to organize and safeguard your files. This can be particularly helpful for large photo and video libraries, which can be set to upload automatically from your phone or computer. With features like file versioning and collaboration tools, cloud platforms offer more than just storage \u00a0\u2014 they enhance productivity and allow seamless file sharing with friends, family or colleagues.",
      "Finally, many cloud storage providers offer encryption and other security measures to protect your files for added peace of mind. However, it would be best always to take extra precautions, such as enabling two-factor authentication and using strong, unique passwords, to ensure your data is safe.\u00a0Kurt\u2019s favorite cloud services can be seen here.",
      "Protect your data: Essential security steps after managing storage",
      "After you've freed up space on your PC-whether by deleting old files, moving data to an external drive or leveraging cloud storage, it's just as important to make sure your valuable information stays secure. The following steps will help you protect your files and personal data from cyber threats and accidental loss.",
      "1. Use strong passwords:\u00a0Create unique, complex passwords for all your accounts and devices. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store secure passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable encryption:\u00a0Encrypt your external hard drives and cloud storage accounts to add an extra layer of protection to your data.",
      "3. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA on all accounts that offer this feature, especially for cloud storage services.",
      "4.\u00a0Install and maintain strong antivirus software: Use a strong antivirus program and keep it updated to protect against malware and other security threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Regularly update your operating system and applications: Keep your devices and software\u00a0up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6. Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Avoid accessing sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public networks, or use a VPN for added security. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Backup your data regularly: Create\u00a0multiple backups of your important files, including at least one offline copy.",
      "8. Use secure file transfer methods: When sharing files, use encrypted transfer methods or\u00a0password-protected links.",
      "By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the security of your data and protect yourself from potential cyber threats.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Your PC\u2019s storage can fill up fast, but you can always free up some space. I personally prefer storing images and videos that take up too much space on an external drive. This way, I can access them whenever I need to while keeping my PC storage free. If an external drive feels like too much of a hassle, you can always opt for cloud storage. Windows supports a range of cloud storage options, including its own services like OneDrive.",

      "Marketing data brokers focus more on your browsing habits, past purchases and interests. They are responsible for \"personalized marketing\" as well as helping other companies target you with those surprisingly relevant ads you see online.",
      "Recruitment data brokers collect and process personal information to offer background screening services to organizations evaluating job candidates or performing background checks before making an offer. Unfortunately, although illegal, there is nothing actually stopping unscrupulous employers from using the much less regulated and reliable people search sites for the same purposes.",
      "Risk mitigation brokers aggregate a variety of background, criminal, property and other information to provide assessment reports to various investment and business companies. The information they collect is aimed at helping such companies manage risk in taking on new business.",

      "Health information data brokers collect information about your general health and sell it to companies in healthcare and related fields. This information can be used to target you with health product ads and even set your insurance premiums.",
      "Hackers are most likely to use people search sites, though; they are easily accessible, eminently searchable, relatively cheap (with trial offers for as little as a dollar) and do not ask any questions. Other data brokers may also sell personal information to hackers, but they tend to sell profiles in bulk.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.

      "It is easy to feel overwhelmed when you realize just how much of your personal information is out there, and how many different players are collecting, selling and using it. But knowing how data brokers operate is the first step to taking back control. Whether it is people search sites or the less visible brokers working behind the scenes, your data is valuable, and you deserve to know who has it and what they are doing with it. The good news is, there are tools and services out there that can help you clean up your digital footprint and protect your privacy. So, do not just sit back and hope for the best \u2014 take action and make your data work for you, not against you.",

It rides on a 108.9-inch wheelbase and features a five-foot bed that is slightly longer and wider than the Maverick's, offering 37 cubic feet of cargo space.

      "Fake PayPal scam email (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How this scam works",
      "This type of scam is known as a remote access scam. It often begins with a fake email that appears to come from a trusted company like PayPal. The message claims there is an issue, such as an unauthorized charge, and urges the victim to call a phone number or click a link.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once the scammer makes contact, they guide the victim to enter a code into their browser or install a program, claiming it will fix the problem. In reality, this grants the scammer full control of the victim\u2019s computer.",
      "Once inside, scammers often search for sensitive files, access banking websites, steal login credentials or install malware to maintain long-term access. Even if the immediate scam is stopped, hidden malware can allow scammers to reenter the system later.",

      "Fake emails are harder to spot than ever: Scammers create emails that look almost identical to real ones from trusted companies like PayPal. They copy logos, formatting and even fake customer support numbers. Always double-check the sender\u2019s email address and verify communications by visiting the official website or app directly instead of clicking links inside emails.",
      "Remote access scams can escalate fast: Once scammers gain control of your device, they can steal sensitive data, move funds between accounts and install hidden malware that stays behind even after the scammer disconnects. It often takes only minutes for serious damage to be done, making fast recognition critical.",
      "Psychological pressure plays a big role: Scammers rely on creating a sense of urgency and fear. By keeping you on the phone and urging secrecy, they isolate you from help and rush you into making bad decisions. Recognizing when you are being pressured is key to breaking the scammer\u2019s control.",
      "Fast action can make all the difference: By quickly disconnecting his computer and contacting his bank, John limited the scammer\u2019s access to his accounts. Acting within minutes rather than hours can stop further theft, block fraudulent transactions and protect your sensitive information from being fully compromised.",

      "Taking simple but strong security steps can protect you from falling victim.",
      "1. Never call a number listed in a suspicious email: Scammers often set up fake phone numbers that sound professional but are designed to manipulate you into handing over control or information. Always find verified contact information through a company's official website or app, not links/numbers provided in suspicious messages.",
      "2. Be skeptical of unusual instructions: No legitimate company will ask you to install software or enter strange codes to protect your account. If anything seems unusual, trust your instincts and stop the communication immediately.",
      "3. Install strong antivirus software on all devices:\u00a0Antivirus programs can detect suspicious downloads, block remote access attempts and help prevent hackers from taking over your system. Having strong antivirus protection installed across all your devices is the best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware and attempt to access your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Use identity theft protection: These services monitor financial accounts, credit reports and online activity for signs of fraud, alerting you to suspicious transactions.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. React immediately if you suspect a scam: Disconnect your device from the internet, contact your bank or credit card company immediately and change your passwords, especially for banking and email accounts. Monitor your accounts closely for unauthorized activity and report the scam to the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission as well as the company that was impersonated. Acting quickly can prevent further access and limit the damage scammers can cause.",
      "6. Use multifactor authentication (MFA):\u00a0MFA adds a critical layer of security beyond passwords, blocking unauthorized logins even if credentials are stolen. Enable MFA on all accounts, especially banking, email and payment platforms, to stop scammers from bypassing stolen passwords.",
      "7. Update devices and software immediately:\u00a0Regular updates patch security flaws that scammers exploit to install malware or hijack systems. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible to ensure you\u2019re always protected against newly discovered vulnerabilities.",
      "8. Employ a password manager with strong, unique passwords: Avoid password reuse and use complex passphrases to minimize credential-stuffing attacks. A\u00a0password manager generates and stores uncrackable passwords, eliminating the risk of weak or repeated credentials. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "9. Never share screen access or grant remote control: Scammers exploit screen-sharing tools to steal passwords and manipulate transactions in real time. Legitimate tech support will never demand unsolicited screen access; terminate the call immediately if pressured.",
      "10. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0These services automate requests to delete your personal information from data brokers and people-search sites, reducing publicly available details scammers could exploit for phishing or impersonation. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "PROTECT YOURSELF FROM TECH SUPPORT SCAMS",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "John\u2019s story is a reminder that online scams are evolving quickly and becoming more aggressive.

    "story": [
      "Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson says hackers are using CAPTCHAs to infect your PC with malware.",
      "Ransomware gangs once thrived on infected email attachments and bogus invoices, but security-savvy users and hardened mail gateways have weakened those tactics. Attackers are now focusing on a subtler trick that targets the small checkbox labeled \"I'm not a robot\" that most people click without thinking.",
      "A widespread campaign known as MacReaper has compromised more than 2,800 legitimate websites and redirects visitors to an infection process designed specifically for Apple computers. The operation relies on visual trust signals, including a convincing fake of Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA, along with hidden clipboard code that ends with the installation of Atomic macOS Stealer malware, a data-harvesting infostealer distributed through Telegram.",

      "A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does the attack unfold?",
      "When a Mac user visits one of the compromised websites, they don't see the page they were expecting. Instead, the site displays a full-screen imitation of Google's familiar reCAPTCHA box.",
      "This fake reCAPTCHA appears harmless, simply asking the user to click \"I'm not a robot.\" However, when the user clicks the box, a hidden command is silently copied to their clipboard. Immediately afterward, the page displays a friendly message, complete with familiar macOS keyboard shortcut visuals, explicitly instructing the user to open Terminal and paste what they've just copied. If the user follows these instructions, the command downloads and runs the malicious file known as Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS).",
      "This trick is specifically targeted at Mac users. The website checks the visitor's operating system and only activates the attack if it detects macOS. For Windows or Linux users, the site behaves normally. Researchers have dubbed this infection method \"ClickFix,\" referencing the single click that initiates the attack chain.",
      "At the center of this campaign is AMOS, a sophisticated piece of malware that has become notorious in cybercrime circles. AMOS is available for rent on Telegram, with some versions costing attackers up to $3,000 per month. Once installed, AMOS can steal a wide array of sensitive data: it can extract Wi-Fi and app passwords stored in Keychain, collect browser cookies and autofill data, list system information and scan through personal folders such as Desktop and Documents. It is also capable of identifying and targeting more than 50 types of cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "Fake reCAPTCHA (Cyber Security News) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Domains and sites compromised in the MacReaper campaign",
      "Several cybersecurity reports have identified specific domains involved in the attack infrastructure. Notably, domains such as\u00a0technavix.cloud and\u00a0salorttactical.top have been highlighted as part of the malicious network distributing AMOS. The campaign's initial discovery traced back to a compromised Brazilian news site,\u00a0agencia2.jornalfloripa.com.br, which served as an early infection vector before the operation expanded to more than 2,800 legitimate websites worldwide.",
      "Macs aren't as secure as Apple wants you to believe",
      "MacReaper challenges two widely held beliefs. The first is that everyday CAPTCHA checks are just harmless speed bumps. The second is that macOS provides a level of built-in security that keeps most attackers at bay. In reality, a single click can expose Keychain credentials, active browser sessions and cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "These are exactly the kinds of targets that attract credential-stuffing groups and profit-driven cybercriminals. Because the attack is triggered by the user, many network monitoring tools treat the traffic as normal, leaving security teams with little to investigate. In environments where Macs and Windows machines share identity systems, one compromised Mac can open access to single sign-on portals, cloud storage and even production codebases.",

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of the MacReaper attack, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures.",
      "1) Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to copy commands or paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it's likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2) Don't click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many MacReaper attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company's official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4) Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you've interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don't recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6) Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from MacReaper or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "MacReaper makes it clear that the most durable exploits aren't zero-days but borrowed moments of trust, an authentic-looking CAPTCHA, a helpful-sounding fix, a clipboard that does what it's told. As Apple tightens the technical screws with Rapid Security Responses and notarization, expect adversaries to double down on such psychological levers. The counter-strategy is to hard-bake healthy skepticism into user behavior and to instrument Macs with the same telemetry layers enterprises already expect from Windows. Security, in other words, has finally become a platform-agnostic muscle, and complacency is the riskiest operating system of all.",

Instead, they rely on tricking you into handing over sensitive information. Here are some of the most common techniques.",
      "Fake banking apps and mobile trojans: Some apps are designed to look exactly like your bank\u2019s official app, but they\u2019re actually fakes. If you enter your login info, it goes straight to the scammer. Even more advanced are\u00a0mobile banking trojans, which hide inside seemingly unrelated apps. Once installed, the trojan watches for when you open your real banking app and then quickly overlays a fake login screen.

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says AT\u00b2 Aerospace\u2019s Z1 hybrid airship uses helium lift, low fuel, no runways.",
      "The tragic Hindenburg disaster of 1937, which resulted in the death of 36 people and effectively ended passenger airship travel, cast a long-lasting shadow over lighter-than-air technology. For many decades, airships were largely confined to niche roles such as advertising and surveillance.",
      "However, a groundbreaking spin-off from Lockheed Martin to AT\u00b2 Aerospace is now reviving the airship concept with a modern twist: hybrid airships designed specifically for eco-friendly cargo transport. Most recently, AT\u00b2 Aerospace announced two purchase orders for their airships, one from Straightline Aviation and one from Arctic Airships.",

      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The Z1 hybrid airship",
      "At the center of this revival is the Z1 hybrid airship, a massive vessel capable of carrying up to 23.5 tons (21 metric tons) of cargo while minimizing environmental impacts and significantly reducing fuel consumption compared to traditional aircraft. Unlike the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg, which was highly flammable, the Z1 relies on helium for lift, a nonflammable gas, providing buoyancy for the majority of the airship's weight, combined with aerodynamic design and advanced propulsion systems.",
      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MASSIVE AIRSHIP COULD SHAKE UP CARGO TRANSPORT",
      "How the Z1 hybrid airship works",
      "The Z1 combines lighter-than-air buoyancy with advanced engineering innovations. Notably, the aircraft features a tri-lobe hull design, a hallmark of Lockheed Martin's earlier airship projects. This design includes a raised central lobe flanked by two side lobes, which enhances lift efficiency and stability. Its Air Cushion Landing System allows it to take off and land on virtually any flat surface, including sand, ice, water or uneven terrain, eliminating the need for traditional runways.",
      "The Z1 uses vectored thrust propulsion and advanced onboard systems for weather prediction and route planning, enabling it to travel more than 1,400 nautical miles at speeds of up to 60 knots. The hybrid lift system merges helium's natural buoyancy with vectored thrust from the engines, optimizing both efficiency and control. This innovative design reduces fuel consumption to just one-fifth of what a heavy-lift helicopter would use, making the Z1 especially suited for transporting goods to remote and difficult-to-access areas such as the Arctic or the Amazon rainforest.",
      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "ZERO EMISSIONS HYDROGEN ELECTRIC JET DISRUPTS CONVENTIONAL FLIGHTS",
      "Why it matters",
      "The Z1 addresses two pressing challenges in modern transportation. First, it offers a practical solution for accessing remote regions where traditional cargo planes and helicopters face high costs and infrastructure limitations. Its ability to land without airstrips unlocks affordable transport options for industries like mining, disaster relief and medical supply delivery in isolated communities.",
      "Second, the Z1 contributes to the urgent global need to reduce carbon emissions. Transports such as cars, trucks, trains, ships and airplanes currently account for over 40% of worldwide carbon emissions, and the Z1's low fuel consumption and ability to overfly environmentally sensitive areas quietly present a scalable alternative for freight transport with minimized environmental impact.",

      "IS THIS 656-FOOT AIRYACHT THE LUXURY TRANSPORTATION OF THE FUTURE?",
      "The road ahead",
      "The recent $50 million order from Straightline Aviation demonstrates strong confidence in the Z1's commercial potential, with the first delivery expected by 2028. Arctic Airships has also placed orders for two airships, targeting operations in Alaska's challenging terrain.",
      "\"Our hybrid airships will transform cargo transport by providing an environmentally responsible solution while maintaining operational efficiency,\" said Dr. Bob Boyd, CEO of AT\u00b2 Aerospace. He went on to say,\u00a0\"Our aircraft not only optimizes cargo movement in challenging terrains but also aligns with the industry's increasing focus on environmental responsibility and cost efficiency.\"",

      "The Z1 hybrid airship is a real, practical answer to the challenges we face in logistics and the environment today. By blending tried-and-true lighter-than-air technology with advanced, fuel-efficient propulsion, AT\u00b2 Aerospace is showing us a whole new way to think about sustainable transport.

      "It might not be your phone, but your carrier\u2019s messaging support. Knowing the difference between SMS, MMS and RCS and how your carrier handles them can save you money, improve message delivery and ensure you\u2019re using the full potential of your messaging app.",
      "A person texting on their phone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Knowing the basics: SMS vs. MMS vs. RCS",
      "Before you can figure out which phone carrier fits your messaging needs, it helps to understand the differences between the three main types of mobile messaging \u2014 SMS, MMS and RCS. Each has its own capabilities, limitations and impact on your experience.",
      "Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals \u2014 plus instant access to my\u00a0free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up!",
      "SMS (Short Message Service) is the most basic form of text messaging and has been around since the early days of mobile phones. It allows users to send plain text messages with a strict character limit of 160 characters. SMS messages are sent over the cellular network, which means they work even if you don\u2019t have a data plan or access to Wi-Fi. This makes SMS one of the most reliable messaging options available, especially for simple communication. It works for all phones, even older models, which makes it universal.",
      "MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service)\u00a0builds upon SMS by allowing the transmission of multimedia content. With MMS, users can send images, videos, audio files and even GIFs. The character limit is significantly higher, typically up to 1,600 characters, although this can vary depending on the carrier. MMS messages also travel over the cellular network but require mobile data to send and receive. They do not require Wi-Fi, but because media files are larger, the reliability can vary. Some carriers compress MMS files or fail to send them if they exceed certain size limits, which means your carefully chosen vacation photo might arrive as a pixelated blur.",
      "RCS (Rich Communication Services) represents the next generation of mobile messaging. It is designed to upgrade the SMS and MMS experience by providing features that rival popular messaging apps like iMessage and WhatsApp. With RCS, users can send high-resolution photos and videos, audio clips, emoji, stickers and even read receipts and typing indicators. There is no character limit, and the service works over Wi-Fi or mobile data instead of over standard cellular channels.",
      "While RCS allows larger files, some messaging platforms or carriers may still apply soft limits or compress images/videos to ensure consistent performance. However, for RCS to work, both the sender and the recipient need to have RCS enabled on a supported messaging app and carrier. Google Messages is the most reliable app for accessing these RCS features, especially on Android devices. However, it should be noted that Apple devices do not support RCS natively because Apple relies on iMessage for similar functionality.",
      "HOW TO STOP SPAM TEXT MESSAGES ON YOUR PHONE",
      "Why it matters when choosing a wireless carrier",
      "Now that you know what SMS, MMS and RCS are, it\u2019s important to understand how your phone carrier influences your messaging experience. From hidden fees to message delivery issues, the provider you choose can make a big difference in how well these technologies work.",
      "Not all carriers treat these messaging types the same. While SMS is often free and unlimited on many plans, MMS messages may incur additional charges, especially on prepaid or international plans. RCS messages, on the other hand, use mobile data or Wi-Fi and typically do not incur per-message fees, making them a cost-effective option if supported.",
      "For example, carrier A might offer unlimited SMS but charge for every MMS sent. Carrier B might include MMS in the plan but cap the number of SMS messages. Carrier C could fully support RCS, letting users send messages over Wi-Fi for free. Choosing the right carrier based on how you communicate can help avoid surprise charges.",
      "While SMS and MMS are universally supported, RCS still depends on carrier infrastructure and the messaging app being used. Some carriers support RCS only through their proprietary apps, which may not be compatible with all devices. Others support \"universal RCS\", which works across multiple platforms but still requires the right app, most reliably\u00a0Google Messages.",
      "If you\u2019re hoping to use RCS features like high-resolution image sharing, read receipts and typing indicators, it\u2019s important to ensure your carrier not only supports RCS but also supports it universally across devices and apps. Otherwise, your message may silently fall back to SMS or MMS if the recipient\u2019s carrier or device does not support RCS.",

      "If you use a smaller or regional provider not mentioned above, or if you plan to travel internationally, it is important to check with your carrier about its current support for RCS, especially if you use an iPhone. While international support for RCS is expanding, it is not yet universal.",
      "When you are abroad, reliable messaging becomes even more critical. SMS is the most dependable option and works almost everywhere, making it a safe choice for staying connected. MMS, on the other hand, can be inconsistent overseas due to differences in network standards and carrier agreements. RCS is even less predictable outside your home country, as it relies on mobile data or Wi-Fi and often does not function while roaming unless your carrier specifically enables it for international use.",
      "So, if you are traveling or using a less common carrier, always confirm whether your plan includes international MMS and RCS support. This will help you avoid unexpected gaps in communication or surprise fees and ensure your messages reach their destination reliably.",

      "3. Keep your device and apps updated: Regularly\u00a0update your operating system and apps to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "4. Use end-to-end encrypted messaging apps: Consider using apps with end-to-end encryption for secure communication. This ensures that only you and the intended recipient can read the messages, keeping them safe from hackers or third-party interception. Popular options include Signal, WhatsApp and iMessage, which prioritize privacy and protect sensitive conversations from unauthorized access.",
      "5. Be mindful of public Wi-Fi and use a Virtual Private Network (VPN):\u00a0Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive communications, as it can be insecure and expose your data to potential eavesdropping or hacking. Consider using a VPN for secure browsing on public networks because it encrypts your internet traffic and masks your IP address, providing a safer experience even on unsecured networks. By using a VPN, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with public Wi-Fi and protect your personal data from unauthorized access. For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "6. Delete sensitive messages:\u00a0Regularly delete sensitive messages to minimize data exposure. This practice helps protect your privacy by ensuring that confidential information isn't stored indefinitely on your device or in the cloud, where it could potentially be accessed by unauthorized parties. Additionally, consider using messaging apps that offer features like automatic message deletion or self-destructing messages to further enhance your privacy",

      "\"The [suggestion] that Becky Hill is now in legal trouble helps Alex Murdaugh \u2014 I strongly disagree with that,\" former South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon told Fox News Digital. \"I think the exact opposite is really true.\"",
      "The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) on Wednesday afternoon announced that Hill, 57, has been charged with obstructing justice and misconduct in Colleton County and perjury in Richland County. The perjury charge stems from a lie she allegedly told South Carolina Supreme Court Justice Toal in January 2024, when the justice ruled that a new trial was not necessary for Murdaugh upon his appeal.",
      "Charging documents state that when Toal asked Hill, \"Did you allow anyone from the press to view sealed exhibits?\" Hill responded, \"No, ma'am,\" which is apparently inconsistent with evidence obtained by authorities. They also accuse her of showing sealed photos to a reporter and using her official position as Colleton County clerk for financial gain, specifically by promoting her book about the Murdaugh case on social media.",

      "\"That had been\u2026 the focus at the hearing for the retrial. Nothing in [Hill's charges] about jury tampering,\" he said. \"To my mind, it's a really big win for the state and a big loss for the defense because a main ground of their appeal would be this jury tampering, and the fact that there are no charges against former clerk Hill for jury tampering tells me that the authorities looked at that and did not believe there was sufficient evidence to show that she tampered with the jury.\"",

[Those are] actions that she took outside of that trial in the course and scope of her duties, taking advantage of her office \u2014 obstruction activity. That has nothing to do with it,\" Bland explained. \"One charge in Richland County is a perjury charge.

      "\"At the end of the day, this is going to be a legal decision on appeal,\" Bland said. \"Was Justice Toal correct in applying the South Carolina standard on juror interference by an official? And that, as the South Carolina standard says, you not only have to show the juror interference, but you have to show the effect that it had on the jurors and their verdict. I represented six of those jurors. Eleven of those jurors said\u2026 anything that Becky Hill said didn't have any effect on our verdict.\"",

She's in charge of the clerk of court's office, where all the filings for the case go, and marshaling all the evidence. She's in charge of the jurors and making sure that they get there on time and they're comfortable and they have something to eat.

And again, I don't think there was a malicious intent with that whatsoever. Having said that... one would expect a clerk of court under these heightened circumstances to follow each and every rule, and the allegations show that she did not.

      "EXCLUSIVE \u2014 Israeli U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon condemned a United Nations official over remarks that he said \"shattered any notion of neutrality.\"",
      "On Tuesday, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher accused Israel of committing genocide in his remarks before the U.N. Security Council.",
      "\"Israel is deliberately and unashamedly imposing inhumane conditions on civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,\" Fletcher told the Security Council on Tuesday. He went on to say that most of Gaza \"is either within Israeli-militarized zones or under displacement orders.\"",

      "Fletcher, who heads the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), also described how Gazans are struggling due to a lack of supplies, as aid trucks have not been allowed to enter the Gaza Strip for 10 weeks. Hospitals are \"overwhelmed,\" and people are facing famine and starvation, according to Fletcher.",
      "\"So, for those killed and those whose voices are silenced: what more evidence do you need now? Will you act \u2013 decisively \u2013 to prevent genocide and to ensure respect for international humanitarian law? Or will you say instead that \u2018we did all we could?\u2019,\" Fletcher said.",

The next day, May 14, a pregnant Israeli woman was killed in a shooting attack while on her way to the hospital to give birth. Tzeela Gez lost her life, but doctors were able to save her baby, who, according to The Associated Press, is \"in serious but stable condition.\"",

      "In his response, Danon said Fletcher\u2019s remarks \"shocked and disturbed\" him, accusing the U.N. official of making an \"utterly inappropriate and deeply irresponsible\" statement that \"shattered any notion of neutrality.\"",
      "\"You had the audacity, in your capacity as a senior U.N. official, to stand before the Security Council and invoke the charge of genocide without evidence, mandate, or restraint,\" Danon wrote in his response. \"As a senior representative of the United Nations, you are obligated to refrain from prejudging complex international matters. Yet, this is precisely what you did before the Council. You did not brief the Council; you delivered a political sermon.\"",
      "In response to a Fox News Digital request for comment, OCHA spokesperson Eri Kaneko said that \"As Mr. Fletcher made clear in his Security Council remarks, it is for legal bodies to consider whether a genocide is taking place - Mr. Fletcher's point is that the world must take decisive action to prevent genocide and ensure respect for international humanitarian law.\"",
      "Israeli Permanent Member to the United Nations Danny Danon speaks during a session of the Security Council at the New York City headquarters. (Israel United Nations mission)",

      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Danon questioned under whose authority Fletcher issued the accusation and said the U.N. official\u2019s use of the word \"genocide\" was a \"desecration and subversion of a term with unique force and weight.\" He went on to say that what made Fletcher\u2019s remarks \"far worse\" was the fact that Israel had \"engaged with you and your office in good faith at the highest levels.\"",
      "The Israeli ambassador concluded his letter by turning the questions around on Fletcher, telling the OCHA chief to ask himself whether he had done enough to prevent Oct. 7, accelerate the release of the hostages and hold Hamas accountable.",
      "Kaneko told Fox News Digital that \"Mr. Fletcher has repeatedly and publicly spoken out against what he calls the horrendous Hamas-led attacks and called for the release of the hostages. Mr. Fletcher was deeply moved by his visit in February to the kibbutz of Nir Oz, where one in four people were killed or taken hostage.\"",
      "Later on Friday, Fletcher issued his own letter in response to Danon in which he recalled meeting with Oct. 7 survivors from kibbutz Nir Oz, where the Bibas family was taken. He also demanded that the Israeli government \"let us do our work.\"",
      "Fletcher also said that while he was not in his position when the Hamas massacre took place, he watched the \"atrocities\" unfold \"with horror.\" The U.N. official added that he has repeatedly called on Hamas to release hostages unconditionally, including during the session in which he accused Israel of committing genocide.",

      "He even visited a mosque, remarking on the pride for he felt for \u201cmy friends\u201d as he took in its beauty. \u201cThis is an incredible culture,\u201d Trump said.",
      "But one omission on the trip became more glaring with each stop:\u00a0Israel.",
      "Tensions between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0were already bubbling up\u00a0before the president spent the week visiting three of America\u2019s key Arab allies: Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "By the end of the trip on Friday, Trump seemed to put further strain on the relationship. He had spent the past few days meeting with Syria\u2019s new leader \u2014 a former al Qaeda leader the U.S. had put a $10 million bounty on \u2014 and announced he was lifting sanctions on the country in a move Israel opposed but one that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia\u00a0had urged the president to take.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Trump told reporters he had discussed the sanctions decision with Netanyahu, framing it as widely supported by others.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s been very popular, certainly in the Middle East,\u201d Trump said. He also cited conversations with bin Salman and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan who, he claimed, saw the move as critical to its chance of survival as a country.",
      "A day after promising to lift the sanctions, Trump praised Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa as a \u201cyoung, attractive guy \u2014 tough guy,\u201d and urged the former rebel fighter to join the Abraham Accords \u2014 the president\u2019s signature foreign policy achievement from his first term that normalized ties between Israel and several Arab states.",
      "During the trip, Trump also leaned into the notion of a deal with Iran being within striking distance, without putting forward any details to assuage some of Israel\u2019s concerns. And on the eve of the president\u2019s trip, his administration announced it had cut a unilateral deal with Hamas, the U.S.-designated terrorist organization that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, to secure the release of the last living American hostage in Gaza.",
      "\u201cHopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict,\u201d Trump said of the release of Edan Alexander. He added on Friday that \u201cwe\u2019re going to find out pretty soon\u201d if Israel is able to\u00a0free the nearly two dozen hostages believed to be alive in\u00a0Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu, meanwhile, bombed Gaza during Trump\u2019s trip to the region,\u00a0killing more than 100 people in the last 24 hours, according to local health authorities.",
      "Asked about Israel\u2019s plans for expanding the war in Gaza, as he pushes for a ceasefire, Trump struck a measured tone.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of good things are going to happen over the next month, and we\u2019re going to see.\u00a0We have to help also out the Palestinians,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know, a lot of people are starving on Gaza, so we have to look at both sides.\u201d",
      "Even so, Israel is increasingly anxious about Trump striking a quick nuclear deal with Iran and Arab leaders shaping the president\u2019s thinking, one person familiar with the dynamic between Trump and Netanyahu said.",
      "\u201cThe trip hasn\u2019t so much put distance between Trump and Netanyahu as it has exposed it,\u201d this person said.",
      "Trump, speaking to reporters, dismissed the notion that his trip marginalized\u00a0America\u2019s closest ally in the region. He said on Wednesday that the U.S. having a strong relationship with Arab leaders is \u201cvery good for Israel.\u201d",
      "Across four breakneck days of deal-making, Arab leaders showed their ability to provide Trump with tangible economic wins he can showcase overseas as benefiting Americans back home, as well as the kind of warm welcome that resonates with the president.",
      "\u201cThe job they\u2019ve done in a fairly short period of time is just outstanding. They\u2019re great people. Great leaders. Three great leaders,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday as he headed back to Washington, D.C. \u201cAnd the respect shown to our country was incredible. Because nobody is treated like that.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s relationship with Netanyahu, by contrast, is largely focused on national security concerns, from Iran to the war in Gaza to the shifting dynamics in Syria.",
      "So far, Israel has largely kept those concerns behind the scenes \u2014 which has not been the case with previous presidents, specifically Barack Obama and Joe Biden,\u00a0even as they vowed to protect America\u2019s \u201cunbreakable bond\u201d with Israel. And the U.S. continues to strongly support Israel, with Trump sending military equipment the Biden administration had paused.",
      "In a statement, National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt described Trump as Israel\u2019s staunchest ally in its history.",
      "\u201cIsrael has had no better friend in its history than President Trump,\u201d Hewitt said. \u201cWe continue to work closely with our ally Israel to ensure remaining hostages in Gaza are freed, Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, and to strengthen regional security in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Hewitt added, \u201cAs he has repeatedly stated in his first and second terms, the President is committed to ensuring Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "As for where the dynamic between Trump and Netanyahu goes\u00a0next, one ally of the president made the case that deepening ties with Arab leaders will ultimately protect Israel because of its close relationship with the U.S. At the same time, the ally noted Trump\u2019s characteristic unpredictability, saying, \u201cTrump does what Trump does.\u201d"

      "Today, at 77, Grandin holds a Ph.D., is a professor of animal science at Colorado State University and has authored multiple New York Times bestselling books.

In that era, Grandin said, it was typical for children displaying traits like hers to be deemed \u201cmentally retarded\u201d and institutionalized. Her mother rejected that thinking and took her to a neurologist, who  recommended speech therapy. In time, Grandin\u2019s speech developed and she forged a path, which included a trip to her aunt\u2019s farm. That opened her world.",

    "summary": "Many Americans are really stressed out right now.  But we\u2019re probably wrong about how stress affects our eating habits, new research suggests.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans are really stressed out right now. When we\u2019re emotionally overwhelmed, it probably feels natural to reach for a bag of chips. But we\u2019re probably wrong about how stress affects our eating habits, a psychologist says.",
      "What does that mean for our waistlines?",
      "Stress eating has long been associated with overeating, but that\u2019s a basic misunderstanding, said Dr. Kristin Javaras, an associate psychologist at McLean Hospital in Massachusetts and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Maybe we\u2019re not eating as much as we think.",
      "Much of what we know about stress eating is based on cultural cliches such as TV shows, movies or social media. Research on the behavior is mostly from surveys that rely on people remembering what they ate when going through tough times.",
      "The problem with those surveys, Jarvaras said, is people\u2019s perceptions often change when they\u2019re stressed, so it can be hard for anyone to accurately describe how their eating behavior was affected.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t actually eat more, but you think you eat more when you\u2019re stressed simply because you think the amount is larger,\u201d said Javaras, who recently presented some of her findings in a Brain & Behavior Research Foundation webinar.",
      "In other words, people remember the moment of a breakup and then eating ice cream.",
      "\u201cBut you don\u2019t think of all the other times you\u2019re actually stressed at work and ate less,\u201d she adds.",
      "Many people actually do eat less when they\u2019re acutely stressed, especially as the severity of the situation increases, in part because they may not have as much time to eat.",
      "Past research has shown approximately 40% people eat more when stressed, 40% eat less and 20% don\u2019t change their eating habits.",
      "When stress can lead to hunger",
      "When the body is under chronic stress, cortisol levels rise, which not only stimulates appetite but also can promote fat storage, particularly in the abdominal area, said Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist and obesity specialist who runs True You Weight Loss in Cary, North Carolina.",
      "\u201cIt also disrupts sleep, which further exacerbates cravings and metabolic dysfunction,\u201d he said.",
      "At that point, people often turn to comfort foods that are high in fat and sugar, which triggers the pleasure center of our brain to release dopamine, providing a temporary sense of relief, McGowan said. That relief is short-lived, often followed by guilt or regret.",
      "And comfort food may not actually provide as much comfort as you think.",
      "A prior study concluded comfort food does not on average reduce stress, finding no difference in healthy women participants when they replaced unhealthy comfort foods with fruits and vegetables.",
      "How to avoid overeating and counteract cravings",
      "\u201cThe more we eat in response to emotion, the stronger the connection between that emotion and the craved food \u2014 making our stress eating response more ingrained over time,\u201d said Rachel Gargano, the chief registered dietitian at a private practice.",
      "\u201cCravings usually last about 20 to 30 minutes, so if you can get through these initial intense, often overwhelming feelings, they usually begin to subside and become more manageable,\u201d she said.",
      "Each person has specific triggers, like being alone at home and seeing or smelling favorite foods that may start the process of overeating, Gargano said.",
      "She recommends keeping a journal to document when cravings start, then categorizing them as physical hunger or emotional hunger, depending on the situation.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s been longer than three or four hours since your last meal, then it\u2019s possible that your body needs a quality, balanced snack or meal,\u201d she said.",
      "If you realize you\u2019re not hungry and it\u2019s just \u201cemotional hunger,\u201d it\u2019s time to try distraction.",
      "\u201cReplacing stress eating with even short bursts of physical activity can be a powerful shift toward long-term well-being,\u201d McGowan adds.",
      "Exercise helps regulate the body\u2019s stress response, lowers baseline cortisol levels, boosts mood, improves sleep quality and supports both physical and metabolic health, he adds.",
      "Alternative options to distract yourself include reading a chapter of your favorite book, going for a quick walk, sitting outside or doing 15 minutes of yoga.",
      "Gargano encourages developing an \u201canti-cravings tool kit,\u201d which can include:",
      "Not skipping regular meals.Getting enough fiber in the diet. Women need about 25 grams daily and men need 35 grams.Getting enough protein each day. (About 30 to 40 grams per meal.)Drinking plenty of fluids. If you aim for about half your weight in ounces per day and add more if it\u2019s hot out or if you\u2019re exercising more than an hour, your body won\u2019t confuse thirst for hunger.Get at least seven hours of sleep, although eight is optimal.",

      "\u201cThe more you\u2019re able to get through a craving without giving in, the more you\u2019re retraining your brain to not need food as a Band-Aid,\u201d Gargano said.",

    "summary": "Sovereignty is not running out of that starting gate in the Preakness Stakes on Saturday, two weeks after winning the Kentucky Derby.",
    "story": [
      "BALTIMORE \u2014 Sovereignty is not running out of that starting gate in the Preakness Stakes on Saturday, two weeks after winning the Kentucky Derby. Yet he is still the talk of Pimlico Race Course this week.",
      "That is because owners and trainer Bill Mott opted to skip the Preakness and with it a chance at the Triple Crown because of the short turnaround. It is the second time in four years the Derby winner is not taking part for that reason, and the fifth time in seven years overall, the Preakness goes on with no Triple Crown on the line.",
      "The trend has reignited the debate about what, if anything needs to change with the Triple Crown, with ideas ranging from putting more space between the Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes to adding incentives to run in all three to changing the order of the races altogether. Like starters in baseball throwing fewer pitchers, elite horses now typically get much longer time between races, and the situation has put tradition and modernization of the sport head to head.",
      "The two-week turnaround now feels to many around the sport like an antiquated schedule when longer gaps are now the norm with an eye toward horse wear and tear and better performance. Thoroughbreds used to be trained and run at a much quicker interval.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a question that has more than one side to it,\u201d said Steve Asmussen, who has won more races than any other trainer in North America. \u201cI love how hard it is to do, which makes it so special. And then would it be making it easier? Does it dilute it? That\u2019s a great question. And I think that it\u2019ll continue to be debated.\u201d",
      "The debate",
      "It was debated constantly during the 37-year drought between Triple Crown champions from Affirmed in 1978 until Bob Baffert-trained American Pharoah swept the three races in 2015. Baffert\u2019s Justify did it in 2018, too, and the chorus of voices calling for change was quieted.",
      "But then, for various reasons, there has been a Triple Crown chance in the Preakness only twice in the past seven years. The biggest draw of the middle leg \u2014 the anticipation for the possibility \u2014 went from being automatic to anything but.",
      "\u201cIt is troubling, and it has been troubling for several years,\u201d said Jerry Bailey, a Hall of Fame jockey who won each of the three races twice and is now an NBC Sports analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s completely flip-flopped from my generation when it was the rule that they would run back and the exception that they wouldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Many top trainers, including Baffert, D. Wayne Lukas, Mark Casse and Michael McCarthy have run a Derby horse in the Preakness or will this year. Others, like Mott, Chad Brown, Todd Pletcher and Brad Cox, are more reluctant to take the risk.",
      "\u201cWe need them in the game,\u201d said Casse, who won the Preakness in 2019 with War of Will and has Sandman this year. \u201cThis is important. We want the best horses for our sport.\u201d",
      "When Asmussen won a Triple Crown race for the first time with Curlin in the 2007 Preakness, it came after his horse finished third behind Street Sense and Hard Spun in the Kentucky Derby. Curlin, Street Sense and Hard Spun went 1-2-3 in the Preakness.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely running on a very different environment than we were then,\u201d Asmussen said. \u201cEvery horse is an individual, every year is different, and it\u2019s just very unique circumstances.\u201d"

    "summary": "No Sovereignty, no problem. The Preakness Stakes on Saturday still has plenty of intrigue.",
    "story": [
      "There\u2019s no sense in wallowing in disappointment over the absence of Sovereignty, the Kentucky Derby winner, from Saturday\u2019s 150th Preakness Stakes. His ownership and training team made it clear that they don\u2019t consider the Triple Crown a prize worth chasing and instead are content to target the Belmont Stakes in early June.",
      "Fortunately, this year\u2019s Preakness is still an appealing race with a mix of returnees from the Derby and promising newcomers that could be poised for stardom. The winning horse will likely earn a trip to the Belmont for a rendezvous with Sovereignty \u2014 and a chance to claim supremacy in the three-year-old division.",
      "Here\u2019s what I\u2019m watching for ahead of Saturday\u2019s race from Baltimore.",
      "Redemption in Baltimore?",
      "Journalism, the beaten favorite in the Kentucky Derby, is the morning line favorite again in the Preakness. He outran 17 of his 18 rivals in the Derby, only finishing behind Sovereignty. On Saturday Journalism will face a field that is much smaller (eight horses) and full of question marks.",
      "The question for bettors, though, is what constitutes value with him. He\u2019s listed at 8-5 in the morning line, which could be a steal on a horse of his caliber. But will those odds actually hold up or will the public all be thinking the same thing? The lower the odds, the greater the incentive to look elsewhere, especially when you consider the history of horses in this same spot: Nine beaten Derby favorites this century have turned around and contested the Preakness, but only two of them won.",
      "Kings of Baltimore",
      "Bob Baffert and D. Wayne Lukas are two of the most decorated trainers in the sport, and they\u2019ve both excelled in this race like no one else. Baffert\u2019s eight Preakness wins are the most all-time, and Lukas is right behind him with seven. Between them, they\u2019ve won the last two editions and one-third of all Preaknesses since 1980, a nearly half-century span.",
      "Baffert will send out Goal Oriented this weekend. With just two career starts, neither in a stakes race, this is not your typical Baffert entry. There is clear upside potential, however. Goal Oriented won both races he\u2019s run in and does have early speed, which can be beneficial in the Preakness. But this is a big step up in terms of competition level, and with such a thin resume the unknowns are plentiful. And with Baffert\u2019s name attached, he\u2019s likely to get a good amount of betting attention, driving down his price. None of Baffert\u2019s wins in this race have been with a horse like this \u2014 but maybe that\u2019s just a reflection of how confident he is in this one?",
      "Lukas, meanwhile, is running American Promise, who was last seen finishing up the track in the Derby. His jockey, Nik Juarez, attempted a middle move in that race, but ended up squeezed tight between two others and then hastily retreated from contention. That performance is a lot to consider, especially given that American Promise\u2019s only wins have been against much lesser competition than this. The best argument for him in this race is probably Lukas himself, who has won it with long shots before, including Seize the Grey at 9-1 last year.",
      "The other Derby returnee",
      "Sandman rounds out the horses that are here after running in the Derby. He was very popular with the betting public that day, going off as the second choice, but never got into the race and finished a well-beaten seventh. His team made a late and surprising decision to run here. His style as a deep-closing horse has not generally fared well in the Preakness, so he\u2019ll either need to change things up and be closer to the pace, or he\u2019ll be reliant on the front-runners going too fast and burning out. His Metallica-inspired name and celebrity ownership figure again to attract a lot of support at the windows.",
      "The Derby-skippers",
      "It used to be almost automatic that the Preakness would be won by a horse coming out of the Kentucky Derby. From 1984 to 2016, 30 of 33 winners had run in Louisville. But since then, we seem to have entered a new era.",
      "Modern trainers are increasingly reluctant to run their horses frequently; attempting the two-week turnaround between Louisville and Baltimore is simply unthinkable to many of them. This has opened the door to Derby-skippers, horses that sit out the Run for the Roses and aim for the Preakness instead. They\u2019ve now won six of the last eight.",
      "Baffert\u2019s Goal Oriented is one of them, but the most highly regarded may be Clever Again, who has flashed signs of brilliance in his three career races. In his most recent, a stakes win at Oaklawn Park in Arkansas, he posted a Beyer speed rating of 101 \u2014 making him the only horse here besides Journalism that has put up a triple-digit figure.",
      "River Thames looms large as well. Back in March, he ran against Sovereignty in a stakes race and lost by just a neck. He could be sitting in a good position on Saturday too, just off the speediest horses and poised to take over late. Somehow, his trainer, Hall of Famer Todd Pletcher, is 0-for-10 in this race, although he\u2019s often bypassed it with his top horses. The more money that Journalism, Sandman and Goal Oriented take, the more Clever Again and River Thames could emerge as value plays.",
      "The other Derby skippers are deserving long shots. Heart of Honor is here following a protracted journey from the Middle East, where he finished second in a stakes race to Admire Daytona (who then ran dead last in the Derby). Pay Billy, who has won big on the lower-tier Maryland circuit, takes the customary local slot on the race; it\u2019s been 42 years since a horse took that route to a Preakness victory. And Gosger\u2019s time and speed rating were both ho-hum in the race he won to get here.",
      "My bet",
      "I went with my heart in the Derby, picking the feel-good story of Lukas and American Promise, and I\u2019ve got the depleted bank account to show for it. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m not tempted to forgive that 16th-place Derby finish and take another shot with him here and, who knows, maybe I\u2019ll lull myself into doing just that. But as much of a sucker as I am for Lukas horses in Triple Crown races, I do have my eyes on some other possibilities.",
      "Along with the rest of the NBC team, I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ve come up with just before the race on Saturday. (Don\u2019t worry, with plenty of time for you to cancel your bet if I curse your horse by picking it.)"

      "Here is everything you need to know about Pimlico Race Course, its history, why it\u2019s being demolished, the plans for renovation and much more.",
      "Where is Pimlico Race Course located?",
      "Located in Baltimore, Maryland, Pimlico Race Course has traditionally hosted the \u201cmiddle jewel\u201d of the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes.",
      "Pimlico, nicknamed \u201cOld Hilltop,\u201d officially opened its doors on October 25, 1870 and first hosted the Preakness Stakes in 1873. In 1890, the Stakes moved from Maryland to a track in New York. The race didn\u2019t run from 1891 to 1893, and then moved to a different track in New York until 1908. In 1909, the race returned to Pimlico and has been hosted at the iconic venue ever since. Pimlico is the second oldest racetrack in the country, behind Saratoga, which debuted in upstate New York in 1864.",
      "Though the track was renovated in the 1950s, the age of Baltimore\u2019s Historic Pimlico Race Course has been a concern for decades. Back in 2019, nearly 7,000 grandstand seats were closed over safety concerns. Renovation plans were discussed but never carried out.",
      "The demolition of the renowned Pimlico Race Course marks the end of an era, but the revitalization of the structure marks the beginning of a\u00a0new\u00a0era.",
      "What is happening with Pimlico race track?",
      "On May 7, the state of Maryland released design concepts for a new Pimlico Race Course, which is set to debut in 2027. Demolition is expected to begin in June ahead of a $400 million reconstruction funded by state bonds.",
      "The 2026 Preakness Stakes will relocate to Laurel Park, a track that sits about 20 miles south of Pimlico. The 2027 Preakness Stakes are expected to return to Baltimore\u2019s revitalized facility. Then, once Pimlico is back up and running, Laurel Park will close for its own redevelopment.",
      "As part of the multi-year project, and in addition to the new and improved Pimlico, a new hotel, event space, and state-of-the-art Thoroughbred training center will be built at Shamrock Farm in Woodbine, Maryland, which is located approximately 20 miles west of Pimlico. The site design features a strong new identity with inspiration from popular Baltimore landmarks like the Rawlings Conservatory in Druid Hill Park and the original Pimlico Clubhouse. The state will direct at least $110 million to the new training facility, which will offer 328 pastoral acres to more than 800 boarded horses, housing for backstretch workers and a training track with dimensions identical to Pimlico.The Maryland Stadium Authority, in partnership with The Maryland Jockey Club and the Park Heights community, will oversee the construction of the new race course, as well as the additional amenities.",
      "The decision to revitalize Pimlico is an essential step forward to promoting the future of Thoroughbred racing in Maryland, as well as growing local and statewide economies. The new facility will support approximately 500 jobs and over 100 racing days annually. Pimlico currently hosts around 15 racing days per year.",
      "\u201cToday we take another step toward a new, reimagined Pimlico,\u201d said Maryland Governor Wes Moore (Citybiz, May 12, 2025). \u201cTogether, we will continue to drive economic growth in Park Heights, throughout Baltimore, and across the entire state.\u201d",
      "Who owns Pimlico Race Course?",
      "In April, it was announced that the Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority, which was created in 2023 to assist in managing Pimlico\u2019s transition from private to public ownership, will be dissolved as soon as July 2025. The Maryland Jockey Club will operate under the Maryland Economic Development Corporation (MEDCO).",
      "\u201cWe are excited to deliver a new, modern Pimlico for racing fans and the Park Heights community,\u201d said Maryland Stadium Authority Chairman Craig Thompson. \u201cThis work is bigger than a racetrack, as historic and important as it is. This is about bringing hundreds of millions of dollars in state investment to Park Heights and working in partnership with MEDCO and the local community to realize a shared vision for the future.\u201d",
      "Despite 1/ST (formerly known as The Stronach Group) transferring operations of Pimlico to the state of Maryland on January 1, 2025, the company is still spearheading the Preakness this year and next year. For 2027 and beyond, Maryland will adopt control over the Stakes. The state will essentially license the event name from 1/ST as part of a long-term agreement.",
      "\u201cIt was highly unlikely that a private operator would want to come in because \u2018What\u2019s the upside for a private operator?\u2019 They\u2019re in the business of making a profit,\u201d said the Thoroughbred Horsemen\u2019s Association chairman and CEO Alan Foreman (Blood Horse, March 2024). \u201c[The tracks] don\u2019t have gaming in Maryland \u2014 they get a small piece of gaming revenue for capital improvement purposes. And there\u2019s really no upside for an operator other than they covet the Preakness.\u201d",
      "Who holds the track record at Pimlico?",
      "It\u2019s important to note that there are other races held at Pimlico besides the Preakness Stakes. With that being said, the owner of the track record at Pimlico for 1 3/16 mile distance is\u00a0Farma Way, with a time of 1:52 2/5 in the 1991 Pimlico Special.",
      "Who holds the track record at the Preakness?",
      "In 1973,\u00a0Secretariat\u00a0secured the Preakness record at 1 3/16 miles, with a time of 1:53 2/5.",
      "Note:\u00a0The Preakness has been staged at seven different distances since its debut in 1873. From 1925 to present day, the distance run is set at 1 3/16 miles.",
      "How can I watch horse racing on",
      "Sign up\u00a0to watch all of our live sports and events, including horse racing.",
      "What devices does Peacock support?",
      "You can enjoy Peacock on a variety of devices.\u00a0View the full list of supported devices here."

    "story": [
      "A judge\u2019s ruling to resentence Erik and Lyle Menendez last week gave the siblings something they\u2019ve not had in more than three decades: a chance that they could leave the Southern California prison where they\u2019re incarcerated.",
      "The brothers, who had been serving life sentences without the possibility of parole after a pair of sensational trials ended with convictions for their parents\u2019 1989 murder, can seek their release from California\u2019s parole board after Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic found they do not pose an \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d if released from prison.",
      "Jesic resentenced the siblings to 50 years to life, endorsing the recommendation of former Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon and denying the position of his successor, Nathan Hochman, who opposed their resentencing.",
      "Here\u2019s what could happen next in the case, which highlighted a debate over a key issue in the criminal justice system \u2014 rehabilitation \u2014 and gained renewed attention after a Netflix miniseries and documentary about their lives.",
      "June 13 hearing",
      "Jesic\u2019s ruling allows Erik, 54, and Lyle, 57, to make their case for freedom at a hearing aimed at determining whether they\u2019re suitable for parole. Those proceedings are scheduled for June 13 \u2014 a date previously set aside for hearings in a separate effort seeking clemency from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, according to a spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which oversees the parole system.",
      "\u201cSince the ruling makes them immediately eligible for parole consideration as youth offenders, it is the Board\u2019s intent to convert the June 13, 2025, clemency hearings to initial parole suitability hearings,\u201d Scott Wyckoff, executive officer of Board of Parole Hearings, stated in a letter obtained by the Los Angeles Times.",
      "In an email, the corrections department spokesperson said the board is allowing people to raise objections to the change.",
      "Although the hearings are no longer for clemency, the brothers\u2019 application with the governor remains active.",
      "If the parole hearing takes place, parole commissioners will be tasked with determining whether the brothers pose an unreasonable risk of danger. Prosecutors, victims\u2019 relatives and others can weigh in on the question.",
      "Hochman told reporters Wednesday that someone from the district attorney\u2019s office will attend. That representative\u2019s level of participation will likely be dictated by the parole board, he said.",
      "Even if the commissioners find the brothers suitable for parole, that \u201cproposed\u201d decision is subject to Newsom\u2019s approval.",
      "Asked Wednesday what he would do if the board recommends parole, Newsom declined to answer but said he often refers recommendations to the full parole board for review. He can also reverse a recommendation, he told reporters.",
      "\u201cObviously, I have great respect for their judgment and the very relatively small percentage of parole applications they actually approve,\u201d he said.",
      "Appeal for clemency",
      "Newsom said the process of determining whether someone is eligible for clemency or parole is similar. As part of the siblings\u2019 clemency application, the governor asked the board to determine whether the brothers pose an unreasonable risk of danger if released.",
      "Part of that evaluation has already been made public. During resentencing proceedings, Hochman said forensic psychologists found that the brothers posed a \u201cmoderate\u201d risk of committing violence outside prison. Those findings were based in part on psychological evaluations and recent prison violations, Hochman said.",
      "A lawyer for the brothers, Mark Geragos, has downplayed the violations \u2014 which include using smuggled cellphones after the resentencing proceedings were initiated \u2014 and said they do not constitute a \u201csuperstrike,\u201d or the kind of serious crime that could suggest they pose an unreasonable risk.",
      "Hochman opposed the brothers\u2019 release in part because of the evaluation. He also said they had not taken full responsibility for their crimes and cited 16 \u201cunacknowledged lies\u201d that he said the brothers told about the murders for decades. He reiterated that position during a news conference Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIf they can deal with the issues that cause their risk level to be increased and then finally come clean with all their lies, fraud and deceit, then they should be appropriate candidates for parole,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking after their resentencing, the brothers said they had taken full responsibility and offered no justification for killing their mother, Kitty, or their father, Jose, on Aug. 20, 1989.",
      "At trial and in media interviews afterward, including in a 2017 interview with \u201cDateline,\u201d the brothers said they killed their parents in self-defense after Lyle confronted his father about sexually abusing his younger brother and Jose appeared to threaten him.",
      "Prosecutors have long disputed this account. They described the killings as calculated and horrific \u2014 Lyle Menendez reloaded his shotgun before shooting his mother in the face \u2014 and motivated by financial gain.",
      "Speaking Tuesday, Lyle Menendez told the court that he was \u201cdeeply ashamed\u201d of who he was 35 years ago.",
      "Claim of new evidence",
      "The brothers have also sought their freedom through a third path \u2014 a petition that seeks to overturn their convictions based on what the brothers\u2019 defense attorneys have described as new evidence in the case.",
      "The petition, which includes a photocopied letter that Erik said he wrote to a cousin and which Geragos has said confirms Jose\u2019s abuse of the younger sibling months before, was filed after the release of Peacock\u2019s \u201cMenudo + Menendez: Boys Betrayed,\u201d which included a former member of the Puerto Rican boy band accusing Jose Menendez of raping him. (Peacock is owned by NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.)",
      "At the time, Jose Menendez was an executive with RCA Records, which had a multialbum contract with the band.",
      "Hochman has said the evidence does not meet the standard required for a judge to order a new trial and that he opposes the petition."

      "A human smuggler tells a potential customer in an audio message in Mandarin that there are now two potential sea routes for illegally entering the U.S. One is to depart by boat near the U.S.-Mexico border and then come ashore near Los Angeles. The second departs Nassau in the Bahamas by boat for the Miami area.",
      "The smuggler says in the audio, obtained by NBC News from a potential smuggling customer, that enforcement off the coast of Florida has increased, but quickly reassures the potential customer, \u201cYou won\u2019t get caught.\u201d",
      "Not so, authorities say.",
      "Out on a labyrinth of canals in Coral Gables, Florida, police are on the lookout for fishermen who might be spotters or boats carrying more weight than normal.",
      "Officials have been on heightened alert because the city\u2019s mangrove-shrouded waterways have become a landing destination for groups of Chinese migrants seeking illegal entry into the United States.",
      "With the southern border a less viable option, these migrants have found Florida via the Bahamas to be a workaround. But authorities have been cracking down and are seeing a decrease in smuggling attempts over the last few months.",
      "The number of Chinese nationals apprehended by Florida-based Customs and Border Patrol officers has climbed and dipped in recent years \u2014 406 in 2020, 616 the year after, then 483 in 2024. But there have been no known smuggling attempts in the Coral Gables area since late January of this year.",
      "Local law enforcement officials admit they aren\u2019t sure if that\u2019s due to increased enforcement, Trump\u2019s policies that have had a similar impact on border crossings \u2014 or if smugglers have simply gotten more sophisticated.",
      "\u201cWe believe we have kind of a handle on our side,\u201d said Coral Gables Police Chief Edward J. Hudak. \u201c[But] where is it going to go next? [Smuggling] is like water. Water is going to go wherever it can go.\u201d",
      "The drop comes after two high-profile human smuggling incidents in the affluent city and another just off shore since the start of the year have resulted in the apprehension of nearly 50 Chinese migrants.",
      "Another incident appears to have occured on Dec. 19, 2024, almost a full month before Coral Gables police made their first human smuggling stop. Surveillance footage obtained by NBC News from a neighbor\u2019s door camera shows a group of 18 Asian migrants walking into a waiting U-Haul van parked next to a waterway, as dozens of vehicles drive by. No police are seen, and there\u2019s no record of the apparent migrants or alleged smuggler ever being apprehended.",
      "Overall, encounters at the southwest border are down 93% compared to this time last year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and smugglers have pivoted to sea routes off the coasts of California and Florida, experts tell NBC News.",
      "More than 35,000 Chinese migrants crossed the southern border in 2023, but crossings have dropped due to stricter enforcement. Last year, apprehensions of Chinese nationals at the border reached a record high.",
      "The Bahamas has quickly become a strategic departure point for many of these migrants coming ashore in Florida due to that country\u2019s lifting of visa restrictions for Chinese citizens.",
      "\u201cThese human smugglers are being more creative,\u201d said Leland Lazarus, the associate director of national security at Florida International University\u2019s Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy. \u201cThey see one route dropping off in the southwest border, and they\u2019re trying maritime routes more frequently.\u201d",
      "Drawing on the narcotics playbook of the past",
      "Police say it\u2019s a challenge to patrol the intricate waterways that snake through Coral Gables as well as the yawning stretch of ocean just outside, but they do have a past playbook. The area has been a smuggling hot spot for decades, first for drugs and now, it appears, for humans.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just dusted off our playbook from the 1980s and 1990s, when the smugglers were bringing in narco narcotics,\u201d said Hudak. \u201cBut this is human cargo now, so that\u2019s really changed the game for us.\u201d",
      "Hudak says the sea-lanes used by human smugglers now are the same ones used for drugs previously. And the smugglers\u2019 knack for evolving and evading authorities also appears unchanged.",
      "\u201cThere are ingenious ways to get narcotics into this country, and there are ingenious ways to get human beings into this country,\u201d said Hudak.",
      "Further communication between the smuggler and his potential customer offers a glimpse at how some criminals may be managing to stay one step ahead of authorities. Rather than using the traditional panga boats or speedboats to ferry migrants across seas, the smuggler says he\u2019s now using yachts.",

      "On red carpets from Los Angeles to the French Riviera, Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs and the R&B singer Cassie intertwined arms, radiating an attractive and carefree fa\u00e7ade for the cameras.",
      "But behind closed doors, she said, she \u201cfelt trapped.\u201d",
      "In the first week of testimony in Combs\u2019 federal sex trafficking trial in New York, Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, described over four days on the witness stand a tumultuous relationship with the music impresario that began in her early 20s and lasted on and off for over a decade. As the government\u2019s star witness, her responses gave a window into a world centered around paid sexual encounters lasting days and sometimes occurring weekly \u2014 known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d \u2014 that she said she was forced to endure under the threat of physical and psychological abuse.",
      "Sign up for the \u201cDiddy on Trial\u201d newsletter for key developments and analysis",
      "The \u201cfreak offs\u201d were so regular, she said, they \u201cbecame a job.\u201d",
      "Much of what Ventura, 38, testified to was graphic, from the sex acts with male escorts to the violence, including the fights with Combs that left her covered in bruises, she said, if she attempted to rebuff a \u201cfreak off.\u201d A visibly pregnant Ventura also recounted how, she said, Combs raped her on her living room floor in 2018, which he has denied.",
      "But as explicit as the line of questioning was from the prosecution, it was necessary, some legal experts say, because it helped to lay a foundation for the federal government\u2019s case in the weeks to come. Ultimately, 12 jurors must decide whether Combs, 55, violated federal laws against racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has vehemently denied all five counts against him, but if found guilty of even one, he could face a lengthy prison sentence.",
      "Rachel Maimin, a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, said a crucial piece of evidence \u2014 security video from a 2016 assault in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in which Combs, wearing only a white towel, could be seen beating and dragging Ventura \u2014 is going to stick in jurors\u2019 minds. On the stand, Ventura explained the incident was the result of her trying to leave a \u201cfreak off,\u201d which sometimes occurred in hotel suites around the world.",
      "Ventura \u201creally was able to tell a story from start to finish,\u201d Maimin said. \u201cShe was able to get into some of the more upsetting and disturbing pieces of the case, including the video of when Combs is beating her. It sets the stage for the rest of the case, where the prosecution is going to have to back up her testimony with all of their evidence.\u201d",
      "Ventura said it was under the direction of Combs that she would use drugs and have sex with male escorts, some found on Craigslist and paid upward of $6,000. Meanwhile, she said, Combs\u2019 security was around constantly to provide supplies, including the drugs, condoms and baby oil.",
      "Hanging over their relationship, she said, was the fear that Combs might blackmail her with recorded videos of the sex acts.",
      "She panicked, she said, when she was hosting an event in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 2014 and \u201csomeone I was working with said they saw a sexually explicit video of me.\u201d She quickly texted Combs, and told jurors that any leaked footage \u201cwould put my career in jeopardy\u201d and \u201ccould ruin everything I worked for.\u201d",
      "A year earlier, Ventura said, she was mortified when she saw Combs watching sexually explicit videos of her while they flew home on a commercial flight after having attended the Cannes Film Festival in France.",
      "\u201cHe pulled up \u2018freak off\u2019 videos on his laptop that I thought were deleted,\u201d Ventura testified. \u201cHe was showing them with other people around. I said, \u2018You are embarrassing me.\u2019 I was scared. I felt trapped. How do you get out of this situation?\u201d",
      "But to stave off his rage, she said, she then arranged a \u201cfreak off\u201d within hours of them landing, otherwise, \u201che said the videos would be released.\u201d",
      "Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor for the District of New Jersey who now practices criminal defense in New York, said Ventura\u2019s testimony has been key, because if jurors find her to be credible, she helps the prosecution\u2019s case that alleges sex trafficking did occur by means of \u201cforce, fraud or coercion.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf she was coerced by violence or threats of violence or blackmail materials into participating in the \u2018freak offs\u2019 over her objections, then the trial is over,\u201d Epner said. \u201cEverything else, which will go on for weeks, will not matter if the jury accepts that she was a credible witness, and they believe beyond a reasonable doubt that she was telling the truth when she said I didn\u2019t want to do these things, he knew I didn\u2019t want to do these things, and the only reason I did them was that I was afraid that he would beat me or that he would release the videos.\u201d",
      "He added that the way Combs\u2019 defense team painted him in their opening statements as a \u201cvery flawed individual,\u201d prone to violence and jealousy in his relationships, was striking.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the strangest trials that we\u2019ve seen because the prosecution and defense agree about so many of the facts,\u201d Epner said.",
      "During cross-examination, defense lawyer Anna Estevao got Ventura to speak about her love for Combs. Text messages were shown that suggest she knew she had the agency to walk away from him after they fought.",
      "Other messages also showed her appearing to be a willing participant in the sexual encounters: \u201cI\u2019m always ready to freak off,\u201d she wrote in 2009.",
      "\u201cFor the defense in the case, the key to the castle is persuading the jury that everything done here was consensual,\u201d said Mark Zauderer, a veteran trial and appellate lawyer in New York.",
      "Ventura also told Estevao that she settled her 2023 lawsuit in which she accused Combs of rape and abuse for $20 million, and initially her lawyer asked for $30 million as she had planned to write a book about her relationship with Combs. (Combs did not admit to \u00a0wrongdoing in settling the suit.)",
      "Zauderer said jurors may see that sum as either Ventura having \u201cvindicated herself\u201d after what she endured or \u201cthe defense is trying to cast it as that she was just looking for money.\u201d",
      "Maimin, the former federal prosecutor, said she still wants to see how prosecutors will further Ventura\u2019s testimony to show how Combs allegedly wielded his power and business pursuits \u2014 built around Bad Boy Records, which he founded in 1993 \u2014 as a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\u201d",
      "In their indictment, prosecutors say Combs \u201crelied on the employees, resources and influence of the multi-faceted business empire that he led and controlled \u2014 creating a criminal enterprise whose members and associates engaged in, and attempted to engage in, among other crimes, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that she got them all the way there,\u201d Maimin said of Ventura\u2019s testimony.",
      "\u201cAs a matter of law, it is enough just to have the testimony of one witness,\u201d Maimin said, \u201cbut given the complexity of the charges against him, including the racketeering conspiracy part, it would be very difficult to say you\u2019ve proven your case beyond a reasonable doubt without corroborating evidence.\u201d",
      "Neither the prosecution nor the defense has released full witness lists for the trial, which is expected to last at least eight weeks.",
      "Dawn Richard, a former member of the girl group Danity Kane, founded by Combs, took the stand briefly late Friday as the prosecution's next witness and is expected to continue testifying Monday. Richard filed a lawsuit last year against Combs, alleging he groped, assaulted and imprisoned her, and that she also saw him beating Ventura.",
      "A lawyer for Combs called the allegations \u201cmanufactured\u201d and said Richard was seeking \u201ca pay day.\u201d",
      "Other witnesses for the prosecution in the coming days may include Ventura's mother and a personal assistant of Combs.",
      "If you or someone you know is facing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence hotline for help at (800) 799-SAFE (7233), or go to\u00a0www.thehotline.org\u00a0for more. States often have domestic violence hotlines as well."

    "story": [
      "BALTIMORE \u2014 Sovereignty is not running out of that starting gate in the Preakness Stakes on Saturday, two weeks after winning the Kentucky Derby. Yet he is still the talk of Pimlico Race Course this week.",
      "That is because owners and trainer Bill Mott opted to skip the Preakness and with it a chance at the Triple Crown because of the short turnaround. It is the second time in four years the Derby winner is not taking part for that reason, and the fifth time in seven years overall, the Preakness goes on with no Triple Crown on the line.",
      "The trend has reignited the debate about what, if anything needs to change with the Triple Crown, with ideas ranging from putting more space between the Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes to adding incentives to run in all three to changing the order of the races altogether. Like starters in baseball throwing fewer pitchers, elite horses now typically get much longer time between races, and the situation has put tradition and modernization of the sport head to head.",
      "The two-week turnaround now feels to many around the sport like an antiquated schedule when longer gaps are now the norm with an eye toward horse wear and tear and better performance. Thoroughbreds used to be trained and run at a much quicker interval.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a question that has more than one side to it,\u201d said Steve Asmussen, who has won more races than any other trainer in North America. \u201cI love how hard it is to do, which makes it so special. And then would it be making it easier? Does it dilute it? That\u2019s a great question. And I think that it\u2019ll continue to be debated.\u201d",
      "The debate",
      "It was debated constantly during the 37-year drought between Triple Crown champions from Affirmed in 1978 until Bob Baffert-trained American Pharoah swept the three races in 2015. Baffert\u2019s Justify did it in 2018, too, and the chorus of voices calling for change was quieted.",
      "But then, for various reasons, there has been a Triple Crown chance in the Preakness only twice in the past seven years. The biggest draw of the middle leg \u2014 the anticipation for the possibility \u2014 went from being automatic to anything but.",
      "\u201cIt is troubling, and it has been troubling for several years,\u201d said Jerry Bailey, a Hall of Fame jockey who won each of the three races twice and is now an NBC Sports analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s completely flip-flopped from my generation when it was the rule that they would run back and the exception that they wouldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Many top trainers, including Baffert, D. Wayne Lukas, Mark Casse and Michael McCarthy have run a Derby horse in the Preakness or will this year. Others, like Mott, Chad Brown, Todd Pletcher and Brad Cox, are more reluctant to take the risk.",
      "\u201cWe need them in the game,\u201d said Casse, who won the Preakness in 2019 with War of Will and has Sandman this year. \u201cThis is important. We want the best horses for our sport.\u201d",
      "When Asmussen won a Triple Crown race for the first time with Curlin in the 2007 Preakness, it came after his horse finished third behind Street Sense and Hard Spun in the Kentucky Derby. Curlin, Street Sense and Hard Spun went 1-2-3 in the Preakness.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely running on a very different environment than we were then,\u201d Asmussen said. \u201cEvery horse is an individual, every year is different, and it\u2019s just very unique circumstances.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Many Americans are really stressed out right now. When we\u2019re emotionally overwhelmed, it probably feels natural to reach for a bag of chips. But we\u2019re probably wrong about how stress affects our eating habits, a psychologist says.",
      "What does that mean for our waistlines?",
      "Stress eating has long been associated with overeating, but that\u2019s a basic misunderstanding, said Dr. Kristin Javaras, an associate psychologist at McLean Hospital in Massachusetts and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Maybe we\u2019re not eating as much as we think.",
      "Much of what we know about stress eating is based on cultural cliches such as TV shows, movies or social media. Research on the behavior is mostly from surveys that rely on people remembering what they ate when going through tough times.",
      "The problem with those surveys, Jarvaras said, is people\u2019s perceptions often change when they\u2019re stressed, so it can be hard for anyone to accurately describe how their eating behavior was affected.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t actually eat more, but you think you eat more when you\u2019re stressed simply because you think the amount is larger,\u201d said Javaras, who recently presented some of her findings in a Brain & Behavior Research Foundation webinar.",
      "In other words, people remember the moment of a breakup and then eating ice cream.",
      "\u201cBut you don\u2019t think of all the other times you\u2019re actually stressed at work and ate less,\u201d she adds.",
      "Many people actually do eat less when they\u2019re acutely stressed, especially as the severity of the situation increases, in part because they may not have as much time to eat.",
      "Past research has shown approximately 40% people eat more when stressed, 40% eat less and 20% don\u2019t change their eating habits.",
      "When stress can lead to hunger",
      "When the body is under chronic stress, cortisol levels rise, which not only stimulates appetite but also can promote fat storage, particularly in the abdominal area, said Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist and obesity specialist who runs True You Weight Loss in Cary, North Carolina.",
      "\u201cIt also disrupts sleep, which further exacerbates cravings and metabolic dysfunction,\u201d he said.",
      "At that point, people often turn to comfort foods that are high in fat and sugar, which triggers the pleasure center of our brain to release dopamine, providing a temporary sense of relief, McGowan said. That relief is short-lived, often followed by guilt or regret.",
      "And comfort food may not actually provide as much comfort as you think.",
      "A prior study concluded comfort food does not on average reduce stress, finding no difference in healthy women participants when they replaced unhealthy comfort foods with fruits and vegetables.",
      "How to avoid overeating and counteract cravings",
      "\u201cThe more we eat in response to emotion, the stronger the connection between that emotion and the craved food \u2014 making our stress eating response more ingrained over time,\u201d said Rachel Gargano, the chief registered dietitian at a private practice.",
      "\u201cCravings usually last about 20 to 30 minutes, so if you can get through these initial intense, often overwhelming feelings, they usually begin to subside and become more manageable,\u201d she said.",
      "Each person has specific triggers, like being alone at home and seeing or smelling favorite foods that may start the process of overeating, Gargano said.",
      "She recommends keeping a journal to document when cravings start, then categorizing them as physical hunger or emotional hunger, depending on the situation.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s been longer than three or four hours since your last meal, then it\u2019s possible that your body needs a quality, balanced snack or meal,\u201d she said.",
      "If you realize you\u2019re not hungry and it\u2019s just \u201cemotional hunger,\u201d it\u2019s time to try distraction.",
      "\u201cReplacing stress eating with even short bursts of physical activity can be a powerful shift toward long-term well-being,\u201d McGowan adds.",
      "Exercise helps regulate the body\u2019s stress response, lowers baseline cortisol levels, boosts mood, improves sleep quality and supports both physical and metabolic health, he adds.",
      "Alternative options to distract yourself include reading a chapter of your favorite book, going for a quick walk, sitting outside or doing 15 minutes of yoga.",
      "Gargano encourages developing an \u201canti-cravings tool kit,\u201d which can include:",
      "Not skipping regular meals.Getting enough fiber in the diet. Women need about 25 grams daily and men need 35 grams.Getting enough protein each day. (About 30 to 40 grams per meal.)Drinking plenty of fluids. If you aim for about half your weight in ounces per day and add more if it\u2019s hot out or if you\u2019re exercising more than an hour, your body won\u2019t confuse thirst for hunger.Get at least seven hours of sleep, although eight is optimal.",

      "\u201cThe more you\u2019re able to get through a craving without giving in, the more you\u2019re retraining your brain to not need food as a Band-Aid,\u201d Gargano said.",
      "Dr. Joanna Steinglass, director of research at the Center for Eating Disorders at NewYork-Presbyterian, said surveys are still helpful for researchers to understand how general increases in stress contribute to more challenges with eating, including whether they lead to any increases in eating disorders.",
      "Finally, if you stress eat once in a blue moon, don\u2019t worry about it, Javaras said.",
      "\u201cI always tell people, don\u2019t stress yourself out further by being like, \u2018Oh, my goodness, I was stressed one day and I ate a little more,\u2019\u201d Javaras said."

      "In autism circles and beyond, Temple Grandin\u2019s story is well known. Grandin, who is autistic, is a pioneer who helped transform the world\u2019s understanding of those who think differently \u2014 in pictures instead of words.",
      "Today, at 77, Grandin holds a Ph.D., is a professor of animal science at Colorado State University and has authored multiple New York Times bestselling books. She tours the world to speak on autism and advocates for people on the spectrum, plus gives agricultural talks. Her story was told in the HBO movie \u201cTemple Grandin\u201d starring Claire Danes.",
      "But there was just as easily a chance that none of this could have happened. There was a time when doctors had doubts about her capacity to learn.",
      "Born in the late 1940s, Grandin was slow to speak as a child. She erupted into tantrums. She thought grown-ups had their own language; it sounded like gibberish to her.",
      "One doctor concluded that Grandin had brain damage. In that era, Grandin said, it was typical for children displaying traits like hers to be deemed \u201cmentally retarded\u201d and institutionalized. Her mother rejected that thinking and took her to a neurologist, who  recommended speech therapy. In time, Grandin\u2019s speech developed and she forged a path, which included a trip to her aunt\u2019s farm. That opened her world.",
      "Her endless curiosity and connection with animals led her to a career creating more humane conditions for livestock, including in slaughterhouses, where her contributions helped revolutionize aspects of the cattle industry."

      "A Russian drone struck a passenger bus in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern Sumy region on Saturday, killing nine people and injuring four others, Ukrainian officials said. The attack came just hours after Moscow and Kyiv held their\u00a0first direct peace talks in years which failed to yield a ceasefire.",

      "\u201cThis is another war crime by Russia \u2014 a deliberate strike on civilian transport that posed no threat,\u201d the Sumy regional administration said in a post on the Telegram messaging app.",
      "Russian and Ukrainian officials met in Turkey on Friday in an attempt to reach a temporary ceasefire, but the talks ended after less than two hours without a breakthrough. It was the first face-to-face dialogue between the two sides since the early weeks of\u00a0Moscow\u2019s February 2022 full-scale invasion\u00a0of Ukraine.",
      "And while both sides agreed on a large prisoner swap, they clearly remained far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting.",
      "One such condition for Ukraine, backed by its Western allies, is a temporary ceasefire as a first step toward a peaceful settlement. The Kremlin has pushed back against such a truce, which remains elusive.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he discussed the talks with U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of France, Germany, the U.K. and Poland. In a post on X from\u00a0a European leadership meeting in Albania, he urged \u201ctough sanctions\u201d against Moscow if it rejects \u201ca full and unconditional ceasefire and an end to killings.\u201d",
      "In Istanbul, Kyiv and Moscow agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, according to the heads of both delegations, in what would be their\u00a0biggest such swap.",
      "Both sides also discussed a ceasefire and a meeting between their heads of state, according to chief Ukrainian delegate, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov.",
      "Medinsky, an aide to President Vladimir Putin, said both sides agreed to provide each other with detailed ceasefire proposals, with Ukraine requesting the heads of state meeting, which Russia took under consideration."

    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers have introduced legislation over the last week that could give the federal government a tighter grasp on some tech platforms, while easing up government scrutiny on artificial intelligence.",
      "The Republican-led House Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s budget reconciliation bill was introduced Tuesday and would give the federal government the ability to update IT systems as well as use AI systems at the Commerce Department. The bill would also put a pause on states\u2019 ability to enforce AI regulations for the next decade to allow the American AI market to grow and be studied.",
      "While some politicians have been skeptical and critical of AI, the Trump administration has been vocal about seeking to encourage the growth of the AI industry in the U.S. with few guardrails.",
      "On Friday, to cap off  President Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East trip, the administration announced a deal with the United Arab Emirates to build a massive data center in the country that will serve American tech companies.",
      "While Republicans have worked to protect AI, lawmakers have also introduced bills that would tighten regulations on some tech companies.",
      "Two of the bills could make rules for tech platforms and their users more restrictive with the intent of making children safer online.",
      "On May 8, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA), which would update \u201cthe legal definition of obscenity for the internet age,\u201d Lee said in a statement.",
      "IODA was first introduced in 2022, and again in 2024, but failed to become law.",
      "IODA would change the definition of obscenity, which applies a three-pronged test to content, to anything that \u201cappeals to the prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion,\u201d and \u201cdepicts, describes or represents actual or simulated sexual acts with the objective intent to arouse, titillate, or gratify the sexual desires of a person.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s currently illegal to transmit obscene content via telecommunications if it\u2019s intended as harassment or abuse. The bill would remove the requirement for that \u201cintent,\u201d meaning it could criminalize any content deemed obscene that is transmitted via telecommunications systems.",
      "Despite the bill lacking bipartisan support or additional recorded co-sponsors, it has gained attention online and in the media for language that could make pornography something that can be prosecuted under laws pertaining to obscenity. However, proponents of the law hope it will prevent children from viewing lewd and obscene content.",
      "Currently, social media platforms are granted a \u201cgood faith\u201d immunity under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which means they can\u2019t be held legally liable for most content posted on their sites, aside from a few exceptions. Although a news release from Lee about IODA didn\u2019t specify who would be held legally responsible for newly obscene content, it said the bill is meant to create a uniform definition of obscenity, so it would be easier to identify and prosecute obscene content.",
      "\u201cObscenity isn\u2019t protected by the First Amendment, but hazy and unenforceable legal definitions have allowed extreme pornography to saturate American society and reach countless children,\u201d\u00a0Lee said in the statement. \u201cOur bill updates the legal definition of obscenity for the internet age so this content can be taken down and its peddlers prosecuted.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, the bi-partisan Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which would hold websites accountable if they host content that is harmful to children, was reintroduced in the Senate.",
      "KOSA was first introduced in 2022 by Sens. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., but failed to make it out of the chamber. During the 2023-2024 congressional term, KOSA was introduced again with amendments to address concerns over the vague wording in the bill. In July, KOSA passed in the Senate, but by the end of 2024, it had failed to advance in the House.",
      "The latest version of KOSA states that the bill would require social media platforms to \u201cremove addictive product features,\u201d give parents more control and oversight of their kids\u2019 social media, create a duty for platforms to mitigate content focused on topics like suicide and disordered eating, and require transparency from social media platforms to share the steps they\u2019re taking to protect children.",
      "Those who are in favor of the bill say it would hold platforms legally accountable if they host harmful content that minors should not view. Opponents said it could inadvertently affect sites that host LGBTQ content. They\u2019re also concerned it could lead to more censorship online.",
      "\u201cSponsors are claiming\u2014again\u2014that the latest version won\u2019t censor online content. It isn\u2019t true. This bill still sets up a censorship regime disguised as a \u2018duty of care,\u2019 and it will do what previous versions threatened: suppress lawful, important speech online, especially for young people,\u201d Joe Mullin, senior policy analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said in a statement.",
      "However, updates made to the bill help to make its reach less broad and remove attorneys\u2019 general ability to prosecute platforms. It also makes more precise the harm it expects social media and other websites to protect against. This has led to some opponents of the bill changing their stance.",
      "The bill was reintroduced with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., signing on. Last year, the bill passed in the Senate, 91-3,\u00a0but died in the House. The current bill has been backed by Apple and Republican figures including Trump and Elon Musk.",
      "In a statement, Apple\u2019s senior director of government affairs for the Americas, Timothy Powderly, said the company was happy to offer its support for the bill, adding that everyone has a role to play in keeping children safe online. He also acknowledged the concerns around KOSA and praised the senators for working to improve the bill.",
      "\u201cAs longtime advocates of privacy as a fundamental right, we believe these improvements are important, and hopefully the first steps towards comprehensive privacy legislation that ensures everyone\u2019s right to privacy online,\u201d Powderly said.",
      "Critics have pushed back on both bills as some say they could result in overly policed speech online.",
      "Matt Navarra, a social media consultant and analyst who has worked with companies like Google and the U.S. and U.K. governments, said the bills \u2014 particularly KOSA \u2014 could have significant ramifications for social media platforms and the way people use them. Navarra said KOSA would force platforms to \u201crethink recommendation engines, notifications, data tracking works for minors.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor engagement-driven platforms like TikTok or Instagram, that\u2019s a radical shift \u2014 it\u2019s not just about what\u2019s allowed, it\u2019s about how addictive and immersive experiences get redesigned or dismantled,\u201d he said. \u201cSo KOSA is less about content policing and more about an algorithmic detox especially for teens.\u201d",
      "Adults would likely also see a major change in what is accessible online if IODA becomes law.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the things that people are concerned about with the bill, particularly around censorship, KOSA does sort of introduce a duty of care that sounds good in theory but in practice could push platforms into over-moderating or flat-out removing content just to avoid the risk,\u201d Navarra said. \u201cAnd the obscenity bill wraps this up even more.\u201d"

      "He even visited a mosque, remarking on the pride for he felt for \u201cmy friends\u201d as he took in its beauty. \u201cThis is an incredible culture,\u201d Trump said.",
      "But one omission on the trip became more glaring with each stop:\u00a0Israel.",
      "Tensions between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0were already bubbling up\u00a0before the president spent the week visiting three of America\u2019s key Arab allies: Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "By the end of the trip on Friday, Trump seemed to put further strain on the relationship. He had spent the past few days meeting with Syria\u2019s new leader \u2014 a former al Qaeda leader the U.S. had put a $10 million bounty on \u2014 and announced he was lifting sanctions on the country in a move Israel opposed but one that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia\u00a0had urged the president to take.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Trump told reporters he had discussed the sanctions decision with Netanyahu, framing it as widely supported by others.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s been very popular, certainly in the Middle East,\u201d Trump said. He also cited conversations with bin Salman and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan who, he claimed, saw the move as critical to its chance of survival as a country.",
      "A day after promising to lift the sanctions, Trump praised Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa as a \u201cyoung, attractive guy \u2014 tough guy,\u201d and urged the former rebel fighter to join the Abraham Accords \u2014 the president\u2019s signature foreign policy achievement from his first term that normalized ties between Israel and several Arab states.",
      "During the trip, Trump also leaned into the notion of a deal with Iran being within striking distance, without putting forward any details to assuage some of Israel\u2019s concerns. And on the eve of the president\u2019s trip, his administration announced it had cut a unilateral deal with Hamas, the U.S.-designated terrorist organization that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, to secure the release of the last living American hostage in Gaza.",
      "\u201cHopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict,\u201d Trump said of the release of Edan Alexander. He added on Friday that \u201cwe\u2019re going to find out pretty soon\u201d if Israel is able to\u00a0free the nearly two dozen hostages believed to be alive in\u00a0Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu, meanwhile, bombed Gaza during Trump\u2019s trip to the region,\u00a0killing more than 100 people in the last 24 hours, according to local health authorities.",
      "Asked about Israel\u2019s plans for expanding the war in Gaza, as he pushes for a ceasefire, Trump struck a measured tone.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of good things are going to happen over the next month, and we\u2019re going to see.\u00a0We have to help also out the Palestinians,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know, a lot of people are starving on Gaza, so we have to look at both sides.\u201d",
      "Even so, Israel is increasingly anxious about Trump striking a quick nuclear deal with Iran and Arab leaders shaping the president\u2019s thinking, one person familiar with the dynamic between Trump and Netanyahu said.",
      "\u201cThe trip hasn\u2019t so much put distance between Trump and Netanyahu as it has exposed it,\u201d this person said.",
      "Trump, speaking to reporters, dismissed the notion that his trip marginalized\u00a0America\u2019s closest ally in the region. He said on Wednesday that the U.S. having a strong relationship with Arab leaders is \u201cvery good for Israel.\u201d",
      "Across four breakneck days of deal-making, Arab leaders showed their ability to provide Trump with tangible economic wins he can showcase overseas as benefiting Americans back home, as well as the kind of warm welcome that resonates with the president.",
      "\u201cThe job they\u2019ve done in a fairly short period of time is just outstanding. They\u2019re great people. Great leaders. Three great leaders,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday as he headed back to Washington, D.C. \u201cAnd the respect shown to our country was incredible. Because nobody is treated like that.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s relationship with Netanyahu, by contrast, is largely focused on national security concerns, from Iran to the war in Gaza to the shifting dynamics in Syria.",
      "So far, Israel has largely kept those concerns behind the scenes \u2014 which has not been the case with previous presidents, specifically Barack Obama and Joe Biden,\u00a0even as they vowed to protect America\u2019s \u201cunbreakable bond\u201d with Israel. And the U.S. continues to strongly support Israel, with Trump sending military equipment the Biden administration had paused.",
      "In a statement, National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt described Trump as Israel\u2019s staunchest ally in its history.",
      "\u201cIsrael has had no better friend in its history than President Trump,\u201d Hewitt said. \u201cWe continue to work closely with our ally Israel to ensure remaining hostages in Gaza are freed, Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, and to strengthen regional security in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Hewitt added, \u201cAs he has repeatedly stated in his first and second terms, the President is committed to ensuring Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "As for where the dynamic between Trump and Netanyahu goes\u00a0next, one ally of the president made the case that deepening ties with Arab leaders will ultimately protect Israel because of its close relationship with the U.S. At the same time, the ally noted Trump\u2019s characteristic unpredictability, saying, \u201cTrump does what Trump does.\u201d"

You did not break her spirit, nor her smile, that lights up every room. You did not break the souls of a mother who gives the best hugs and plays the silliest games with our little girls. You did not break the woman who has made me a better man.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s very, very creepy. It\u2019s based on sort of a sub Reddit thread. It\u2019s like a grassroots cult legend,\u201d he said of the new movie.",

      "Blake Shelton just dropped his 13th studio album, \u201cFor Recreational Use Only,\u201d a project he told TODAY.com was four years in the making. On Tuesday, he hit the plaza for TODAY\u2019s Citi Concert Series and later told us about how this album came together.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really think of the album as, like, inspired by anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always kind of just approached making an album \u2014 just find the best songs I can possibly get my hands on, you know? I never set out with a direction.\u201d",

      "At the same time, Shelton noted that he aims to remain true to himself as an artist through the process.",
      "\u201cWho I am as a country artist, I think I lean more traditional, probably, but I\u2019m always trying to find something new, push the boundaries a little bit,\u201d he said.",
      "Shelton joked that he\u2019s \u201cway behind when you listen to the radio,\u201d but he\u2019s still always searching for \u201cwhat the next thing is.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think \u2018Texas\u2019 is a good example of that, way different than anything I\u2019ve done before,\u201d he said of his new single.",

      "Annie Murphy, who won an Emmy Award for her role as Alexis on the beloved sitcom \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d weighed in on fans never-ending question: Will there be a reboot?",
      "\u201cListen, I want that as badly as other people seem to. I\u2019m not going to stop trying to manifest that,\u201d she told TODAY.com on Tuesday.",
      "Whether another version of \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d ever comes to fruition, Murphy said much of the cast has reunions of their own.",
      "\u201cWe all like try to keep in touch as much as we can,\u201d Murphy said, acknowledging their \u201cbeyond busy\u201d schedules. \u201cBecause it was such a special show for all of us. And we all love each other so much.\u201d",
      "Though the comedy, which ran for six seasons, wrapped five years ago, Murphy said she\u2019s still stopped on the street for one of her character\u2019s iconic lines. When Alexis would bicker with her brother (Dan Levy), she was known to memorably yell, \u201cEw, David!\u201d",
      "Murphy only actually said the line three times in the entire series, but her Valley Girl accent was so memorable that any \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d fan would recognize the phrase.",
      "When fans do remember the line, Murphy said it\u2019s sometimes \u201cscreamed in my face,\u201d while others firmly command the actor, \u201c\u2018Do it now.\u2019\u201d But, she told TODAY.com, she found a way out.",
      "\u201cNow I often just start going, like, \u2018No, how about you do it? And I\u2019m right here with you. I\u2019m just your support animal, and you can go for it.\u2019 And people tend to,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s like a way out. I\u2019ve planted a little loop for myself.\u201d",
      "Now, Murphy stars in Season 2 of the Hulu drama \u201cNine Perfect Strangers\u201d as Imogen, a character far different from Alexis. But would the two ever be friends?",
      "\u201cThat is a very good question. No, I think Imogen would write Alexis off as a ditz \u2014 even though Alexis is not a ditz,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut I think Imogen is a very judgy little minx, and I think she would make a pretty hard judgment and judge a book by its cover and never look back.\u201d"

    "summary": "Benito Skinner discusses what parts of \"Overcompensating\" are based on his own life and the significance of all those pop culture references and hit soundtrack.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for Season 1 of \u201cOvercompensating.\u201d",
      "The opening scene of \u201cOvercompensating\u201d on Prime Video is similar to an experience its star, Benito Skinner, had during one of his first sleepover parties with friends \u2014 just a bit more absurd.",
      "The scene shows a young Skinner rewinding a very specific portion  of the 1997 film \u201cGeorge of the Jungle,\u201d starring Brendan Fraser, until one of his friends asks if they can do something else.",
      "Skinner changes the channel and lands on the beginning of the music video for Britney Spears\u2019 hit 2000 song, \u201cLucky.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think all these moments were kind of pivotal in my journey,\u201d Skinner tells TODAY.com. \u201cLike, \u2018Lucky\u2019 was the song that I think changed my life in so many ways. As a kid, I was like, \u2018Oh, I love Britney in a different way than everyone around me. I\u2019m relating to this song in ways that no one else knows.\u2019\u201d",
      "The pop culture references don\u2019t stop coming in the first season of Skinner\u2019s Prime Video series, which follows a first-year college student, Benny, as he tries to hide his sexuality from those around him and present as a straight man who loves football and girls.",
      "Over the course of \u201cOvercompensating's\u201d eight episodes, Charli XCX performs three pre-\u201cBrat\u201d hits, Megan Fox is featured prominently on a poster in Benny\u2019s dorm room, and cameos include Bowen Yang, Matt Rogers, Kaia Gerber and more. Skinner also brought in TikTok stars like Nadia Alexeev to dance during a frat party scene.",
      "\u201cThat had to be done,\u201d Skinner says. \u201cDrunk girl dancing? Nadia.\u201d",
      "The premise of \u201cOvercompensating\u201d comes from Skinner\u2019s own experiences, he says, but he felt he needed to amp up certain dramatic elements for the show.",
      "\u201cI feel like I really based it on feelings and experiences and relationships, so like the coming out things were as honest and true as we could go,\u201d Skinner says. \u201cThose feel like I did experience pretty much everything in the show.\u201d",
      "He adds that the relationship between his character Benny and his best friend, Carmen, played by Wally Baram, represents the friendships he\u2019s had with women throughout his life.",
      "\u201cThe relationship between Benny and Carmen is something that I felt with women my whole life, of them always being protectors for me,\u201d Skinner says. \u201cSo that feels very real.\u201d",
      "Skinner, who rose to stardom through his comedy and celebrity impressions on social media, says that while certain aspects of the show are true to his real-life experiences, it was important to him and showrunner Scott King to fill the cast with people that will surprise viewers.",
      "\u201cMaybe you think you know them in the pilot, but you don\u2019t,\u201d Skinner explains. \u201cAt a certain point, your life starts to feel kind of like boring and not that interesting \u2014 like, you have to make a TV show, you need stakes.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo yeah, at a certain point, I was kind of like, \u2018OK, I feel like my coming out story and these relationships are in there,'\u201d he continues. \u201cBut now, let\u2019s go.\u201d",
      "King tells TODAY.com that when writing the script with Skinner, they weren\u2019t focusing on what situations would be the most dramatic or the most funny.",
      "\u201cWe just wanted it to be real,\u201d King says. \u201cAnd even in the most heightened moments we wanted to play it real.\u201d",
      "King adds that while they were discussing their shared college experiences, he was surprised by how similar they were.",
      "\u201cAs someone who graduated before Benny was even born, he and I, when we were talking about college, even though it was such different times, so different for gay men at those times, too, there was such a universality to our experiences,\u201d King says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s where we were able to capture the comedy and the real.\u201d",
      "About those needle drops...",
      "Music plays a central role in the show, Skinner says, with tracks coming in from Lorde, Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj.",
      "During a recent visit to Northwestern University, Skinner says he went to a sorority house, and some of the members asked about his show and its soundtrack.",
      "\u201cI said a few (songs) from the show, and they were like, \u2018Totally,\u2019\u201d Skinner recalls. \"And I was like, \u2018Wait. Oh, so it\u2019s like, a college bubble, like nothing has changed.\u2019 I love that.\u201d",
      "Charli XCX notably plays herself in the show and serves as an executive producer on the series.",
      "\u201cI always knew that she had to be the college concert. Because when I was in college, I went to the \u2018Sucker\u2019 tour alone, because I didn\u2019t want anyone to know, because that\u2019s totally gay,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I knew it had to be her.\u201d",
      "When working on Charli XCX's role in the script, Skinner says he wanted to give her more than just a performance.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we just wanted to slot her in \u2014 this is a comedy,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, we want people to die and be surprised and also, maybe if we can, weave in some kind of cathartic moment for musicians who are singing their life\u2019s work to college kids who are on molly. Like, let\u2019s do this.\u201d",
      "In the scene, Charli XCX performs three of her older hits, \"Boom Clap,\" \"Boys\" and \"I Love It,\" while Benny starts to feel ill from a hazing incident in which he had to swallow several live beta fish. His bestie Carmen was forced to eat extremely cheesy Italian food (even though she's lactose intolerant), and the pair try to make it through the concert. But they both end up in bathroom stalls next to each other getting extremely sick during her performance.",
      "The juxtaposition of singing your life's work in front of hundreds of inebriated college students was a moment Charli XCX was plenty familiar with, Skinner says.",
      "\u201cWhen I sent it to her, she was like, 'I think I have said some of these things about playing \"Boom Clap\" at a college.' Like, \u2018Why are you guys making me do this 100 times a year?\u2019\u201d he recalls Charli XCX saying.",
      "\u201cI mean it was such a no brainer that she was genius and was gonna kill it, so we had to give her as much as we could,\" Skinner adds. \"And she did it in between \u2018Sweat\u2019 tour shows.\u201d",
      "Another music moment in \"Overcompensating\" that was inspired by Skinner's own life involves Lady Gaga\u2019s song, \u201cThe Edge of Glory.\u201d After having a strange experience at his school's secret society, Benny starts to have a panic attack and decides to go up to an openly gay student and ask him to hang out.",
      "While Benny's talking with the student, the opening notes of \"The Edge of Glory\" begin to play, a nod to what the track feels like in Skinner's own life.",
      "\u201cLike leaving high school, rolling up the windows and blasting that and sobbing on the way home \u2014 like, that\u2019s me,\u201d Skinner says of his experience with the song.",
      "\u201cI think every song in it, it\u2019s why we named the episodes after these songs,\" he adds. \"I feel like, in college, music is currency.\u201d",
      "\"Overcompensating\" is now streaming on Prime Video."

    "story": [
      "Warning: This article contains spoilers for \u201cFinal Destination Bloodlines.\u201d",
      "The most basic rule of any \"Final Destination\" movie is that, ultimately, no one survives \u2014\u00a0except for one character: The endlessly intriguing mortician William J. Bludworth, played by horror legend Tony Todd.",
      "So when Todd, of \"Candyman\" fame, passed away last November at 69, it was only fitting that this death-obsessed series gave him a sendoff as intriguing and memorable as the character he played.",
      "Todd's role as Bludworth in \"Final Destination Bloodlines,\" released May 16, was one of his final on-screen appearances, filmed just months before he passed away, directors Adam Stein and Zach Lipovsky tell TODAY.com.",
      "\"What he developed with Bludworth is really special because it\u2019s the only piece of the franchise that continues,\" Lipovsky says, adding that he brought a degree of \"charm and mystery\" to the role that was \"delightful\" and inspired countless fan theories.",
      "The directors knew he was ill when they were crafting the story and with filming with him, Lipovsky explains.",
      "\"So we knew it was going to be his last 'Final Destination' movie and, potentially, his last film ever.\"",
      "They took that responsibility seriously and worked with Todd to create a backstory for his character that would help answer some lingering questions.",
      "But they also wanted to \"give him an opportunity to say goodbye to the character, to the audience and all the people that love everything that he's been doing,\" Lipovsky says.",
      "In the scene, Bludworth reveals that he's sick and knows his own time is limited. There are ways to cheat death, he tells the characters, but things are likely to get \"messy.\"",
      "Sooner or later, he says, death is coming for all of us. \"I intend to enjoy the time I have left,\" he tells them, \"and I suggest you do the same.\" He continues, \"Life is precious. Enjoy every single second. You never know when.\"",
      "The fact that Todd knew he was likely facing his final months in real life \"gave that scene real authenticity,\" says longtime \u201cFinal Destination\u201d producer Craig Perry, adding that it \"translated into one of the most poignant moments in the entire franchise.\"",
      "And Todd's contribution to the series was \"enormous,\" Perry tells TODAY.com. When initially casting the for the role, which first appeared in the original \"Final Destination\" in 2000, \"we wanted somebody who always looked like he had a secret that he wasn't telling, a sort of enigma behind his eyes,\" Perry says.",
      "In Todd, they found all that and more.",
      "\"We really felt that Tony had all of that gravitas and mystery in his very DNA,\" Perry says. \"His presence brought a sense of foreboding medicine mystery, and beyond that, he was able to have a playfulness that made the character fun to watch.\"",
      "Todd elevated basic exposition \u2014 and transcended typical \"magical Negro\" horror tropes. In fact, Stein says, part of their direction with the character was \u201cwanting to kind of explode that trope and show that, no, Bludworth was a real person.\u201d",
      "In the previous movies, Bludworth has been a \"mysterious mentor figure, so (Todd) was very excited to show how he knows so much about death \u2014\u00a0as a real person,\" Stein explains. \"It's not because he's an angel or death itself,\" he continues, \"it's because he had this experience in his life.\"",
      "Taking the idea even further, Bludworth tells this latest crop of young people trying to deceive death that they aren't the first who have come to him for advice \u2014\u00a0and he's done with all that.",
      "\"That was to comment on even how cinema has changed a bit,\" Stein says. \"Like, we're not doing that anymore.\"",
      "While filming, Todd was \"just so incredibly joyful,\" Stein recalls. He was physically weak, but \"so excited,\" he says. Todd especially wanted to take photos with the actors who play Bludworth's mother and child self, Stein says, as his characters in other films often didn't get such fleshed-out backstories.",
      "And when it came time to perform his final speech, the directors told him to \"throw the script away for a moment and just speak from the heart,\" Lipovsky says. \"It was a unique opportunity for him to speak in character to what's happening in the story, but on a secondary level, be speaking to the audience about himself.\"",
      "The take in the film is the one Todd improvised.",
      "\"Even the way that he says 'Good luck' and winks at the camera as he walks out and starts whistling is sort of his own gift of talking about heavy things, but with a dark and delightful charm,\" Lipovsky says. \"The whole cast and crew couldn't believe that he had given us that.\""

    "story": [
      "A day after Justin Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, alleged that Blake Lively \u201cdemanded\u201d Taylor Swift release a statement supporting her, Judge Lewis J. Liman has had the accusations stricken from the case.",
      "On Thursday, May 15, Judge Liman \u2014 who is presiding over the trial between the two \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d stars set for\u00a0March 9, 2026, in New York \u2014 described Freedman's letter as \"improper\" and said it \"must be stricken,\" in a court ruling obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "\"It is irrelevant to any issue before this Court and does not request any action from this Court,\" Judge Liman wrote.",
      "He continued, \"The sole purpose of the Letter is to 'promote public scandal' by advancing inflammatory accusations, on information and belief, against Lively and her counsel. It transparently invites a press uproar by suggesting that Lively and her counsel attempted to 'extort' a well-known celebrity.\"",
      "At the end of Judge Liman's statement, he added, \"Counsel is advised that future misuse of the Court\u2019s docket may be met with sanctions.\"",
      "Lively's spokesperson sent a statement to TODAY.com reacting to Judge Liman granting the request of the Lively's legal team to remove Freedman's allegations from the record.",
      "\u201cIt took the court less than 24 hours to see through Mr. Freedman\u2019s irrelevant, improper and inflammatory accusations, strike them, remove them from the court and warn Mr. Freedman that further misconduct may be met with sanctions,\u201d Lively's spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Freedman for a comment.",
      "Liman's decision regarding Freedman's accusations is the latest development involving\u00a0the legal battle between the two former co-stars.\u00a0Following Swift\u2019s spokesperson\u00a0addressing the pop star reportedly being subpoenaed\u00a0in Lively and Baldoni\u2019s legal back-and-forth, Freedman filed\u00a0a letter\u00a0with\u00a0Judge Liman on May 14, in which the attorney wrote that the purpose of the subpoena was to access discovery regarding \u201cwitness tampering and evidence spoliation.\u201d",
      "He said that the counsel for Wayfarer Parties, which includes Baldoni, received \u201cinformation from a source who is highly likely to have reliable information\u201d alleging that Lively asked Swift to delete their text messages. Freedman then claimed that Michael Gottlieb, Lively\u2019s lawyer, contacted Swift\u2019s attorney and \u201cdemanded that Ms. Swift release a statement of support for Ms. Lively, intimating that, if Ms. Swift refused to do so, private text messages of a personal nature in Ms. Lively\u2019s possession would be released.\u201d",
      "Freedman further described the alleged demands as \u201cinappropriate and apparently extortionate threats\u201d and said a representative for Swift responded to them in \u201cat least one written communication\u201d sent to Gottlieb.",
      "\u201cIt is those communications that the Wayfarer Parties seek to obtain by way of subpoena, as they would evidence an attempt to intimidate and coerce a percipient witness in this litigation,\u201d Baldoni\u2019s lawyer continued.",
      "TODAY.com obtained a statement from Gottlieb regarding Freedman\u2019s letter to the judge, in which he called the accusations \u201ccategorically false.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt should be unnecessary to respond to anonymously sourced, baseless, allegations recklessly leveled without any supporting evidence. It is worth stating for the record, however, that each of the allegations in the Freedman Letter is unequivocally and demonstrably false. As a legal matter, the Freedman Letter is improper. It does not seek any form of relief, is irrelevant to any motion currently pending before the Court, and serves no legitimate purpose. It is not useful to the Court in any respect,\u201d Lively's lawyers wrote.",
      "They also said that Freedman\u2019s letter appeared intended to \u201claunder scandalous and defamatory allegations about Ms. Lively and opposing counsel into the press.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Swift\u2019s rep for a comment, as well.",
      "Swift\u2019s spokesperson previously issued a statement regarding the subpoena, asserting that the musician has no connection to the movie adaptation besides her song \u201cMy Tears Ricochet\u201d being featured on the soundtrack. Her rep said that the witness summons was a way to generate \u201ctabloid clickbait.\u201d",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even see \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 until weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024 headlining the biggest tour in history,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Her rep continued, \u201cThe connection Taylor had to this film was permitting the use of one song, \u2018My Tears Ricochet.\u2019 Given that her involvement was licensing a song for the film, which 19 other artists also did, this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift\u2019s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.\u201d",
      "Lively and Baldoni\u2019s legal case began on Dec. 20 when Lively filed an 80-page sexual harassment complaint alleging that Baldoni created a hostile workplace environment on the set of \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d and that he later launched a smear campaign to \u201cdestroy\u201d her reputation. She also alleged that he crossed the line while they filmed intimate scenes and that he harassed her on set.",
      "Freedman reacted to the accusations in a statement to TODAY.com at the time, calling them \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively then filed a federal lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company, Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, crisis communications representative Melissa Nathan and publicist Jennifer Abel on Dec. 31. Her attorney alleged there was a \u201cretaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns.\u201d",
      "Following an article about Lively\u2019s accusations, Baldoni sued The New York Times for libel. He also filed a lawsuit against Lively, her husband, Ryan Reynolds, Lively\u2019s rep Leslie Sloane and Sloane\u2019s PR firm on Jan. 16, accusing them of defamation and disregarding contractual claims.",
      "Swift became linked to the case when Baldoni filed his suit, which included alleged text messages exchanged between him and Lively. In the documents, a \u201cTaylor\u201d is referenced and described as a \u201cmegacelebrity friend.\u201d",
      "Baldoni\u2019s team confirmed to NBC News at the time that the \u201cTaylor\u201d in the suit was the pop singer, who has been friends with Lively for years.",
      "According to NBC News, one alleged text from Lively read, \u201cIf you ever get around to watching Game of Thrones, you\u2019ll appreciate that I\u2019m Khaleesi, and like her, I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually better. Because my dragons also protect those I fight for. So really we all benefit from those gorgeous monsters of mine. You will too, I can promise you.\u201d"

      "Although she was still adamant that separation was best to help \u201cfigure out what\u2019s best for our relationship,\u201d Jen Affleck allowed her husband to move back in. However, she made him promise not to talk over her.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t know whether to have a good time right now because I know that this is making Zac uncomfortable and because of how both Demi and Jessi treated my relationship prior to this. It makes me question their intentions,\u201d Jen Affleck said in a confessional interview.",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how bad this would upset Zac. I just wanted to be the fun friend who just said, 'Yeah, and that it would be so awesome.' But I didn\u2019t really question their intentions behind it and I also didn\u2019t ask myself how I felt about it,\u201d she said in a confessional interview.",
      "The #MomTok star also said her husband was \u201cupset\u201d and \u201cjumping to conclusions\u201d after the party. She called the experience \u201ctriggering.\u201d",

      "\u201cI am frustrated because I feel like I\u2019m having to stick up and defend our family and it\u2019s making me look like the bad guy when these are your friends,\u201d he said. \u201cIf my friends were doing these kinds of things to us, I would confront them or I would drop them.\u201d",

    "summary": "Oliver Stark unpacks the ending of \"9-1-1\" Season 8, including if Buck is moving or leaving the 118.",
    "story": [
      "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Warning: This article contains spoilers from the \"9-1-1\" Season Eight finale, \"Seismic Shifts.\"\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8",
      "In typical \"9-1-1\" fashion, Season Eight ended with a bang \u2014 well, several.",
      "After starting the season with a bee-nado (a tornado composed of bees, for anyone wondering), the Season Eight finale saw the 118 race to a more familiar scene: an infrastructure collapse.",
      "The 118, still reeling without its captain, splits off in pairs at the scene of the high-rise building collapse, with Henrietta \"Hen\" Wilson (Aisha Hinds) and Howard \u201cChimney\u201d Han (Kenneth Choi) rescuing several tenants, as Evan \u201cBuck\u201d Buckley (Oliver Stark) and Ravi Panikkar (Anirudh Pisharody) go to what's left of the upper levels.",
      "LAPD Sgt. Athena Grant (Angela Bassett) was on scene when the apartment complex started crumbling down. She rushes back in to help, finding two pinned tenants in the building's laundry room. As their conditions worsen, she sends a survivor to get help, and Chimney joins her.",
      "But with the team still inside, the unsteady building continues to shake, rocked with mini-explosions, leaving Buck and Ravi trapped with a victim and Chimney and Athena's exit route completely blocked.",
      "For Buck, it marks a very different circumstance than one of the team's last big emergencies. In Episode 14, all of the 118 were locked inside a lab \u2014 except for Buck.",
      "\"I think he's almost more comfortable being trapped as long as he's able to do his job,\" Oliver Stark tells TODAY.com of the finale. \"Being on the outside was the most jarring thing for him.\"",
      "The lab disaster notably ended with the shocking death of Capt. Bobby Nash (Peter Krause). Quarantined in the lab, members of the 118 were exposed to a deadly virus. Chimney was infected, and he was saved via Athena and Buck\u2019s heroics to acquire an antidote. But Bobby \u2014\u00a0Athena\u2019s husband \u2014 was also infected and died in the lab.",
      "In the finale \u2014\u00a0back to true \"9-1-1\" fashion \u2014 the 118 and Athena save the day, with no further casualties.",
      "Here's how it all goes down (literally) \u2014 and, as Stark says, how the circumstances are hopefully introducing a more \"mature\" Buck looking ahead to the show's already-renewed Season Nine.",
      "How does '9-1-1' Season 8 end?",
      "The 118 has since seemingly fallen apart in the aftermath of Bobby's death. While they showed a united front at Bobby's funeral in Episode 16 \u2014 with Eddie Diaz (Ryan Guzman) returning from El Paso, Texas, after moving earlier in the season to be with his son \u2014 they are each grieving separately in the most recent episodes.",
      "Chimney and Athena, both struggling with Bobby's sacrifice, can barely stand to be in the same room. Meanwhile, Buck and Eddie have another fight, with Eddie accusing Buck of being selfish about Eddie's new job opportunity in El Paso amid his grief.",
      "For the 118, Episode 18 opens on a somber note. All gathered at the station, the team throws a going away lunch for Eddie, who's set to report for duty at an El Paso firehouse the next morning. He's given his turnout uniform, and he and Chris enjoy one last shared meal with the team. Hen says she's turned down taking the job of captain, while Buck reveals he's put in for a transfer.",
      "\"Out of the 118?\" Eddie asks.",
      "\"It's just a number now,\" Buck responds.",
      "The team then heads to the call at the building collapse. Stark says being in the thick of the action is Buck at his best.",
      "\"There are different sides of Buck, and some of them are a bit sillier. I don't know, he's just like guileless and golden retriever-y, but there is no doubt that he's an extremely adept firefighter,\" Stark says. \"So I think him being in the emergency is where he's going to thrive and be able to do his best. I think it's a chance as well to see this more mature, calmer, 'let's get to work' version of Buck.\"",
      "While the rest of team rescues victims, Eddie is packing up his gear and preparing to head to the airport with Chris to go back to Texas. Eddie then sees reports of the building collapse and the search-and-rescue response on the news. Donning his familiar uniform, he heads toward the rubble, just in time to save Buck, Ravi and one of the victims before the building collapses further.",
      "\"I was watching the news, had a bit of FOMO,\" Eddie tells Buck over the radio, before shooting a line gun to their location, allowing the trio to escape.",
      "Stark says for Buck, that moment of Eddie coming to save the day represents a return to the status quo.",
      "\"I think just a case of things getting back to the way they're meant to be, and as we touched on, maybe never being quite the same, but the steps to repair slowly being built,\" Stark tells TODAY.com of Eddie's save.",
      "The team, Eddie included, then head to rescue Athena, Chimney and their patients. In the end, everyone makes it back alive, with zero civilian casualties from the building collapse.",
      "After the emergency and back at the station, Chimney notices the team rapidly splitting off despite their success as a united front. Eddie checks his phone looking for a flight back to El Paso while Buck puts away his turnouts. An emboldened Chimney orders everyone to stop moving and tells Eddie he's not leaving L.A. and Buck that he's not transferring.",
      "\"This is our fire house. This is the 118, and it's not just a number. It's us,\" an emotional Chimney tells the team. \"... Cap is gone. But leaving won't change that. It won't make you feel any less sad. It just means that you'll be sad all alone.\"",
      "He rounds out his speech with strict orders for everyone \u2014 Buck and Eddie included \u2014 to get some rest before reporting for their next shift \"right here, together.\"",
      "A shocked Hen responds, \"Copy that, Cap \u2014 I mean, Chim,\" suggesting the 118 might not have to look far in Season Nine for its next leader.",
      "Asked what stops Buck from considering leaving the 118, Stark tells TODAY.com, \"It's not really his decision.\"",
      "\"It's very much told to him,\" Stark says. \"'Put your stuff down. Get to work. This is where we live.' And it's what I think everybody needs to hear.\"",
      "Eddie being ordered to stay brings in the literal question of living situations.",
      "In Episode Nine, Buck moved into Eddie's house as a subletter so Eddie could follow Chris to El Paso. Since Eddie's return to L.A. for the funeral, he's been staying on Buck's couch in his old house.",
      "In regards to their dynamic as roommates, Stark jokes, \"Apparently they work out who's going to do the groceries and then they don't always follow through on that.\" (In Episode 17, Buck and Eddie's fight occurred in the kitchen and started after Buck picked up the groceries though Eddie said he would.)",
      "\"They work a lot of hours. That's the one thing as well. I don't think they spend a lot of time at home,\" he adds of Buck and Eddie's time as roommates. \"So yeah, that is for the audience to fill in the blank for themselves.\"",
      "In the final minutes of Episode 18, it's revealed that Eddie and Chris have moved back, Buck is looking for a new apartment and Athena is putting the now-finished house she had been building with Bobby on the market.",
      "After he's asked by his realtor why he's leaving his last place, Buck says, \"It wasn't really mine. I was subletting.\"",
      "\"Buck is looking for his own place again, and I just think that he's ready to \u2014\u00a0kind of the combination of everything's that's been happening through the season \u2014\u00a0the old apartment, the loft, is gone. This is Eddie's place. Who am I going to be, stand on my own two feet?\" Stark says of what Buck is looking for.",
      "A move may prove disheartening to longtime supporters of a potential romance between Buck and Eddie. Earlier in Season Eight, the show introduced the possibility onscreen for the first time after Buck reconnects with his ex, who insinuates he'd be open to getting back together \"now that the competition's (Eddie) is out of the way.\" Buck was later point blank asked by sister Maddie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is he was in love with Eddie, which he adamantly denied.",
      "\"You know when something huge happens, your personal dramas, they just, everything falls by the wayside a little bit,\" Stark says. \"I don't know if that will be addressed next year or what.\"",
      "Asked if Buck continued to think about that question before Bobby's death, Stark says he thinks Buck \"shut it down.\"",
      "\"I don't think the idea is that Buck went home and looked in the mirror and said, 'Wait, am I in love with Eddie?' I think it came so far out of left field for him when Tommy first said it,\" Stark says. \"I don't think the idea is that we were saying Buck now is questioning if that's true.\"",
      "\"And, you know, look, (showrunner) Tim (Minear) will make that decision if it is or not,\" he adds. \"But I don't think in that moment that the story was now Buck is wondering if he is. I think Buck thought, 'No, you're absolutely wrong. What are you talking about?' And yeah, we'll go from there.\"",
      "Overall, Stark says he hopes Bobby's death in Season Eight will give him a chance to play a more \"mature Buck\" going forward.",
      "\"I was excited that maybe this could be the thing that helps Buck mature or grow into a different place at a different stage,\" he says. \"So I think that\u2019s, from my point of view, anyway, what the fallout or the repercussions for Buck will be.\""

    "story": [
      "For six seasons, Carrie Bradshaw chased after commitment while wearing Manolos and writing her weekly column. Ironically, at the beginning of \"Sex and the City,\" it was Sarah Jessica Parker who hemmed and hawed over signing the dotted line.",
      "The 60-year-old actor spoke about her early hesitation during a two-part appearance in the \"Are You a Charlotte?\" podcast, hosted by longtime \"Sex and the City\" co-star Kristin Davis. Speaking to Davis, Parker explained why she \"panicked\" at the idea of \"committing\" to the series, even after she shot the show's pilot, which first aired in 1998.",
      "As Parker explained it, the experience of filming the show's first episode was \"lovely,\" but she \"forgot all about it\" until one day, she was walking down a street in New York City when she ran into a well-known producer who complimented her on the show.",
      "\"Then I went on with my day, and when the show was picked up, I panicked,\" she recalled. \"I was like, I can\u2019t be on a TV show. I don\u2019t think I'm suited for that life.\"",
      "Prior to \"Sex and the City,\" Parker had made a name for herself, having starred in \"Square Pegs,\" \"A Year in the Life,\" and \"Equal Justice,\" the latter of which was the only one to make it two seasons. Parker explained that the brief length of each series afforded her a chance to \"bounce around\" and appear in other films and work with experienced actors and directors.",
      "\"Then I moved on and I would do a play or I'd do some readings and then I'd do a part in a movie,\" she explained. \"I really thought, like that is the goal, like the journeyman is the goal.\"",
      "\"The idea of a television series meant that I couldn\u2019t do all those things ... and that I would get in the same car every day, and it just kind of felt like somebody was, you know, putting their hand over my mouth or something,\" she explained, adding that she eventually called up her agent.",
      "\"I talked to my agents and I said, 'You know, hey, can you get me out of this?'\" she recalled before noting that, eventually, she learned that because HBO was still relatively new and an \"unknown species\" to many, she had the benefit of flexibility.",
      "Eventually, she was encouraged to try it out for just a year.",
      "\u201cAnd I never looked back,\u201d she said. \u201cI was never not happy to be there. There was no place I would rather have been than on our set.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Ahead of her new book, \"Atmosphere,\" Taylor Jenkins Reid is opening up about her sexuality, detailing how it impacts her writing process and being perceived a certain way by fans.",
      "In a May 15 interview with Time magazine, Reid revealed she is bisexual, despite many fans assuming she was straight as she is married to a man.",
      "\u201cIt has been hard at times to see people dismiss me as a straight woman, but I also didn\u2019t tell them the whole story,\u201d she said.",
      "Reid admitted that assumptions about her sexuality are nothing new for her. In fact, they began when she was a teenager when she dressed differently than the social norm.",
      "\"I got hit pretty quickly with, 'Why can\u2019t you dress more like a girl? Why don\u2019t you do your nails? Why do you talk that way? Can\u2019t you be a little bit quieter?'\" she told the outlet. \"I started to get people who would say, \u2018Oh, I get why you dress like a boy\u2014you\u2019re gay.'\"",
      "But Reid didn't feel like she identified with being labeled as gay, as she was attracted to both sexes \u2014 her first love was a man and then, in her early 20s, she fell in love with a woman. With both loves, however, people doubted if it was the right course for her.",
      "\"This was the late '90s, so nobody was talking about bisexuality. And if they were, it was to make fun of people,\" Reid told the outlet. \"The messages about bisexuality were you just want attention, or it was a stop on the way to gayville.",
      "\"I found that very painful, because I was being told that I didn\u2019t know myself, but I did,\" she added.",
      "Reid hasn\u2019t been shy in expressing her sexuality through her writing, penning characters who fall on different ends of the spectrum of sexuality.",
      "In \u201cDaisy Jones & The Six,\u201d the main romance centers around a heterosexual love triangle, while \u201cThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\u201d details a love story between two women. Meanwhile, \u201cMalibu Rising,\" which was Read with Jenna's pick for June 2021, showcases mainly heterosexual relationships, but one character experiences a queer awakening.",
      "Her new book, \"Atmosphere,\" out June 3, allowed Reid to explore more of her attraction to women. The novel features a love story between one woman in outer space and one on the ground.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like time for me to write a very high-stakes, dramatic love story,\" the author told Time.",
      "While she may not have always been open with the public about the specifics of her sexuality, she told Time that she was always honest with those closest to her. Her husband, screenwriter Alex Jenkins Reid, even showed her an idea that describes someone's sexuality as a house with many rooms.",
      "\"My attraction to women is a room in the house that is my identity \u2014 Alex understood this book was about me spending time in that room,\u201d Reid said. \"He was so excited for me, like, \u2018What a great way for you to express this side of you.\u2019 And he helped me get the book to be as romantic and beautiful as it could be.\"",
      "Reid also understands that because she's married to a man, she gets \"straight-passing\" privileges that others don't receive.",
      "\"How do I talk about who I really am with full deference to the life experiences of other people?\" she told Time. \"Basically, where I came down is I can talk about who I am, and then people can think about that whatever they want.\""

      "The plan is under serious enough consideration that the administration\u00a0has discussed\u00a0it with Libya\u2019s leadership, two people with direct knowledge of the plans and a former U.S. official said.",
      "In exchange for the resettling of Palestinians, the administration would potentially release to Libya billions of dollars of funds that the U.S. froze more than a decade ago, those three people said.",
      "No final agreement has been reached, and Israel has been kept informed of the administration\u2019s discussions, the same three sources said.",
      "The State Department and the National Security Council did not respond to multiple requests for comment before this article was published. After publication, a spokesperson told NBC News, \u201cthese reports are untrue.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe situation on the ground is untenable for such a plan. Such a plan was not discussed and makes no sense,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said that Hamas, the U.S.-designated terrorist group that has run Gaza, was not aware of any discussions about moving Palestinians to Libya.",
      "\u201cPalestinians are very rooted in their homeland, very strongly committed to the homeland and they are ready to fight up to the end and to sacrifice anything to defend their land, their homeland, their families, and the future of their children,\u201d Naim said in response to questions from NBC News. \u201c[Palestinians] are exclusively the only party who have the right to decide for the Palestinians, including Gaza and Gazans, what to do and what not to do.\u201d",

      "Libya has been plagued by instability and warring political factions throughout the nearly 14 years since a civil war broke out in the country and its longtime dictator, Moammar Gadhafi, was toppled. Libya is struggling to care for its current population as two rival governments, one in the west led by Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and one in the east led by Khalifa Haftar, are actively and violently fighting for control.\u00a0The State Department currently advises Americans not to travel to Libya \u201cdue to crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict.\u201d",
      "Dbeibah\u2019s government could not be reached for comment. Haftar\u2019s Libyan National Army did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "How many Palestinians in Gaza would voluntarily leave to live in Libya is an open question. One idea administration officials have discussed is to provide Palestinians with financial incentives such as free housing and even a stipend, the former U.S. official said.",
      "The details of when or how\u00a0any plan to relocate Palestinians to Libya could be implemented\u00a0are\u00a0murky, and an effort to resettle up to 1 million people there would likely face significant obstacles.",
      "Such an effort would likely be extremely expensive, and it\u2019s not clear\u00a0how the Trump administration would seek to pay for it. In the past, the administration has said Arab nations would help with\u00a0rebuilding Gaza after the war there ends, but they have been critical of Trump\u2019s idea of permanently relocating Palestinians.",
      "In recent weeks, the Trump administration has also looked at Libya as a place where it could send some immigrants it wants to deport from the U.S. However, plans to send one group of immigrants to Libya were stalled by a federal judge this month.",
      "Moving up to 1 million Palestinians to Libya could put far more of a strain on the fragile country.",
      "The\u00a0CIA\u2019s most recent publicly available estimate\u00a0of Libya\u2019s current population is about 7.36 million. In terms of population, Libya absorbing\u00a01\u00a0million more people\u00a0would be equivalent to the U.S. taking in about 46 million.",
      "Precisely where Palestinians would be resettled in Libya\u00a0has not been determined, according to the former U.S. official. Administration officials are looking at\u00a0options for housing them and every potential method for transporting them from Gaza to Libya \u2014 by air, land and sea \u2014is being considered,\u00a0according to one of the people with direct knowledge of the effort.",
      "Any of those methods would likely prove cumbersome and time-consuming, as well as costly.",
      "It would take around 1,173 flights on the world\u2019s largest passenger airplane, the Airbus A380, at its maximum passenger capacity to transport 1 million people, for instance. With no airport in Gaza, moving anyone from there on flights would first require transporting them to an airport in the region. If Israel does not want to allow Palestinians to come through its territory, the closest airport would be in Cairo, about 200 miles away.",
      "Transportation by land from Gaza through Egypt to Benghazi, Libya\u2019s second-largest city, which is farther east than the capital, Tripoli, would require driving about 1,300 miles. Automobiles typically hold fewer passengers than other modes of transportation. About 55 people can fit in an intercity passenger bus.",
      "Up to 2,000 people can fit on the top-end versions of some of the ferries the U.S. used to transport civilians along the Mediterranean Sea to escape Libya\u2019s civil war in 2011. If those vessels were to be used \u2014 and assuming that they didn\u2019t need to refuel and weather conditions were good \u2014 it would take hundreds of trips lasting more than a day each way for up to 1 million people to travel from Gaza to Benghazi.",
      "The plan under discussion is part of\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s vision for a postwar Gaza, which he said in February the U.S. would seek to \u201cown\u201d and rebuild as what he called \u201cthe Riviera of the Middle East,\u201d two current U.S. officials, the former U.S. official and the two people with direct knowledge of the effort said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to take over that piece, develop it and create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it will be something the entire Middle East can be proud of,\u201d Trump said at the time.",
      "To achieve his goal for the reconstruction of Gaza, Trump has said Palestinians there would have to be permanently resettled elsewhere.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t live in Gaza right now, and I think we need another location. I think it should be a location that\u2019s going to make people happy,\u201d Trump said in February during a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "Trump outlined a goal of finding \u201ca beautiful area to resettle people permanently in nice homes, and where they can be happy and not be shot, not be killed, not be knifed to death like what\u2019s happening in Gaza.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think people should be going back to Gaza,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump\u2019s idea, which blindsided some of his top aides, including\u00a0Secretary of State Marco Rubio, when he announced it,\u00a0drew criticism from America\u2019s Arab allies\u00a0and\u00a0U.S. lawmakers from both parties.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see what the Arab world says but, you know, that\u2019d be problematic at many, many levels,\u201d Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said at the time.",
      "The U.S. and Israel in March also\u00a0rejected a proposal from Egypt\u00a0for rebuilding Gaza without relocating Palestinians.",
      "The administration\u2019s work on a Libya plan comes as Trump\u2019s relationship with Netanyahu has become strained, in part because of Israel\u2019s decision to launch a new military offensive in Gaza.",
      "The Trump administration has considered multiple locations for resettling Palestinians living in Gaza, according to a senior administration official, a former U.S. official familiar with the discussions and one of the people with direct knowledge of the effort.",
      "Syria, with its new leadership following the ouster of Bashar al Assad in December, also is under discussion as a possible location for resettling Palestinians currently\u00a0in Gaza, according to one of the people with direct knowledge of the effort and a former U.S. official familiar with the discussions.",
      "The Trump administration has taken steps toward restoring diplomatic relations with Syria. Trump announced on Tuesday that the U.S. would lift sanctions on Syria and met briefly with the country\u2019s new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, on Wednesday."

      "\u201cWe have full confidence and the capability to overcome all difficulties,\u201d Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying said last week during a government-sponsored trip to the rural county of Malipo in Yunnan province, on the border with Vietnam.",
      "\u201cAs for what the United States is doing, we really don\u2019t want any kind of war, but if we have to face up to reality, then we have no fear at all,\u201d she told reporters at a middle school. \u201cThe ordinary people already feel the suffering from the tariff war, so I really hope the [U.S.] administration will come back to normal.\u201d",

Per capita disposable income in Malipo was $2,300 a year last year, compared with about $69 a year in 1992.",
      "But Beijing\u2019s professed confidence belies real concern about the work that remains to be done as well as the potential impact of U.S. tariffs as China struggles with structural imbalances and slowing economic growth.",

      "More than 450 million of China\u2019s 1.4 billion people live in rural areas, and getting them to spend more on consumer products is crucial as China tries to reduce its economic dependence on exports threatened by tariffs.",

      "Hua said the strength of China\u2019s system is its ability to \u201cconcentrate resources\u201d on people\u2019s urgent needs. Beijing is thought to have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on poverty alleviation since 2015.",
      "China\u2019s approach to reducing inequality combines \u201ccoercive top-down control\u201d with high social spending in an effort to \u201chighlight the perceived failures of liberal free-market capitalism,\u201d Rana Mitter, a historian and political scientist at the Harvard Kennedy School, wrote in a new Foreign Affairs article.",

    "story": [
      "The streets of Syria were a carnival of car horns, fireworks and flags after President Donald Trump made the surprise announcement that the United States would lift sanctions that have throttled the country\u2019s economy for more than 45 years.",
      "Trump stunned even close observers on Tuesday by saying he wants to normalize relations after Syria\u2019s longtime president, Bashar al Assad, was toppled in December. Trump met Wednesday with Assad\u2019s successor, interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former leader of an al-Qaeda offshoot group, in Saudi Arabia\u00a0after urging him\u00a0late Tuesday to \u201cshow us something special.\u201d",
      "That has delighted Syrians and campaigners, who have been calling for sanctions relief to rebuild the war-ruined country \u2014 a reconstruction priced up to $400 billion. When Trump made the announcement \u2014 telling a Saudi audience \u201cwe\u2019re taking them all off\u201d \u2014 Syrian housewife Dalal Qallab took to\u00a0the streets with her children in an outpouring of joy.",
      "\u201cTrump said that he will give us a chance, and we deserve that chance,\u201d Qallab, a mother of four from the port city of Latakia, told NBC News. \u201cAfter 14 years, I felt that the American president cared about us,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was a historic moment. It gave us hope for a better life.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a chance at relief after a grim 14 years in a country that until now has been one of the world\u2019s most sanctioned.",
      "\u201cFor years, sanctions have caused severe damage to the Syrian economy, directly impacting citizens\u2019 lives and hindering development and production,\u201d said Syrian economy minister spokesperson Hassan Al-Ahmad in a statement sent to NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis decision presents a genuine opportunity to revive the economy, restore national production cycles, and open doors to investments, technology, and markets,\u201d he added. \u201cFrom the Syrian government\u2019s perspective, this decision marks a turning point that we aim to leverage wisely and rationally.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere have been very few positive things happening in Syria,\u201d said  Aron Lund, a Syria expert and a fellow at Century International, a progressive think tank based in New York. \u201cAssad going was, of course, positive in the sense that you got rid of this mass murderer,\u201d but the \u201ceconomic morass\u201d has persisted.",
      "Assad\u2019s 2011 crackdown morphed into one of the most devastating and complex civil wars of modern times. Iran, Russia and Hezbollah lined up behind Assad, and the U.S., Turkey and others supported different rebel groups. Amid all of that, the Islamic State terroist organization thrived.",
      "Assad stayed in power by killing his own people, deploying chemical weapons and Russian bombs, and torturing and murdering them in an underground network of gulags. The U.N. estimates more than 300,000 people were killed; another 13 million were forced to flee their homes.",
      "In recent years, however, most international aid has flown into places like Ukraine and Gaza. Now it will be far easier for cash to enter Syria, Lund said. He called Trump\u2019s move \u201ca big, good thing for Syria\u2019s chances of recovering and stabilizing as a functioning nation state.\u201d",
      "Such a development would be welcomed by Syria\u2019s neighbors in the Gulf and Middle East. And indeed, Trump said his decision to lift sanctions came at the behest of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. They want to see a stable Syria, one that does not disseminate refugees, instability and terrorism, and acts as an ally against Iran.",
      "\u201cI hope to see Syria like the UAE, Qatar or Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Nasser Eido, 49, a lawyer who fled to Norway during the war but has since returned to Damascus since Assad fell. \u201cI\u2019m confident we can achieve this. The old regime stole the country\u2019s resources, kept the people poor and left them hungry.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s move does not come without risk, however.",
      "Questions still hang over al-Sharaa, who led Assad\u2019s overthrow and says he has reformed since his days as the leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which spearheaded the offensive against Assad in early December.",
      "He has given some moderate signals, appointing women and minorities to government positions and saying Sharia, the strict interpretation of Islamic law, will not be imposed. Yet some groups remain uneasy about their place in the new Syria, where there have already been mass killings of Alawites, Assad\u2019s minority Muslim sect.",
      "\u201cThere is the risk that the Syrian government, which is pretty hardcore Islamist, ends up doing horrible things: more massacres, or Christians getting killed, or something else that would not play well in Washington,\u201d Lund said. The White House could be in the position of having to defend itself \u201cagainst the charges that it maybe enabled that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not a risk free decision.\u201d",
      "In 1979, the country was blacklisted on the State Department\u2019s first list of state sponsors of terror, alongside Iraq, Libya and former South Yemen. Today, Syria is the only one left, the others being replaced by North Korea, Cuba and Iran. This classification imposes financial restrictions, as well as banning any American military-related imports or exports.",
      "More U.S. sanctions came in 2004, followed by the first measures from the United Nations and European Union a year later. In 2011, when Assad began brutally suppressing demonstrations, the U.S., U.N. and E.U. imposed further import and export controls.",
      "After rebels toppled Assad in just 11 days with little fightback, the U.S. eased some of these restrictions, granting a six-month license that allowed humanitarian aid to enter the country.",
      "Since then, the Trump administration had shown few signs of offering easy progress. It demanded that Syria fulfill a list of conditions that included protecting minorities before any sanctions could be shifted \u2014 hence the surprise at Trump's announcement.",

    "summary": "South Africa has a dark history of racism, including confiscating land from Black residents, before and during the anguish of apartheid.",
    "story": [
      "A day after 59 white South Africans were welcomed to America as refugees, more than 86,000 South African farmers \u2014 who are mostly white \u2014 are gathering this week at the NAMPO Harvest Day trade fair, an annual agricultural exhibition considered the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "Over four days, the attendees will discuss innovations in technology, collaborations and various other elements of an industry that last year generated nearly $14 billion in revenue.",
      "Notably, according to one participant, there is no planned discussion of violence against white farmers or \u201cAfrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored, race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation\u201d without compensation, as President Donald Trump wrote in a Feb. 7 executive order that opened the way for the 59 South Africans to come to U.S., despite a ban on refugees from other nations.",
      "The executive order referenced South Africa\u2019s Expropriation Act enacted last year, which in some cases allows the government to seize unused land without compensation, something Cyril Ramaphosa, the country\u2019s president, said has not happened.",
      "The act awakened a profoundly troubling argument over land rights. South Africa's dark history of racism includes the confiscation of land from Black residents, both before and during the apartheid. Afrikaners, the minority white descendants of Dutch and French settlers who arrived in South Africa in the 1600s, were leaders of the apartheid regime that ended in 1994.",
      "The purported goal of the Expropriation Act is to shrink the vast land ownership disparity that came with the oppressive rule. According to the organization Action for Southern Africa, 72% of farms and agricultural holdings are owned by whites, who make up 7.3% of the population. Black Africans, representing 81.4%, own only 4% of the land.",
      "Trump asserted on Monday, ahead of the refugees\u2019 arrival in the U.S., that \u201cwhite farmers are being brutally killed and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.\u201d",
      "Yet Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, said that the spirit of NAMPO this week reaffirms that \u201cgenocide\u201d of white South African farmers \u201cwas imaginary and not happening in our country.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all disturbed that the U.S. side is alleging that there\u2019s genocide and mistreatment of white farmers in South Africa. It is incorrect,\u201d said Sihlobo, who is also co-author of the book \u201cThe Uncomfortable Truth About South Africa\u2019s Agriculture.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anything, the sector continues to flourish. [Trump's] comments are misinformed and not mirroring the reality on the ground in the country,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "The New York Times reported 225 people were killed on South African farms over a four-year period ending in 2024. Of those deaths, 101 were Black current or former workers living on farms, and 53 were farmers, who are usually white.",
      "Nico Harris, a farmer of Afrikaans heritage, told Daily Maverick South African newspaper that the problems he sees can be overcome and stem from the government not being \u201cpro-farmer.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the refugees that have gone [to the U.S.] are not well-established family farming businesses like we are,\u201d Harris told the paper. \u201cI think they don\u2019t have an opportunity in the country and they might think that, \u2018This is an opportunity for us.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really fleeing because they are scared or worried, I think they see it as an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Harris added, \u201cI think there are racially discriminating laws against white farmers, and I think they have problems and haven\u2019t got sympathy from the government. But there are no real land grabs, and I don\u2019t think there are real threats. There are individual farm attacks, but it\u2019s more related to criminal activity. We just hope our government is going to wake up and realize that they need the farmers, Black and white.\u201d",
      "One of the South Africans who arrived in the U.S. on Monday told The Washington Post that she had been advised not to speak with the media and said it had been a \u201cvery emotional, very rough couple of weeks.\u201d",
      "Theo Boshoff, CEO of AgBiz, which represents companies across the agricultural value chain, including South African and multinational companies, said crime in rural farming areas is high but \u201cnot targeted against any racial or ethnic group.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no genocide in South Africa,\u201d Boshoff added. \u201cPeople who live in rural areas, who are often farmers, are simply more vulnerable to crime and violent crime because they live in remote areas.\u201d",
      "And because they are remote, law enforcement often is not nearby to protect them. \u201cThere is no cultural or racial bias at play. White farmers, Black farmers, white farmworkers, Black farmworkers are\u00a0all equally at risk and united in combatting this challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t agree with insinuations that rural crime is motivated by politics or in any way related to South Africa\u2019s affirmative action efforts to remedy our checkered past.\u201d",
      "Solidarity, a South African trade union that represents 600,000 Afrikaner families, said in a statement in February that it does not agree with the African National Congress, which wants to close the farmland disparity gap. \u201cBut we love our country. As in any community, there are individuals who wish to immigrate, but repatriation of Afrikaners as refugees is not a solution for us,\u201c the group wrote.",
      "President Ramaphosa said on X that the country\u2019s laws \u201cbalance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.\u201d He said that a meeting with President Trump about the country\u2019s land reform policy would result in them sharing \u201ca better and common understanding over these matters.\u201d",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, has talked of his home country having \u201cracist ownership laws\u201d in a genocidal effort against white farmers.",
      "Fadial Adams, a member of the National Assembly of South Africa, a political body that passes legislation and analyzes executive action, warned of Musk\u2019s influence on the president. \u201cLet us not forget that Elon Musk is a beneficiary of our suffering and our slavery in South Africa, and it is not something that he hides. He was raised on a system which benefited white South Africans exclusively,\u201d\u00a0Adams said. \u201cElon Musk should stop acting like the minister for foreign affairs for South Africa. He\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration and Musk representative did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Afriforum, a nongovernmental South African agency that supports the interests of white citizens, have called for farm murders to be classified as priority crimes requiring special attention, like gender-based violence or rhino-poaching. It does not support the Expropriation Act.",
      "\u201cMany laws identified by the Afrikaner lobby groups as racist are viewed by the African National Congress as being necessary, intentional measures to redress past wrongs,\u201d said Thula Simpson, an associate professor of history at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. \u201cSo the present developments strike at the heart of the post-apartheid consensus.\u201d",
      "As for the farmers in South Africa as a whole, Sihlobo, the economist from the Agricultural Business Chamber, pointed at how the country's earnings from exporting produce have grown from $2 billion in the year 2000 to nearly $14 billion in 2024.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re self-sufficient,\u201d Sihlobo said. \u201cThat speaks to the progress the sector has been making. You can\u2019t see numbers like that where there\u2019s a genocide.\u201d",
      "Jaco Minnaar, the chairman of AGRI SA, the largest agriculture organization in South Africa, says the larger problem is South Africa\u2019s crime rate.",
      "\u201cWe can see that farm murders in South Africa have a slightly higher rate per capita than murders in general, but it\u2019s farmers and farmworkers, which is not all necessarily white,\u201d Minnaar said.",
      "\u201cOur murder rate is one of the highest per capita in the world, even higher than some of the war-torn countries. That\u2019s something that we need to address,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t specifically see from the statistics that white people or any other demographic group are targeted. Or that there\u2019s a genocide.\u201d"

      "\u201cNobody does drama like the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church,\u201d said Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, shortly after emerging from the conclave that elected Pope Leo XIV on Thursday.",
      "The quick decision, made some 33 hours after the Sistine Chapel\u2019s doors closed and the cardinals went into sequestration, was a sign that they likely entered the conclave with enough unity around the decision to continue Francis\u2019 legacy that they did not have to spend days tussling over a new direction for the Vatican.",
      "In the weeks ahead of the conclave, Cardinal Joseph Tobin, archbishop of Newark, said in a joint press conference with five other American cardinals on Friday. \u201cWe listened to each other. What does the church need? What does the world need? What are we hoping for? What are we dreaming about?\u201d",
      "Leo, previously Cardinal Robert Prevost, a U.S. native with Peruvian citizenship and deep ties to Latin America, is described by the Vatican as the \u201csecond pope from the Americas,\u201d to Francis\u2019 first. He is known to have been close to the late pontiff, both in their daily dealings at the Vatican and ideologically.Like Francis, Leo is known for his concern for the poor and marginalized, and in his first Sunday blessing as pope, quoted Francis and called for ceasefires in Ukraine and Gaza, the subjects of Francis\u2019 final message to the world.",
      "The conclave is shrouded in secrecy, and many of the dealings that lead up to it remain in the shadows, but since the end of the conclave some cardinals have offered glimpses into what happened in the hours that led up to Leo\u2019s election.",
      "Once the Sistine Chapel\u2019s doors close, the cardinals swear an oath of \u201cabsolute and perpetual secrecy,\u201d as do all\u00a0Vatican\u00a0staff assisting them, including cooks, cleaners and drivers. Mobile phones are confiscated, an ancient reason for a digital detox that at least one cardinal, Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, appreciated for giving him \u201cmore time on my hands just to be prayerful, just to reflect, just to be still, rather than being constantly agitated,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "On the first evening, the cardinals cast their first-round votes, but black smoke billowed from the chimney, meaning no pope was chosen.",
      "The cardinals adjourned for the night to Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse were most of them were staying \u2014 and eating. Cardinal Wilton Gregory said that \u201ca lot of dialogue occurred at mealtime, coffee breaks, those moments when you can engage in smaller groups.\u201d\u201cThe only method is the human method, to get to talk to another, the dialogue, to listen to one another,\u201d Cardinal Robert McElroy, archbishop of Washington, said about the conversations that eventually lead to the two-thirds majority required to elect a pope.",
      "The next morning, the cardinals returned to the Sistine Chapel and two more ballots were cast, but black smoke emerged once again.",
      "\u201cVoting is like watching a glacier move, but sometimes glaciers under stress move a lot faster,\u201d Tobin said.",
      "Despite wide speculation on papabili in the wake of Francis\u2019 death, once the conclave began, we don\u2019t know who the other front-runners were, or why they fell behind. But Dolan told CNN that Prevost\u2019s name had begun to emerge from relative obscurity even before the conclave began. And he continued to confer with his brother cardinals into the conclave.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that he stood up and made this overwhelmingly convincing speech that just wowed,\u201d said Gregory. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any particular intervention, but I do believe he engaged quite effectively in the smaller group conversations.\u201d",
      "And while conclaves in centuries past could stretch for weeks, Prevost\u2019s election began to take shape on the second day.",
      "Or as Gregory framed it: \u201cThere was a great movement on the second day, a great movement within the body that was there and there could be nothing other than the grace of God moving us toward this consensus.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I experience is that everything begins in politics and finishes mystic,\u201d added McElroy.",
      "Tobin recalled the moment after casting his vote. \u201cI walked back and I took a look at Bob, and because his name had been floating around, and he had his head in his hands,\u201d he said. \u201cI was praying for him, because I couldn\u2019t imagine what happens to a human being when you\u2019re facing something like that.\u201d",
      "During a press conference on Saturday, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, himself considered one of the leading candidates for pope, said he was seated next to Prevost.",
      "In the minutes after his election, when the new pope was gasping for air as the weight of his new role descended on him, Tagle said he asked him if he wanted a piece of candy. Prevost accepted and Tagle pulled one from a pocket beneath his cardinal\u2019s robe. \u201cThat\u2019s my first act of charity,\u201d he said he told Prevost jokingly, \u201cfor our new Holy Father.\u201d",
      "Soon after, Prevost emerged on the balcony of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica as Pope Leo XIV, proof of an efficient and successful conclave.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t our first rodeo,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this 268 times.\u201d"

      "Marked by high-level talks and lavish displays of regional hospitality, the trip showcased Trump\u2019s self-styled role as a dealmaker and peacemaker. Still, his loftiest targets \u2014 resolving the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine \u2014 remain elusive.",
      "In Abu Dhabi, Trump capped his weeklong tour with a visit to Qasr Al Watan, the emirate\u2019s presidential palace, where he toured exhibits showcasing investments in energy, health care and aviation. Accompanied by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the president met with business leaders and took shots at his predecessor.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just thinking, we have a president of the United States doing the selling,\u201d Trump said, taking a swipe at former President Joe Biden. \u201cYou think Biden would be doing this? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d A large screen at the event repurposed his campaign slogan to proclaim \u201cMaking Energy Great Again,\u201d a nod to the economic focus of the trip.",
      "Throughout the week, Trump announced major investments by Middle Eastern nations in American businesses, including a $600 billion investment deal from Saudi Arabia and an agreement with Qatar Airways to buy hundreds of planes from Boeing and GE Aerospace.",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields lauded the trip as an \"incredibly formative visit that forged America\u2019s Golden Age through its partnerships with a critical region of the world.\"",
      "The visit came amid controversy over Trump's eagerness to accept a planned gift from the Qatari government: a $400 million luxury plane which he hopes to use as Air Force One. The offer has drawn backlash from Democrats and some Republicans back home over potential ethical, security and financial challenges.",
      "Trump repeatedly dismissed concerns about the plane, saying he \"thought it was a great gesture.\" He also brushed off accusations that the trip, which came as his namesake company expands into the Middle East, created a potential conflict of interest.",
      "Yet, even as he celebrated his economic victories, the president faced the reality upon departure of the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine, conflicts he has vowed to resolve.",
      "The president has made ending some of the world\u2019s thorniest conflicts a top priority of his administration, vowing to stop the bloodshed and bring about a lasting peace. And in a show of strong commitment, he has dispatched top aides to the cause, with special envoy Steve Witkoff hopscotching the globe in pursuit of the president\u2019s goal.\u00a0Before departing Washington, Trump announced the release of Edan Alexander, an American held by Hamas, with Qatar playing a central role in the negotiations.",
      "However, the president acknowledged that significant challenges remain. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at Gaza,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he left Abu Dhabi. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving.\u201d",

      "Earlier, Trump had expressed disappointment but not surprise when Putin failed to attend a planned meeting in Turkey. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible for him to go if I didn\u2019t go,\u201d Trump said, noting that his schedule had made the trip untenable.",
      "Instead, he teased the near possibility of a breakthrough in nuclear talks with Iran. Trump told reporters Friday that his administration had submitted a proposal for a deal with Tehran, after describing earlier their efforts \u201cin very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace.\u201d Earlier in the week, Trump hinted that he hoped an agreement was near, stating that \u201cwe\u2019re not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran.\u201d",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said later Friday that his government had not \"received any written proposal from the United States\" and that there was \"no scenario\" in which Tehran would abandon its nuclear program to reach a deal with the U.S.",
      "\"Iran nonetheless remains determined and straightforward: Respect our rights and terminate your sanctions, and we have a deal,\" he said on X. \"Mark my words: there is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to enrichment for peaceful purposes: a right afforded to all other [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty] signatories, too.\"",
      "Trump also said Friday that recognizing the new Syrian government \u2014 and lifting what he called \"brutal\" and \"biting\" sanctions \u2014 was \"the right thing to do\" as the new leadership cements its control.",
      "Trump said Wednesday that the trip did not sideline Benjamin Netanyahu by forgoing a visit with the Israeli prime minister, explaining that his relationships with Arab leaders are \u201cvery good for Israel.\u201d He also said he reached out to Netanyahu on the decision to lift sanctions on Syria.",
      "Analysts see parallels between this trip and Trump\u2019s 2017 Middle East tour.",
      "\u201cThe key thing to watch is what comes next in the region and what big steps his administration takes,\u201d said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. After 2017, the Gulf region saw a rift that isolated Qatar for three years and a U.S. \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran that he said failed to deliver lasting results. Yet, the trip also laid the groundwork for the Abraham Accords, the 2020 agreement normalizing ties between Israel and several Arab states, which remains Trump\u2019s signature foreign policy achievement and which Biden sought to continue.",
      "Trump is aiming higher. \u201cThis time around, Trump is looking for a historic breakthrough with Iran on the nuclear talks and also dreams of getting a Nobel Prize if he gets that Iran deal or expands the Abraham Accords to include a Saudi-Israeli normalization accord,\u201d Katulis said.",
      "Trump\u2019s hosts this week have also played important roles in these efforts, helping to mediate the conflicts and offering support to negotiations, and the president acknowledged there was more to do as he departed Abu Dhabi.",
      "\u201cUnexpected surprises and events have a way of knocking U.S. administrations off balance,\u201d Katulis said. \u201cThe ongoing war in Gaza and the growing misery of Palestinians living there will be a critical test.\u201d"

      "But the recent tariff cut has given them a chance to ramp up shipments from China and restock their warehouses and fulfill existing orders, supply chain experts say.",
      "\u201cIn the short term, [Temu and Shein] are definitely going to increase their shipment volume to the U.S.,\u201d said Anand Kumar, associate director of research at Coresight Research, adding that it will also help the companies reassess their long-term strategy.",
      "According to Jason Wong, who has been associated with Temu's product logistics in Hong Kong, the company has paused shipments from China after the end of the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption and relied on U.S. stockpiles to fulfill orders.",

      "On May 2, Trump ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption policy, which analysts had criticized as hurting local businesses and disguising illicit fentanyl trade.",
      "The small-package tariff exemption had helped Temu and Shein maintain budget prices on the merchandise they shipped directly from China.",

    "story": [
      "BASEL, Switzerland \u2014 Fans from around the world have descended upon the 69th Eurovision Song Contest to rally behind performers from their home countries who have been battling it out onstage all week.",
      "In total, there are 26 performances in the grand final: the countries that got through the semifinals, plus the host country (this year, Switzerland) and a group called the Big Five \u2014 France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom \u2014 which enter the final automatically because their countries make the biggest financial contributions to Eurovision.",
      "As the artists gear up for an extravagant, glitter-dusted pop song contest featuring their wildly over-the-top performances, thousands of spectators gather at Eurovision Village, a convention center that\u2019s been turned into a hub for fans. Some drape national flags on their backs, others paint the flags on their faces. Many find themselves dancing until the early hours at the EuroClub, which plays nothing but Eurovision hits.",
      "The event is what members of the Remember Monday group representing the U.K. called a cultural phenomenon, likening it to the Super Bowl in the U.S.",
      "\u201cEveryone knows what it is,\u201d Holly-Anne Hull said. \u201cAnd everyone, whether they like it or not, is aware of who\u2019s won it every year.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what else to know.",
      "How to watch and vote",
      "Performers will battle it out during Saturday\u2019s grand final, which airs at 3 p.m. ET on Peacock for viewers in the U.S.",
      "The winner of the contest is decided by a mix of votes from national juries of music professionals and viewers watching at home. People all around the world can vote for the winner using the contest\u2019s app or online.",
      "Who are this year\u2019s favorites?",
      "Gambling on Eurovision is big business, and sports betting firms \u2014 who give their two cents on the odds of each contender \u2014 have a decent track record of identifying which songs will do well at Saturday\u2019s grand final.",
      "This year, the favorites include Sweden, which has won the contest seven times since the first Eurovision in 1956. The group KAJ, a trio of Swedish-speaking Finns, is entering this year with \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d an ode to the Nordic tradition of going to the sauna. The song, which features staging re-creating a sauna complete with dancers in towels, is the most-streamed song by far from this year\u2019s contest, according to Spotify.",
      "Another top contender is Austria. Singer JJ, an opera singer, uses extraordinary vocal range to hit high notes throughout his song, \u201cWasted Love.\u201d",
      "The Dutch entry is also considered a front-runner. Singer Claude\u2019s \u201cC\u2019est La Vie\u201d has a mixture of French and English lyrics, and it\u2019s this year\u2019s third most-streamed song of the nominees on Spotify.",
      "Other eye-catching numbers to watch for",
      "Eurovision songs cut across genres, and while many wouldn\u2019t be out of place on a Top 40 radio playlist, sometimes they stand out for wild lyrics or eye-popping staging.",
      "In addition to the Swedish sauna song, this year\u2019s entries include Icelandic act V\u00e6b. The blond brothers don oversized silver outfits and jewel-encrusted sunglasses and energetically jump around the stage during their song \u201cR\u00f3a,\u201d which is about rowing a boat.",
      "Finland\u2019s Erika Vikman singing about a \u201clust trance\u201d while wearing thigh-high leather boots in \u201cIch Komme.\u201d The song reaches its climax with Vikman on a giant microphone stand suspended in the air with sparks flying out of it.",
      "Being weird doesn't guarantee a spot in the final, though. This year's Irish entry was a dance anthem imagining a world in which Laika, the Soviet dog who died after being sent to space, not only lived but \u201chas a party in the air\u201d and \u201cis dancing every night among the stars.\u201d It didn't make it past Thursday's semifinal.",
      "Have there been any controversies?",
      "As was the case last year, Israel\u2019s participation has drawn protests over the country\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip. This year\u2019s contestant, Yuval Raphael, survived the Hamas-led terror attack on the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) bars lyrics it views as political and last year forced Israel\u2019s entry to change lyrics that referenced the attacks.",
      "Martin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said in a statement that the EBU, which organizes the contest, \u201cis not immune to global events but, together with our Members, it is our role to ensure the Contest remains \u2014 at its heart \u2014 a universal event that promotes connections, diversity and inclusion through music.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is not our role to make comparisons between conflicts,\u201d he added, noting that the EBU \u201cremains aligned with other international organizations that have similarly maintained their inclusive stance towards Israeli participants in major competitions at this time.\u201d",
      "The entry from Malta also prompted controversy for its lyrics to Miriana Conte\u2019s song, \u201cServing.\u201d The original version featured the Maltese word for \u201csinging,\u201d which sounds like a vulgar word in English. That word has been omitted in the reworked version. The singer posted on her Instagram that the EBU had made her change the words.",
      "In a statement to Sky News, NBC's British partner, at the time, the EBU said that \"if a song is deemed unacceptable for any reason, broadcasters are given the opportunity to modify it, or select a new one, before the deadline as per the rules of the Contest.\"",
      "The Italian consumer group Codacons also filed a complaint over offensive stereotypes in Estonian Tommy Cash\u2019s \u201cEspresso Macchiato,\u201d which includes lyrics that reference \u201csweating like a mafioso\u201d and being \u201caddicted to tobacco.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Eurovision did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Estonia\u2019s entry.",
      "A major surprise appearance could be in store",
      "A question on many people\u2019s minds is whether C\u00e9line Dion \u2014 yes the C\u00e9line Dion \u2014 will make an appearance.",
      "The award-winning artist was 20 years old when she won the competition for Switzerland back in 1988. (Although she is Canadian, artists don\u2019t need to be from the country they represent. For example, this year, the Swedish entry is from Finland and the Irish entry is from Norway.)",
      "Dion appeared in a video at Tuesday\u2019s semifinal saying she \u201cwould love nothing more\u201d than to appear at the contest. The singer has been public about her stiff-person syndrome diagnosis and gave an emotional performance at the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Paris last year.",
      "Asked via email by NBC News about the possibility of Dion appearing in person at Saturday\u2019s final, Eurovision spokesperson Sibylle Tornay said, \u201cThere are currently no changes regarding C\u00e9line Dion \u2014 we are still in close contact with her, of course her health is the most important thing and comes first.\u201d"

      "NBC News asked the Russian team Thursday whether Putin is prepared to compromise \u2014 there was no answer.",
      "Ukraine instead wants a 30-ceasefire as a basis on which to build future diplomatic wins. Its European supporters say that they will hit Russia with further sanctions if it does not agree.

      "The arrest followed a tip from the airport\u2019s customs that reported Shaw had received a suspicious airway package from Thailand, Sipayung said.

      "Mexican beauty influencer Valeria Marquez was shot and killed on camera during a TikTok live stream.",
      "Marquez, 23, was sitting inside a beauty salon in Zapopan when live stream footage caught the shocking incident. The influencer, who was wearing the same bodysuit she wore in her latest Instagram photo, was seen holding a stuffed pig in her lap in the moments before her death.",
      "She was heard saying in Spanish, \u201cThey\u2019re coming,\u201d before a voice offscreen greeted her with, \u201cHey, Vale?\u201d Marquez then answered \u201cyes\u201d and muted the sound on the stream. Seconds later, she appeared to be shot by a firearm.",
      "Her Instagram following ballooned from less than 100,000 to nearly 260,000 in the wake of the news as a mix of support and shock poured into the comments of her recent posts.",
      "City police officers and paramedics confirmed Marquez\u2019s death upon arriving at the scene, according to the Jalisco state attorney general\u2019s office. The office stated on Tuesday that the\u00a0slaying is being investigated for potential femicide, which is defined by the UN as \u201can intentional killing with a gender-related motivation.\u201d",
      "Research by the data gathering platform Statista ranked Mexico as the second-highest nation for femicides in Latin America in 2023. The country recorded nearly 800 cases in 2024, a decrease from previous years. Victims tended to have preexisting familial or communal relationships with their aggressors, according to Statista.",
      "Initial investigations for Marquez\u2019s killing found that a man had entered the premises and apparently fired a weapon at her. Investigators are continuing to gather evidence. According to Tuesday\u2019s statement, Marquez\u2019s body was set to be transferred to the facilities at the\u00a0Jalisco Institute of Forensic Sciences, where it would await official identification and an autopsy."

      "DOHA, Qatar \u2014 President Donald Trump\u00a0brushed off\u00a0questions Wednesday\u00a0over ethical concerns about the\u00a0growing\u00a0Middle East\u00a0footprint of his\u00a0family business, as his\u00a0trip in the region\u00a0takes him to three countries with Trump-branded ventures.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he didn\u2019t know how an Emirati-backed firm had struck a deal with the Trump family company\u2019s digital coin for $2 billion.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Trump said, adding that he is a big cryptocurrency fan and if the U.S. doesn\u2019t lead in crypto and AI, China will. Zach Witkoff, a co-founder of the World Liberty Financial crypto venture and the son of the president\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, announced the investment at a conference in Dubai earlier this month.",
      "Asked if the Saudi-financed and Trump-linked LIV Golf tour came up during his conversations with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the last two days, Trump said it had not. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss that,\u201d he added. He also sidestepped Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s threat to block his nominees until there are more answers on a high-priced jet that Qatar has offered as a gift and instead mused that there was \u201cjust something wrong\u201d with Schumer, a New York Democrat.",
      "The Trump Organization, led by the president\u2019s two oldest sons, has also significantly expanded its Middle East footprint, with new ventures in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. These include a Trump International Hotel & Tower in Dubai, a golf resort in Doha with Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund\u2019s real estate arm,\u00a0a Trump Tower in Jeddah, and a hotel under construction in Muscat. The projects are partnered with Dar Global, a developer linked to the Saudi government. It's unclear how long the projects will take to complete.",
      "The Trump-branded projects have drawn scrutiny in Washington from the president's political opponents and even some allies, who point out that the president has not divested from the Trump Organization and continues to profit from \u2014 and personally promote \u2014 these business ventures in his second term. The company has said that Trump handed over management of his assets to his family before returning to office and has no day-to-day role.",
      "\"The Trump Organization developments in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates raise serious conflict of interest questions, as President\u00a0Trump meets with top officials of all three countries this week,\u201d said Meghan Faulkner, communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group and watchdog focused on issues of public integrity and affiliated with Democrats. \u201cThe American people should not have to wonder if Donald Trump is prioritizing their interests or his own bottom line while he is making foreign policy decisions, but his business ties make that an unavoidable question.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that, \"Any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. President Trump\u2019s Administration is committed to full transparency.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s affinity for the Middle East is well known, with the president finding fertile ground in the region as he works to carve out an image as a global peacemaker and the leader of a country that is open for business. On Tuesday in Riyadh, he announced plans to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria and offered Iran \u201ca new, hopeful path\u201d toward a better future.",
      "During a state visit with Qatar\u2019s emir on Wednesday, Trump praised the warming Qatar-Saudi Arabia relationship, lavishing flattery on his host. \u201cWe just came from Saudi Arabia, where we have another great man over there that's a friend of yours,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys get along so well and like each other. You sort of remind me a little bit of each other, if you want to know the truth. They're both tall, handsome guys who happen to be very smart.\u201d",
      "This marks a shift from his first term, when a Saudi-led coalition blockaded Qatar over alleged terrorism support.",
      "And Trump has defended as \u201ca great gesture\u201d the Qatari jet gift, saying before leaving Washington that turning it down would be foolish. \u201cI could be a stupid person and say, \u2018No, we don\u2019t want a free, very expensive airplane,\u2019\u201d Trump said, adding that it would go to his presidential library foundation once he leaves office. Qatar, however, appeared to temper the announcement. Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar\u2019s media attach\u00e9 to the U.S., clarified that the transfer is \u201cunder consideration\u201d by Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense, with no final decision having been made.",
      "Democrats in Washington are capitalizing on the controversy, with the Democratic National Committee announcing plans to fly a banner that reads \u201cQatar-a-Lago\u201d over Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club on Wednesday.\u00a0Some Republican allies of the president have also raised concerns about the jet: Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson called the gift a \"very odd offer,\" and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said the plane could bring \"significant espionage and surveillance problems.\"",
      "At a news conference Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., dismissed concerns about the Trump family\u2019s foreign business dealings, claiming he did not have expertise on the matter and stressing that Trump has been transparent.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has nothing to hide,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe\u2019s very upfront.\u201d He stressed that ethics oversight is in place and emphasized that his focus is on leading the House. And he said Qatar\u2019s gift of the plane was \u201cto the country,\u201d not Trump personally.",
      "Refitting the plane could cost $1 billion and take years to complete, more than twice the plane\u2019s reported value, NBC News reported. The cost, likely to come at taxpayers\u2019 expense, raises questions about the practical implications of a gift to a president who may no longer be in office at the time it's ready to use."

      "BASEL, Switzerland \u2014 As tourists crossed Basel\u2019s Mittlere Br\u00fccke bridge Thursday, some of them paused to savor the warm spring sun just as they have done for centuries. This week, the crossing that straddles the Rhine river as it meanders across the borders with nearby France and Germany was lined with flags bearing the Eurovision Song Contest slogan, \u201cUnited by Music.\u201d",
      "Basel, and Europe at large, are anything but united.",
      "Police and the the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) are preparing themselves for a potential repeat of last year\u2019s iteration of Eurovision, the song competition that launched the careers of ABBA and 1988 winner Celine Dion. The 2024 contest was overshadowed by politics perhaps more than in any previous year, with fierce protests over the participation of Israel amid its government\u2019s intensifying war on Gaza.",
      "It\u2019s purely by chance that this year\u2019s contest, usually an outrageous jamboree of inscrutable lyrics and scantily clad backing dancers, is being held in a country with a long-standing policy of neutrality. Each year\u2019s venue is dictated by which country won the previous year.",
      "The EBU, which organizes the contest, says the event is nonpolitical, but given that it brings together dozens of countries \u2014 this year, 37 nations will take part \u2014 the divisions and flashpoints present on the world stage inevitably creep in among the pyrotechnic reveling.",
      "The political divide over Israel\u2019s participation in Basel has already tested the EBU\u2019s impartiality.",
      "Israel shattered a fragile two-month ceasefire earlier this year, as its military intensifies its bombardment of the Gaza Strip and enforces a total blockade of food, medicine and goods from entering the enclave, where more than 50,000 people have been killed, according to Gaza health officials.",
      "The war began following the Hamas-led terror attacks on several sites in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed around 1,200 people. One of those sites was the Nova music festival, where around 360 people were killed.",
      "The singer representing Israel, which first took part in the contest in 1973, is Yuval Raphael \u2014 one of the survivors of that attack.",
      "Last year, Raphael spoke to the United Nations Human Rights Council, describing how she sought refuge in a bomb shelter with other festivalgoers, hiding for eight hours under dead bodies. She told the U.N., \u201cthe physical injuries I sustained are healing, but the mental scars will stay with me forever.\u201d",
      "The EBU bars lyrics it views as political and last year forced Israel\u2019s entry to change lyrics that referenced the Oct. 7 attacks.",
      "While the lyrics of this year\u2019s song, \u201cNew Day Will Rise,\u201d don\u2019t make reference to any events in particular, Galia Press-Barnathan, a professor of international relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, says the message is nevertheless clear."

    "story": [
      "ISTANBUL \u2014 High-stakes peace talks Thursday between Russia and Ukraine that were called for by Vladimir Putin hit speed bumps as the Kremlin confirmed he would be skipping the negotiations and President Donald Trump added that \"nothing\" would happen unless he and his Russian counterpart attended.",
      "Uncertainty over the start date, location and whether either side would even participate made for chaotic scenes in the Turkish capital, Ankara, as well as in Antalya and Istanbul \u2014 where some 200 journalists and crew were massed outside the Ottoman-era Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace with no clear idea of when talks would get underway. The talks were later postponed for Friday.",
      "The build-up to Thursday's talks had included a back and forth between Kyiv, Moscow and the Trump administration which hinted at the possibility of a three-way meeting involving Trump, Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. That did not ultimately materialize.",
      "While speaking to reporters on Air Force One en route to the United Arab Emirates, Trump was asked about the level of the delegation Russia sent to Turkey.",
      "\u201cLook, nothing\u2019s going to happen until Putin and I get together, OK?\u201d he said, adding that Putin did not lead the delegation because Trump had chosen not to attend. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going if I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d",
      "Later on Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that he would meet with the Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul on Friday. Echoing Trump's comments, he reaffirmed that the involvement of both Trump and Putin would be \"the only way we're going to have a breakthrough\" in the war.",
      "Rubio said the U.S. will decide on a timeline for a possible meeting between Trump and Putin after the Friday talks, adding that the president is willing to \u201cstick with\u201d the process as long as it takes to achieve peace.",
      "Prior to Rubio's comments, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had told CNN \u201cno,\u201d when asked whether Putin would be attending talks in Turkey, and had separately said at the time that there were \u201cno preparations\u201d for talks between Putin and Trump in the coming days.",
      "Putin made the suggestion for negotiations \u201cwithout any preconditions\u201d after Ukrainian allies, including Germany, France and Britain presented an ultimatum to Moscow to either accept the ceasefire proposal or face additional sanctions.",
      "The Russian leader's no-show is expected to further antagonize the White House, which has markedly changed its tone over the war in the past weeks. After his historic Oval Office shouting match with Zelenskyy, Vice President JD Vance has shifted to accusing Moscow of \u201casking for too much\u201d in the bilateral peace talks senior Trump administration officials have held with Russia in recent weeks.",
      "That is partly because Trump\u2019s major gripe with Ukraine \u2014 that American taxpayers have mostly funded its defense \u2014 was soothed after the two nations struck a minerals deal that would go some way to repaying American military aid.",
      "Zelenskyy has also presented himself as compliant, backing Trump\u2019s calls for an immediate 30-day ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "Trump has said he is \u201calways considering\u201d additional sanctions against Russia if he believes Moscow is blocking the peace process, with officials also suggesting secondary sanctions on the buyers of Russian oil.",
      "After heeding Trump\u2019s calls to accept Putin\u2019s initial suggestion of talks Sunday, Zelenskyy landed Thursday in Ankara.",
      "Before a planned meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Zelenskyy said he would meet with a broader Turkish delegation, as well as American diplomats.",
      "\u201cThe level of the Russian delegation is not officially known to me yet, but from what we see \u2014 it looks like not a serious level,\u201d Zelenskyy said, using a Ukrainian word meaning \"sham\" or \"theatrical.\"",
      "\u201cWe must understand the level of the Russian delegation and what mandate they have \u2014 whether they are even capable of making any decisions on their own,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause we all know who actually makes decisions in Russia.\u201d",
      "That was instead of joining the talks initially planned for Istanbul, after the Kremlin indicated late Wednesday that rather than Putin, or even Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, it was instead sending a relatively junior team headed by Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin.",
      "While the Kremlin's last-minute naming of a junior team has done little to dispel Ukrainian and European allegations that Putin is not taking Trump's peace-brokering attempts seriously, the Russian delegation that arrived Thursday in Istanbul was \u201cready for serious work,\u201d the Russian Foreign Ministry's Maria Zakharova said at a news briefing the same day.",
      "Ukraine responded to the scaling-down of the talks by vascillating over whether it would even send a delegation to Istanbul, as Kyiv and Moscow appeared to disagree over the start time of talks.",
      "While Russian media initially reported a 10 a.m. local time start (3 a.m. ET) at the Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace, that shifted to midday and then after 5 p.m, before being postponed to Friday.",
      "Further illustrating the confusion in Istanbul, American personnel were seen late Thursday morning still appearing to prepare a venue for a U.S. delegation to use as a base, with officials huddled in urgent meetings and two security staff arriving with a German shepherd dog.",
      "Keir Simmons and Natasha Lebedeva reported from Istanbul, and Mithil Aggarwal from Hong Kong."

      "HAVANA \u2014 Daily blackouts averaging four hours or more have become the new normal across Cuba\u2019s capital of Havana, an unsettling sign of a still-unresolved energy crisis as the sultry Caribbean summer sets in.",
      "Havana\u2019s misfortune follows a string of nationwide blackouts over several months, most recently in March, that plunged the country\u2019s frail grid into near-total disarray, stressed by fuel shortages, natural disaster and economic crisis.",
      "The major commercial hub on the island and a top tourist destination, Havana has long endured occasional blackouts but until this year had been largely shielded from the worst of the outages by the grid operator.",
      "\u201cPeople are stressed,\u201d said Aramis Bueno, a 47-year-old resident of the densely populated Central Havana neighborhood of Dragones, as he sat on his doorstep during an evening blackout this week.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not easy living like this. Look at what time it is. We haven\u2019t been able to shower, to eat ... because of the blackouts.\u201d",
      "The worsening power outages in Havana come as the United States has severely tightened sanctions on Cuba, returning the island nation to a list of state sponsors of terrorism and ratcheting up restrictions on remittances, tourism and trade.",
      "Blackouts in the capital, unlike in much of the rest of the country, are largely scheduled, and far shorter than in the outlying and more rural provinces, where outages sometimes span 15 hours or more per day.",
      "But they are increasingly the talk of the town in Havana.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrible, it\u2019s terrible. The electricity system in this country right now just isn\u2019t working,\u201d said Dayam\u00ed Cheri, 52, a resident of cramped Old Havana. \u201cWith this heat and no electricity, no one can survive.\u201d",
      "Recent outages led to school and workplace closures, reinforcing an already deep shortfall in economic output, which fell 1.9% in 2023. The economy did not expand in 2024, when more severe blackouts set in, though the government has not yet released last year\u2019s growth figures.",
      "There are glimmers of hope, however.",
      "Cuba is making progress this year on a China-backed plan to install more than 50 solar parks capable of churning out more than 1,000 megawatts of electricity.",
      "Eleven such solar parks have been installed since February, offering the promise of a better future, though most Habaneros say they\u2019re still hunkering down for a long summer.",
      "\u201cI was born with blackouts,\u201d said Yasunay Perez, 46, of central Havana. \u201cThis is nothing new.\u201d"
