      "Conservationists and a Native American advocacy group are suing to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources",
      "RENO, Nev. -- Conservationists and an advocacy group for Native Americans are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources.",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.",
      "The new lawsuit says the Interior Department\u2019s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat was \u201cin danger of extinction now\u201d when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.",
      "\u201cOne cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,\u201d said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno.",
      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",
      "Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and \u201cvigorously defend\u201d approval of the project, \u201cwhich was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "Eds: This story has been corrected to show the Western Shoshone Defense Project is a Native American advocacy group, not a recognized tribe."

      "North Carolina elections officials say that more than 4.2 million voters cast ballots at early in-person voting sites, with turnout in western counties hit by Hurricane Helene outpacing the rest of the state",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina had already surpassed its early-voting record set in 2020, but the State Board of Elections announced Sunday that more than 4.2 million voters cast ballots at early in-person voting sites, with turnout in western counties hit by Hurricane Helene outpacing the rest of the state.",
      "Early in-person voting, which ended Saturday, has become increasingly popular in the presidential battleground state over several election cycles. People can simultaneously register to vote and cast ballots at early voting sites.",
      "Four years ago, a record 3.63 million people voted at hundreds of sites in all 100 counties during the early-voting period. This year, the state exceeded that total by Thursday, days before the period ended, the board said.",
      "Including absentee voting, 4,465,548 voters \u2014 or 57% of the state\u2019s 7.8 million registered voters \u2014 cast ballots in the general election as of Sunday morning, officials said, noting that turnout may be slightly higher because of a lag between when ballots are cast and when data is uploaded.",
      "Turnout in the 25 western counties affected by Hurricane Helene was stronger than the rest of the state at 58.9% \u2014 about 2% higher than statewide turnout, officials said.",
      "\u201cI am proud of all of our 100 county boards of elections and the thousands of election workers who are making this happen in their communities,\u201d state board Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell said in a statement. \u201cAnd I am especially proud of the workers and voters of Western North Carolina. You are an inspiration to us all.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s strong early turnout has come partly in response to a push by state and national Republicans to get people to vote early. Their message marks a sharp contrast to the 2020 election, when former President Donald Trump \u2014 without any evidence to back the claim \u2014 said mail-in voting was rife with fraud.",
      "In addition to president, North Carolina residents are choosing a new governor, attorney general and several other statewide positions, along with members of the U.S. House and state General Assembly."

      "The trial of a man accused of killing two teenage girls in a small Indiana community has passed its midway point following more than two weeks of testimony about the 2017 killings",
      "DELPHI, Ind. -- The trial of a man accused of killing two teenage girls in a small Indiana community has passed its midway point following more than two weeks of testimony about the 2017 killings.",
      "Prosecutors rested their case Thursday against Richard Allen after jurors heard recorded phone calls in which he told his wife that he killed Abigail Williams, 13, and Liberty German, 14.",
      "Allen's trial began Oct. 18 at the Carroll County Courthouse in Delphi, the girls\u2019 hometown. Jurors have been sequestered since the begining of the trial, which is scheduled to run through Nov. 15.",
      "The defense began calling its first witnesses Thursday. A psychologist for the Indiana Department of Correction told jurors Friday that Allen was seriously mentally ill when he began confessing to the killings while housed at the Westville Correctional Facility.",
      "Allen, 52, faces up to 130 years in prison if he is convicted on two counts of murder and two additional counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping.",
      "Here are some key moments in the trial so far:",
      "Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas McLeland opened the trial by telling jurors they would see and hear evidence, including incriminating statements Allen has made, that will convince them he forced the girls off a hiking trail into a secluded area while armed with a gun and cut their throats.",
      "Allen was the person seen on cellphone video German recorded on the day the girls disappeared and an unspent bullet found between their bodies came from Allen's gun, McLeland said.",
      "Defense attorney Andrew Baldwin told jurors Allen is innocent. Baldwin said the jury would hear witness statements and forensic evidence that would raise \u201creasonable doubt\u201d that Allen is not the killer and said the state's timeline does not match the evidence in the case.",
      "Someone else may have kidnapped the teens and returned them early the next day to the scene where they were found dead, Baldwin said.",
      "In the first full week of the trial, jurors were shown photographs of the area where the teens' bodies were found in a wooded area off the hiking trail. The girls, known as Abby and Libby, had crossed an abandoned railroad trestle called the Monon High Bridge during their hike.",
      "Some jurors and others in the courtroom gasped or turned away when gruesome images of their bloody bodies were shown, and the girls' mothers wept.",
      "Jurors also viewed cellphone video that German recorded just before the youths vanished showing a man wearing a blue jacket and jeans following Williams as she crosses the Monon High Bridge.",
      "In an enhanced version of the video shown to jurors, one of the girls says, \u201cThere\u2019s no path so we have to go down here.\u201d Just before the video ends, prosecutors said, the man seen in the video tells the teens, \u201c Down the hill.\u201d",
      "Investigators said in an affidavit released about a month after Allen's October 2022 arrest that he became a suspect after they went back and reviewed \u201cprior tips\u201d and found that he had been interviewed by an officer in 2017.",
      "Trial testimony has revealed more details about how they zeroed in on the former pharmacy worker.",
      "A retired state government worker who volunteered in March 2017 to help police with the investigation told jurors that in September 2022 she found paperwork that caught her eye.",
      "Kathy Shank testified she found a \u201clead sheet\u201d saying that two days after German and Williams\u2019 bodies were found, a man contacted authorities and said he had been on the trail the afternoon the girls went missing. His name was listed incorrectly as Richard Allen Whiteman and marked \u201ccleared,\u201d Shank said.",
      "She determined the man\u2019s name was actually Richard Allen and recalled that a young girl had been on the trail at the same location and time and had seen a man.",
      "\u201cI thought there could be a correlation,\u201d Shank testified, adding that she notified officers of her find.",
      "The girls' bodies were found Feb. 14, 2017, the day after they went missing.",
      "Two days later, Allen contacted authorities and told them he was on the hiking trail the afternoon of Feb. 13, during the time period when the girls disappeared, according to testimony.",
      "Dan Dulin, an Indiana Department of Natural Resources captain, told the court he spoke to Allen, who said he was on the hiking trail between 1 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. and remembered seeing three girls.",
      "After Shank brought Allen to investigators\u2019 attention, they interviewed him in October 2022. Allen told investigators he arrived at the trail around noon and left no later than 2 p.m., not 3:30 p.m. as he told Dulin in 2017.",
      "Steve Mullin, who was Delphi's police chief when the girls were killed and later became an investigator at the county prosecutor\u2019s office, said Allen told him and another officer that he was wearing a blue or black Carhartt jacket, jeans and a beanie on the day the teens vanished.",
      "Mullin said he asked Allen if he was the similarly dressed person seen in German\u2019s cellphone video.",
      "\u201cHis response was if the picture was taken with the girls\u2019 camera, there was no way it was him,\u201d Mullin testified.",
      "Prosecutors also showed jurors police interviews with Allen videotaped before his arrest in which he repeatedly professed his innocence.",
      "On Thursday the jury heard several recorded phone calls of Allen speaking with his wife from prison in which he told her that he killed German and Williams. In one of the calls, he said, \u201cI did it. I killed Abby and Libby.\u201d",
      "The jury heard testimony earlier from the former warden of the Westville Correctional Facility, where Allen was previously held, who said Allen claimed to have killed the girls with a box cutter that he later discarded.",
      "Dr. Monica Wala, Allen\u2019s prison psychologist during his time at Westville, testified Allen began confessing to killing the girls in early 2023 during his sessions with her. She said he provided details of the crime in some of the confessions, including telling her he slashed the girls\u2019 throats and put tree branches over their bodies.",
      "A report written by Wala and presented to the jury as an exhibit states Allen also told her he had planned to rape the teens but did not do so after he saw a van traveling nearby.",
      "A state trooper testified Thursday that Allen's remark corroborated a statement by a man whose driveway passes under the Monon High Bridge and who said he was driving home in his van around that time.",
      "Allen's attorneys have said their client made the incriminating statements while under the pressure and mental stress of being locked up and watched 24 hours a day and being taunted by people incarcerated with him.",
      "During cross-examination, Wala acknowledged she followed Allen\u2019s case with interest during her personal time even while she was treating him and that she was a fan of the true crime genre.",
      "Court documents released weeks after Allen\u2019s arrest state that testing determined an unspent bullet found between the girls' bodies \u201chad been cycled through\u201d a pistol Allen owned.",
      "Melissa Oberg, an Indiana State Police firearms expert, told the jury her analysis tied the round to Allen\u2019s Sig Sauer, a .40-caliber handgun.",
      "Allen\u2019s attorney tried to cast doubt on the accuracy of firearms testing during cross-examination. Oberg said she is not aware of making any identification mistakes in her more than 17 years of analyzing firearms."

      "BOSTON -- Firefighters in Massachusetts are continuing to battle stubborn brush fires across the state with officials urging residents to take precautions to help avoid sparking new blazes.",
      "Hundreds of acres (hectares) in the greater Boston area have already burned in the past week with new fires cropping up in the western and central parts of the state.",
      "In Massachusetts, an average of 15 wildland fires are reported each October. This year, the month\u2019s total capped at about 200 \u2014 an increase of about 1,200% over the average, rivalling the monthly numbers usually seen in the traditional early spring brush fire season.",
      "About 100 fire were reported over the last seven days of the month and preliminary information indicates that all of them started with human activity, according to fire officials. The fires prompted some communities last week to cancel school classes and Halloween activities.",
      "On Friday, the National Weather Service declared a \u201cred flag\u201d warning for much of eastern Massachusetts. The warning means that the region, which has been experiencing dry and warm weather, is at high risk of fire.",
      "Fire officials have reminded residents that open burning is prohibited statewide through January and in many communities year-round.",
      "They also urged residents to avoid outdoor cooking and heating and to use caution when using power equipment like lawnmowers and leaf blowers. The engines can become hot enough to ignite dry leaves and grass.",
      "Fire officials also cautioned against tossing cigarette butts, matches, or other smoking materials over the edge of a balcony, stub them out on stairs or railings, or toss them in dry vegetation or debris.",
      "On Saturday, a Boston man was arrested in connection to a brush fire in Milford, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. The man was charged with setting fire to another\u2019s land and burning land, trees, lumber and produce.",
      "More than a quarter of this year's brush and wildland fires took place in October, according to Chief Fire Warden David Celino of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. The October fires have also accounted for more than half of the 1,158 acres (469 hectares) burned so far this year.",
      "\u201cThe weather conditions and dry surface fuels that have contributed to these fast-moving fires are expected to continue in the days ahead,\" Celino said in a press release. \"Any outdoor fire will grow quickly, become difficult to control, and require numerous firefighting resources.\u201d",
      "State Fire Marshal Jon Davine said about 45% of Massachusetts homes are in or near wooded areas at risk for brush and wildland fires. Many of those fires have started with activity around the house, like outdoor cooking and using lawn tractors and other power equipment, he added.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have been transformed from a local armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization with support from Iran, Iraqi armed groups, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militants and others, U.N. experts said in a new report.",
      "The Iranian-backed Houthis have exploited the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and worked to enhance their status in Iran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d to gain popularity in the region and beyond, the experts monitoring sanctions against the Houthis said in the 537-page report to the U.N. Security Council.",
      "To support Iranian-backed Hamas militants, whose surprise attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, sparked the war in Gaza, the Houthis have been attacking vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, disrupting global shipping in a key geopolitical area.",
      "Despite Houthi claims that they would target ships linked to Israel, the panel said its investigations revealed the rebels have been targeting vessels indiscriminately.",
      "Its analysis of data from the International Maritime Organization, the U.S. and the United Kingdom revealed that at least 134 attacks were carried out from Houthi-controlled areas against merchant and commercial vessels and U.S. and U.K. warships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden between Nov. 15, 2023, and July 31, 2024.",
      "\u201cThe group\u2019s shift to actions at sea increased their influence in the region,\u201d the U.N. experts said. \u201cSuch a scale of attacks, using weapon systems on civilian vessels, had never occurred since the Second World War.\u201d",
      "In their attacks, the experts said, the Houthis used a new and previously undisclosed ballistic missile, the Hatem-2.",
      "The five-member U.N. panel includes experts on arms, finance, regional affairs, international humanitarian law and armed groups. The experts hail from India, Egypt, Switzerland, Belgium and Cabo Verde. Confidential sources told the panel that the Houthis are coordinating operations with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and strengthening ties to the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab militant group in Somalia.",
      "The Houthis have been engaged in a civil war with Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they took control of the capital Sanaa and most of the north. Hopes for peace talks to end the war vanished after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks.",

      "The experts said the transformation has been possible due to the transfer of military materiel and training provided by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard\u2019s elite Quds Force, Hezbollah and Iraqi specialists and technicians.",
      "Military experts, Yemeni officials and even officials close to the Houthis indicated that the rebel group couldn\u2019t produce complex weapons systems such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surveillance and attack drones, portable air defense systems, and thermal sights, which they have used without foreign support, the U.N. experts said.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 12:50:21 -0500",
    "summary": "No one knows how Tuesday&rsquo;s presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year",
    "story": [
      "No one knows how Tuesday\u2019s presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve\u2019s move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- No one knows how Tuesday's presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve's move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year.",
      "The presidential contest might still be unresolved when the Fed ends its two-day meeting Thursday afternoon, yet that uncertainty would have no effect on its decision to further reduce its benchmark rate. The Fed's future actions, though, will become more unsettled once a new president and Congress take office in January, particularly if Donald Trump were to win the White House again.",
      "Trump's proposals to impose high tariffs on all imports and launch mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants and his threat to intrude on the Fed's normally independent rate decisions could send inflation surging, economists have said. Higher inflation would, in turn, compel the Fed to slow or stop its rate cuts.",
      "On Thursday, the Fed's policymakers, led by Chair Jerome Powell, are on track to cut their benchmark rate by a quarter-point, to about 4.6%, after having implemented a half-point reduction in September. Economists expect another quarter-point rate cut in December and possibly additional such moves next year. Over time, rate cuts tend to lower the costs of borrowing for consumers and businesses.",
      "The Fed is reducing its rate for a different reason than it usually does: It often cuts rates to boost a sluggish economy and a weak job market by encouraging more borrowing and spending. But the economy is growing briskly, and the unemployment rate is a low 4.1%, the government reported Friday, even with hurricanes and a strike at Boeing having sharply depressed net job growth last month.",
      "Instead, the central bank is lowering rates as part of what Powell has called \u201ca recalibration\u201d to a lower-inflation environment. When inflation spiked to a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, the Fed proceeded to raise rates 11 times \u2014 ultimately sending its key rate to about 5.3%, also the highest in four decades.",
      "But in September, year-over-year inflation dropped to 2.4%, barely above the Fed's 2% target and equal to its level in 2018. With inflation having fallen so far, Powell and other Fed officials have said they think high borrowing rates are no longer necessary. High borrowing rates typically restrict growth, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as housing and auto sales.",
      "\u201cThe restriction was in place because inflation was elevated,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed economist. \u201cInflation is no longer elevated. The reason for the restriction is gone.\u201d",
      "Fed officials have suggested that their rate cuts would be gradual. But nearly all of them have expressed support for some further reductions.",
      "\u201cFor me, the central question is how much and how fast to reduce the target for the (Fed's key) rate, which I believe is currently set at a restrictive level,\u201d Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Directors, said in a speech last month.",
      "Jonathan Pingle, an economist at Swiss bank UBS, said that Waller's phrasing reflected \u201cunusual confidence and conviction that rates were headed lower.\"",
      "Next year, the Fed will likely start to wrestle with the question of just how low their benchmark rate should go. Eventually, they may want to set it at a level that neither restricts nor stimulates growth \u2014 \u201cneutral\u201d in Fed parlance.",
      "Powell and other Fed officials acknowledge that they don't know exactly where the neutral rate is. In September, the Fed's rate-setting committee estimated that it was 2.9%. Most economists think it's closer to 3% to 3.5%.",
      "The Fed chair said the officials have to assess where neutral is by how the economy responds to rate cuts. For now, most officials are confident that at 4.9%, the Fed's current rate is far above neutral.",
      "Some economists argue, though, that with the economy looking healthy even with high borrowing rates, the Fed doesn't need to ease credit much, if at all. The idea is that they may already be close to the level of interest rates that neither slows nor stimulates the economy.",
      "\u201cIf the unemployment rate stays in the low 4's and the economy is still going to grow at 3%, does it matter that the (Fed's) rate is 4.75% to 5%?\u201d said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, asked. \u201cWhy are they cutting now?\u201d",
      "With the Fed's latest meeting coming right after Election Day, Powell will likely field questions at his news conference Thursday about the outcome of the presidential race and how it might affect the economy and inflation. He can be expected to reiterate that the Fed's decisions aren't affected by politics at all.",
      "During Trump's presidency, he imposed tariffs on washing machines, solar panels, steel and a range of goods from China, which President Joe Biden maintained. Though studies show that washing machine prices rose as a result, overall inflation did not rise much.",
      "But Trump is now proposing significantly broader tariffs \u2014 essentially, import taxes \u2014 that would raise the prices of about 10 times as many goods from overseas.",
      "Many mainstream economists are alarmed by Trump\u2019s latest proposed tariffs, which they say would almost certainly reignite inflation. A report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that Trump\u2019s main tariff proposals would make inflation 2 percentage points higher next year than it otherwise would have been.",
      "The Fed could be more likely to raise rates in response to tariffs this time, according to economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics, \"given that Trump is threatening much bigger increases in tariffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cAccordingly,\" they wrote, \u201cwe will scale back the reduction in the funds rate in our 2025 forecasts if Trump wins.\u201d",

      "In 1989, Americans were riveted by the shotgun murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills mansion by their own children",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- In 1989, Americans were riveted by the shotgun murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills mansion by their own children. Lyle and Erik Menendez were sentenced to life in prison and lost all subsequent appeals. But today, more than three decades later, they unexpectedly have a chance of getting out.",
      "Not because of the workings of the legal system. Because of entertainment.",
      "After two recent documentaries and a scripted drama on the pair brought new attention to the 35-year-old case, the Los Angeles district attorney has recommended they be resentenced.",
      "The popularity and proliferation of true crime entertainment like Netflix\u2019s docudrama \u201cMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story\u201d is effecting real life changes for their subjects and in society more broadly. At their best, true crime podcasts, streaming series and social media content can help expose injustices and right wrongs.",
      "But because many of these products prioritize entertainment and profit, they also can have serious negative consequences.",
      "The use of true crime stories to sell a product has a long history in America, from the tabloid \u201cpenny press\u201d papers of the mid-1800s to television movies like 1984's \u201cThe Burning Bed.\" These days it's podcasts, bingeable Netflix series and even true crime TikToks. The fascination with the genre may be considered morbid by some, but it can be partially explained by the human desire to make sense of the world through stories.",
      "In the case of the Menendez brothers, Lyle, who was then 21, and Erik, then 18, have said they feared their parents were about to kill them to prevent the disclosure of the father\u2019s long-term sexual molestation of Erik. But at their trial, many of the sex abuse allegations were not allowed to be presented to the jury, and prosecutors contended they committed murder simply to get at their parents\u2019 money.",
      "For years, that's the story that many people who watched the saga from a distance accepted and talked about.",
      "The new dramas delve into the brothers' childhood, helping the public better understand the context of the crime and thus see the world as a less frightening place, says Adam Banner, a criminal defense attorney who writes a column on pop culture and the law for the American Bar Association\u2019s ABA Journal.",
      "\u201cNot only does that make us feel better intrinsically,\" Banner says, \u201cbut it also objectively gives us the ability to think, \u2018Well, now I can take this case and put it in a different bucket than another situation where I have no explanation and the only thing I can say is, \u2018This child just must be evil.'\u201d",
      "Much true crime of the past takes particularly shocking crimes and explores them in depth, generally with the assumption that those convicted of the crime were actually guilty and deserved to be punished.",
      "The success of the podcast \u201c Serial,\u201d which cast doubt on the murder conviction of Adnan Syed, has given birth to a newer genre that often assumes (and intends to prove) the opposite. The protagonists are innocent, or \u2014 as in the case of the Menendez brothers \u2014 guilty but sympathetic, and thus not deserving of their harsh sentences.",
      "\u201cThere is an old tradition of journalists picking apart criminal cases and showing that people are potentially innocent,\u201d says Maurice Chammah, a staff writer at The Marshall Project and author of \u201cLet the Lord Sort Them: The Rise and Fall of the Death Penalty.\"",
      "\u201cBut I think that the curve kind of goes up exponentially in the wake of \u2018Serial,\u2019 which was 2014 and obviously changed the entire landscape economically and culturally of podcasts,\" Chammah says. \"And then you have \u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 come along a few years later and become a kind of behemoth example of that in docuseries.\u201d",
      "Roughly during the same time period, the innocence movement gained traction along with the Black Lives Matter movement and greater attention on police custody deaths. And in popular culture, both fiction and nonfiction, the trend is to mine a villainous character's backstory.",
      "\u201cAll these superheroes, supervillains, the movie \u2018Joker' \u2014 you\u2019re just inundated with this idea that people\u2019s bad behavior is shaped by trauma when they were younger,\u201d Chammah said.",
      "Banner often represents some of the least sympathetic defendants imaginable, including those accused of child sexual abuse. He says the effects of these cultural trends are real. Juries today are more likely to give his clients the benefit of the doubt and are more skeptical of police and prosecutors. But he also worries about the intense focus in current true crime on cases where things went wrong, which he says are the outliers.",
      "While the puzzle aspect of \u201cDid they get it right?\u201d might feed our curiosity, he says, we run the risk of sowing distrust in the entire criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to take away the positive ramifications that putting that spotlight on a case can bring. But you also don\u2019t want to give off the impression that this is how our justice system works. That if we can get enough cameras and microphones on a case, then that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to save somebody off of death row or that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to get a life sentence overturned.\u201d",
      "Adds Chammah: \"If you open up sentencing decisions and second looks and criminal justice policy to pop culture \u2014 in the sense of who gets a podcast made about them, who gets Kim Kardashian talking about them \u2014 the risk of extreme arbitrariness is really great. ... It feels like it\u2019s only a matter of time before the wealthy family of some defendant basically funds a podcast that tries to make a viral case for their innocence.\u201d",
      "Whitney Phillips, who teaches a class on true crime and media ethics at the University of Oregon, says the popularity of the genre on social media adds another layer of complications, often encouraging active participation of viewer and listeners.",
      "\u201cBecause these are not trained detectives or people who have any actual subject area expertise in forensics or even criminal law, then there\u2019s this really common outcome of the wrong people being implicated or floated as suspects,\" she says. \"Also, the victims' families now are part of the discourse. They might be accused of this, that, or the other, or at the very least, you have your loved one's murder, violent death, being entertainment for millions of strangers.\u201d",
      "This sensibility has been both chronicled and lampooned in the streaming comedy-drama series \u201cOnly Murders in the Building,\u201d which follows three unlikely collaborators who live in a New York apartment building where a murder has taken place. The trio decide to make a true crime podcast while simultaneously trying to solve the case.",
      "Nothing about true crime is fundamentally unethical, Phillips says. \u201cIt\u2019s that the social media system \u2014 the attention economy \u2014 is not calibrated for ethics. It\u2019s calibrated for views, it\u2019s calibrated for engagement and it\u2019s calibrated for sensationalism.\"",
      "Many influencers are now vying for the \u201cmurder audience,\u201d Phillips says, with social media and more traditional media feeding off each other. True crime is now creeping into lifestyle content and even makeup tutorials.",
      "\u201cIt was sort of inevitable that you would see the collision of these two things and having these influencers literally just put on a face of makeup and then tell a very kind of \u2014 it\u2019s very informal, it\u2019s very dishy, it\u2019s often not particularly well researched,\" she says. \u201cThis is not investigative journalism.\u201d"

      "On the final Sunday of a rollercoaster presidential contest, Republican nominee Donald Trump is asking voters in Pennsylvania again to make him leader of a \u201cfailed nation\u201d while also unleashing a profane, conspiracy-laden rant asserting U.S. elections ...",
      "LITITZ, Pa. -- LITITZ, Pa. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump delivered a profane and conspiracy-laden speech two days before Tuesday's presidential election, talking about reporters being shot and suggesting he \u201cshouldn't have left\u201d the White House after his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "In remarks Sunday that bore little resemblance to the speech he's been delivering at his recent rallies, the former president repeatedly cast doubt on the integrity of the vote and resurrected old grievances after trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat. Trump intensified his verbal attacks on what he cast as a \u201cdemonic\u201d Democratic Party and the American media, steering his rally in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, at one point to the topic of violence against members of the press.",
      "He noted the ballistic glass that is used to protect him at outdoor events after a gunman's assassination attempt in July and pointed to openings between the panels.",
      "\u201cI have this piece of glass here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don\u2019t mind that so much.\u201d",
      "It was the second time in recent days that Trump has talked about guns being pointed at people he considers enemies. He suggested former Rep. Liz Cheney, a prominent Republican critic, wouldn\u2019t be willing to support foreign wars if she had \u201cnine barrels shooting at her.\u201d",
      "Facing criticism for suggesting violence against the media, Trump's campaign later played down his comments.",
      "\u201cThe President\u2019s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else,\u201d Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement. Instead he claimed that Trump was suggesting that reporters were in \u201cgreat danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also. There can be no other interpretation of what was said. He was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!\u201d",
      "Trump also revived falsehoods about elections and argued that he can only lose to Democrat Kamala Harris if he is cheated, even though polls suggest a very tight race.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a crooked country,\" Trump railed to his crowd on a chilly airport tarmac, returning to the grievance that had defined the early days of his campaign. \u201cThey\u2019ll want to put you in jail because you want to make it straight. Think of it, think of it. They cheat in elections and you call them on it and they want to put you in jail.\u201d",
      "Trump was indicted for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in both Washington and Georgia.",
      "Some of his allies, notably former chief strategist Steve Bannon, have encouraged Trump to prematurely declare victory on Tuesday night after polls close even if the race is too early to call. That's what Trump did four years ago, kicking off months of denial and lies that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "For much of this year, Trump had run a relatively disciplined campaign, emphasizing the issues his aides believe can deliver him victory, even as he clung to false theories about voter fraud and frequently went on digressions, stirring controversy. But that discipline is increasingly collapsing.",
      "Trump in recent weeks has joked about golfer Arnold Palmer's genitalia, continued using gendered or sexist language in his efforts to win over women and staged a rally at New York's Madison Square Garden with speakers who made crude and racist insults that continue to dominate the headlines.",
      "The darker and more profane tone of his campaign has comes as the former president, who has long been a fan of the masculine pageantry of the WWE, has been entering his rallies to the ominous tolling bell music once used by the wrestler known as \u201cThe Undertaker.\"",
      "Trump had nonetheless been delivering what was a fairly consistent stump speech most days, aided by a series of videos that kept him on script, even as he veered from subject to subject in a discursive style he has labeled \u201cthe weave.\u201d But outside the Lancaster airport, he completely abandoned his planned remarks, skipping his usual points on the economy, immigration and rote criticisms of Harris.",
      "Trump's remarks in Pennsylvania were not planned according to a person familiar with them, who noted Trump is known to ad-lib. While it was unclear exactly what had set Trump off, his campaign had released a memo earlier in the day criticizing new polling from The New York Times again showing the race extremely close in the seven major swing states.",
      "Trump had spoken by phone before he took the stage with two reporters who had mentioned polling, including one who had asked him if he thought there was any way he could lose.",
      "Trump has been frustrated that the campaign remains locked in a close fight to the finish. He thinks Harris is an unworthy opponent and he cannot understand why he isn't dominating, said one Republican familiar with the dynamics of the campaign who, like others, was granted anonymity to discuss it.",
      "Another Republican blamed last-minute anxiety -- and Trump having to trust a system that he believes is rigged against him.",
      "Still, several Trump allies applauded his speech, saying that they were glad he was shining a light on concerns about fraud in the race's final stretch.",
      "Harris pushed back at Trump's characterizations of U.S. elections, telling reporters on Sunday that Trump's comments are \u201cmeant to distract from the fact that we have and support free and fair elections in our country.\u201d Those \u201cgood systems\u201d were in place in 2020, Harris said, and \u201che lost.\u201d",
      "The vice president said she trusts the upcoming vote tally and urged voters, \u201cin particular people who have not yet voted to not fall for this tactic, which I think includes suggesting to people that if they vote, their vote won't matter.\u201d",
      "Trump, for his part, acknowledged that he was sidestepping his usual approach with his conspiratorial speech. He repeatedly talked about disregarding the advice of his aides, repeating their feedback in a mocking voice and insisting that he had to talk about election fraud despite their objections.",
      "In his next appearance a few hours later at an airport in Kinston, North Carolina, Trump returned to much of his usual script, alternating between prepared remarks and familiar stories.",
      "At one point, he said, \u201chopefully, we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,\u201d undercutting the Senate Republican leader who endorsed Trump earlier this year despite blaming him for the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.",
      "\u201cCan you believe he endorsed me?\u201d Trump added a minute later with a laugh. \u201cThat must have been a painful day in his life.\u201d",
      "He took the stage a third time Sunday night in Macon, Georgia, sticking more closely to his prepared remarks and focusing heavily on immigration.",

      "Orlando Harris\u2019 family pleaded with police to confiscate the 19-year-old\u2019s bullet-proof vest, ammunition and AR-15-style rifle",
      "Orlando Harris\u2019 family pleaded with Missouri police to confiscate the 19-year-old\u2019s bullet-proof vest, ammunition and AR-15-style rifle. They knew his mental health was fragile after more than one suicide attempt. But the best officers could do in a state with some of the most expansive gun rights is suggest Harris keep the weapon in a storage unit.",
      "Nine days later, Harris entered his former St. Louis high school and declared, \u201cAll of you are going to die.\u201d",
      "A new 456-page police report details the efforts Harris' family took to try to take his gun away in the days before he walked into Central Visual Arts and Performing Arts High School on Oct. 24, 2022, when he killed a student and a teacher and wounded seven others before he was fatally shot by police.",
      "Missouri is not among the 21 states with a red-flag law. Also known as extreme risk protection orders, red-flag laws are intended to restrict the purchase of guns or temporarily remove them from people who may hurt themselves or someone else.",
      "The case highlights how hard it is for law enforcement to restrict gun access, even when there are clues something is deeply amiss.",
      "After an Army reservist killed 18 people in October 2023 in Lewiston, Maine, an investigation found missed opportunities to intervene in the shooter\u2019s psychiatric crisis. And before a 14-year-old was charged in a deadly shooting this fall at his Georgia high school, a deputy talked to him about an online threat and family warned of an \u201cextreme emergency.\u201d",
      "The investigation report in Harris' case shows the first time he attempted suicide was in the fall of 2021, just before he was scheduled to leave for college. Pandemic disruptions, the arrest of a friend in a homicide and a car wreck all may have contributed to his depression, his family and former boss told investigators.",
      "The police report makes no mention of him attending college. Instead, he worked in the cafeteria at a senior facility, where he sometimes discussed guns with coworkers.",
      "The following August he met with a Washington University psychiatry resident, telling her he thought about shooting people at his old school. He said those thoughts lasted for just one evening and went away, and that there was no planning and he didn\u2019t want to do it.",
      "But soon after, Harris began a countdown to the shooting. His plans included detailed maps of the school and a plan to target teachers, students and the LGBTQ community. He also had plans to burn down his family's home with them inside.",
      "The psychiatrist prescribed medications, but Harris didn\u2019t fill the prescriptions. The report says they developed an emergency plan.",
      "Washington University did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Harris then stopped showing up for appointments.",
      "On Oct. 8, he tried to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer in St. Charles, Missouri, but the transaction was blocked by an FBI background check. The report doesn't explain why, and police didn't respond to an email from the AP. The FBI merely provided a list of the 12 reasons for a denial with no other details.",
      "Then on Oct. 10, Harris drove to a nearby suburb to pay a man $580 in cash for the rifle used in the shooting.",
      "Harris\u2019 family grew more concerned on Oct. 15, when two packages from gun and ammunition suppliers arrived. One of his sisters, Noneeka Harris, opened them, finding a body armor vest, magazine holsters and magazines. She then searched his bedroom and found the rifle inside an old TV box.",
      "Harris' mother, Tanya Ward, called BJC Mental Health Services and staff there \u201cdeemed the situation as an immediate threat.\u201d They advised her to take the items to the police department and tell officers about her son\u2019s mental illness.",
      "Police at the station told her they couldn\u2019t take the firearm because Harris was of legal age to possess it. They said she should head home and an officer would meet them there. By the time she returned, Harris was home and insistent that he keep the gun.",
      "His mother was adamant that the gun not be in the house, so the officers suggested a storage unit. The report said the officers also advised her on steps she needed to take to have her son deemed mentally unstable.",
      "Federal law has banned some mentally ill people from buying guns since 1968, including those deemed a danger to themselves or others, who have been involuntarily committed, or judged not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.",
      "Ultimately, the firearm and other items were loaded into the trunk of Harris' sister's vehicle, including a box of ammunition that arrived the next day. She later drove her brother to a storage facility, which was about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the high school.",
      "She told police she \u201cknew something was going to happen.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 24, shots rang out as Harris entered his former high school.",
      "It is unclear why Harris targeted the school. A security officer recalled him as somewhat popular and his grade school principal said he wasn\u2019t bullied, according to the investigative report. But as he fired at a dance class, one student told police she heard someone yell, \u201cI hate this school. I hate everybody.\u201d",
      "Fatally wounded, Alexzandria Bell initially ran toward the entrance before slumping to the ground, a security officer reassuring the 10th grader that help was on the way. But then she went quiet.",
      "One class jumped out a window to escape after their physical education teacher, 61-year-old Jean Kuczka, stood between them and Harris. Kuckza was killed.",
      "Harris eventually made his way to the third floor, hiding in a computer lab. The first officer to charge into the lab had a daughter at the school.",
      "\u201cI had everything to lose,\u201d the officer, who was among those to open fire, recalled in the police report. He texted his daughter afterward, telling her, \u201cI killed him.\u201d",
      "Harris' sister told investigators that when she heard about the shooting, she started driving toward the school but then went home instead, waking up her mother who had worked overnight.",
      "Harris' mother later checked her voicemail. There was a message from a hospital asking if she still needed help with her son."

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has ruled that Iowa can continue challenging the validity of hundreds of ballots from potential noncitizens",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- A federal judge ruled Sunday that Iowa can continue challenging the validity of hundreds of ballots from potential noncitizens even though critics said the effort threatens the voting rights of people who\u2019ve recently become U.S. citizens.",
      "U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher, an appointee of President Joe Biden, sided with the state in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in the Iowa capital of Des Moines on behalf of the League of Latin American Citizens of Iowa and four recently naturalized citizens. The four were on the state\u2019s list of questionable registrations to be challenged by local elections officials.",
      "The state\u2019s Republican attorney general and secretary of state argued that investigating and potentially removing 2,000 names from the list would prevent illegal voting by noncitizens. GOP officials across the U.S. have made possible voting by noncitizen immigrants a key election-year talking point even though it is rare. Their focus has come with former President Donald Trump falsely suggesting that his opponents already are committing fraud to prevent his return to the White House.",
      "In his ruling Sunday, Locher pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court decision four days prior that allowed Virginia to resume a similar purge of its voter registration rolls even though it was impacting some U.S. citizens. He also cited the Supreme Court's recent refusal to review a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision on state electoral laws surrounding provisional ballots. Those Supreme Court decisions advise lower courts to \u201cact with great caution before awarding last-minute injunctive relief,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Locher also said the state's effort does not remove anyone from the voter rolls, but rather requires some voters to use provisional ballots.",
      "In a statement on Sunday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, celebrated the ruling.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a victory for election integrity,\" Reynolds said. \"In Iowa, while we encourage all citizens to vote, we will enforce the law and ensure those votes aren\u2019t cancelled out by the illegal vote of a non-citizen.\u201d",
      "Rita Bettis Austen, legal director for the ACLU of Iowa, said some voters could be disenfranchised due to the ruling and Secretary of State Paul Pate's directive.",
      "\u201cWe are obviously disappointed with the court\u2019s decision not to outright block Secretary Pate\u2019s directive, which we still fear threatens to disenfranchise eligible voters simply because they are people who became citizens in the past several years,\" Austen said in a written statement. \u201cEven the Secretary agrees that the vast majority of voters on his list are United States citizens.\u201d",
      "Even still, Austen said the lawsuit forced Pate to back away from forcing everyone on the list to vote provisionally only. County auditors may permit a voter on the list to cast a regular ballot if they deem it appropriate, and voters can prove they are citizens with documentation, she added.",
      "After Locher had a hearing in the ACLU\u2019s lawsuit Friday, Pate and state Attorney General Brenna Bird issued a statement saying that Iowa had about 250 noncitizens registered to vote, but the Biden administration wouldn\u2019t provide data about them.",
      "Pate told reporters last month that his office was forced to rely upon a list of potential noncitizens from the Iowa Department of Transportation. It named people who registered to vote or voted after identifying themselves as noncitizens living in the U.S. legally when they previously sought driver\u2019s licenses.",
      "\"Today\u2019s court victory is a guarantee for all Iowans that their votes will count and not be canceled out by illegal votes,\u201d Bird said in the statement issued after Sunday's decision.",
      "But ACLU attorneys said Iowa officials were conceding that most of the people on the list are eligible to vote and shouldn\u2019t have been included. They said the state was violating naturalized citizens\u2019 voting rights by wrongfully challenging their registrations and investigating them if they cast ballots.",
      "Pate issued his directive Oct. 22, only two weeks before the Nov. 5 election, and ACLU attorneys argued that federal law prohibits such a move so close to Election Day.",
      "The people on the state\u2019s list of potential noncitizens may have become naturalized citizens after their statements to the Department of Transportation. Pate\u2019s office told county elections officials to challenge their ballots and have them cast provisional ballots instead. That would leave the decision of whether they will be counted to local officials upon further review, with voters having seven days to provide proof of their U.S. citizenship.",
      "In his ruling, Locher wrote that Pate backed away from some of his original hardline positions at an earlier court hearing. Pate's attorney said the Secretary of State is no longer aiming to require local election officials to challenge the votes of each person on his list or force voters on the list to file provisional ballots even when they have proven citizenship at a polling place.",
      "Federal law and states already make it illegal for noncitizens to vote, and the first question on Iowa\u2019s voter registration form asks whether a person is a U.S. citizen. The form also requires potential voters to sign a statement saying they are citizens, warning them that if they lie, they can be convicted of a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.",
      "Locher\u2019s ruling also came after a federal judge had halted a similar program in Alabama challenged by civil rights groups and the U.S. Department of Justice. Testimony from state officials in that case showed that roughly 2,000 of the more than 3,200 voters who were made inactive were actually legally registered citizens.",
      "In Iowa\u2019s case, noncitizens who are registered are potentially only a tiny fraction of the state\u2019s 2.2 million registered voters.",
      "But Locher wrote that it appears to be undisputed that some portion of the names on Pate\u2019s list are registered voters who are not U.S. citizens. Even if that portion is small, an injunction effectively would force local election officials to let ineligible voters cast ballots, he added.",
      "Democrats and Republicans have been engaged in a sprawling legal fight over this year\u2019s election for months. Republicans have filed dozens of lawsuits challenging various aspects of vote-casting after being chastised repeatedly by judges in 2020 for bringing complaints about how the election was run only after votes were tallied. Democrats have their own team of dozens of staffers fighting GOP cases.",
      "Immigrants gain citizenship through a process called naturalization, which includes establishing residency, proving knowledge of basic American history and institutions as well as taking an oath of allegiance to the United States.",

      "Justices Karen Baker and Rhonda Wood are running to replace outgoing Chief Justice Dan Kemp in this year's nonpartisan runoff. Baker and Wood were the top two finishers in a four-person race for the court in March, but neither garnered the majority necessary to win the race outright.",
      "Arkansas' court is technically nonpartisan, but Republican-backed justices hold a 4-3 majority on the court. That majority is set to expand to 5-2, no matter who wins the race, with GOP Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders slated to fill two vacancies on the court next year.",
      "Baker or Wood will become the first woman elected chief justice in the state. Betty Dickey was appointed to serve as the court's chief justice in 2003.",
      "Wood, who was first elected to the court in 2014 and then reelected in 2022, has the backing of Republicans including Sanders and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton. The Republican Party of Arkansas' state committee also has endorsed her candidacy.",
      "Wood, however, said she believes her experience on the court shows she is an independent voice and not ruling in line with either party.",
      "\u201cI think I have made decisions consistently with the law, but not necessarily maybe one party or another would agree with,\" Wood told The Associated Press.",
      "Baker, who has served on the court since 2011, did not respond to multiple messages from the AP requesting an interview. Baker won reelection in 2022, defeating a former Republican lawmaker who touted himself as a constitutional conservative.",
      "In interviews, Baker has said she has proven herself to be nonpartisan.",
      "\u201cI think my opponent has demonstrated she is not,\u201d she told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, when asked about Sanders' political action committee supporting Wood's campaign.",
      "Arkansas' court races have been targeted in past years by conservative groups that have spent heavily on efforts to push the court further to the right.

      "The two candidates split most recently on a lawsuit over an abortion rights measure that would have scaled back a state ban that took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned.",
      "Wood wrote the court\u2019s 4-3 majority opinion that upheld the state\u2019s decision to reject petitions submitted in favor of the proposal. The court ruled sponsors of the measure did not comply with paperwork requirements for paid signature gatherers.",
      "In a blistering dissent, Baker asked, \u201cWhy are the respondent and the majority determined to keep this particular vote from the people?\u201d",
      "When asked what the opinions clarified about the difference between the justices, Wood said, \u201cI think it's clear which comes across as more judicially restrained versus an opinion that's sort of trying to sway public emotion.\"",
      "Baker has touted her experience on the bench and previously cited improving attorney licensure as an area she would like to focus on if elected.",
      "Wood has said she would like to push for changes to the court system to make it more accessible, including text notifications of hearings and alternative options for court attendance including nights courts and virtual courts.",
      "\u201cThere's a lot of finite kind of pinpoint things I want to do specifically but the theme is making it way more transparent and citizen-friendly,\u201d Wood said.",
      "Whoever loses the race will still remain on the court, but the election will give Sanders a second appointment to make next year. Justice Courtney Hudson was elected in March to a position on her court that is different from her own, creating a vacancy. Hudson will replace Cody Hiland, who Sanders appointed to the court last year."

      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The president of Cyprus said Sunday his administration is committed to expanding defense and security cooperation with the U.S., as his meeting with American President Joe Biden last week charted a course for the \u201cnext ambitious steps\u201d in bilateral relations that are currently at a \u201chistoric high.\u201d",
      "President Nikos Christodoulides says his government's \u201cclear foreign policy orientation\u201d has resulted in deepening the Cyprus-U.S. strategic partnership over the first 18 months of his five-year term in fields including law enforcement cooperation on countering money laundering and sanctions evasion, as well as energy.",
      "A centerpiece of that security cooperation is the U.S.-funded center for port and maritime security known by its acronym CYCLOPS where officials from neighboring countries including Libya, Yemen and Lebanon, receive key training ranging from cybersecurity to ship inspections.",
      "Christodoulides said his Oct. 30 visit to the White House \u201cis proof and recognition of the geostrategic role of Cyprus and the country\u2019s potential and capabilities.\u201d",
      "\u201cCyprus can be a reliable \u2018port of stability\u2019 and at the same time a country that has a vision to transform its immediate region, alongside its partners, into a region of promise, stability, cooperation and prosperity,\" Christodoulides said in an email response to an Associated Press questionnaire.",
      "The Cypriot president said his administration is \u201ccertainly considering\u201d procuring U.S.-made weapons following the 2020 lifting of a decades-long arms embargo. But what must precede such purchases is for the U.S. Congress to lift its embargo for an extended period. Currently, that is renewed annually.",
      "Christodoulides said Cyprus\u2019 geostrategic role is highlighted by the fact that since Sept. 27, some 3,635 third-country nationals from 29 countries have been repatriated through the island nation following their evacuation from Lebanon. He said several countries consider Cyprus an \u201cassisted departure hub and a Temporary Safe Location (TSL)\u201d where the island\u2019s ports, airports and designated temporary accommodations are used for civilian or military-led departures. He did not specify those countries.",
      "He said Cyprus is ready to respond if and when a mass evacuation from Lebanon is set in motion.",
      "Another key initiative for which Cyprus has gained international plaudits and was singled out by Biden is the so-called Amalthea plan that saw the establishment of the Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor through which some 20,000 metric tons of aid flowed into the Palestinian territory earlier this year.",
      "Most of that aid reached Gaza through a U.S.-built, $230 million temporary pier project that lasted about four months after being beset by turbulent weather, security threats and sweeping personnel restrictions.",
      "Christodoulides said work is underway in cooperation with the U.S. the U.K. the United Arab Emirates and the European Union, to re-activate the maritime route to Gaza through the Israeli port of Ashdod. Collected aid will be security-screened in Cyprus and shipped to Ashdod \u201cfor swift onward delivery to Gaza.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe maintain excellent, longstanding relations with our neighboring countries, underpinned by trust, and we have consistently acted as the region\u2019s voice in the European Union, and as a reliable interlocutor and partner with all the states of the region,\u201d Christodoulides said.",
      "On his decision to invite FBI and U.S. Department of Justice officials to help Cypriot law enforcement to halt Russian sanctions evasion through Cypriot lawyers and accountants, Christodoulides said, \u201cwe are strongly determined to clear our country\u2019s name internationally and prove that Cyprus is a state fully aligned with the principles and values of the West.\u201d",
      "He said \u201cseveral cases\u201d of possible sanctions evasion are under investigation\u201c and the aim is to bring them to justice as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Regarding energy cooperation, Christodoulides said the fact that both U.S. energy giants ExxonMobil and Chevron are active in the search for hydrocarbons in Cyprus\u2019 offshore economic zone is \u201ca vote of confidence\u201d in the island nation.",
      "He said next year will be a \u201cmilestone\u201d for both energy companies. ExxonMobil and partner QatarEnergy, which discovered a sizeable natural gas deposit in one of two areas, or blocks, they hold exploration licenses for, are scheduled to drill two additional wells in January of next year.",
      "Chevron is expected to complete fine-tuning a revised development plan for its Aphrodite gas field, estimated to hold around 4.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.",
      "\u201cAs the first gas from the Aphrodite is directed to the market, this automatically makes Cyprus a gas seller, which is extremely important not only in monetary terms but also for geopolitical reasons,\u201d said Christodoulides."

      "The results on Election Day will come down to Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin",
      "WASHINGTON -- The results on Election Day will come down to seven states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have visited them the most. Together, these states are likely to deliver the Electoral College votes needed for the winning candidate to get a majority of 270.",
      "It will be a game of hopscotch to keep up with key times in each of the states, which stretch across four different time zones.",
      "A look at the Election Day timeline across the seven, with all listings in Eastern Standard Time:",
      "Polls open at 8 a.m. in Arizona, which Joe Biden carried in 2020 by 0.3%. He was only the second Democratic presidential candidate to do so in nearly 70 years. Polls will close at 9 p.m.",
      "Arizona does not release votes until all precincts have reported or one hour after all polls are closed, whichever is first.",
      "In 2020, The Associated Press first reported Arizona results at 10:02 p.m. ET on Nov. 3, Election Day, and declared Biden the winner at 2:51 a.m. ET on Nov. 4.",
      "Polls open at 7 a.m. in Georgia, which played a key role in 2020. Biden was the first Democrat in a White House race to carry the state since Bill Clinton in 1992, defeating Trump by less than one-quarter of a percentage point, a margin of 11,779 votes.",
      "Since then, Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn those results have been at the heart of a criminal case in Fulton County. It is on hold while his legal team pursues a pretrial appeal to have District Attorney Fani Willis removed from the case and the indictment tossed. The Georgia Court of Appeals will hear those arguments after the election.",
      "Georgia's polls close at 7 p.m.",
      "In 2020, the AP first reported Georgia results at 7:20 p.m. ET on Nov. 3 and declared Biden the state's winner at 7:58 p.m. ET on Nov. 19, more than two weeks after Election Day.",
      "Polls open at 7 a.m. ET in Michigan, one of the \u201cblue wall\u201d states that went narrowly for Trump in 2016 after almost 30 years of voting for Democratic candidates. Biden won it back four years later. His margin was about 154,000 votes out of more than 5.5 million votes.",
      "Michigan covers two time zones, but polls in most of the state close at 8 p.m. ET, with the rest at 9 p.m. ET.",
      "In 2020, the AP first reported Michigan results at 8:08 p.m. ET on Nov. 3 and declared Biden the winner at 5:58 p.m. ET on Nov. 4.",
      "Polls open at 10 a.m. ET in Nevada, the smallest electoral vote prize of the battlegrounds. But it has one of the best track records as a presidential bellwether. The candidate who won Nevada has gone on to win the White House in 27 of the past 30 presidential elections.",
      "Polls close at 10 p.m. ET. The state doesn\u2019t release results until the last person in line has voted, so there\u2019s usually been a wait between poll close and the first results.",
      "In 2020, the AP first reported Nevada results at 11:41 p.m. ET on Nov. 3 and declared Biden the winner at 12:13 p.m. ET on Nov. 7.",
      "Polls open at 6:30 a.m. ET in North Carolina, which has been carried by Democrats only two times in presidential elections since 1968. But the state has stayed competitive for both major parties. Trump\u2019s 2020 victory in North Carolina, by about 1 percentage point, was his smallest winning margin in any state.",
      "Polls close at 7:30 p.m. ET.",

      "Polls open at 7 a.m. ET in Pennsylvania, another \u201cblue wall\" state. Biden\u2019s 2020 margin in Pennsylvania was about 80,000 votes out of more than 6.9 million votes. This year, it's the spot where Harris and Trump met for the first time at their sole debate in September in Philadelphia.",

    "title": "A TV as big as a bed? With the holidays approaching, stores stock more supersize sets",
    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 09:22:30 -0500",
    "summary": "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
    "story": [
      "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
      "NEW YORK -- For some television viewers, size apparently does matter.",
      "Forget the 65-inch TVs that were considered bigger than average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 8 feet across. That's wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a king-size bed.",
      "Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year, according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise tepid television market, according to analysts.",
      "The 38.1 million televisions sold with a width of at least 97 inches between January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs \u2014 the 19 models range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 \u2014 and introduced displays in roughly 70% of its stores.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really taken off this year,\" Blake Hampton, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising, said.",
      "Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at least 97 inches was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its first 98-inch TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said.",
      "Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling business, recently bought a 98-inch Sony for his 14,000-square-foot house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 85\u201d TV in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home and uses some to display digital art.",
      "\u201cWe just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking for and thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony. \u201cYou get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You\u2019re sitting watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can put yourself in the scene.\u201d",
      "The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through September period, Circana said.",
      "Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski, the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a year, Kowalski said.",
      "The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of two inches in both 2021 and 2022, and 85-inch TVs began gaining traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 98-inch TVs to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 110-115 inches are on the market right now, he said.",
      "\u201cYou get better resolution over time,\" Kowalski said. \"You get better picture quality. And so just over time, it\u2019s easier to produce those sets and improve the technology.\"",
      "Best Buy's Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as \u201cincredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re watching YouTube TV content or \u2018 NFL Sunday Ticket,\u2019 you can actually get four screens up, and that\u2019s four 48-inch screens on it,\u201d he said.",
      "Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed its 98-inch lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every scene.",
      "James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment division of Samsung's U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and experience content is shifting.",
      "\u201cIt's even more so about watching TV as a shared experience,\u201d Fishler said. \u201cThey want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at home. \u201d",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, its Sam\u2019s Club division, and Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens.",
      "TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach on home theater projectors, which create a 100- to 120-inch image that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without windows.",
      "\u201cA dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the purview of projectors,\u201d Andrew Sivori, vice president in the entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer. \"But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV.\"",
      "Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd. But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, \u201cIt\u2019s still a niche business.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of people just don\u2019t have the space to put one of those in,\u201d he added.",
      "Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make sure a 98-inch TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said.",
      "But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good news is that the recommended distance for a 98-inch TV is actually just 6-12 feet from the seating area. The rule of thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine the ideal viewing distance, Samsung's Fishler said.",
      "If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go?",
      "\u201cI think we'll have to wait and see,\u201d Fishler said."

    "summary": "No one knows how Tuesday&rsquo;s presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year",
    "story": [
      "No one knows how Tuesday\u2019s presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve\u2019s move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- No one knows how Tuesday's presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve's move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year.",
      "The presidential contest might still be unresolved when the Fed ends its two-day meeting Thursday afternoon, yet that uncertainty would have no effect on its decision to further reduce its benchmark rate. The Fed's future actions, though, will become more unsettled once a new president and Congress take office in January, particularly if Donald Trump were to win the White House again.",
      "Trump's proposals to impose high tariffs on all imports and launch mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants and his threat to intrude on the Fed's normally independent rate decisions could send inflation surging, economists have said. Higher inflation would, in turn, compel the Fed to slow or stop its rate cuts.",
      "On Thursday, the Fed's policymakers, led by Chair Jerome Powell, are on track to cut their benchmark rate by a quarter-point, to about 4.6%, after having implemented a half-point reduction in September. Economists expect another quarter-point rate cut in December and possibly additional such moves next year. Over time, rate cuts tend to lower the costs of borrowing for consumers and businesses.",
      "The Fed is reducing its rate for a different reason than it usually does: It often cuts rates to boost a sluggish economy and a weak job market by encouraging more borrowing and spending. But the economy is growing briskly, and the unemployment rate is a low 4.1%, the government reported Friday, even with hurricanes and a strike at Boeing having sharply depressed net job growth last month.",
      "Instead, the central bank is lowering rates as part of what Powell has called \u201ca recalibration\u201d to a lower-inflation environment. When inflation spiked to a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, the Fed proceeded to raise rates 11 times \u2014 ultimately sending its key rate to about 5.3%, also the highest in four decades.",
      "But in September, year-over-year inflation dropped to 2.4%, barely above the Fed's 2% target and equal to its level in 2018. With inflation having fallen so far, Powell and other Fed officials have said they think high borrowing rates are no longer necessary. High borrowing rates typically restrict growth, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as housing and auto sales.",
      "\u201cThe restriction was in place because inflation was elevated,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed economist. \u201cInflation is no longer elevated. The reason for the restriction is gone.\u201d",
      "Fed officials have suggested that their rate cuts would be gradual. But nearly all of them have expressed support for some further reductions.",
      "\u201cFor me, the central question is how much and how fast to reduce the target for the (Fed's key) rate, which I believe is currently set at a restrictive level,\u201d Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Directors, said in a speech last month.",
      "Jonathan Pingle, an economist at Swiss bank UBS, said that Waller's phrasing reflected \u201cunusual confidence and conviction that rates were headed lower.\"",
      "Next year, the Fed will likely start to wrestle with the question of just how low their benchmark rate should go. Eventually, they may want to set it at a level that neither restricts nor stimulates growth \u2014 \u201cneutral\u201d in Fed parlance.",
      "Powell and other Fed officials acknowledge that they don't know exactly where the neutral rate is. In September, the Fed's rate-setting committee estimated that it was 2.9%. Most economists think it's closer to 3% to 3.5%.",
      "The Fed chair said the officials have to assess where neutral is by how the economy responds to rate cuts. For now, most officials are confident that at 4.9%, the Fed's current rate is far above neutral.",
      "Some economists argue, though, that with the economy looking healthy even with high borrowing rates, the Fed doesn't need to ease credit much, if at all. The idea is that they may already be close to the level of interest rates that neither slows nor stimulates the economy.",
      "\u201cIf the unemployment rate stays in the low 4's and the economy is still going to grow at 3%, does it matter that the (Fed's) rate is 4.75% to 5%?\u201d said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, asked. \u201cWhy are they cutting now?\u201d",
      "With the Fed's latest meeting coming right after Election Day, Powell will likely field questions at his news conference Thursday about the outcome of the presidential race and how it might affect the economy and inflation. He can be expected to reiterate that the Fed's decisions aren't affected by politics at all.",
      "During Trump's presidency, he imposed tariffs on washing machines, solar panels, steel and a range of goods from China, which President Joe Biden maintained. Though studies show that washing machine prices rose as a result, overall inflation did not rise much.",
      "But Trump is now proposing significantly broader tariffs \u2014 essentially, import taxes \u2014 that would raise the prices of about 10 times as many goods from overseas.",
      "Many mainstream economists are alarmed by Trump\u2019s latest proposed tariffs, which they say would almost certainly reignite inflation. A report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that Trump\u2019s main tariff proposals would make inflation 2 percentage points higher next year than it otherwise would have been.",
      "The Fed could be more likely to raise rates in response to tariffs this time, according to economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics, \"given that Trump is threatening much bigger increases in tariffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cAccordingly,\" they wrote, \u201cwe will scale back the reduction in the funds rate in our 2025 forecasts if Trump wins.\u201d"

      "Conservationists and a Native American advocacy group are suing to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources",
      "RENO, Nev. -- Conservationists and an advocacy group for Native Americans are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources.",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.",
      "The new lawsuit says the Interior Department\u2019s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat was \u201cin danger of extinction now\u201d when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.",
      "\u201cOne cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,\u201d said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno.",
      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",
      "Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and \u201cvigorously defend\u201d approval of the project, \u201cwhich was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d",

      "\u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d is enjoying another weekend at the top of the box office charts",
      "\u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d enjoyed another weekend at the top of the box office. The Sony release starring Tom Hardy added $26.1 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "It was a relatively quiet weekend for North American movie theaters leading up to the presidential election. Charts were dominated by big studio holdovers, like \u201cVenom 3,\u201d \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d and \u201cSmile 2,\u201d while audiences roundly rejected the Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and Robert Zemeckis reunion \u201cHere.\u201d Thirty years after \u201cForrest Gump,\u201d \u201cHere\u201d opened to only $5 million from 2,647 locations.",
      "\u201cVenom 3\u201d only fell 49% in its second weekend, which is a notably small drop for a superhero film, though it didn\u2019t exactly open like one either. In two weeks, the movie has made over $90 million domestically; The first two opened to over $80 million. Globally, the picture is brighter given that it has already crossed the $300 million threshold.",
      "Meanwhile, Universal and Illumination\u2019s \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d continues to attract moviegoers even six weeks in (and when it\u2019s available by video on demand), placing second with $7.6 million. That's up 11% from last weekend. The animated charmer has made over $121 million in North America and $269 million worldwide.",
      "\"'The Wild Robot' has quietly been this absolute juggernaut for the fall season,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cFor that film to see an increase after six weeks is astounding.\u201d",
      "\u201cSmile 2\u201d landed in third place with $6.8 million, helping to push its worldwide total to $109.7 million.",
      "The time-hopping \u201cHere,\u201d a graphic novel that was adapted by \u201cForrest Gump\u201d screenwriter Eric Roth, was financed by Miramax and distributed by Sony\u2019s TriStar. With a fixed position camera, it takes audiences through the years in one living room. Critics were not on board: In aggregate it has a lousy 36% on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cIt was a slow weekend anyway, but it didn\u2019t resonate in a way that many thought it might,\" Dergarabedian said. \"There are a lot of films out there for the audience that \u2018Here\u2019 was chasing.\"",
      "Despite playing in almost 1,000 more locations, \u201cHere\u201d came in behind Focus Features' papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d which earned $5.3 million. Playing in 1,796 theaters, \u201cConclave\u201d dropped only 20% from its debut last weekend and has made $15.2 million so far. Two Indian films also cracked the top 10 in their debuts, \u201cBhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u201d and \u201cSingham Again.\u201d",
      "Overall box office continues to lag behind 2023 by almost 12%. But holiday moviegoing will likely give the industry an end-of-year boost with titles like \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d on the way.",
      "\u201cIn a couple of weeks, it\u2019ll get a lot more competitive,\u201d Dergarabedian said.",
      "Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s film \u201cA Real Pain,\u201d a comedic drama about cousins on a Holocaust tour in Poland, launched in four theaters this weekend in New York and Los Angeles. It made an estimated $240,000, or $60,000 per screen, which is among the top three highest per theater averages of the year. Searchlight Pictures will be expanding the well-reviewed film nationwide in the coming weeks, going wide on Nov. 15 to over 800 theaters.",
      "Box office charts don\u2019t always paint a full picture of the moviegoing landscape, however. This weekend several relatively high-profile films playing in theaters did not report full grosses for various reasons, including the Clint Eastwood film \u201cJuror #2,\u201d Steve McQueen\u2019s WWII film \u201cBlitz\u201d and the Cannes darling \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d Netflix, which is handling \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d never reports box office. Apple Original Films is following suit with \u201cBlitz,\u201d a likely awards contender, which is in theaters before hitting Apple TV+ on Nov. 22.",
      "\u201cJuror No. 2\u201d is a Warner Bros. release, and a well-reviewed one at that. The film directed by Eastwood stars Nicholas Hoult as a juror on a murder case who faces a big moral dilemma. Domestic ticket sales were withheld. The studio did say that it earned $5 million from international showings, where it played on 1,348 screens.",
      "Even major studios withhold box office numbers occasionally. Earlier this year, Disney did not report on the Daisy Ridley movie \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea.\u201d Results were most notably withheld during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"It\u2019s really up to the distributors,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cOften times the reason that certain movies may not be reported is that there\u2019s a chance that the quality of the movie will be conflated with the box office number.\u201d",
      "Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore, were:",
      "1. \u201cVenom: The Last Dance,\u201d $26.1 million.",
      "2. \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d $7.6 million.",
      "3. \u201cSmile 2,\u201d $6.8 million.",
      "4. \u201cConclave,\u201d $5.3 million.",
      "5. \u201cHere,\u201d $5 million.",
      "6. \u201cWe Live In Time,\u201d $3.5 million.",
      "7. \u201cTerrifier 3,\u201d $3.4 million.",
      "8. \u201cSingham Again,\u201d $2.1 million.",
      "9. \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice,\u201d $2.1 million.",
      "10. \u201cBhool Bhulaiyaa 3,\u201d $2.1 million.___This story has been corrected to reflect that the seventh film in the top 10 was \u201cTerrifier 3,\u201d not \u201cTerrifier 2.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Ethiopia this year became the first country in the world to ban the importation of non-electric private vehicles",
      "ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -- As the price of fuel soared in Ethiopia earlier this year, Awgachew Seleshi decided to buy an electric car. That aligned with the government's new efforts to phase out gas-powered vehicles. But months later, he's questioning whether it was the right decision.",
      "He faces a range of issues, from the erratic supply of electricity in Addis Ababa, the capital, to the scarcity of spare parts.",
      "\u201cCharging my car has been a challenge,\" the civil servant said. \u201cSpare parts that are imported from China are expensive, few mechanics are able to fix such cars and the resale value of such cars is poor.\u201d",
      "Seleshi's troubles point to wider challenges for Ethiopia. In January, the East African country became the first in the world to ban the importation of non-electric private vehicles.",
      "The decision eased pressure on authorities who spend scarce foreign currency to subsidize the cost of fuel, but it also reflected growing enthusiasm for electric vehicles as the world demands more green technologies to reduce climate-changing emissions.",
      "Earlier this month, Ethiopia's government raised the price of fuel by up to 8% as part of a plan to gradually end all fuel subsidies in Africa's second-most populous country.",
      "Authorities have claimed some success in enforcing the ban on non-electric vehicles entering Ethiopia, and more than 100,000 electric cars are now being imported into the country each month.",
      "The official target is to increase the monthly import figure to 500,000 by 2030. By that time, a big new dam Ethiopia has built on the Nile River is expected to be producing power at full capacity.",
      "Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, in a televised address earlier this year, said the Grand Renaissance Dam will start generating more than 5,000 megawatts of electric power within a year. Authorities say such capacity would support the transition to electric vehicles.",
      "For now, many in Addis Ababa, a city of more than 5 million people, are doubtful the country can achieve its ambitious goals for electric vehicles without further needed infrastructure and services.",
      "The few garage owners who can fix broken electric cars say they are overwhelmed, while customers say they are being overcharged amid an apparent lack of competition.",
      "\u201cThere are two or three garages that can fix new energy vehicles in Ethiopia and many consumers lack awareness on how to take care of such vehicles,\" said Yonas Tadelle, a mechanic in Addis Ababa. \u201cAs mechanics, we also lack the tools, the spare parts and the know-how to fix such cars.\u201d",
      "Many EVs are now parked in garages and parking lots awaiting parts expected to come from China.",
      "Ethiopia's minister in charge of transport, Bareo Hassen Bareo, has said he believes the country can be a model nation with a green economy legacy, with the prioritization of electric vehicles a key component.",
      "The government will invest in public charging stations, he told The Associated Press, and there are plans to create a plant manufacturing EV batteries locally to reduce reliance on imports.",
      "Private efforts have included a collaboration, which has since fizzled, between Olympian Haile Gebreselassie and South Korean carmaker Hyundai to make electric vehicles in Ethiopia. That effort is believed to have collapsed over the sourcing of materials.",
      "Samson Berhane, an economist based in Addis Ababa, said the sudden flood of electric vehicles into the local market despite poor infrastructure is making it difficult for customers to adapt comfortably. Some EVs sell for about $20,000.",
      "\u201cVery few people are willing to take the risk of buying electric cars due to the lack of infrastructure, shortage of mechanics specialized in EV maintenance and the flooding of the market with Chinese brands that have questionable details and long-term visibility,\" Berhane said.",
      "But he said he believes that Ethiopia is more than able to provide electricity to the expected 500,000 EV\u2019s there within the next decade while fulfilling its industrial ambitions.",
      "Some Ethiopians are already giving up on electric vehicles, and the secondhand trade in gasoline-powered vehicles continues. There are at least 1.2 million vehicles across Ethiopia, and only a small fraction are electric ones.",
      "Businessman Yared Alemayehu bought a Chinese-made electric vehicle that he had hoped to use for a taxi service. He knew the car had a mechanical defect, but he believed it could be fixed. A mechanic disagreed.",
      "In the end, he sold the car at a loss and bought a Toyota Corolla \u2014 a car made in 2007 that he felt was more reliable \u2014 for the equivalent of $20,000, a sum that included the hefty taxes imposed on gasoline vehicles. Taxes can be higher than the cost of importing the vehicle.",
      "\u201cIn addition to having to charge my old electric car, it frequently broke, and the garage was overcharging, and the lineup at the garage was overwhelming us,\" he said.",
      "Taxi driver Dereje Hailu, who had high hopes for his Chinese-made E-Star electric vehicle when he purchased it earlier this year, said his expectations had been dashed.",
      "\u201cWith such a car, I fear I might be stuck if I go far from Addis Ababa where there are no charging stations,\" he said.",

      "As part of a sweeping two-year investigation into prison labor, The Associated Press found that correctional staff nationwide have been accused of using inmate work assignments to sexually abuse incarcerated women, luring them to isolated spots, out of...",
      "HUNTINGTON, W.Va. -- It was after midnight when she crept down the narrow, dimly lit stairs carrying a bag of dirty laundry. She crossed under a patchwork of pipes and ducts to the far back corner of the basement, as she had done many times before. That, she said, is where correctional officer James Widen was waiting for her.",
      "He had just called her name over the intercom, telling her to report to the work release center\u2019s laundry room. So April Youst rose from her bunk, careful not to wake the other incarcerated women sleeping in the dorm.",
      "When she got downstairs, she said Widen offered to save her some money by opening \u201cthe cage,\u201d a little room with free washers and dryers reserved for new prisoners who hadn\u2019t yet started their jobs.",
      "She gratefully stepped inside. And then, she said, everything changed.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s rubbing himself,\u201d she said, while reminding her of all the little favors he\u2019d done for her. \u201cHe was like \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s time to pay.\u2019\u201d",
      "Her account of that night to The Associated Press mirrors, almost word for word, the complaint she filed with police eight years ago. Widen was charged two years later and pleaded not guilty, but the case continues to crawl through the criminal court system. He vehemently denied the allegations to the AP, contending he was set up.",
      "Youst is part of the fastest-growing population behind bars \u2014 women, most of whom are locked up for nonviolent crimes that often are drug-related. Though female prisoners long have been victims of sexual violence, the number of reports against correctional staff has exploded nationwide in recent years. Many complaints follow a similar pattern: Accusers are retaliated against, while those accused face little or no punishment.",
      "In all 50 states, the AP found cases where staff allegedly used inmate work assignments to lure women to isolated spots, out of view of security cameras. The prisoners said they were attacked while doing jobs like kitchen or laundry duty inside correctional facilities or in work-release programs that placed them at private businesses like national fast-food restaurants and hotel chains.",
      "\u201cThe only thing you\u2019re thinking about when you\u2019re coming into intake is, \u2018How am I going to stay safe?\u2019\u201d said Johanna Mills of Just Detention International, a nonprofit organization working to end sexual violence behind bars. When she was incarcerated, she said her boss smashed her in the head and raped her after bringing her to an empty gym one night to do electrical work. \u201cIt never occurred to me to watch my back from the supervisor,\u201d she said.",
      "As part of a two-year investigation that has exposed everything from multinational companies benefiting from prison labor to incarcerated workers\u2019 lack of rights and protections, AP reporters spoke to more than 100 current and former prisoners nationwide, including women who said they were sexually abused by correctional staff.",
      "The AP also scoured thousands of pages of court filings, police reports, audits and other documents that detailed graphic stories of systemic sexual violence and cover-ups from New York to Florida to California.",
      "Those cases prompted a bipartisan Senate investigation two years ago that found prisoners were sexually abused by wardens, guards, chaplains or other staff in at least two-thirds of all women\u2019s federal prisons over the past decade. But a backlog of thousands of cases has impeded the Bureau of Prison\u2019s ability to hold employees accountable, government investigators said.",
      "The Prison Rape Elimination Act, passed more than 20 years ago, created a channel for filing reports that resulted in a threefold increase in the number of allegations of staff sexual misconduct involving male, female and transgender inmates from 2010 to 2020 at jails and prisons nationwide.",
      "Just over a month ago, U.S. lawmakers held a hearing to discuss how to better safeguard inmates. One woman, Bonnie Hernandez, testified that she was raped repeatedly and violently by officer Lenton Hatten in a Florida federal prison after he made her clean the recreation area as part of her work detail.",
      "\u201cIt got to the point where I feared for my life and had no choice but to report him, even though I was terrified to do so,\u201d she said. In response, she said she was sent to isolation, then transferred to a facility with greater restrictions and no access to video calls with her daughters. Still, it was one of the rare cases that led to prosecution, boosted by DNA evidence. Hatten faced a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. He received only three months last year after pleading guilty to sexual abuse of a ward.",
      "\u201cWhat you allow is what will continue,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, said after her testimony. \u201cThree months for rape is absurd. \u2026 That\u2019s not justice.\u201d",
      "Sometimes, even a confession isn\u2019t enough to lead to punishment. At another federal facility in Florida, a guard who had sex with women on landscape duty was among at least six men who were not prosecuted even though they admitted to the misconduct during an internal investigation, according to the Senate report. That was in part because, by law, government employees cannot be criminally charged if they are compelled to make statements.",
      "Internationally, prison rape is recognized as a form of torture. While it is illegal in the U.S, correctional officers have argued in some states that \u2013 despite the clear power imbalance \u2013 inmates gave their consent. Laws vary widely. For example, sexual abuse of an inmate can be a misdemeanor in Kentucky with a maximum sentence of 12 months, but prison rape is a felony in Pennsylvania, carrying up to seven years behind bars.",
      "Correctional staff often quit or retire before internal investigations are complete, sometimes retaining pensions and other benefits, experts say. With no paper trail and severe staff shortages, some are simply transferred or hired at other facilities or they land positions overseeing vulnerable populations like juveniles, the AP found.",
      "Officer Widen took a job in West Virginia after resigning from a women\u2019s prison in neighboring Ohio. According to an internal investigation submitted as part of civil court filings, he had delivered a ring from an inmate to a former prisoner. He told the AP there was no sexual contact and that he quit after upsetting prison officials by launching his own investigation into heroin smuggling at the facility, transporting the ring in exchange for information from the inmate.",
      "Youst said she had no concerns about Widen when she first arrived at the Huntington Work Release Center. In fact, she said he was a favorite among many of the men and women living there, sometimes sneaking them cigarettes or warning them about shakedowns. She said he also helped make a write-up against her go away after she was caught with a contraband cellphone \u2013 an incident that could have gotten her sent back to prison and farther away from her young daughter, who was living just down the street.",
      "As a guard, Widen held incredible power over the women. They had earned their places at the program, allowing them to dip a toe back into the free world. Though work assignments inside prisons may pay only pennies an hour, outside opportunities \u2014 which easily can be taken away \u2014 allow women to earn a little more money before their release.",
      "Youst had been in and out of the system for years for crimes stemming from her addiction. She was working days at a local mattress company when she was called down to the laundry room that night in early 2016. She told police \u2014 and the AP \u2014 that Widen started touching himself over his pants. Then, she said, he told her the cameras couldn\u2019t see what he was about to do.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s already pulling his pants down,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can hear his belt.\u201d",
      "She said she desperately tried to reason with him, stressing that someone could walk in on them and that the women upstairs in the dorm might miss her if she was gone too long.",
      "And then, echoing the account she gave police, she said, \u201cHe just pretty much bent me over the washing machine.\u201d",
      "Youst said she is baffled by how the case has dragged on.",
      "Widen has been free since posting bond after his arrest in 2018. He told the AP that all allegations of sexual misconduct at the work release center are untrue, labeled Youst \u201ca career criminal\u201d and said the police were unjustly after him.",
      "\u201cMy rights have been violated every which way,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to hide. I didn\u2019t do anything I was accused of. West Virginia is crooked.\u201d",
      "West Virginia, a rugged swath of Appalachia that has been home to the country\u2019s highest overdose death rate for a decade, has experienced one of America\u2019s sharpest spikes in female incarceration rates, with a more than 200 percent increase in state prisons between 2000 and 2016 \u2014 which is precisely when lawyers started fielding sexual abuse complaints.",
      "AP reporters met with current and former prisoners inside correctional facilities and at their homes in mountain communities, some of whom said staff members often started out being nice \u2014 bringing them fast food or makeup \u2014 and then raped them, peeped at them in showers or forced them to strip and perform sex acts on other prisoners while the guards watched.",
      "Most female victims locked up nationwide were abused before being incarcerated, research shows. They rarely report assaults, fearing they won\u2019t be believed or will be punished, ranging from losing their jobs to being placed in solitary confinement or denied contact with their children. And many on work release have only a short time left to serve and are wary of doing anything that could send them back to prison or add time to their sentences.",
      "In most cases nationwide, internal investigations determine that allegations are \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d And in the cases that have enough evidence to wind their way through the legal system, only 6% of the nearly 1,000 staff who reportedly engaged in sexual misconduct with male and female inmates in 2019 and 2020 were convicted, according to the latest Department of Justice figures. Without prosecution, perpetrators also can avoid placement on sex offender registries.",
      "In West Virginia, Amanda McGrew, the state\u2019s compliance director for the Prison Rape Elimination Act, said some prisoners use the act to file complaints unrelated to sexual abuse because they know it will trigger the removal of an officer until an investigation is completed. Police are alerted when accusations are substantiated and it\u2019s up to prosecutors to take a case forward, she said. And even when staff resign, she added, investigations continue.",
      "But there is another route: Huntington-based attorney Michael Woelfel has sought restitution through a stream of civil suits.",
      "Woelfel, who also is a Democratic state senator, said he has settled 127 cases in which women accused guards of abuse in the past 15 years, forcing the state\u2019s insurance carrier to pay out millions of dollars.",
      "He said he first started receiving calls from women jailed for crimes linked to their addiction after judges took a hard line, locking them up to try to straighten them out. He had known some of them since they were girls, appearing before him when he oversaw preliminary juvenile delinquency cases that sometimes involved sexual or physical abuse at home.",
      "Most lawyers wouldn\u2019t touch their prison rape claims, and not just because they are hard to win due to qualified immunity \u2014 a high bar that helps protects people in law enforcement from liability resulting from misconduct.",
      "\u201cThere is a certain element of people that think if you go to prison, you sort of get whatever you get in there,\u201d Woelfel said, adding that while he is still contacted by women alleging sexual misconduct, the slew of lawsuits has helped pressure the state to crack down. \u201cThat taboo of rape or sexual assault \u2026 it\u2019s so commonplace that people still joke about that.\u201d",
      "Women have been targeted from their days on slave plantations, when they were raped by their owners, to the decades-long period that followed emancipation and involved leasing convicts out to private companies. Widespread reports of abuse eventually led to the creation of reformatories, where women no longer were overseen by men.",
      "That began to change in the 1970s after anti-discrimination laws opened the door for cross-gender supervision, just as the number of women being locked up started to rise. Though they now represent only about 10 percent of the nation\u2019s overall prison population, female incarceration rates have jumped from about 26,000 in 1980 to nearly 200,000 today.",
      "Some guards believe women with substance abuse issues are accustomed to using sex as a commodity on the streets, seeing them as partly responsible for their own victimization, said Brenda Smith, a law professor at American University and one of the country\u2019s top experts on prison rape.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re viewed as sort of the lowest of the low,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not really women \u2014 they\u2019re just other things.\u201d",
      "Youst said her case appears to bear that out. She\u2019s out of prison and said she\u2019s working to stay clean, holding down a busy job while building a new life.",
      "Even before the languishing criminal case, Youst and three others from the Huntington work release center came forward to file civil suits against Widen. The cases were settled by the state\u2019s insurance carrier for $240,000 in 2019, with no admission of any wrongdoing, Woelfel said. The AP interviewed three of the women. The fourth died of an overdose before the agreement was reached.",
      "Widen contended the women were driven by a payday and plotted together, saying, \u201cMe, too! Me, too! Me, too!\u201d",
      "But Alesha Canfield, who was among the four women filing suit, said she talked to no one about Widen at the center.",
      "She said she was worn out from working morning and afternoon shifts at two major restaurant chains, but still struggled to sleep at night, worried that Widen would tap her on the shoulder in the dorm and summon her to the center\u2019s basement.",
      "\u201cI was terrified. I did what I was told,\u201d she said to the AP, noting that she waited to file a rape report until after leaving the facility because she feared retaliation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the criminal,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s the cop. So why are they going to believe me anyway?\u201d",
      "Canfield, who related the same story in civil court filings, said it\u2019s hard to understand why abuse behind bars isn\u2019t taken more seriously.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all women,\u201d she said. \u201cJust because we made a mistake and got caught once in our lives doesn\u2019t mean that we should be treated any different than any other woman in this world.\u201d",
      "A recent spike in scandals, cover-ups and lawsuits linked to women\u2019s facilities nationwide has prompted congressional investigations and scathing Department of Justice reports that cited a \u201cculture of abuse.\u201d Experts say powerful unions sometimes work to shield staff from allegations of misconduct. And in some cases, correctional officers who speak out are retaliated against.",
      "Things were so bad at FCI Dublin in California that prisoners and staff named it \u201cthe rape club,\u201d a 2022 AP investigation found. At least two men who pleaded guilty to sexual abuse were work supervisors: Nakie Nunley targeted at least five female prisoners who worked at the federal government\u2019s call center, where inmates are employed by companies to do jobs like telemarketing and customer service. And Andrew Jones abused women who worked for him in the kitchen. The correctional facility was recently shut down; Nunley and Jones have been imprisoned along with at least five others, with another case still pending.",
      "Brandy Moore White, who heads the union representing nearly 30,000 correctional staff in federal prisons, condemned sexual abuse inside facilities and pointed to a need for more resources amid \u201ccatastrophic\u201d staffing shortages.",
      "\u201cThe most e\ufb03cient way to provide security and oversight is not cameras and technology, it is sta\ufb03ng,\u201d she told lawmakers during a recent Senate subcommittee hearing, noting that employees also face sexual violence and harassment from inmates. \u201cIf you have 10 staff supervising 500 inmates, there is time for people who have ill intentions to do things that they shouldn\u2019t do.\u201d",
      "Many accusations note that guards took special care to avoid surveillance video. A civil lawsuit filed in September said that officer Jose Figueroa-Lizarraga moved cameras in an Arizona state facility and raped a prisoner who was on a job assignment, forcing her inside the guard\u2019s control room. After reporting the incident, the woman was attacked again, the suit said \u2014 alleging that the second time, even her request for emergency contraception was ignored. She became pregnant and nearly died after hemorrhaging during childbirth.",
      "Figueroa-Lizarraga also was prosecuted on criminal charges and pleaded guilty to a lesser crime of attempting to commit unlawful sexual conduct by a custodian. He was sentenced to two years probation in August.",
      "In some cases, the allegations of abuse extend beyond prison walls.",
      "Correctional officer Anthony Martin kept his job at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail even after several female inmates alleged he sexually abused them by creating special work assignments. Then in March, while off-duty in Queens, he was arrested for allegedly raping a woman in the community. In that case, the district attorney moved swiftly. Martin was indicted by a grand jury in August for first-degree rape and faces up to 25 years if convicted.",
      "\u201cThis disparity sends a chilling message - that the dignity and rights of the incarcerated are worth less than those on the outside,\u201d said attorney Anna Kull, who is representing a woman who alleges Martin abused her while she was locked up.",
      "Other correctional officers accused of abuse sometimes transition into working with even more vulnerable populations. Youst said it was Widen possibly taking a new job that ultimately spurred her to act.",
      "\u201cI heard him say something about juveniles \u2014 you know, working in a juvenile facility. That\u2019s when I knew I had to say something,\u201d she said.",
      "Youst believed she had something that might stop him from going anywhere else. She told police that Widen didn\u2019t use a condom that night and pulled a handful of napkins out of his coat pocket when he was done.",
      "\u201cHe gave them to me and stood in front of me and made me wipe myself off,\u201d she said to the AP, as she previously had told police. \u201cI threw them in the trash can, and he\u2019s like, \u2018No, give them back to me.\u2019\u201d",
      "As soon as he stepped aside, she said she raced back upstairs to her dorm, pulled off her fleece pajamas and black T-shirt and hid them. She tried to avoid being alone with Widen again, but said the abuse continued.",
      "One winter morning, she said she stuffed a plastic bag containing the clothes from that night into her coat and left the work release center for her job. She called the one person she had heard could help \u2013 attorney Michael Woelfel.",
      "He met her at the mattress factory and took the bag to the police, handing it over for DNA testing in a state where prisoners cannot legally consent regardless of circumstances. Though questions were raised at the lab about the chain of custody, it was a match for Widen.",
      "Widen was working in West Virginia\u2019s juvenile services department when he was charged with two counts of felony sex acts against a prisoner \u2014 Youst. His bail was set at $25,000, and he was released on bond six years ago.",
      "He told the AP that his DNA could have come from somewhere else in the center \u2014 or even from his disgruntled ex-wife.",
      "Since being charged, Widen has been assigned three defense lawyers by the state. The original judge retired. And a new prosecuting attorney, whose office declined comment, is now on the case.",
      "Widen has attended multiple hearings at the Cabell County courthouse and is expected to appear again this month. A trial date has not been set.",
      "Just down the street sits the building that once housed the work release center. It was shut down seven years ago due to disrepair, and today operates as an addiction wellness center.",
      "Nothing looks the same from Youst\u2019s time there \u2014 except the laundry room and the cage in the basement corner.",

    "story": [
      "Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has approved a revised plan for a massive proposed wind farm after he rejected a slimmed-down version earlier this year",
      "OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has approved a revised plan for a massive proposed wind farm after he rejected a sharply slimmed-down version earlier this year.",
      "Inslee urged permitting officials to work quickly to allow the construction of as many Horse Heaven Wind Farm turbines as possible, The Seattle Times reported. Washington state won't meet its \u201curgent clean energy needs\u201d if officials take years to authorize the turbines, he said.",
      "The original $1.7 billion project included up to 222 wind turbines across 24 miles (38.6 kilometers) of hillsides in the Tri-Cities area of eastern Washington and three solar arrays covering up to 8.5 square miles (22 square kilometers).",
      "But then Washington\u2019s Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, a clearinghouse for permits required by large projects, recommended slashing the proposal in half because nests of the endangered ferruginous hawk were found in the area. It wanted a 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) buffer around each nest.",
      "Most nests were empty, but the hawks can return to them years later.",
      "In May, Inslee rejected the council's recommendation to shrink the project, prompting the panel to suggest a compromise that would examine turbines and nests on a case-by-case basis. Under this plan, which Inslee formally approved Oct. 18, a technical advisory group would recommend whether to reduce individual nest setbacks to 1 kilometer (0.6 mile.)",
      "This could allow the developer, Boulder, Colorado-based Scout Clean Energy, to build all but 30 of the turbines originally proposed.",
      "Inslee, a Democrat, has sought to make climate initiatives key to his legacy. He is not seeking reelection after three terms in office.",
      "The wind farm project has pitted local opponents against the state\u2019s ever-growing need for renewable energy since it was first proposed in 2021. In a letter to the site evaluation council, Inslee noted that Washington\u2019s energy demands could nearly double by 2050."

      "Exxon earned $8.6 billion, or $1.92 per share, for the three months ended Sept. 30. A year earlier the Spring, Texas-based company earned $9.07 billion, or $2.25 per share.",
      "The performance topped Wall Street's expectations, though Exxon does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales. Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research were calling for earnings of $1.91 per share.",
      "Revenue totaled $90.02 billion, falling short of Wall Street\u2019s estimate of $93.51 billion.",
      "Exxon\u2019s net production reached 4.6 million oil-equivalent barrels per day during the third quarter, an increase of 5% compared with the previous quarter.",
      "Oil prices have been falling recently after a retaliatory strike by Israel on Iran targeted military sites rather than the oilfields of the world\u2019s seventh largest producer of crude. The long-term expectation is for oil prices to move lower, not higher. That\u2019s because the balance between supply and demand has tilted toward supply, a dynamic that typically deflates oil prices.",

Similar to Exxon, Chevron does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales.",
      "Revenue and net income were lower than a year ago at the San Ramon, California, company, which is relocating its headquarters to Houston by year-end.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Colm McLoughlin, an Irishman who landed in the deserts of the United Arab Emirates and helped lead Dubai Duty Free into becoming an airport retail behemoth generating billions of dollars, has died. He was 81.",
      "McLoughlin ran Dubai Duty Free from 1983 until he retired earlier this year, a span of over 40 years that saw Dubai grow from a creekside trading port into a modern metropolis, home to the world's tallest building and other attractions.",
      "And all the millions of passengers coming into Dubai International Airport, now the world's busiest for international travel, saw the rows of electronics, cigarettes, cigars, alcohol and other goods available duty-free at his stores, hawked by a salesforce in green suit jackets, yellow ties and conversing in multiple languages.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very Middle Eastern kind of thing,\u201d McLoughlin told the Los Angeles Times in 1987 as he showed off its gold market. \u201cWe have to cater to a lot of tastes.\u201d",
      "Dubai Duty Free said in a statement that McLoughlin died Wednesday after a short illness, without elaborating. The operation's new managing director, Ramesh Cidambi, praised McLoughlin for steering its \u201cgrowth to a $2 billion dollar business with over 6,000 employees at the time of his retirement.\u201d",
      "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, offered condolences for his death Friday.",
      "\u201cWith a heavy heart, we mourn the passing of Colm McLoughlin, a distinguished visionary whose dedication transformed Dubai Duty Free into a global icon over more than four decades,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed wrote on the social platform X. \u201cColm was an inspiring and humble figure, one of the beautiful faces of Dubai and a brilliant mind with a kind and loving heart.\u201d",
      "Born in Ballinasloe, Ireland, in 1943, McLoughlin joined Shannon Airport's first-in-the-world duty-free operation in 1969. In July 1983, he came with a 10-man team to Dubai to set up the sandy airport's duty-free operation. His six-month contract ended up stretching into 40 years.",
      "Like the rest of the aviation industry, Dubai Duty Free took a hit during the years of the coronavirus pandemic and airline groundings. But sales have since bounced back. In 2023 alone, under McLoughlin, Dubai Duty Free sold 6 million cans of beer, 2.3 million bottles of whiskey, 2.3 million cartons of cigarettes, 10.2 million cigars and 3.3 million bottles of perfume.",
      "One big segment has been Chinese travelers, after Dubai Duty Free worked to accept their credit cards, had staff speaking Mandarin and put in goods they wanted.",
      "\u201cWe would be silly if we didn\u2019t take advantage of it and try to serve them,\u201d McLoughlin told The Associated Press in 2012.",
      "And many a bleary-eyed traveler in Dubai's cavernous airport tried their luck at the constant raffles being offered, whether for $1 million, a luxury automobile or a racing motorcycle.",
      "McLoughlin also was known for Dubai Duty Free's sponsorship of tennis and golf tournaments, as well as his work supporting Dubai's Irish community. He received the Irish Presidential Distinguished Service Award in 2014.",

      "Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign is actively warning business leaders that Donald Trump has a pattern of disregard for democracy and the rule of law that would threaten U.S. economic growth",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Kamala Harris ' campaign is actively warning business leaders that Donald Trump has a pattern of disregard for democracy and the rule of law that would threaten U.S. economic growth \u2014 a closing argument designed to show the possible consequences for companies and workers if he returns to the White House.",
      "It\u2019s a position that Trump's team rejects as they tell voters that prices will be lower and growth stronger than ever before if he wins Tuesday's election. As a billionaire who made his name in real estate, the former president has argued for higher tariffs to bring more factories into the United States and tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations on the premise that will lead to more investment.",
      "The rival positions get at a fundamental distinction between the two candidates on how to guide the world\u2019s largest economy: Harris\u2019 team is arguing that the rule of law creates the certainty that can make markets and workers thrive, while Trump is arguing that tariff increases and tax cuts are the keys for growth.",
      "Gene Sperling, who has guided three Democratic presidents on economic policy and is now advising the Harris campaign, has made what he describes as a \u201ccommon sense\u201d case to financiers and others about the dangers of a second Trump administration.",
      "\u201cA president who targets people, targets CEOs, targets companies, targets journalists and targets opposition could have a devastating impact on the investment confidence that has been robust for the past four years but also part of America\u2019s strength since its founding,\u201d said Sperling.",
      "But the billionaire hedge fund investor John Paulson, a Trump supporter who sees himself as a possible treasury secretary, pushes back against the Harris campaign's criticisms by saying the world was more stable under Trump and inflation was lower.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely false,\" he said of Sperling's argument about the rule of law being at risk. \"When people make these claims, they\u2019re totally spurious. They\u2019re not grounded in reality. Trump is a brilliant businessman. He wants to bring down wasteful spending and encourage growth.\u201d",
      "Trump has derided his opponent's handling of the economy as \u201cstupid\u201d and claimed the stock market will crash if he loses the election, although the S&P 500 index of stocks has increased roughly 50% during President Joe Biden 's term.",
      "\u201cWe will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost, the lowest regulatory burdens, and free access to the best and biggest market on the planet,\u201d Trump said at a rally Tuesday in Allentown, Pennsylvania. \u201cThe problem is, if we had more of these idiots running our country, you won\u2019t have a big and best market anymore because we\u2019re a nation in decline.\u201d",
      "The Harris team's push involves connecting the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol with Trump's history of using the bully pulpit to attack the Federal Reserve as well as companies such as Amazon, Merck, Comcast, John Deere and Toyota. Their argument is that companies are less likely to make long-term investments if democratic values are under attack and election results denied.",
      "In addition to Sperling, corporate executives have been hearing from Robert Rubin, the former treasury secretary; Kenneth Chenault, the former CEO of American Express; and Brian Deese, the former National Economic Council director for Biden.",
      "One person familiar with the conversations said that the representatives of the Harris campaign are not having to push hard on this issue. Seemingly apolitical CEOs are privately raising this issue as their central concern about a Trump presidency, with the person insisting on anonymity to describe the private conversations with business leaders who want to stay out of the electoral spotlight.",
      "But Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow in governance at the Brookings Institution, said that the Harris campaign has somewhat underplayed the risks given the possible hazards.",
      "\u201cBy and large, Americans have been able to take the basic rule of law for granted,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThe kind of rampant cronyism and fraud that is endemic in some other countries has really been unimaginable here\u00ad\u00ad \u2014 and that\u2019s a great thing, of course. But it also makes it difficult for people to conceive of just how important government is for the functioning of markets.\u201d",
      "Both campaigns are vying for support from the business community. Trump has the backing of billionaire Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla, SpaceX and X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter. Billionaires such as Microsoft founder Bill Gates and billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban are backing Harris.",
      "Many of the disputes have centered on policy differences. Trump has said that the higher corporate tax rates favored by Harris would deter investment, while the Harris team has attacked his plans to remove Biden-era incentives for building computer chip, electric vehicle and other advanced factories as costing the country factory jobs.",
      "But the argument about the importance of democratic values picked up credibility in October after the Nobel memorial prize in economics was awarded to three economists, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson, who showed that social institutions and the rule of law are critical for economic growth.",
      "Acemoglu was among the 23 Nobel prize-winning economists who signed a letter saying Trump's economic plans would \u201clead to higher prices, larger deficits, and greater inequality.\u201d",
      "The letter said: \u201cAmong the most important determinants of economic success are the rule of law and economic and political certainty, and Trump threatens all of these.\u201d",
      "The topic has long fascinated Harris, a former California attorney general. Two people working in the White House recalled that in 2022, Harris asked for economic research to back her own understanding that the erosion of democratic standards would harm growth. Those people insisted on anonymity to discuss the request.",
      "Similarly, Biden was the nominee, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients made the case to the CEOs in the Business Roundtable that a Trump return to the presidency would generate uncertainty that would hinder growth. It was a pitch that contrasted with Trump floating additional tax cuts to the group.",
      "Neither the Business Roundtable nor the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have made endorsements in November's presidential election. The Business Roundtable has made keeping corporate tax rates at their current 21% rate its top legislative priority. Trump has pledged further cuts to the corporate rate for U.S. manufacturers, whereas Harris would like to raise it to 28%, an increase though still lower than the 35% rate in place until 2017.",
      "The Chamber, meanwhile, has emphasized its willingness to advocate for its corporate members with whichever administration would be in power.",
      "Business Roundtable CEO Josh Bolten said in a statement this month that the organization supported the peaceful transfer of power. So far, Trump has declined to commit to the peaceful transfer of power, after having falsely claimed that his 2020 loss was the result of a rigged election, a claim that helped encourage the 2021 insurrection.",
      "\u201cIt can take time to finalize election results, and we urge all Americans to respect the processes set out in federal and state laws for electoral determinations and an orderly transition,\" Bolten said."

      "But in a conference call with investors Thursday, the company said those closures will be offset by new restaurant openings. Wendy\u2019s said it plans to open between 250 and 300 restaurants this year.",
      "Wendy\u2019s President and CEO Kirk Tanner said the restaurants that are closing are underperforming compared to others.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re just in locations that don\u2019t build our brands,\u201d Tanner said. \u201cYou look at a brand that\u2019s 55 years old and some of those restaurants are quite out of date.\u201d",
      "Dublin, Ohio-based Wendy\u2019s didn\u2019t provide a list of the locations to be closed. But Tanner said they are spread out all over the country.",
      "\u201cOur focus is on building new restaurants because we know they deliver well over the average of these poor-performing restaurants,\u201d he said. \u201cWe, overall, want the best restaurants for the customers and that customer experience we want to deliver.\u201d",

      "Next week\u2019s presidential election isn\u2019t just a referendum on Donald Trump and Kamala Harris",
      "WASHINGTON -- Next week's presidential election isn't just a referendum on Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. It's also a measure of the influence the world's richest man wields over American democracy.",
      "Elon Musk, the South African-born tech and business titan, has spent at least $119 million mobilizing Trump's supporters to back the Republican nominee. His social media platform, X, has become a firehose of pro-Trump propaganda. And he's playing a starring role in Trump-style rallies in critical battleground states.",
      "All the while, he's coming under growing scrutiny. He skipped a hearing on Thursday in a lawsuit over his effort to dole out millions of dollars to registered voters, giveaways legal experts liken to vote buying. He\u2019s being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. And The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Musk regularly communicates with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a potential national security risk because SpaceX, his aerospace company, holds billions of dollars worth of contracts with NASA and the Department of Defense.",
      "Musk is hardly the only person whose megawealth places him at the nexus of politics, business and foreign policy. But few are working so publicly for a single candidate as Musk, whose expansive business ties and growing bravado pose a vexing test of one unelected person's political power. His stature is perhaps one of the most tangible consequences of the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which eliminated many limits on political giving.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely an election brought to you by Citizens United,\u201d said Daniel I. Weiner, the director of elections and government at the Brennan Center for Justice, who added that the phenomenon was bigger that just Musk. \u201cWhat this is really about is a transformation of our campaign finance system to one in which the wealthiest donors are playing a central role.\u201d",
      "Musk did not respond to a request for comment made through his attorney. Tesla, his electric car company, and X did not respond to inquiries. SpaceX disputed parts of The Journal's reporting in a statement and said it continues to work in \u201cclose partnership with the U.S. Government.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s conversion to a self-described \u201cDark MAGA\u201d Trump warrior is a recent one. In the past, he donated modest sums to both Republicans and Democrats, including $5,000 to Hillary Clinton in 2016, records show. He didn\u2019t contribute to Trump\u2019s political efforts until this year, according to federal campaign finance disclosures.",
      "He was all in once he did.",
      "Musk is now leading America PAC, a super political action committee that is spearheading Trump\u2019s get-out-the-vote effort.",
      "As a newcomer to politics, there have been growing pains.",
      "Over the summer, America PAC struggled to reach its voter contact goals. Musk brought in a new team of political consultants, Generra Peck and Phil Cox, who worked on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2019 losing Republican presidential primary bid.",
      "On paper, the numbers have improved. But Republican officials, operatives and activists say in some critical places it\u2019s been difficult to tell how active the PAC\u2019s ground effort has been.",
      "The PAC's presence is not perceptible in rural Georgia, according to three Republican strategists who are closely monitoring the ground game in the battleground state. For example, America PAC has shown little evidence of leaving literature behind on doorsteps, as is common when a voter is not home, especially in remote places, the three people said.",
      "There are also indicators Musk, a tech innovator, has been taken advantage of at his own game. In Nevada, three other people familiar with America PAC\u2019s efforts said hired canvassers paid tech-savvy operatives to digitally manipulate an app used to track their progress \u2014 appearing to falsify their data so they could get paid for work that they did not do. Canvassers are typically paid by the number of doors that they knock on.",
      "There are signs the practice wasn't limited to Nevada. One person warned America PAC leadership weeks ago that canvasing data from multiple states showed signs that it had been falsified, but their concerns were not acted on, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.",
      "The individuals, like others who provided details about Musk\u2019s political operation, insisted on anonymity to discuss the matter out of fear of retribution.",
      "Musk has become frustrated with the inner workings of his political organization and has brought in private sector associates, including Steve Davis, president of the Boring company, Musk\u2019s tunnel building company, according to three people with knowledge of the move. Davis\u2019 role with America PAC was previously reported by The New York Times.",
      "A person close to the PAC disputed that the group had been taken advantage of, suggesting it was a conspiracy theory based on a poor understanding of how political canvassing works. The person insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the innerworkings of the PAC.",
      "Musk\u2019s leadership of the PAC has not been his only political stumble.",
      "On Monday, Philadelphia\u2019s district attorney filed a lawsuit to halt Musk\u2019s $1 million cash sweepstakes, which is a part of America PAC\u2019s effort to garner support for Trump. Musk had pledged to give away $1 million a day until the election to voters in battleground states who have signed a petition supporting the Constitution. Legal experts cautioned that the contest was likely illegal, venturing into vote buying territory because participants were required to be registered to vote to win the money.",
      "Democratic District Attorney Larry Krasner\u2019s suit argues the giveaways amount to an illegal lottery. A state judge put the case on hold on Thursday while a federal court considers taking action. The Department of Justice sent a warning letter to America PAC that the giveaways could violate election law.",
      "Musk has more riding on the election than just bragging rights.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the main agency that regulates Tesla, has repeatedly proved to be a thorn for the electric car maker run by Musk, which is the primary source of his wealth. The agency is overseeing more than a dozen recalls, some that Tesla resisted. It has also opened investigations that have raised doubts about Musk\u2019s claims that Tesla is close to deploying self-driving vehicles, a key expectation of shareholders and a major driver of Tesla\u2019s lofty share price.",
      "Earlier this year Tesla disclosed that the Department of Justice and the SEC have requested and subpoenaed information about \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d capability, vehicle functionality, data privacy and other matters.",
      "The social media platform X is another Musk company that has drawn interest of the Biden administration. The Federal Trade Commission has probed Musk\u2019s handling of sensitive consumer data after he took control of the company in 2022 but has not brought enforcement action. The SEC has an ongoing investigation of Musk\u2019s purchase of the social media company.",
      "Musk has been forceful with his political views on the platform, changing its rules, content moderation systems and algorithms to conform with his world view. After Musk endorsed Trump following an attempt on the former president\u2019s life last summer, the platform has transformed into a megaphone for Trump\u2019s campaign, offering an unprecedented level of free advertising that is all but impossible to calculate the value of.",
      "Many of his troubles, which Musk blames President Joe Biden and Democrats for, could go away if Trump is elected. The former president has mused that Musk could have a formal role in a future Trump administration that focuses on government efficiency \u2014 an enormous conflict of interest given Musk\u2019s companies' vast dealings with the government.",
      "Musk has even offered to help develop national safety standards for self-driving vehicles, alarming auto safety groups, which also worry that he could interfere with investigations of Tesla.",
      "\u201cOf course the fox wants to build the henhouse,\u201d said Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety watchdog group.",
      "That\u2019s also what makes the revelation that Musk has been in regular contact with Putin so troubling to foreign policy experts. The Defense Department and NASA are heavily dependent on SpaceX to launch spy satellites and take astronauts into space. But The Wall Street Journal reported that during one talk, Putin asked Musk not to activate his Starlink satellite system, a subsidiary of SpaceX, over Taiwan as a favor for Chinese President Xi Jinping. Russia has denied that the conversation took place.",
      "In a statement posted to X, the aerospace company said the Journal story included \u201clong-ago debunked claims\u201d and questioned the relevance of the newspaper's reporting on Taiwan.",
      "\u201cStarlink is not available there because Taiwan has not given us a license to operate,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThis has nothing to do with Russia or China.\u201d",
      "National security experts say the revelation that Musk communicated with Putin is still troubling.",
      "Putin is \"a war criminal who is slaughtering civilians. That makes this wrong in my view,\u201d former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul told The Associated Press last week. \u201cYou have to decide what team you are on. Are you on the American team or are you on the Russian team?\u201d",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Warren Buffett is now sitting on more than $325 billion cash after continuing to unload billions of dollars worth of Apple and Bank of America shares this year and continuing to collect a steady stream of profits from all of Berkshire Hathaway's assorted businesses without finding any major acquisitions.",
      "Berkshire said it sold off about 100 million more Apple shares in the third quarter after halving its massive investment in the iPhone maker last quarter. The remaining stake of roughly 300 million shares was valued at $69.9 billion at the end of September remains Berkshire's biggest single investment, but it has been cut drastically since the end of last year when it was worth $174.3 billion.",
      "Investors will also be disappointed to learn that Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its own shares in the quarter.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said shareholders will wonder why Buffett is continuing to accumulate so much cash. \u201cAre they more pessimistic about the future economic and market picture than perhaps others are?\u201d she said.",
      "Buffett said at the annual meeting in May that part of why he started selling some of his Apple shares is that he expects tax rates to go higher in the future. But Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said he wonders if part of the reason Buffett started selling Apple is tied to last year's death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger because the sales started shortly after Munger's death. Shanahan said Buffett has never been as comfortable with technology businesses as his longtime partner was.",
      "\u201cIf Charlie Munger were still alive, perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have sold down the position quite as aggressively \u2014 maybe at all,\u201d Shanahan said.",
      "Berkshire said Saturday that investment gains again drove its third quarter profits skyward to $26.25 billion, or $18,272 per Class A share. A year ago, unrealized paper investment losses dragged the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's earnings down to a loss of $12.77 billion, or $8,824 per Class A share.",
      "Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire\u2019s operating earnings if they want to get a good sense of how the businesses it owns are doing because those numbers exclude investments. Berkshire\u2019s bottom-line profit figures can vary widely from quarter to quarter along with the value of its investments regardless of whether the company bought or sold anything.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire said its operating earnings were only down about 6% at $10.09 billion, or $7,023.01 per Class A share. That compares to last year's $10.8 billion, or $7,437.15 per Class A share.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted that Berkshire would report operating earnings of $7,335.11 per Class A share.",
      "Berkshire's revenue didn't change much at $92.995 billion. A year ago, it reported $93.21 billion revenue. That number was ahead of the $92.231 billion revenue that three analysts surveyed by FactSet predicted.",
      "Berkshire owns an assortment of insurance businesses, including Geico, along with BNSF railroad, several major utilities and a varied collection of retail and manufacturing businesses, including brands like Dairy Queen and See\u2019s Candy.",
      "One of Berkshire's insurers, Guard, reported some additional losses on previous years after managers reassessed its policies.",
      "Berkshire did resolve one mystery from the quarter by spelling out how much it paid to acquire the rest of the shares in its utility business from the estate of former Berkshire board member Walter Scott.",
      "Berkshire said it paid $2.4 billion cash, issued $600 million in debt and gave the Scott family Class B Berkshire shares worth a little over $1 billion. So the total compensation was about $4 billion. That means the Scott family didn\u2019t get nearly as good of a price for their 8% stake in the utilities as when Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel sold his 1% stake in the utility business two years ago for $870 million.",

      "NEW YORK -- Online video production company MrBeast said Friday it has fired somewhere between 5 to 10 employees following an investigation into the YouTube empire's workplace culture.",
      "A company spokesman declined to put a precise number on the firings, say which employees were let go or for what reasons. But the shakeup comes as Jimmy Donaldson, who draws millions of views under the MrBeast alias with highly produced stunts and giveaways, deals with accusations of impropriety against himself, his collaborators and others within his multimillion-dollar production company that have threatened his family-friendly image.",
      "Investigators only identified \u201cseveral isolated instances of workplace harassment and misconduct,\" according to a two-page letter sent Friday by Alex Spiro, a trial lawyer who led the investigation by white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and whose clients have included Jay-Z and Elon Musk.",

      "Spiro said the team interviewed 39 current and former employees. Millions of documents from phones, emails, and messaging platforms including Discord and Slack were also reviewed, according to the letter.",
      "The controversies surrounding the so-called King of YouTube began snowballing this summer. Ava Tyson, a Donaldson friend and fellow creator accused of sharing inappropriate sexual messages with minors over multiple years, left the channel in July. Also circulated online by YouTuber Rosanna Pansino was a 2017 recording of Donaldson making racist comments and using homophobic slurs.",
      "A preliminary July shoot for his ambitious \u201cBeast Games\u201d Amazon Prime Video show was quickly hit with safety complaints from some contestants who said they faced \u201climited sustenance\u201d and \u201cinsufficient medical staffing\u201d while competing for a $5 million grand prize.",
      "MrBeast in turn has hired new executives, including a head of personnel and a general counsel, according to Spiro, and additional employees are getting \u201ctargeted training and executive coaching\u201d for undisclosed violations of company policy.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon led U.S. stock indexes higher on Friday, while a surprisingly weak jobs report  marred by some unusual occurrences cemented bets on Wall Street for another cut to interest rates next week.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to recover some of its loss from the day before, which was its worst in eight weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 288 points, or 0.7%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.8%.",
      "Amazon climbed 6.2% after delivering a bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected and was the strongest force pushing the S&P 500 higher.",
      "Intel, meanwhile, rallied 7.8% despite reporting a worse loss than expected. Its revenue topped analysts\u2019 estimates, and it gave a forecast for results in the current quarter that likewise topped expectations. Cardinal Health was another one of the market\u2019s bigger gainers and jumped 7% after topping analysts\u2019 forecasts for profit and revenue in the latest quarter. It also raised its profit forecast for its fiscal year, which is only in its second quarter.",
      "They helped offset a 1.2% slide for Apple, which said it expects revenue growth in the important holiday quarter to be in the low to mid-single digit percentages. That was below several analysts\u2019 forecasts.",

      "In the bond market, Treasury yields pushed higher following some swings after a highly anticipated report said U.S. employers added only a net 12,000 workers to their payrolls last month. That was far short of the 115,000 in hiring that economists were expecting or the 223,00 jobs that employers created in September.",
      "The nearly unanimous expectation on Wall Street remains for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point next week. But the weaker-than-expected jobs report wiped out the slim chance traders had been seeing of the Fed holding rates steady, according to data from CME Group.",
      "The Fed kicked off its rate-cutting campaign  in September with a larger-than-usual cut of half a percentage point, as it turns more attention to keeping the job market solid instead of focusing on just driving inflation lower.",
      "The two-year Treasury yield, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed\u2019s actions, initially fell following the jobs report but then climbed to 4.20% from 4.18% late Thursday.",

      "Economists said Friday\u2019s jobs report contained a lot of noise and perhaps not much signal. Besides two hurricanes that left destructive paths across the United States during the month, a strike by workers at Boeing  also helped depress the numbers.",
      "All those distortions make the numbers difficult to parse, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t change our view that the labor market should further decelerate in coming months,\u201d said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.",
      "The hope on Wall Street is that the economy will still avoid a recession, even with that expected slowdown in the job market, thanks in part to coming cuts to interest rates by the Fed. The overall economy has so far remained more resilient than feared.",
      "A separate report on Friday said U.S. manufacturing contracted by more last month than economists expected. It\u2019s been one of the areas of the economy hurt most by the Fed\u2019s keeping interest rates at a two-decade high until September.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe after finishing lower across much of Asia outside of Hong Kong.",
      "The price of oil, meanwhile, rose again to further trim its loss for the week. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose 0.4%. Brent crude, the international standard, also climbed 0.4%.",

      "Worries about this week\u2019s tax-raising U.K. budget within financial markets appear to have eased with the interest rates charged on British debt steadying and the pound rising against most other currencies",
      "LONDON -- Worries about this week's tax-raising U.K. budget within financial markets appeared to ease Friday with the interest rates charged on British debt steadying and the pound rising against most other currencies.",
      "In the wake of Wednesday's budget statement, the first by a Labour government for 14 years, British financial assets have been choppy, with investors taking a more risk-averse approach by selling both government bonds and the pound.",
      "The budget saw taxes raised by 40 billion pounds ($52 billion), proportionately the biggest for over three decades, and borrowing and spending increased \u2014 a combination that clearly unnerved some investors.",
      "Some analysts voiced worries about the potential inflationary impact of the budget, which may prompt the Bank of England to cut interest rates more slowly than previously anticipated. Though the bank is widely expected to reduce its main interest rate next week by a further quarter-point to 4.75%, the markets have moved to price in fewer reductions next year in the wake of the budget.",
      "Other analysts said the public finances will likely need to be bolstered again in coming years if the U.K.'s economic growth doesn't pick up. The Office for Budget Responsibility, an independent watchdog, said in its assessment of the budget that the measures would do little to boost growth levels over the coming years.",
      "On Friday, the yield, or interest rate, charged on the U.K.'s 10-year bonds held steady at 4.45%, following increases since Treasury chief Rachel Reeves presented the budget. The pound meanwhile was up 0.4% to $1.2951.",
      "Ahead of the statement, Reeves was clearly aware of how a budget can go wrong and prompt panic in financial markets. Two years ago, the short-lived premiership of Liz Truss foundered after a series of unfunded tax cuts sent borrowing costs surging.",
      "\u201cThough the market\u2019s allergic reaction is unwelcome for the new Labour government, the response has been much more muted than after the Conservative\u2019s mini-Budget of September 2022. \u201d said Andrew Goodwin, chief U.K. economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "The overall increase in taxes announced by Reeves comes in large part from an increase in a tax businesses pay for employing people. The 1.2 percentage-point increase in employers' national insurance contributions, along with the fact that the levy will be paid on lower incomes, is forecast to raise 25 billion pounds.",
      "Many executives have expressed concern about the move, arguing that it may depress wages by prompting firms to seek a way of absorbing the additional costs.",
      "The center-left Labour Party won a landslide election victory July 4 after promising to end years of turmoil and scandal under successive Conservative governments, get Britain\u2019s economy growing and restore frayed public services. But the scale of the measures announced on Wednesday by Reeves exceeded Labour\u2019s cautious general election campaign."

    "summary": "In 2006, environmental nonprofits and some of the world&rsquo;s largest soybean traders came together in a landmark &ldquo;soy moratorium&rdquo; to stop the sale of soy grown on illegally deforested land in Brazil's Amazon",
    "story": [
      "In 2006, environmental nonprofits and some of the world\u2019s largest soybean traders came together in a landmark \u201csoy moratorium\u201d to stop the sale of soy grown on illegally deforested land in Brazil's Amazon",
      "AGUA CLARA, Brazil -- A historic agreement that's helped curb deforestation in Brazil\u2019s Amazon for nearly two decades suffered a major blow after Mato Grosso, the country\u00b4s largest soybean-producing state, passed a law ending incentives for participating processing and trade companies.",
      "The law passed last week was designed to void the Soy Moratorium \u2014 a 2006 deal in reaction to a Greenpeace investigation that linked soy produced in illegally deforested areas to U.S. commodities giants Cargill, Bunge and ADM. Under pressure, the companies agreed at the time not to buy soy produced in areas cleared after 2006. The date was later revised to July 2008.",
      "Several studies in recent years have shown the moratorium contributed to the Amazon\u2019s preservation. A 2020 study in the journal Nature Food found that the agreement, in combination with public policies, contributed to the steepest reduction of deforestation recorded in Brazil\u2019s Amazon, between 2003 and 2016.",
      "Backed by soybean producers and most of Mato Grosso\u00b4s lawmakers and mayors, the new legislation cuts tax benefits to companies that participate in any agreement that imposes restrictions on expanding agricultural activities into areas that can be legally deforested. Governor Mauro Mendes signed the law Oct. 24. It goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2025, but regulations are pending.",
      "It states that only the illegally deforested area of a farm will be prevented from selling soy. In other words, if a 4,000-acre (1,618-hectare) property clears 200 acres (81 hectares) unlawfully, just the output from that specific area is blocked. Specialists warn that such refined monitoring is technically challenging, if not unfeasible.",
      "Under the moratorium, property with any post-2008 deforestation is forbidden altogether to sell its crops, regardless of whether the deforestation is legal.",
      "Supporters of the new state law have long claimed the moratorium\u00b4s 2008 limit is stricter than Brazilian legislation that allows the deforestation of up to 20% of a large rural property in the Amazon.",
      "\u201cWe will not rest as long as the moratorium harms even one producer,\" the Mato Grosso soy producers president Lucas Costa Beber said in a celebratory statement. \"And until this agreement is extinct, the trading companies will not have a peaceful sleep.\"",
      "Environmental nonprofits and the entity representing leading soybean trade and processing companies have criticized Mato Grosso\u00b4s initiative.",
      "\u201cThe law is a setback,\u201d said Bernardo Pires, sustainability director of the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (Abiove), which supports the moratorium. \u201cCompanies committed to sustainability should receive twice as many benefits instead of losing them.\u201d",
      "Abiove members, which include Cargill, Bunge and ADM, buy over 90% of Mato Grosso\u00b4s soy production. The state tax benefits amount to $308 million a year.",
      "Pires said the moratorium\u00b4s zero deforestation policy is a market demand. \"Our European customers demand not to consume any products associated with deforestation,\u201d he said.",
      "Cristiane Mazzetti, coordinator of the forests campaign at Greenpeace Brazil, said the law reveals a double standard among politicians connected to agribusiness, who oppose the moratorium as unnecessary yet seek to weaken these same environmental protection.",
      "The new law sparked mixed reactions within President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s government, which has promised zero deforestation by 2030.",
      "Andr\u00e9 Lima, secretary of deforestation control at the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, said that although state governments have the right to choose which economic activities they want to support, it is unconstitutional to withdraw tax incentives from companies that have adopted sustainability and climate criteria aligned with Brazil\u2019s deforestation reduction goals.",
      "\u201cIt also goes against the national tax reform guidelines, which have incorporated sustainable development as an important criterion for promoting more and new tax incentives for the green economy,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "Agriculture Minister Carlos F\u00e1varo, however, praised the law. \u201cThe project (moratorium) is stricter than the law, and this creates legitimate dissatisfaction among producers,\u201d he told reporters in an event last week.",

    "story": [
      "The English village of Abbots Langley has become a flashpoint in a British battle over data centers",
      "ABBOTS LANGLEY, England -- Originally built to store crops from peasant farmers, the Tithe Barn on the edge of the English village of Abbots Langley was converted into homes that preserve its centuries of history. Now, its residents are fighting to stop a development next door that represents the future.",
      "A proposal to build a data center on a field across the road was rejected by local authorities amid fierce opposition from villagers. But it's getting a second chance from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, which is pursuing reforms to boost economic growth following his Labour party's election victory in July.",
      "Residents of Abbots Langley, 18 miles (30 kilometers) northwest of London, worry the facility will strain local resources and create noise and traffic that damages the character of the quiet village, which is home to just over 20,000 people. Off the main street there's a church with a stone tower built in the 12th century and, further down the road, a picturesque circular courtyard of rustic thatched-roof cottages that used to be a farm modeled on one built for French Queen Marie Antoinette.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just hideously inappropriate,\u201d said Stewart Lewis, 70, who lives in one of the converted houses in the 600-year-old Tithe Barn. \u201cI think any reasonable person anywhere would say, \u2018Hang on, they want a data center? This isn\u2019t the place for it.'\u201d",
      "As the artificial intelligence boom fuels demand for cloud-based computing from server farms around the world, such projects are pitting business considerations, national priorities and local interests against each other.",
      "Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has stepped in to review the appeals filed by developers of three data center projects after they were rejected by local authorities, taking the decision out of the hands of town planners. Those proposals include Abbots Langley and two projects in Buckinghamshire, which sits west of London. The first decision is expected by January.",
      "The projects are controversial because the data centers would be built on \u201cgreenbelt\u201d land, which has been set aside to prevent urbanization. Rayner wants to tap the greenbelt for development, saying much of it is low quality. One proposed Buckinghamshire project, for example, involves redeveloping an industrial park next to a busy highway.",
      "\u201cWhilst it\u2019s officially greenbelt designated land, there isn\u2019t anything \u2018green\u2019 about the site today,\u201d said Stephen Beard, global head of data centers at Knight Frank, a property consultancy that\u2019s working on the project.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually an eyesore which is very prominent from the M25\u2033 highway, he said.",
      "Greystoke, the company behind the Abbots Langley center and a second Buckinghamshire project to be built on a former landfill, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. In an online video for Abbots Langley, a company representative says, \u201cWe have carried out a comprehensive search for sites, and this one is the very best.\u201d It doesn't specify which companies would possibly use the center.",
      "The British government is making data centers a core element of its economic growth plans, deeming them \u201ccritical national infrastructure\u201d to give businesses confidence to invest in them. Starmer has announced deals for new centers, including a 10 billion pound ($13 billion) investment from private equity firm Blackstone to build what will be Europe's biggest AI data center in northeast England.",
      "The land for the Abbots Langley data center is currently used to graze horses. It's bordered on two other sides by a cluster of affordable housing and a highway.",
      "Greystoke's plans to construct two large buildings totaling 84,000 square meters (904,00 square feet) and standing up to 20 meters (66 feet) tall have alarmed Lewis and other villagers, who worry that it will dwarf everything else nearby.",
      "They also doubt Greystoke's promise that it will create up to 260 jobs.",
      "\u201cEverything will be automated, so they wouldn\u2019t need people,\" said tech consultant Jennifer Stirrup, 51, who lives in the area.",
      "Not everyone in the village is opposed.",
      "Retiree Bryan Power says he would welcome the data center, believing it would benefit the area in a similar way as another big project on the other side of the village, the Warner Bros.' Studio Tour featuring a Harry Potter exhibition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll bring some jobs, whatever. It\u2019ll be good. Yeah. No problem. Because if it doesn\u2019t come, it\u2019ll go somewhere else,\u201d said Power, 56.",
      "One of the biggest concerns about data centers is their environmental impact, especially the huge amounts of electricity they need. Greystoke says the facility will draw 96 megawatts of \u201cIT load.\" But James Felstead, director of a renewable energy company and Lewis\u2019 neighbor, said the area\u2019s power grid wouldn\u2019t be able to handle so much extra demand.",
      "It's a problem reflected across Europe, where data center power demand is expected to triple by the end of the decade, according to consulting firm McKinsey. While the AI-fueled data boom has prompted Google, Amazon and Microsoft to look to nuclear power as a source of clean energy, worries about their ecological footprint have already sparked tensions over data centers elsewhere.",
      "Google was forced to halt plans in September for a $200 million data center in Chile\u2019s capital, Santiago, after community complaints about its potential water and energy usage.",
      "In Ireland, where many Silicon Valley companies have European headquarters, the grid operator has temporarily halted new data centers around Dublin until 2028 over worries they\u2019re guzzling too much electricity.",
      "A massive data center project in northern Virginia narrowly won county approval last year, amid heavy opposition from residents concerned about its environmental impact. Other places like Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Singapore have imposed various restrictions on data centers.",
      "Public knowledge about the industry is still low but \u201cpeople are realizing more that these data centers are quite problematic,\u201d said Sebastian Lehuede, a lecturer in ethics, AI and society at King\u2019s College London who studied the Google case in Chile.",
      "As awareness grows about their environmental impact, Lehuede said, \u201cI\u2019m sure we will have more opposition from different communities.\""

      "With most preliminary results counted, Sandu was leading with almost 55% of the vote, and in a late-night speech she promised to be president for all Moldovans.",
      "Her rival Alexandr Stoianoglo, who was backed by the pro-Russian Party of Socialists, had promised a closer relationship with Moscow.",
      "During the vote, the president's national security adviser said there had been \"massive interference\" from Russia in Moldova's electoral process that had \"high potential to distort the outcome\".",

      "Stoianoglo, who was fired as prosecutor general by Sandu, has denied being pro-Kremlin.",
      "As polls closed, both Maia Sandu, 52, and her rival thanked voters, with Stoianoglo speaking in Russian as well as Romanian. Although Romanian is Moldova's main language, Russian is widely spoken because of its Soviet past.",
      "Voting ended in Moldova at 21:00 (19:00 GMT), with a 54% turnout higher than four years ago, and especially high among expat voters at polling stations abroad.",
      "Stoianoglo took an early lead and won the vote in Moldova itself with more than 51%, according to the preliminary results. Sandu was far ahead in the capital Chisinau, and was completely dominant among expat voters.",

      "Then, moving into Russian, she said: \"I have heard your voice \u2013 both those who supported me and those who voted for Mr. Stoianoglo. In our choice for a dignified future, no-one lost... we need to stand united.\"",
      "Maia Sandu\u2019s foreign policy adviser, Olga Rosca, told the BBC she was proud of the result.",
      "Asked whether she was surprised that Stoianoglo had won in Moldova itself, she said the vote in Moldova and abroad should be seen as one and the same: \u201cWe never divide people into Moldovans at home and expatriates - we see Moldovans as one family.\u201d",
      "With elections coming next year she said the president had \u201cclearly indicated she has heard the mood for change. On several occasions between the [two presidential] votes she said the fight against corruption must be intensified and justice reform must be accelerated \u2013 she\u2019s committed to this work\u201d.",
      "The final result will be declared on Monday.",
      "EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Sandu, saying \"it takes a rare kind of strength to overcome the challenges you've faced in this election.",
      "\"I'm glad to continue working with you towards a European future for Moldova and its people,\" her message on X said.",
      "Casting his ballot, Alexandr Stoianoglo had promised to be an \"apolitical president\", and that he had voted for \"a Moldova that should develop in harmony with both the West and the East\".",
      "Stoianoglo polled particularly well in rural areas and the south, while Sandu was ahead in the cities and with young voters.",
      "After casting her ballot, Sandu had warned of \"thieves\" who sought to buy their vote and their country.",
      "Presidential national security adviser Stanislav Secrieru said Russia had organised buses and large charter flights to bring voters to polling stations.",
      "Bomb scares had briefly disrupted voting in Moldova, at UK polling stations in Liverpool and Northampton and at Frankfurt and Kaiserslautern in Germany, he added.",
      "A Soviet republic for 51 years, Moldova is flanked by Ukraine and Romania and one of Europe's poorest countries. It has a population of 2.5 million and an expat population of 1.2 million.",
      "Moldova's authorities have long warned that a fugitive oligarch called Ilan Shor has spent $39m (\u00a330m) trying to buy the election for Moscow with handouts to 138,000 Moldovans.",
      "Shor, who is based in Moscow, denies wrongdoing but did promise cash payments to anyone prepared to back his call for a \"firm No\" to the EU.",
      "Commentators and politicians had warned that a Stoianoglo victory could radically change the political landscape in the Danube and Black Sea region, not because he was some kind of \"Trojan horse\", but rather because Russia has thrown its weight behind him.",
      "There were queues at polling stations in Moscow, Italy and among voters from a mainly Russian-speaking breakaway region of Transnistria, who had to cross the River Dniester into Moldovan-controlled territory to vote. Transnistria is home to a Russian military base and a huge arms depot.",
      "Moldova's election commission said it was aware of reports of organised and illegal transports of voters by air and land in Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Turkey, and appealed to the public to report further violations.",
      "Although Sandu had easily won the first round of the vote, several candidates swung behind Stoianoglo, although the third-placed candidate refused to back either of the two.",
      "The first round coincided with a nail-biting referendum on backing a change to the constitution embracing the commitment to join the EU.",
      "In the end the vote passed by a tiny margin in favour, and Maia Sandu said there had been clear evidence of attempts to buy 300,000 votes."

      "If Chinese leader Xi Jinping is unable shape the Putin-Kim alliance to suit his interests, China may well remain stuck in the middle as western anger and anxiety grows.",
      "Moscow and Pyongyang deny that North Korean soldiers are headed for Ukraine, widely seen as a significant escalation. But the United States says it has seen evidence of this, following allegations by South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence.",
      "The first reports emerged just before Xi met his Russian counterpart at the Brics summit earlier in October, overshadowing a gathering that was meant to send the West a defiant message.",
      "It increasingly appears as though China\u2019s allies are spiralling out of its control. Beijing, the senior partner in the triad, seeks to be the stable leader of a new world order, one that is not led by the US. But that\u2019s difficult to do when one ally has started a war in Europe, and another is accused of aiding the invasion.",
      "\u201cChina is unhappy with the way things are going,\u201d Mr Green says, \u201cbut they are trying to keep their discontent relatively quiet.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s certainly a sensitive topic for Beijing, judging by the response to our presence in the border town, where it seems tourists are welcome - but journalists are not.",
      "We were in public areas at all times, and yet the team was stopped, repeatedly questioned, followed and our footage deleted.",
      "The hotel demanded to keep my passport for \u201cmy safety and the safety of others\u201d. Police visited our hotel rooms, and they also blocked the road to the port at Hunchun, which would have given us a closer view of the current trade between Russia and China.",
      "'Lips and teeth'",
      "On the viewing platform in Fangchuan, it\u2019s clear that most tourists have come to see North Korea.",
      "\u201cI saw a person cycling,\u201d says one girl peering through a telescope. Her friend  rushes over to see: \u201cOoooh! It\u2019s such a mysterious country.\u201d",
      "Close by is the Tumen river that gently cuts through all three countries. It is China\u2019s gateway into the Sea of Japan, where it has territorial disputes with Tokyo.",
      "The 1,400km-long (870 mile) Chinese border has some of the only platforms with a clear view into North Korea. South Korea\u2019s frontier with the North is an almost impenetrable barrier, the heavily mined and fortified Demilitarized Zone.",
      "Someone offers me a pair of binoculars. Some people are cycling through the village on ageing bicycles, but there are few other signs of life. One of the largest buildings is a school with a sign calling for children to \u201clearn well for Chosun\u201d, another name for North Korea.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea has always been our neighbour. It\u2019s no stranger to us,\u201d says a middle-aged man. \u201cTo be able to see how they live makes me realise China is prosperous and strong.\u201d",
      "Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime would certainly struggle to survive without its biggest benefactor, China, which accounts for more than 90% of foreign trade, including food and fuel.",
      "That was not always the case. In the early 1960s it was the Chinese who fled famine across the Tumen river. Some even went to school in North Korea because they believed its education system at the time was better.",
      "The North Korean economy crashed after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 \u2013 which had been its main source of aid and cheap oil - sparking severe food shortages and, eventually, famine.",
      "Soon, North Korean refugees began wading through an often freezing river at the risk of being shot dead to escape hunger, poverty and repression. There are now more than 30,000 of them in South Korea and an unknown number still live in China.",
      "\u201cSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Korea hasn\u2019t really had any choice but to maintain good relations with China, which has been its sole benefactor,\u201d Mr Green says.",
      "But now, he adds, Russia \u201cis offering an alternative and the North Koreans are seeking to exploit that\u201d.",
      "Mao Zedong, the first leader of the People\u2019s Republic of China, had likened the relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang to the closeness between \u201clips and teeth\u201d: \u201cIf the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold.\u201d",
      "\u2018The comrade from hell\u2019",
      "Now, Beijing finds itself smarting from a lack of gratitude as Kim\u2019s lips are \u201ckissing elsewhere\u201d, according to sociologist Aidan Foster-Carter, who has studied North Korea for several decades.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea has consistently been the comrade from hell to both Russia and China. They take as much money as they can and [then] do what they like.\u201d",
      "Analysts have noted that Kim has consistently flattered Putin over Xi in the last year. While Kim hasn\u2019t met Xi since 2019, he has met Putin twice in the past year or so. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has drawn the two sanctioned leaders closer than ever. Putin seeks more support for his war and Kim wants to bolster his regime with alliances and attention.",
      "From the Chinese border, it\u2019s easy to see the burgeoning relationship between the two sides.",
      "The whistle of a train interrupts the tourist chatter, and a steam engine pulling a long line of freight carriages slowly chugs across the railway bridge from Russia to North Korea. It stops in front of a Korean sign facing China which reads: \u201cTowards a new victory!\u201d",
      "The US estimates that Kim has sold more than a million artillery shells and Grad rockets to Moscow for use in Ukraine, which North Korea denies.",
      "But there is no doubt that the pair have stepped up cooperation after signing a security pact in June to help each other in the event of \"aggression\" against either country.",
      "\u201cYou have very stiff and formal language to Xi Jinping on the occasion of what is actually an historically important event \u2013 the 75th anniversary of relations of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d Mr Foster-Carter says.",
      "\u201cAnd yet on Putin\u2019s birthday, Kim calls him \u2018my closest comrade\u2019. If you are Xi Jinping, what are you thinking?\u201d",
      "'Through gritted teeth'",
      "It\u2019s hard to know, because China has shown no signs of interfering with the Russia-North Korea alliance.",
      "The US has noticed Beijing\u2019s disquiet and for once the two rivals may have similar goals.",
      "In the last week, State Department officials have raised the issue of North Korean troops in Russia with Chinese diplomats.",
      "Beijing does have options - in the past, they have cut supplies of oil and coal to North Korea, and complied with US-led sanctions to curb Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programme.",
      "Already, China is battling US accusations that it is selling components to Russia that aid its invasion of Ukraine. Beijing\u2019s trade with Moscow is also flourishing, even as it tries to cope with Western tariffs.",
      "Xi has kept Russia close because he needs Putin\u2019s help to challenge the US-led world order. But he has not stopped trying to repair ties with Europe, the UK and even the US. China has also been holding talks with Japan and South Korea to ease historic tensions.",
      "But Kim\u2019s increasingly aggressive rhetoric against Seoul has the South once again debating whether it should have its own nuclear arsenal. North Korean troops on a Ukrainian battlefield would only further unravel Beijing\u2019s plans.",
      "The possibility has already seen South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol discuss \"concrete counter-measures\" and talk of strengthening security cooperation with Ukraine and Nato.",
      "A nuclear-armed South Korea or an \u201cEast Asian Nato\u201d are not ideal in a region where China wants greater sway. An emboldened Kim could also draw a stronger show of support from the US \u2013 in the form of warships or even weapons - towards its allies, Seoul and Tokyo.",
      "\u201cFor a very long time, China has had a policy of three nos in Northeast Asia \u2013 one of those nos was a no nuclear North Korea. Obviously that has been a failure,\u201d Mr Green says.",
      "Now Beijing fears that the alliance with Russia could destabilise North Korea, he adds: \u201cThat could even benefit Vladimir Putin in a way it really would not benefit Xi Jinping.\u201d",
      "Experts say Beijing is just as worried as the West about what military technology Putin might sell to Kim in exchange for troops.",
      "\u201cSatellites, for sure,\u201d Mr Foster-Carter says. \u201cBut Putin is bad \u2013 not mad. Russia knows just as China knows that North Korea is a loose cannon. Giving [Kim] more technology for nukes is not a good thing for anybody.\u201d",
      "Experts believe Xi is unlikely to do anything drastic because China needs a stable North Korea \u2013 if he cuts off aid, he would likely have a refugee crisis at the border.",
      "But Kim too might have a decision to make.",
      "Although Russia is paying for shells and troops, Mr Foster-Carter says, it is China that \"has actually kept North Korea going all this time, often through gritted teeth. I just wonder at what point Beijing will turn on Pyongyang?\u201d.",
      "Kim's deadly gamble could also have a profound impact closer to home - the 25 million North Koreans who are cut off from the outside world and completely dependent on the regime for their survival.",
      "Across the Tumen river in Fangchuan, a North Korean soldier watches us, while we watch him.",
      "Steam rises from snack stands selling noodles and sizzled octopus on sticks on the Chinese side. And he can probably hear the giggling tourists taking pictures with the latest cameras and phones, which he is forbidden from owning.",
      "The shallow river is a gulf neither the tourists nor the soldier can cross.",
      "Are North Korean troops joining Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine?",

    "summary": "A look back at the Democratic candidate's career in California shows her struggle to define herself to the public began long before she came to Washington.",
    "story": [
      "Just over three months ago, Vice-President Kamala Harris walked up to a microphone to make a speech that would define both her past and her future.",
      "A day before, President Joe Biden had dropped out of the election race and endorsed her to succeed him as Democratic candidate. With only a short period of campaigning ahead of her, Harris had no time to waste.",
      "There is a saying in politics: define yourself or be defined by your opponent. And in that moment, when Harris made her first pitch to the American people, she defined herself not just in terms of her record in the White House or as a US senator, but the years she spent as a California prosecutor.",
      "\u201cI took on perpetrators of all kinds - predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type,\u201d she said of her Republican challenger.",
      "The line has been repeated often at her campaign rallies and stump speeches, as the 60-year-old has sought to frame this election as a contest between a hard-bitten prosecutor and a convicted felon, constantly reminding voters of Trump\u2019s legal troubles.",
      "How Donald Trump came back from the political abyss",
      "How Donald Trump came back from the political abyss",
      "But a look back at Harris\u2019s time in and out of California's courtrooms reveals her enduring struggle to define herself, what her opponents say is a history of pivoting on issues depending on the political weather, as well as her uncanny ability to seize the moment when others have counted her out.",
      "Street murders and rough San Francisco politics",
      "Harris\u2019s time in law enforcement began just out of law school in Alameda County, California - which includes the cities of Berkeley and her hometown of Oakland.",
      "During the 1990s, in the midst of the government's \"war on drugs\", Oakland struggled with violent crime.",
      "For a junior prosecutor, the job was daunting. But the severity of the cases you had to deal with meant it was considered a top job for a young and ambitious attorney, said Teresa Drenick, who worked with Harris at the time.",
      "\u201cIt was like a potboiler of an atmosphere. The amount of grief and agony you ingested every day was hard to process. For us, it was intense. The stakes being high, the crimes being so serious,\u201d she told the BBC.",
      "\"It was near the height of the crack-cocaine epidemic. There were gang murders, street corner murders taking place. There was a lot going on in Oakland that enabled you as a prosecutor to handle some of the most serious cases that a prosecutor is ever going to handle.\"",
      "Ms Drenick and Harris were on the same trial team together. She admired Harris\u2019s confidence in front of a jury, and her respect for her colleague only grew when Harris was transferred to a different team in the same courthouse focused on child sexual assault.",
      "\"She was very, very caring of victims of child abuse. She was able to speak to them in a way that allowed them to open up to her,\u201d she said.",
      "It was at this time that Harris dated Willie Brown, a local political kingmaker and speaker of the California State Assembly who helped launch the careers of some of the state\u2019s other most prominent political leaders, including Gavin Newsom, the current governor, and San Francisco Mayor London Breed.",
      "Brown appointed her to two state boards and introduced her to some of San Francisco\u2019s highest-profile Democratic donors. The short-lived romance ended by the time Brown was elected as the city\u2019s mayor in 1995. Three years later, Harris took a job at the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office.",
      "During her relationship with Brown, who was 30 years her senior, Harris had begun mingling with some of the city\u2019s political heavyweights.",
      "San Francisco's political machine, which Harris has described as \u201ca bare-knuckled sport\u201d, has launched the careers of some of the nation\u2019s biggest political stalwarts including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the late Senator Dianne Feinstein.",
      "Harris forged relationships with both of them, rising alongside contemporaries like Newsom, as she found her feet in the political world.",
      "Her swift rise through San Francisco\u2019s rough-and-tumble politics were defined by days in courtrooms representing victims and nights at glitzy political galas.",
      "This was also around the time that Harris met one of her closest friends \u2013 and most significant donors - Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.",
      "Jobs donated $500 to Harris\u2019s 2003 campaign for San Francisco district attorney, which she won, toppling the man who had hired her. Twenty years later, the billionaire philanthropist donated nearly $1m to the Biden-Harris re-election campaign, according to Fortune Magazine. It\u2019s not known how much she has directly contributed to Harris\u2019s bid for the presidency, but the amount is considered substantial.",
      "\u2018No exception to principle\u2019",
      "On the day before Easter in 2004, just four months into Kamala Harris\u2019s tenure as the district attorney of San Francisco, a gang member brandishing an AK-47 rifle fatally shot a 29-year old police officer named Isaac Espinoza.",
      "The slaying stunned the city, with many politicians and prominent members of the police calling for the death penalty.",
      "But Harris, who had made opposition to capital punishment a key part of her political campaign to become the city\u2019s top prosecutor, instead decided to pursue a life sentence without parole. She made her decision public just 48 hours after the murder, without informing the widow first.",
      "\u201cShe did not call me,\u201d Espinoza told CNN in 2019. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why she went on camera to say that without talking to the family. It\u2019s like, you can\u2019t even wait till he\u2019s buried?\u201d",
      "The backlash was swift. Speaking at the officer\u2019s funeral, Senator Feinstein demanded his killer \u201cpay the ultimate price\u201d. While walking out of the church service, she told reporters that had she known Harris was against the death penalty, she probably wouldn't have endorsed her.",
      "\u201c[T]here can be no exception to principle,\u201d Harris later wrote in an opinion piece in the San Francisco Chronicle, defending her decision.",
      "Long-time civil rights attorney John Burris, who supported Harris\u2019s decision at the time, said he thought it was \u201cpolitically was not wise for her, but it was a philosophical position she took\u201d.",
      "\"She was pretty bold in her position and she did take a lot of heat for it,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThat was a pretty progressive stand.\u201d",
      "The incident could have been the end of her political ambitions, but Harris, who had grown up with a single mother in the working-class city of Oakland, carried on.",
      "\u201cIs she a political animal? Absolutely not. Is she naturally skilled? Yes,\u201d said Brian Brokaw, who managed Harris\u2019s two successful campaigns for California attorney general in 2010 and 2014. \u201cFor her, politics is the means to the end. She is focused on the end result and the impact she can have on people\u2019s lives less than the process.\u201d",
      "Harris seemed to absorb some lessons from her first major decision as San Francisco district attorney. Four years later, she again declined to pursue the death penalty after a dramatic killing, but this time, she better understood how her decision would reverberate.",
      "Tony Bologna had been driving in San Francisco with his three sons when their vehicle was barraged by gunfire. Bologna and two of his sons were killed; his third son was critically injured.",
      "Shortly after the killing, police arrested Edwin Ramon Uma\u00f1a, an undocumented member of the MS-13 gang who had evidently mistaken the 49-year old Bologna for a sworn enemy.",
      "This time, Harris opted to deliver the difficult news about her prosecutorial decision to Bologna\u2019s widow Danielle herself, recalls Matt Davis, who was representing Danielle Bologna in a civil suit against the city at the time.",
      "\u201cIt was no surprise that Danielle had a very strong, negative reaction to the news,\u201d Mr Davis told the BBC in a recent interview. \u201cShe made it clear that she was upset, and Kamala listened to her and expressed her sympathies but stayed pretty firm.\u201d",
      "The meeting left an indelible impression on Davis. He had befriended Harris in law school in San Francisco, and when she had first revealed her plans to run for D.A., he remembers thinking she didn\u2019t have a chance.",
      "But he says that painful conversation made him realise he had underestimated her.",
      "\u201cThat was not an easy thing to do,\u201d Mr Davis said.",
      "Progressive prosecutor?",
      "Over the span of her law enforcement career, Harris\u2019s allies sought to paint her as a \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d committed to criminal justice reform but also tough on crime.",
      "It was a fine line to walk in a liberal city in the country\u2019s largest left-leaning state, and one that critics on both sides of the political aisle say she did not stick to.",
      "As district attorney, she adopted a so-called \u201csmart-on-crime\u201d philosophy, which included initiatives to keep non-violent offenders out of prison by steering them into job training programs and ensuring young offenders remained in school.",
      "Niki Solis, an attorney in the San Francisco public defender\u2019s office who worked opposite Harris in the early 2000s, said she had been receptive to her concerns about how young victims of sex trafficking were being charged with prostitution, as opposed to being treated as victims.",
      "\u201cI realised that she understood issues that a lot of her predecessors and a lot of [district attorneys] up and down the state failed to understand or even acknowledge,\u201d said Ms Solis.",
      "Trump and his allies on the right have sought to play up this time in her career, depicting her as part of a \u201cSan Francisco liberal elite\u201d. But on the left of politics, she has been accused of not being reform-minded enough, with some on social media nicknaming her \u201cKamala the cop\u201d.",
      "But by the time Harris was elected as California\u2019s attorney general, in 2010, her progressive tendencies appeared to have given way to political pragmatism.",
      "\"She was seeking more of a national profile. She wanted to make a mark. There was definitely an expectation of an interesting future to come,\u201d said Gil Duran, who worked for Harris in the attorney general\u2019s office for a few months.",
      "\"The attorney general - usually a sleepy backwater of an office - was now home to a rising star.\"",
      "On the national stage, Harris began to make her mark. In 2012, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Harris threatened to walk away from negotiations on a financial settlement between state attorneys general and five US banks. California was set to receive around $4 billion in the initial deal, and Harris eventually secured $18 billion for the state.",
      "The Harris campaign has highlighted this case on the campaign trail as more proof she\u2019s willing to stand up to powerful interests.",
      "But more recent reporting shows that only $4.5 billion of the settlement ended up going towards California homeowners who had been ripped off by lenders.",
      "In moves that angered some liberals, she implemented a school truancy program state-wide, which some county prosecutors used to arrest parents. And she defied a Supreme Court order to reduce overcrowding in the state\u2019s prisons.",
      "She also reversed her previous position on the death penalty in 2014 when, as attorney general, she appealed a lower court\u2019s ruling that found it was unconstitutional. Now, the prosecutor who once refused to sentence violent murderers to death on the basis that \"there is no exception to principle\" was defending the state\u2019s right to do just that.",
      "Hadar Aviram, a criminal justice and civil rights professor who petitioned Harris to leave the decision in place, was one of many critics of her stance.",
      "\u201cYou are not under any obligation to defend things that are morally unjust,\u201d she told CNN in 2019 of the episode. \u201cIf you truly believe that they\u2019re morally unjust and you have an opportunity to take a stand, I think it\u2019s an imperative to do so.\u201d",
      "Former San Francisco city attorney Louise Renne, who worked with Harris when she first left Oakland, said the torrent of criticism she faced over her support for the death penalty was unfair.",
      "\u201cThe thing is when you\u2019re state attorney general, you have to defend the law. That\u2019s your obligation,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201c I don\u2019t regard that as a weakness or a valid criticism at all.\u201d",
      "But Harris was selective about which laws she enforced. In 2004, when Gavin Newsom, then San Francisco's mayor, decided to allow same-sex weddings, in violation of state law, Harris helped officiate a few of the ceremonies, calling it \u201cone of the most joyful\u201d moments of her career.",
      "Her long record as a prosecutor would prove tricky when, after being elected to the US Senate in 2016, Harris decided to run for the Democratic presidential nomination.",
      "She chose to kick off her 2020 presidential run just blocks away from the Alameda County Courthouse, the same place where she first uttered the words, \u201cfor the people\u201d \u2013 which would become part of her campaign slogan.",
      "But in the midst of her campaign, George Floyd, an unarmed black man, was murdered by a police officer during an arrest, igniting a nationwide racial reckoning and demand for criminal justice reform. Her past defence of the death penalty, and resistance to prison reform, earned her criticism from her party\u2019s left-flank.",
      "She dropped out of the presidential race before the primary contests to choose a Democratic contender had even begun.",
      "Reinvented again",
      "Now, as Harris campaigns for president against Donald Trump, she is again calling attention to her prosecutorial bona-fides, but reframed in a new political atmosphere.",
      "While many cities, including San Francisco, experimented with progressive police reform after Floyd\u2019s murder, a spike in crime and homelessness during the pandemic has triggered a public backlash against so-called \u201csoft on crime\u201d policies. Republicans have also heavily focused on political messaging around crime and public safety in recent years.",
      "Harris\u2019s past as a prosecutor is no longer such a liability, and in a race against the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes, the narrative aligns with the political moment.",
      "Notably, at the Democratic National Convention this summer, abolishing the death penalty was dropped from the party platform.",
      "And while in 2020, Harris was trying to win over left-leaning Democrats, she is now explicitly making a pitch for moderate Republicans who may be fed up with Trump. To do that, she has shifted a number of her positions - from border security to single-payer health care - to the centre.",
      "This has led to accusations from her opponents that she is a flip-flopper.",
      "She\u2019s \u201ca chameleon\u201d, Trump\u2019s running mate and Ohio Senator JD Vance told CNN in August. \u201cShe pretends to be one thing in front of one audience and she pretends to be something different in front of another audience.\u201d",
      "But Mr Duran, Harris's former colleague in the attorney general\u2019s office, sees it less as a matter of political scrupulousness and more simply a sign of her political pragmatism.",
      "\"I think she does have conviction but it\u2019s really hard to run a campaign on your convictions alone, for the most part,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Kamala Harris we\u2019re seeing now is very much poll and focus-group driven.\u201d",
      "What Harris really stands for has been a question that has dogged her throughout her career - and continues to follow her on her bid for the Oval Office. But to Mr Brokaw, her former campaign manager, she has always operated on her own terms.",
      "\u201cShe has carved her own path and left a whole bunch of people behind who counted her out and underestimated her,\u201d he said.",

      "Experts around the world have marvelled at how little Indian Space Research Organisation\u2019s (Isro) Moon, Mars and solar missions have cost. India spent $74m on the Mars orbiter Mangalyaan and $75m on last year\u2019s historic Chandrayaan-3 \u2013 less than the $100m spent on the sci-fi thriller Gravity.",
      "Nasa\u2019s Maven orbiter had cost $582m and Russia\u2019s Luna-25, which crashed on to the Moon\u2019s surface two days before Chandrayaan-3\u2019s landing, had cost 12.6bn roubles ($133m).",
      "Despite the low cost, scientists say India is punching much above its weight by aiming to do valuable work.",
      "Chandrayaan-1 was the first to confirm the presence of water in lunar soil and Mangalyaan carried a payload to study methane in the atmosphere of Mars. Images and data sent by Chandrayaan-3 are being looked at with great interest by space enthusiasts around the world.",
      "So how does India keep the costs so low?",
      "Retired civil servant Sisir Kumar Das, who looked after Isro\u2019s finances for more than two decades, says the frugality can be traced back to the 1960s, when scientists first pitched a space programme to the government.",
      "India had gained independence from British colonial rule only in 1947 and the country was struggling to feed its population and build enough schools and hospitals.",
      "\u201cIsro\u2019s founder and scientist Vikram Sarabhai had to convince the government that a space programme was not just a sophisticated luxury that had no place in a poor country like India. He explained that satellites could help India serve its citizens better,\u201d Mr Das told the BBC.",

      "India makes historic landing near Moon's south pole",
      "The year India reached the Moon - and aimed for the Sun",
      "But India\u2019s space programme has always had to work with a tight budget in a country with conflicting needs and demands. Photographs from the 1960s and 70s show scientists carrying rockets and satellites on cycles or even a bullock cart.",
      "Decades later and after several successful interplanetary missions, Isro\u2019s budget remains modest. This year, India\u2019s budgetary allocation for its space programme is 130bn rupees ($1.55bn) - Nasa\u2019s budget for the year is $25bn.",
      "Mr Das says one of the main reasons why Isro\u2019s missions are so cheap is the fact that all its technology is home-grown and machines are manufactured in India.",
      "In 1974, after Delhi conducted its first nuclear test and the West imposed an embargo, banning transfer of technology to India, the restrictions were \u201cturned into a blessing in disguise\u201d for the space programme, he adds.",
      "\u201cOur scientists used it as an incentive to develop their own technology. All the equipment they needed was manufactured indigenously - and the salaries and cost of labour were decidedly less here than in the US or Europe.\u201d",
      "Science writer Pallava Bagla says that unlike Isro, Nasa outsources satellite manufacturing to private companies and also takes out insurance for its missions, which add to their costs.",
      "\u201cAlso, unlike Nasa, India doesn't do engineering models which are used for testing a project before the actual launch. We do only a single model and it's meant to fly. It's risky, there are chances of crash, but that's the risk we take. And we are able to take it because it\u2019s a government programme.\u201d",
      "Mylswamy Annadurai, chief of India\u2019s first and second Moon missions and Mars mission, told the BBC that Isro employs far fewer people and pays lower salaries,  which makes Indian projects competitive.",

      "He says he \u201cled small dedicated teams of less than 10 and people often worked extended hours without any overtime payments\u201d because they were so passionate about what they did.",
      "The tight budget for the projects, he said, sometimes sent them back to the drawing board, allowed them to think out of the box and led to new innovations.",
      "\u201cFor Chandrayaan-1, the allocated budget was $89m and that was okay for the original configuration. But subsequently, it was decided that the spacecraft would carry a Moon impact probe which meant an additional 35kg.\u201d",
      "Scientists had two choices - use a heavier rocket to carry the mission, but that would cost more, or remove some of the hardware to lighten the load.",
      "\u201cWe chose the second option. We reduced the number of thrusters from 16 to eight and pressure tanks and batteries were reduced from two to one.\u201d",
      "Reducing the number of batteries, Mr Annadurai says, meant the launch had to take place before the end of 2008.",
      "\u201cThat would give the spacecraft two years while it went around the Moon without encountering a long solar eclipse, which would impact its ability to recharge. So we had to maintain a strict work schedule to meet the launch deadline.\u201d",
      "Mangalyaan cost so little, Mr Annadurai says, \u201cbecause we used most of the hardware we had already designed for Chandrayaan-2 after the second Moon mission got delayed\u201d.",
      "Mr Bagla says India\u2019s space programme coming at such low cost is \u201can amazing feat\u201d. But as India scales up, the cost could rise.",
      "At the moment, he says, India uses small rocket launchers because they don't have anything stronger. But that means India's spacecraft take much longer to reach their destination.",
      "What has India's Moon rover Pragyaan been up to since landing?India's Sun mission reaches final destination",
      "What has India's Moon rover Pragyaan been up to since landing?",
      "India's Sun mission reaches final destination",
      "So, when Chandrayaan-3 was launched, it orbited the Earth several times before it was sling-shot into the lunar orbit, where it went around the Moon a few times before landing. On the other hand, Russia\u2019s Luna-25 escaped the Earth\u2019s gravity quickly riding a powerful Soyuz rocket.",
      "\u201cWe used Mother Earth's gravity to nudge us to the Moon. It took us weeks and a lot of resourceful planning. Isro has mastered this and done it successfully so many times.\u201d",
      "But, Mr Bagla says, India has announced plans to send a manned mission to the Moon by 2040 and it would need a more powerful rocket to fly the astronauts there quicker.",
      "The government recently said work on this new rocket had already been approved and it would be ready by 2032. This Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV) will be able to carry more weight but also cost more.",
      "Also, Mr Bagla says, India is in the process of opening up the space sector to private players and it\u2019s unlikely that costs will remain so low once that happens.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 00:01:32 GMT",
    "summary": "A growing global movement is seeing people object to data centres in their locality.",
    "story": [
      "Environmental campaigner Julie Bolthouse points out that Northern Virginia has the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centres. This is not something she is thrilled about.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re the Wall Street of the data centre industry,\u201d says Ms Bolthouse, who is a director of local Virginian charity and campaign group Piedmont Environmental Council.",
      "Data centres are vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Northern Virginia, the northern region of the state of Virginia, has been a key location for data centres since the 1990s. This is thanks to its immediate proximity to Washington DC, yet with historically cheap electricity and land prices.",
      "Centred on the city of Ashburn, which is 35 miles (56km) west of the US capital, there are more than 477 data centres in the state. This is by far the largest number in the US, with Texas in second place on 290, and California third with 283.",
      "In fact, some studies say that 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic goes through Ashburn and the surrounding area, which has been dubbed \u201cData Centre Alley\u201d.",
      "Thanks in large part to the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires more computing power, demand for data centres is rocketing. As a result, global data centre capacity is expected to double over the next five years, according to a recent study by business analysis firm Moody\u2019s.",
      "Ms Bolthouse and other environmentalists in Northern Virginia are opposed to the continuing expansion of the data centre sector in their region, saying it is already having a major negative impact on their quality of life.",
      "She points to new electricity cables being built over conservation land, parks and neighbourhoods, increased water demand, and the facilities\u2019 back-up diesel generators affecting air quality.",
      "Ms Bolthouse also cites the fact that households in Virginia and neighbouring Maryland are being expected to help pay for the electricity network upgrades that the data centres require.",
      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",
      "The group is continuing to challenge plans for a new \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) data centre in County Clare on Ireland\u2019s west coast.",
      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",
      "\"This threat to the right to water amidst a water crisis raised strong criticisms, leading Google to change the proposed technology to cool down its equipment, so the project was modified. Chillers will cool down with air instead of water.\u201d",
      "In Chile, meanwhile, Google has halted plans for a data centre over similar water use concerns.",
      "Back in Virginia, Ms Bolthouse says the firms need to do more to boost sustainability. In the long run, she says, it will be in the industry's own interests to improve data centres' environmental impact.",
      "\"What's going to happen if we continue with business as usual is that electrical prices are going to skyrocket for everybody, including the data centre industry - and that's their biggest bill, so that's going to impact them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe water scarcity issue is also going to impact them.",
      "\u201cSo I am optimistic that we're going to see a little bit of progress, but I think it's going to take time.\"",

    "story": [
      "After more than a decade as a lawyer at high-powered banking firms like Goldman Sachs and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Nigerian-British Kelechi Ejikeme left the corporate world to follow her passion for interior design.",
      "Her rug collection is inspired by Nigeria's diverse terrain - rolling hills, winding rivers, sprawling savannahs and dense forests, and reminds me of the view from planes.",
      "\"So, when you interpret that into a rug or a carpet, it\u2019s symbolic,\" she said when I met her at her stall at the Decorex interior design show held in London last month.",
      "\"It\u2019s like, every minute, this is what we're actually every day stepping on.\"",
      "Made from jute, a durable and eco-friendly material, each rug integrates these natural elements.",
      "Jute is typically cultivated locally for its edible leaves, not for fibre. It comes from the same plant used for ewedu soup, a staple in south-western Nigeria.",
      "To bring her vision to life, Ejikeme has her rugs produced in India and Nepal, where jute is more widely developed into a thriving industry.",
      "Also at the event was Amechi Mandi, a Cameroonian-Nigerian interior designer who won House & Garden magazine\u2019s Rising Star award in 2022.",
      "He was not showcasing any of his work but had just spoken in a side session about his transition from fashion to interior design.",
      "Mandi holds a degree in furniture and product design, but after working in the fashion industry and later at a design firm, he became increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of genuine African-inspired interior textiles.",
      "Too often, he found, they relied on \"clich\u00e9d\", post-colonial motifs.",
      "This led him to explore his Cameroonian and Nigerian heritage, with a focus on pre-colonial traditions.",
      "Recognising the untapped potential of indigenous textiles fading from memory -especially with the rise of \"ankara\" wax prints, a European import that has come to symbolise African design - Mandi set out to revive these cultural elements.",
      "He began integrating traditional techniques and patterns into his designs, and his work now includes a popular collection of cushions and throws, as well as a successful wallpaper collaboration.",
      "\"People have told me, 'Oh, your work is not African,' because they want to see ankara prints. It's been so impressed in the minds,\" Mandi told me.",
      "\"I get inspiration from indigenous traditions and cultures, and then, I give it a more contemporary spin,\" he added.",
      "Listening to Mandi made me realise how much I, too, had come to associate modern African design with ankara fabrics.",
      "This textile has dominated African fashion and design, making its mark on global stages in recent decades.",
      "And so, as I wandered through the exhibition, it was easy to assume that African designs were absent from this notable gathering.",
      "When she first started, Ejikeme juggled both law and interior design, working in one during the week and the other on weekends. It did not take long for her to realise where her true passion lay.",
      "\"In one world, you\u2019re trying to contain your energy or yourself or your expression just so that you don\u2019t ruffle feathers, while in another world your energy, you can\u2019t even extinguish it,\" she said.",
      "Since making the leap to full-time design six years ago, she has tackled a variety of projects, from homes and workplaces to movie sets.",
      "Last year, she launched her own rug collection, adding a new dimension to her work from her Swallow and Tea studio.",
      "\"It\u2019s a really new thing and I\u2019ve only had two shows but so far I\u2019ve had mostly residential and retail buyers mainly from Europe probably because my first show was in Belgium. Decorex was my first UK show,\" Ejikeme said.",
      "Most of Mandi\u2019s customers are Europeans, a trend he attributes to a prevailing preference among many Africans for foreign products.",
      "\"Most Africans still prefer to buy a Gucci,\" he said.",
      "\"I do have a few Africans buying but they are not like everyday Africans. They were all people who were born and bred abroad and are deep into African heritage and culture.\"",
      "Both Ejikeme and Mandi concur that interior design in Africa is still in its developmental stages.",
      "In contrast to fashion, which has long been a significant focus for Africans and has recently experienced remarkable growth, the field of African interior design is just starting to establish itself.",
      "Ejikeme reflected on her first independent project in 2013, which coincided with a new wave of Africans in London entering high-paying fields like investment banking.",
      "She aimed to create spaces that not only exuded luxury and comfort but also captured a sense of home for her African clients, reflecting their heritage in a meaningful way.",
      "\"I was stumped because I'm somebody who loves antiques. I love old design. When I was in design school in London, my favourite thing was history of design, like learning about all the different periods - Victorian, Edwardian, etc - and what distinguished one from the other.",
      "\"But there was no such thing in Africa. There's nothing like the history of African design because we haven't really kept that track,\" she said.",
      "This realisation motivated her to begin categorising African design periods to better understand and preserve the continent's design evolution, an ongoing project she began during her past 10 years living in Nigeria before returning to London last year.",
      "Ejikeme visited places like the Bogobiri art gallery in Lagos, which displayed a mixture of old sculpture and modern art.",
      "She also visited sellers in quiet corners of Nigerian markets, where she came across staffs of office used by Igbo elders in precolonial times. She began categorising these objects she came across according to their period in history, whether late 1990s or pre-colonial.",
      "She has not yet finished and wants to devote more time to it to use them in her interior design projects.",
      "Mandi believes that following trends in how we design our homes and other spaces was historically never an African thing, especially with the centuries of the transatlantic slave trade.",
      "\"Traditionally, interiors have never been a priority. We have always been into functionality. We were more into decorating our exteriors, like painting the walls, painting the outside,\" he said.",
      "\"Each civilization has evolved, but we didn\u2019t have the chance to evolve because of the 400 years we were arrested with the transatlantic slave trade.\"",
      "He added that Africans were in \"constant flight\" during the slave trade, so \"how can you think, 'I have this house, I have to make the inside fine, let me put that bench, let me weave this cloth'? Our society didn't have the chance to evolve like that.\"",
      "Both Ejikeme and Mandi noted that many wealthy and prominent Africans, from celebrities to entrepreneurs, often have interiors that lack a distinctly African identity.",
      "However, Ejikeme believes this is changing as more Africans gain disposable income, they are increasingly investing in decorating their homes in a way that tells their personal story and captures their experiences.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 00:51:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Why are still no closer to unmasking the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto?",
    "story": [
      "Bitcoin underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry, is now traded by the world's biggest investment houses and is even an official currency in one country.",
      "But despite its meteoric rise, a deep mystery remains at its heart: what is the true identity of its founder, the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto?",
      "Many have tried to answer that question, but so far all have failed. In October, a high-profile HBO documentary suggested that a Canadian bitcoin expert called Peter Todd was he. The only problem: he said he was not, and the crypto world largely shrugged it off.",
      "So, inevitably, ears pricked up across our newsroom - and the crypto world at large - when on Thursday a call went out that the mysterious creator of Bitcoin was to, finally, unmask himself at a press conference.",
      "There is deep interest in who Satoshi Nakamoto is in part because they are considered a revolutionary programmer who helped spawn the crypto industry.",
      "Their voice, opinions and world view would be extremely influential on an industry with such a devoted and zealous fanbase.",
      "But the fascination also stems from the fact that, as the holder of more than one million bitcoins, Satoshi would be a multi-billionaire, not least because the price of the coins is currently close to an all-time high.",
      "Given that vast wealth, it was somewhat unusual to be asked by the organiser of Thursday\u2019s press conference to pay for my seat at his grand unveiling.",
      "A front row seat would be \u00a3100. It was another \u00a350 if I wanted unlimited questions. Organiser Charles Anderson even encouraged me to spend \u00a3500 in exchange for the privilege of interviewing \"Satoshi\" on stage.",
      "I declined.",
      "Mr Anderson said I could come along any way but cautioned there might not be a seat for me, such was the level of anticipation.",
      "As it happened, seating wasn\u2019t a problem.",
      "Only around a dozen reporters turned up to the prestigious Frontline Club - which interrupted proceedings at one point to stress it only provided a room, and not any official endorsement.",
      "Very soon it became clear that all attendees were extremely sceptical.",
      "After some digging it emerged both the organiser and the purported Satoshi were currently embroiled in a complex legal fight over fraud allegations - linked to claims to be Satoshi.",
      "It was an unpromising start, and things only got worse from there.",
      "Mr Anderson invited \"Satoshi\" to come on stage.",
      "A man called Stephen Mollah, who had been sat silently on the side the whole time walked up and resolutely declared: \u201cI am here to make a statement that yes: I am Satoshi Nakamoto and I created the Bitcoin on Blockchain technology.\u201d",

      "In the spring the High Court in London ruled that Mr Wright was not the inventor.",
      "Tech billionaire and crypto enthusiast Elon Musk also denied he was behind the cryptocurrency after a former employee at one of his firms, SpaceX, suggested it.",
      "Which brings us to the question: does it really matter?",
      "The crypto market's current valuation means it is worth more than Google. And it seems inconceivable that the tech giant would play such a big role in our lives without people knowing who founded it, and owned a sizeable chunk of the firm.",
      "Perhaps there\u2019s good reason for the real Satoshi to keep schtum though. That bitcoin stash would make them worth an estimated $69bn and their life and character would no doubt be heavily scrutinised if they were found.",
      "Peter Todd, who was named by the HBO documentary as being Satoshi, said the unwelcome attention he's received has made him fearful for his safety.",

      "Kalundborg, a town of just 16,000 people on the Danish coast about an hour\u2019s drive from Copenhagen, is as close as you might get to a modern-day gold rush town.",
      "It's the main production centre for weight loss drug Wegovy. Semaglutide, used in Wegovy and diabetes drug Ozempic, is made in a factory here, and parent company Novo Nordisk has invested more than $8.5 billion (\u00a36.5bn) in the town. That's nearly the entire GDP of Monaco.",
      "But persuading people to actually live in the town could prove tricky.",
      "There's an influx of workers and builders at the factory in the morning and an exodus in the afternoon - locals call it the \"Novo Queue\" and recommend avoiding the town's road for these hours each day.",
      "Hardly any of the workers stay - they live outside and drive in.",
      "So when there's \u00a3400,000 of investment per resident, what's there not to like?",
      "Behind the rosy figures, Kalundborg faces many challenges, from rundown schools and low incomes to many children being overweight.",
      "State school grades in Danish language and maths here are below the national average. Some on the town's periphery have few facilities inside or out, with just old swings in the playground.",
      "\u201cIf you saw that, you will take one of the big cities around here and say, 'Well, we will live there and then I can drive to Kalundborg to work,'\" regional councillor Helle Laursen Petersen tells me.",
      "She says these schools are struggling to attract experienced teachers, helping to fuel low expectations among many parents.",
      "After all, she says, they think their children will always get a job at the Novo Nordisk factory, so why bother trying to get to university?",
      "Ali, Anna K, Anna and Marie at Gymnasium, the most academic secondary school in the area, tell me they want to leave to study.",
      "\"It might become interesting later, but as of now, I think it's a bit too boring to settle down here -\u00a0I think I'd like a larger city,\" Anna K says.",
      "But Ali and Marie are more excited about coming back after their studies, hopeful of more job opportunities in the town so they can enjoy its natural beauty more.",
      "Problems - and hope",
      "Meanwhile Brian Sonder Anderson, who runs the Blue Angel cinema and is head of the local trader\u2019s association, points out that supermarkets and bakeries are booming locally as factory workers flock to them on their lunch breaks.",
      "But other shops, such as those selling shoes and clothes, quickly open then shut down again because of the number of workers living elsewhere.",
      "Many families on low incomes live here, priced out of the capital Copenhagen where rents and property prices have soared - leaving some on benefits and others relying on work at the factory.",
      "Kalundborg also has a health problem - it's in the highest 5% of Danish towns for children being overweight.",
      "Novo Nordisk, meanwhile, is now Europe's most valuable company with a revenue last year of more than $33bn - bringing its market value to more than $500bn.",
      "Investment in the town aims to add 1,250 jobs to the existing 4,500 employees at the Kalundborg plant and ramp up production of its best-selling drugs. While the company represents about 1% of the Danish workforce, it accounts for a more sizeable proportion of its growth.",
      "Denmark's economic growth was 1.1% over the first nine months of 2023. But strip away the pharmaceutical sector, dominated by Novo, and the economy shrank by 0.8%. Some analysts have warned that parts of the country's economy risks becoming too reliant on the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "The town's mayor Martin Damm is upbeat, insisting that more than 1,000 new jobs are being created here every year and some young people are happy to call it home.",
      "\u201cIn Europe people are moving from the rural area into the big cities and this is going the opposite way,\" he says.",

      "\"There's so many international people in this town and almost everyone that I've talked to in English has responded in English,\" he says.",

      "Three years ago, the DNA-testing firm 23andMe was a massive success, with a share price higher than Apple's.",
      "But, from those heady days of millions of people rushing to send it saliva samples in return for detailed reports about their ancestry, family connections and genetic make-up, it now finds itself fighting for its survival.",
      "Its share price has plummeted and this week it narrowly avoided being delisted from the stock market.",
      "And of course this is a company that holds the most sensitive data imaginable about its customers, raising troubling questions about what might happen to its huge \u2013 and extremely valuable \u2013 database of individual human DNA.",
      "When contacted by the BBC, 23andMe was bullish about its prospects - and insistent it remained \"committed to protecting customer data and consistently focused on maintaining the privacy of our customers.\"",
      "But how did what was once one of the most talked-about tech firms get to the position where it has to answer questions about its very survival?",
      "DNA gold rush",
      "Not so long ago, 23andMe was in the public eye for all the right reasons.",
      "Its famous customers included Snoop Dogg, Oprah Winfrey, Eva Longoria and Warren Buffet - and millions of users were getting unexpected and life-changing results.",
      "Some people discovered that their parents were not who they thought they were, or that they had a genetic pre-disposition to serious health conditions.  Its share price rocketed to $321.",
      "Fast forward three years and that price has slumped to just under $5 - and the company is worth 2% of what it once was.",
      "What went wrong?",
      "According to Professor Dimitris Andriosopoulos, founder of the Responsible Business Unit at Strathclyde University, the problem for 23andMe was twofold.",
      "Firstly, it didn\u2019t really have a continuing business model \u2013 once you\u2019d paid for your DNA report, there was very little for you to return for.",
      "Secondly, plans to use an anonymised version of the gathered DNA database for drug research took too long to become profitable, because the drug development process takes so many years.",
      "That leads him to a blunt conclusion: \u201cIf I had a crystal ball, I\u2019d say they will maybe last for a bit longer,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "\u201cBut as it currently is, in my view, 23andMe is highly unlikely to survive.\u201d",
      "The problems at 23andMe are reflected in the turmoil in its leadership.",
      "The board resigned in the summer and only the CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki \u2013 sister of the late YouTube boss Susan Wojcicki and ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergei Brin \u2013 remains from the original line-up.",
      "Rumours have swirled that the firm will shortly either fold or be sold - claims that it rejects.",
      "\"23andMe\u2019s co-founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki has publicly shared she intends to take the company private, and is not open to considering third party takeover proposals,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "But that hasn\u2019t stopped the speculation, with rival firm Ancestry calling for US competition regulators to get involved if 23andMe does end up for sale.",
      "What happens to the DNA?",
      "Companies rising and falling is nothing new - especially in tech. But 23andMe is different.",
      "\"It's worrying because of the sensitivity of the data,\" says Carissa Veliz, author of Privacy is Power.",
      "And that is not just for the individuals who have used the firm.",
      "\"If you gave your data to 23andMe, you also gave the genetic data of your parents, your siblings, your children, and even distant kin who did not consent to that,\" she told the BBC.",
      "David Stillwell, professor of computational social science at Cambridge Judge Business School, agrees the stakes are high.",
      "\u201cDNA data is different. If your bank account details are hacked, it will be disruptive but you can get a new bank account,\" he explained.",
      "\"If your (non-identical) sibling has used it, they share 50% of your DNA, so their data can still be used to make health predictions about you.\u201d",
      "The company is adamant these kinds of concerns are without foundation.",
      "\"Any company that handles consumer information, including the type of data we collect, there are applicable data protections set out in law required to be followed as part of any future ownership change,\" it said in its statement.",
      "\"The 23andMe terms of service and privacy statement would remain in place unless and until customers are presented with, and agree to, new terms and statements.\"",
      "There are also legal protections which apply in the UK under its version of the data protection law, GDPR, whether the firm goes bust or changes hands.",
      "Even so, all companies can be hacked - as 23andMe was 12 months ago.",
      "And Carissa Veliz remains uneasy - and says ultimately a much robust approach is needed if we want to keep our most personal information safe.",
      "\"The terms and conditions of these companies are typically incredibly inclusive; when you give out your personal data to them, you allow them to do pretty much anything they want with it,\" she said.",

      "I mean, everybody knows exactly what he was saying. What he was saying is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We played the sound bite.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 you're so much in favor of war.",
      "Yes, you \u2013 no, you played a piece of the sound bite, because, in another piece of it, he said he would give her a gun to go stand in conflict as well. You don't normally give a gun to someone that is going to be facing a firing squad, which is what much of the media made it sound like.",
      "The point he was making is not a new point. It is a point that has been made by people in both parties for decades. And that is, you're all for war, and it's easy to be for war when you're in some fancy building and you're safe and sound in Washington, D.C.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Let's see how much you are for war when you yourself get deployed into combat. That's the point that he was making.",
      "That he uses language that maybe is not what we typically hear from someone that works at a think tank\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 well, fine.",
      "But I think it's truly, not just unfair, it's egregious to see that reported the way that it was, along with other things that are out there. I have never seen such a concerted effort.",
      "And, look, I have always believed there's bias, because no one's unbiased, but I have never seen such a concerted effort like what I have seen, especially in the last two weeks, among multiple media outlets in this country to, in some cases, breathlessly distort and lie about what's being said and to create and manufacture these gotcha moments against Donald Trump.",
      "I have never seen it before.",

      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: They do matter. They do matter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 specifically warned about the risk of political violence in this country, some of it stoked by foreign adversaries, Iran trying to do that, Russia trying to do that, in the days after the election.",
      "Are you confident in the security and the integrity of the election?",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, I'm confident in the security and integrity of the elections, and especially because we have strong systems across this country.",
      "It's spread across 50 states. That doesn't mean there aren't going to be problems. We saw problems earlier in the week in Pennsylvania, and they were resolved by a court, where people were not allowed \u2013 being allowed in one county from accessing their on-demand mail ballot at the spot. There are going to be issues like that.",
      "They're being confronted at the front end, and those things are being looked at. Look, in the state of Michigan, we know now \u2013 and this is not me making it up. I can't believe it hasn't received more coverage. A Chinese national registered to vote and voted. And now he's being charged for doing that. But guess what? His ballot is going to count.",
      "We know at least one noncitizen's ballot is going to count in Michigan because they don't know which ballot it is and they can't retrieve it. These are facts. Now, whether that's widespread or not, I hope not, but these are things that are happening, and they need to be watched at.",
      "As far as foreign adversaries, sure. I mean, Iran wants to kill Donald Trump. Iran \u2013 this has been fully documented. They are trying to kill Donald Trump. You talk about violent rhetoric. He's the only candidate in this race, and not because I wish this on anybody else, who's had not one, but two assassination attempts against his life.",

      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: So, of course we're all concerned about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "In terms of the case you talked about in Michigan, we have tracked that. The secretary of state of that state has actually brought charges, has made that public. That individual may actually be deported\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Yes. But that vote's still going to count.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 may actually be deported because there are laws in this country that punish people\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: They are. But the vote still counts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 when they are illegal, and they try to vote in federal elections. That 19-year-old is going to face some consequences.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Correct. But the vote still counts.",
      "He is. And he's going to \u2013 but his vote still counts. His vote will still be counted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. I'm just trying to make clear that there are systems\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: But that's a big deal. I think that's a big deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 as you pointed to, as the courts are also playing a role here.",
      "I need to ask you about China, though. This massive and pervasive hacking by China of U.S. telecom companies is significant. Your colleague Mark Warner said it's the most significant breach he has ever seen in his entire time on the committee.",
      "Do you know if China has been able to access the audio of Americans' phone calls?",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, I'm not going to comment on what they access, but I agree with Mark Warner's statement.",
      "It is an egregious, outrageous and dangerous breach of our telecommunications systems across multiple companies. I will leave it at that. I think, as time goes on, we're going to learn more about it. Some of it will be made public. I think there's more that's still being gathered.",
      "It's a very serious situation that we face and I think one that is quite threatening, maybe not directly to the election\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 per se, but certainly to the national security of our country moving forward. It's a vulnerability that no one imagined or anticipated.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined by Nevada Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, who joins us from Las Vegas.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO (D-Nevada): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to be tracking your state very closely and all six of its electoral votes.",
      "In this early vote, we've seen half of Nevada's active registered voters have cast ballots, and there's some anxiety among Democrats because Republicans currently have a lead statewide. Are you confident the remaining ballots will close that gap and deliver the state to Harris?",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Well, Margaret, I can tell you a couple of things.",
      "One, I am optimistic that we are going to win, not only for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, but for Jacky Rosen, in this state. I am absolutely confident in our ground game, in our canvassing and knocking on doors and talking to our voters, because that's literally what matters here, is making sure that our voters, who are paying attention now in a swing state like Nevada, that somebody is talking to them, because there's so much information out there.",
      "And now is the time for us to connect with our voters and talk to them about the issues that they care about. So, yes, I am very, very confident.",
      "And the only other thing, let me say this, Margaret, is, you know, I was reelected just recently, and there was a Republican advantage in my race, in my midterm, and I won. Not only did I win. Our congressional delegation won. And so we also won our \u2013 our state seats in our state House.",
      "So what we know in Nevada, it is really about that organization. It's knocking on those doors. It's phone-banking. It's talking to our voters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: We also have a large population of our voters who are nonpartisan. Over a third are nonpartisan. And those are the independents in other states, and they lean Democratic. They leaned my way.",
      "And so I am very, very confident that, as we are working our ground game, we're going to organize our way to victory here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 you mentioned your victory in 2022. That was just by 8,000 votes. So this \u2013 this could be a tight one as well this time around.",
      "The Trump campaign talks about making inroads with the working-class population, in particular, on the issue of the economy. Your state has the second highest unemployment rate in the country. The majority of voters do not have a college degree.",
      "Why shouldn't the Trump campaign be confident that they are making inroads with this key demographic?",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Well, a couple of things, Margaret. You talked about my \u2013 my tight race. They're always tight in Nevada. It's a swing state. They're always close. It's always within the margin.",
      "And that's why it is important you get out and talk to voters and you don't take anyone for granted. And you're right. A large part of our population, our service industry, those are high school-educated individuals. That's my family. They worked in this industry.",
      "And these are the individuals we want to talk to. But we also have been engaging them on the issues that matter to them. And if you look at our strong organized labor, which is the culinary, which is made up most of the service industry, along with our building trades, they're knocking on those doors in favor of the Democrats, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.",
      "So there is this outright concerted effort by everyone to make sure our voters understand who is \u2013 what's at stake here. And there's a stark difference. I mean, you know, let me just say\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: \u2026 because this is important for voters to know this, that Kamala Harris has already talked about, she wants to represent everyone. She wants to lift everybody up.",
      "No matter who voted for her, she's going to represent them. She's going to start day one with a to-do list to how she works on the issues that she knows that many voters are challenged with. Donald Trump is going to walk in the Oval Office with an enemies list. There's a difference between the two.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: And when you talk to voters about it who are expecting that in Nevada, in a swing state, that makes the difference in whether or not we are going to win. And we are going to win.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But does your party \u2013 we played what the current president, Joe Biden, said about Trump supporters, and some have compared that, Republicans have compared that to what Hillary Clinton said about a basket of deplorables.",
      "Does your party have a disdain problem in talking down to working class voters in particular?",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Well, I can tell you here in Nevada in general \u2013 first of all, let's just say, but \u2013 we know this, that President Biden clarified his statement, and Kamala Harris has made it very clear she wants to represent everyone, no matter\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he quibbled about an apostrophe in the transcript.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: But \u2013 but Kamala Harris made it very clear moving forward that she wants to represent everyone, right, no matter whether you voted for her or not.",
      "And whoever you vote for, you shouldn't be criticized for that. And she's made that very clear.",
      "What \u2013 what I hear from voters in Nevada \u2013 and this is where the \u2013 where it's relevant, not the spin rooms, not the polls, not what you're hearing on the national news, but what are voters saying, and what do they care about? And they're listening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: And I can tell you, my voters in Nevada that I talk to, which is really a large population of not only our blue- collar, but minority Latinos, a \u2013 excuse me, Asian American Pacific Islanders, a vibrant Black community, Native Americans \u2013 they are listening to, what are the issues?",
      "Who's bringing the solutions, right? Who has the solutions to address the affordable housing issue? That's Kamala Harris.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Who has the issues to address how we lower health care costs and keep them low for all Americans? Kamala Harris. Who has the idea about how we protect the Affordable Care Act and not repeal it? That's Kamala Harris.",
      "So those conversations matter to my voters in Nevada, and that's what's relevant at the end of the day and how we're going to make this happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And your state also will be key to watch. You do have abortion on the ballot.",
      "Even though it's already legal in your state, there is talk about enshrining it in the Constitution, based on what happens Tuesday. We'll be following that and what happens with your party.",
      "Senator, we have to leave it there for time. Thank you.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION, and our panel of election law and security experts.",
      "David Becker is the executive director of the Center for Election, Innovation and Research. Chris Krebs is the former head of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under the Trump administration. And Samantha Vinograd was most recently a counterterrorism official at the Department of Homeland Security under the Biden administration.",
      "Good morning to you all.",
      "Setting the table for a consequential week.",
      "Chris, I want to start with you.",
      "We're in that 48-hour window that Microsoft warned was going to be rife with attempts to hack people's minds. We've seen at least four fake videos the FBI and U.S. intelligence have warned are meant to manipulate. Yesterday, the FBI said there were two out there that are fake. Before that we had disclosed that Russia was behind a Bucks County, Pennsylvania, fake video and one targeting voters in Georgia, falsely claiming that Haitian migrants were - were voting.",
      "How do these tactics that Russia is using now compare to what you saw in 2020 and back in 2016?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Well, they've evolved their techniques from generating and launching content from, for instance, St. Petersburg. That's what we saw in 2016. You had the internet research agency operating out of an office building, almost like, you know, a normal business.",
      "Over time, though, given the improvements in the intelligence community, cyber command, and our own awareness of the activities and what they're doing, they've started to push the boundaries out. And so they're actually generating content and then they're laundering it effectively through other platforms, like Telegram and even now what we're seeing is a significant amount of laundering through X.",
      "And then U.S. citizens pick up this information and pick up these videos, and then they promote it on their own accounts and on their own social media platforms, like Facebook. So, they are moving it out. They're avoiding the techniques that U.S. law enforcement intelligence has deployed and developed. And so they're not as good though. So, a lot of these videos that we're seeing, they're actually quite amateurish. That's not to say they can't have better content coming forward, but really they're just kind of flooding the zone and trying to distract.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And confuse and sow - and sow distrust of our institutions.",
      "Sam, U.S. intelligence has been briefing and disclosing. That's part of what they're doing to try to counteract this.",
      "We also saw early on warnings about Iran and what they are doing. The assessment Iran favors Harris, Russia favors Trump.",
      "What form of influence are we seeing?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, Iran has two main goals in this election cycle. First, to denigrate President Trump. They have expressed present - excuse me, a preference for Vice president Harris based upon Trump's record in office and their perception of what Mr. Trump would do if elected. That's objective one.",
      "Objective two is to sow discord. And they view undermining perception about thein integrity of our election as an effective tool. So, they are using influence operations to denigrate Mr. Trump and to sow discord using AI- generated content really focused in particular on, for example, allegations of voter fraud. We should expect Iran to continue increasingly sophisticated influence operations related to perceptions of a lack of election integrity. That will last well after polls close, Margaret. This is the most attenuated election security related threat environment we have likely seen in history.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's not about just changing votes. It's about not trusting our democracy.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: David, 76 million Americans already voted. So, can we say those numbers show the adversaries are failing, or are the election workers you're speaking with really concerned about what's to come?",
      "DAVID BECKER: Well, it's - it has increased our ability to be resilient against the disinformation. The more people who vote early, they're effectively inoculated themselves against disinformation that might be inclined to be intended to help them self-suppress their vote or confuse them about how to vote. So, the fact that we've had over 76 million vote already, and that's going to increase by several million more once all the mail ballots are in, once there's even early voting going on today, still in about 27 states and D.C. So, that's very good. That means the number of people that still need to vote on Election Day, when disinformation might be very focused on them, trying to get them confused with very little time for them to be resilient against that disinformation, that's going to affect fewer voters. That's a very good thing. And I think we're seeing, especially in states like Georgia and North Carolina, well over 4 million votes in each of those states has been cast. Millions of votes in many other - of the swing states. And so far, very few problems despite efforts to create problems perhaps from our adversaries overseas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you would point people to the secretaries of state themselves, their websites, for reliable information?",
      "DAVID BECKER: Yes. Whenever you need information, go to your state election website. That's usually the secretary of state's website. Sometimes, in North Carolina, Wisconsin, there's an election commission or an election board. Go to your local election website if you know your country or locality where elections are taking place. And if you need help, go to vote.gov. That will navigate you there eventually. Go - just rely upon those sources solely for information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chris, when you were in government, we did see, back in 2018, disclosure by the general at the head of then Cyber Command and the National Security Agency say that - that the government at that time set up a small group to basically knock Russia offline, to physically stop them from some of these influence operations.",
      "Can the U.S. undertake offensive operations like that now?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Absolutely. I do think though that the infrastructure that the adversaries or the Russians and the Iran have put into place may not be where it once was. It has moved. Keep in mind that earlier this year the Department of Justice took offline a disinformation group that we track as Doppelganger, they took their various websites offline. And they did it in a way that was timed so that they could not rebuild those websites and reestablish the engagement with those websites in time for the election. So, there have been steps taken to ensure that the bad guys can't execute their strategies.",
      "And in the meantime, you have organizations, like SISA, that are doing more with more jurisdictions on election security than at any other point previously. So, they have a lot of confidence around the resilience of the system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what you said about using Americans to spread disinformation.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: People are becoming unwitting agents of a foreign adversary essentially by re-tweeting or reposting some of these fake videos.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: We have seen that, right? So, there was another Department of Justice announcement that a media outlet, based out of Tennessee, was receiving funding from the Russians, from RT, a cutout (ph) -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tenet Group.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Tenet Group.",
      "Now, to David's earlier point, that is why it is so critically important that American voters, when they're looking for information about the election, they go to their relevant local or state official. They know what's going on. Go - if you're in Georgia, Brad Raffensperger and Gabe Sterling are probably running the tightest ship when it comes to elections in the country right now. They're incredibly effective. They're out there. They're putting information in the hands of the American people so they understand what's happening.",
      "And so when Russian operations like the Haitian voters pops up, they were on it immediately and they knocked it down. That is hugely effective in maintaining trust of the process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sam, we have seen concerns about physical security, though, as well at voting locations. The Democratic governor of Washington state has activated the National Guard, put them on stand-by, citing general and specific information and concerns about violence and unrest. You did have that drop box in Vancouver that damaged hundreds of ballots. There was an incendiary device there. Are there specific plots the federal government knows of at this time?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, it is a generally heightened threat environment, both in terms of complexity and the length of time that terrorism related threats, criminal threats and influence operations by nation states will last related to the election. It is just prudent planning, Margaret, in this threat environment for officials at all levels of government, federal, state and local, to engage in detailed operational planning. State and local officials are in the lead for the security in their jurisdictions.",
      "Now, in my experience, particularly post January 6th, those operational plans must include a full sense of all available law enforcement resources. National Guard is the last resort. You have local resources, state resources and then, as necessary, National Guard, as well as a clear sense of who to call when so that there aren't communication failures.",
      "Federal officials have invested a lot of money and time in doing exercises, hundreds them with state and local officials, sharing intelligence and information, and trying to share best practices. But at the end of the day, the state and local officials are in the lead and should have clear operational plans for a range of scenarios that may arise, in particular large scale security incidents that may arise with little or no warning. We learned lessons from January 6th. And from my conversations with former colleagues, that operational planning has been underway for years, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: David, I want to quickly get you to respond to what Senator Rubio was raising during our interview. He was talking about the charges brought by the secretary - or I mentioned the charged brought by the secretary of state against the individual he highlighted had cast a vote despite not being a citizen.",
      "DAVID BECKER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How is it that someone who's not a citizen could register and cast a ballot? How did that even happen?",
      "DAVID BECKER: Well, we have several protections in place to make sure it's very, very unlikely this is going to happen. We've seen places like Ohio, which has documented only six cases of non-citizen voting over a decade, dating back to 2014. We have places like Georgia, that has documented nine cases of non-citizen voting since 2008. So, it does happen, but it's extremely rare. And I'm sure Michigan is going to go through the process of evaluating exactly what went wrong in this one particular instance.",
      "But it's also important to note, this is one case. It was very swiftly dealt with. This individual is going to lose his administration at the University of Michigan. He's going to be prosecuted. He might go to jail. And he's almost certainly to be deported.",
      "This is a cautionary tale. It's one of the reasons we know that non-citizen voting is extremely rare. It's not zero, but it's very close to zero because the potential benefit to the person who perpetrates that crime, one vote in an election with 160 million ballots is far outweighed by the potential risk that they're facing of deportation and other jail time, et cetera.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for that.",
      "I wanted you to explain the process, because I think explaining how our courts work -",
      "DAVID BECKER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How the systems are set up to deal with these things is important.",
      "One of the things disclosed in the U.S. intelligence report put out by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was that Russia's amplifying these claims of non-citizen voting.",
      "DAVID BECKER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's what happens.",
      "DAVID BECKER: Right. That's what happens. And there are plenty of protections in place to make sure that this is extremely rare. As close to zero as it can be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. Thanks for your perspective. I know we'll keep you on speed dial throughout the week.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS:",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To dissect some of the new economic indicators we've been seeing, we're joined by Mohamed El-Erian. He is the chief economic adviser at Allianz.",
      "Welcome back to the program.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: (Chief Economic Advisor, Allianz): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, we saw on Friday this jobs report that indicated job creation stalled a bit in October. There were some complicating factors, like hurricanes and a strike at Boeing. But what's your perspective on what this indicates for the next president of the United States?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, most of the report, as you pointed out, was distorted in a really important manner by the strikes by the hurricanes. The bottom line, Margaret, is we have an economy that has been growing robustly. Inflation is coming down. And the main challenge for the next administration is not just to maintain what is called economic exceptionalism, because we're outperforming all other advanced economies, but also to continue to reposition it for the engines of tomorrow's prosperity. And that's absolutely critical.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know the Federal Reserve is meeting later this week, may move on interest rates again since inflation is around or getting close to that 2 percent target. But for average people, they see housing prices are high, they see grocery prices are still high. Where's the scenario where those prices actually come down?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and that's what everybody's expecting, but it's not going to happen.",
      "Look, the good news is interest rates will continue to come down. The good news is inflation, which is the rate of increase of the cost of living will come down. But it's very hard to bring down prices. And that's one political problem is, when you tell people inflation is coming down, in their head they think prices are coming down, not the rate of increase of prices. So, it's a misunderstanding, unfortunately. But you've to be careful what you wish for, because if prices come down significantly, we are then in something much worse economically.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that misunderstanding being used quite a lot on the campaign trail, Mohamed, as you know.",
      "I know the stock market is not an indicator of what's happening with the economy, but it is forward-looking. This week what should we be expecting as a reaction to the outcome of this election?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, believe it or not, a lot of investors are just on the sideline. They see so many possibilities, be it for the presidential race, be it for Congress, or even the extent to which what is promised by presidential candidates will become policy. There stands to be a big gap between the two. So, quite a few investors have said, you know what, there's way too much uncertainty. I'm just standing on the sideline and waiting to see what emerges.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A gap between what's promised and what's delivered is a very diplomatic way of putting campaigning there, Mohamed. But neither candidate is even making a gesture towards reducing the debt burden in this country. And in terms of what's being promised, the plans that the vice president has put forward is estimated by this Committee for a Responsible Budget to increase the federal debt by nearly $4 trillion through 2035. Donald Trump's plans would increase it by nearly $8 trillion.",
      "Congress, as you suggested there, they can put the brakes on anything here. But does this continued promise of spending and no promise of reducing it concern you?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: It does. It does in a big way.",
      "Look, it was unthinkable that we would have almost 30 months of unemployment at 4 percent or below and we'd run fiscal deficit of six to eight percent. Remember, John Kennedy said, when the sun is shining you fix the roof. Instead, the sun has been shining on our economy and we've created more roofs. Our debt to GDP is 120 percent of - our debt is 120 percent of GDP.",
      "Look, both candidates, whether they like it or not, are going to have to find a way to moderate deficits and debt and critically, Margaret, to create operational flexibility in the budget. The budget is becoming more and more rigid, which means that it's harder to respond to unanticipated shocks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unanticipated shocks.",
      "In terms of one of the things that we have heard from the Trump campaign quite a lot is this pledge to use tariffs to create income for the government somehow. That's how Donald Trump suggests using them.",
      "Do you view tariffs as a regressive tax that will hurt poor people by raising prices for them, or do you view them as somehow, you know, a rising tide that floats all boats?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, tariffs are a dangerous tool. They have limited use, but if they are overused, they become counterproductive. It is - it is not a good idea to promise the use of tariffs to deliver all sorts of things. Be it a lower deficit, be it protecting domestic producers, be it putting pressure, leveraging influence on other countries. Tariffs have a role to play, but not to the extent - and similar for the other side. Industrial policy and regulation, they both have a role to play.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: But be careful of overreach.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Fair point.",
      "Mohamed El-Erian, thank you very much for your analysis. The economy consistently the number one issue for American voters in this election.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now for a preview of what we'll all be looking for on Tuesday is our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Anthony, this is neck-and-neck. You've been telling us that for weeks now. What is it that the campaigns are focusing on and what we should be looking for?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Hey there, Margaret. So, start with this. Here is the map. The states in white are all those razor-tight battleground states. But let's get beyond the margin of error for a second and look at some of the political possibilities. And we can show you that in our polling models.",
      "Start with this, what I think is one of the key dynamics in this race. There are voters who say they did not vote in 2020 and many of them, in fact about four in ten, say that they definitely will this time. Among them, especially the men among them, are for Donald Trump. And the Trump campaign is trying to turn them out.",
      "So, we wondered, what happens if he does? And I'll show you. On this map we're going to run that scenario through our CBS models. And if he does turn out a lot of those non-voters, those men, they boost him, he would do well across the sun belt, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and flip Pennsylvania, and that would be enough to put him over the top and give him the win. That's a hypothetical, but it shows you how one of those campaign dynamics could play out.",
      "Now, on the other side, there's another important dynamic, and that is the gender gap. We've talked about it a lot. And I'll show you a slide from one of our recent polls that illustrate that. So many more women voting for Kamala Harris.",
      "Well, you've seen the Harris campaign out there trying not only to get women turnout, but also some crossover from Republicans, and in particular Republican women. So, we said, what happens if she can get those Republican numbers to match closer to what Joe Biden got in 2020, driven in large part by women and Republican women. If I put that scenario into the map here, our models show that she would hold the blue wall states across the upper Midwest, keep Georgia in her column, even flip North Carolina, and that would give her an Electoral College victory.",
      "All of this, again, hypothetical. But it puts it in political terms, some of the dynamics that could play out, and we'll be watching, on election night, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you'll be watching in real time as the data comes in to the desk.",
      "What is it that we should be tracking throughout the night?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, we're going to show you everything as it comes in. And the first thing I'm going to show you is where the votes are, because sometimes, and I'll pull up the 2020 map here in Georgia just as an example, you're going to see red areas, Republican, you're going to see blue areas, Democratic. But I'm always going to show, there are more people in some of these place than others. If I take this map and I rotate it, you'll - what you'll see in the example of Georgia is, the higher bars reflect more votes, and there's more voters in Atlanta and metro Atlanta. And Democrats need to do well in places like that. Really get a lot of turnout there. Whereas across rural areas, you see it's more flat on the map here. Not as many votes but Republicans very consistently kind of add to their margins there. That's one way we're going to show you the state in full.",
      "The other thing I'm going to watch is patterns, shifts from the last election to this one. Again, as an example, if I were to show you the shift that happened from 2016 to 2020, in Georgia, Democrats, Joe Biden at the time, got a lot of those counties around metro Atlanta shifting blue, those rural areas shifted red, Republicans. We'll see if something like that happens again. So it's where the votes come from, how they shift and the last thing, very quickly, Margaret, I'll remind everybody is, patience. If I were to take that same Georgia timeline and show you what it looked like at say 9:00 p.m., just after poll closed, a couple hours, you see so much uncounted votes still in Georgia, Metro Atlanta hadn't counted yet, et cetera. If this pattern comes out again on election night, we'll want to say, hold on, let's wait for all the votes to get counted before we know the winner.",
      "Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Patience is a virtue.",
      "Anthony, thank you.",
      "We'll be right back.",

    "story": [
      "Two days before Election Day, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, said she's \"very confident\" Democrats will win in her battleground state.",
      "\"I am optimistic that we are going to win, not only for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, but for Jacky Rosen in this state,\" she said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Around half of Nevada's active registered voters have cast ballots, with Republicans leading statewide, spurring anxiety among Democrats heading into Election Day. Nevada is also the only state where Republicans flipped the governor's mansion in 2022, although Cortez Masto hung onto her seat by less than 8,000 votes in that same election. But Cortez Masto said she's \"optimistic\" about Harris' chances in the Silver State, citing what she has seen as an impressive ground game and canvassing efforts from Democrats.",
      "\"That's literally what matters here, is making sure that our voters, who are paying attention now in a swing state like Nevada, that somebody is talking to them,\" Cortez Masto said. \"Now is the time for us to connect with our voters and talk to them about the issues that they care about.\"",
      "With an economy based largely around tourism and hospitality in Las Vegas, Nevada is home to a significant working class population. The Trump campaign has worked to make inroads among the voting bloc with economic policies that may be especially salient in Nevada, where the economy was among the most impacted by pandemic closures in 2020, spurring frustration with Democrat-led policies.",
      "Cortez Masto said Democrats are engaging with the working-class communities \"on the issues that matter to them,\" while touting support from organized labor. And she argued that Harris is the candidate with solutions for affordable housing and lowering health care costs, among other issues.",
      "\"That's what's relevant at the end of the day, and how we're going to make this happen,\" she said.",
      "Still, the Nevada Democrat urged that elections are \"always close\" in Nevada. And she noted that she won reelection in 2022 facing a Republican advantage \u2014 in what was the closest Senate race in the country in the midterms.",
      "Cortez Masto pointed to the state's large population of nonpartisan voters who she argued lean Democrat, saying \"they leaned my way, and so I am very, very confident that, as we are working our ground game, we're going to organize our way to victory here.\"",
      "A Republican presidential candidate hasn't won Nevada since 2004, but Democrats' margin of victory has decreased in recent years.",
      "Cortez Masto also defended President Biden after he appeared to call supporters of former President Donald Trump \"garbage,\" saying that he had clarified the remarks as being about a comedian's rhetoric at a Trump rally. And she argued that Harris, whom she worked with when they were both state attorneys general, has \"made it very clear, moving forward, that she wants to represent everyone.\"",
      "\"No matter whether you voted for her or not, and whoever you vote for, you shouldn't be criticized for that,\" Cortez Masto added.",
      "Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, downplayed Trump's connection to the comedian's remarks, while arguing that \"what's more relevant\" is Mr. Biden's comment, which he argued is in line with \"what most people in the Democratic Party and hierarchy believe.\"",
      "\"If you're so confident about victory, the way the Harris people say they are, then why would you be out there attacking not Donald Trump \u2014 attacking anyone who is thinking about voting for him,\" Rubio said. \"That doesn't seem to be like the actions of a confident campaign. It seems to me like the actions of a scared one.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The 2024 election will not only decide who succeeds President Biden in the White House, but in 10 states, voters will also have the chance to weigh in on abortion access through ballot measures.",
      "In the wake of the Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which had established the right to an abortion in the U.S. Constitution, abortion rights groups have turned to ballot initiatives to put the issue of reproductive rights squarely before voters.",
      "Proponents have already seen successes with this approach in 2022 and 2023, when there were abortion-related initiatives on the ballot in seven states.",
      "If the latest ballot measures are successful in expanding abortion access, they would override stringent bans on the procedure in five states. Roughly two dozen states have enacted abortion restrictions after Roe was reversed, and 14 of those states have near-total bans with limited exceptions.",
      "Here's where abortion is on the ballot in 2024:",
      "Arizona",
      "A ballot measure, known as Proposition 139, would create a \"fundamental right\" to abortion in Arizona. Under the proposed change to the state's constitution, the state would not be able to \"interfere with this fundamental right before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible.\" Fetal viability is generally understood to be between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy, and is defined in the ballot measure as the point when \"the fetus has a significant likelihood of survival outside the uterus,\" as determined by a healthcare professional.",
      "A yes vote would enshrine the right in the state constitution. Abortion is currently legal in Arizona within the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. The measure requires more than 50% of support from voters to be approved.",
      "Colorado",
      "Colorado's Amendment 79 would amend the state's constitution to add a section recognizing the right to abortion. The question on the ballot asks whether there should \"be a change to the Colorado constitution recognizing the right to abortion and, in connection therewith, prohibiting the state and local governments from denying, impeding, or discriminating against the exercise of that right, allowing abortion to be a covered service under health insurance plans for Colorado state and local government employees and for enrollees in state and local governmental insurance programs.\"",
      "The ballot measure would roll back a constitutional amendment approved by voters 40 years ago that barred the use of state funds for abortions.",

      "Florida",
      "Known as Amendment 4, or the \"Amendment to Limit Government Interference with Abortion,\" the measure would override Florida's ban on abortion after six weeks and enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution.",
      "The text of the amendment states that \"no law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient's health, as determined by the patient's health care provider.\" It would leave in place a parental notification requirement for a minor seeking an abortion.",
      "The ballot measure requires support from 60% of voters in order to pass.",
      "Florida's proposal garnered attention this summer when former President Donald Trump, who resides at a private club in Palm Beach, criticized the state's current six-week ban and said he was \"going to be voting that we need more than six weeks.\" The Republican presidential nominee quickly backtracked and said that while he disagrees with Florida's ban, he would be voting \"no\" on the ballot measure.",

      "The measure would allow the state to restrict or ban abortion after fetal viability, considered to be between 22 and 24 weeks into pregnancy, except when necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. It also would prohibit the government from discriminating against any person providing or obtaining reproductive health care in government programs, funding or other activities.",

    "summary": "The Colonial Era living history museum in Williamsburg, Virginia, offers an enlightening portrait of life in Revolutionary-era America, while providing a vivid contrast to today's political and social conflicts.",
    "story": [
      "Colonial Williamsburg, capital of the British colony of Virginia, has been preserved as a sprawling museum. Its mission: that \"the future may learn from the past.\"",
      "The crown jewels of Williamsburg, Virginia, are the interpreters, interacting with audiences of our day, but in the context of the world as they would have known it in their time.",
      "By way of example, Thomas Jefferson welcomes visitors: \"Good day, friends. How are you faring? You have no complaints? You must not be Virginians! If not from Virginia, where from? Pennsylvania, land of religious anarchy? Welcome! The Ohio Territories? From terra incognito. Welcome to civilization! Upper Canada? Bonjour! Are you immigrating here? Oh, you should. We are trying to encourage immigrants to immigrate here.\"",
      "Indeed, immigration was highly controversial in Jefferson's time, but from a radically different perspective than ours. I raised the issue with Kurt Smith (who personifies Thomas Jefferson), and Katherine Pittman (a very feisty Martha Washington).",
      "\"It was there in 1776,\" said Smith, \"in the Declaration of Independence. You know that middle bit that everyone skips? In the 27 long train of abuses, Jefferson says, 'He [the king] has prevented immigration.' It is one of the reasons we declare independence.\"",
      "Pittman asked, \"And how can we improve if we never welcome anything new?\"",
      "\"We're not talking about 'never' welcoming anything new,\" Koppel said. \"We need to know who's coming. We need to know whether they are people of good character. Isn't that what the argument is about?\"",
      "\"It's the argument in your time,\" Pittman said. \"We can just speak to our time.\"",
      "\"Oh, cut it out!\"",
      "\"You started it!\" Pittman laughed.",
      "\"I'm in a pissing match with Mrs. Washington, for God's sake!\" said Koppel.",
      "\"I think I'm gonna win!\" she laughed.",
      "The interpreters are well advised to merely hint at the issues of our day. Jefferson (Smith) opined, \"How do you get a body of men to vote for something because it's the right thing to do? I don't know. Maybe your politicians do it all the time!\" The audience was amused.",
      "Visitors to Williamsburg are left to grapple with the actual political problems of 2024. One woman remarked, \"There are certain people that want all the power, like the king. They wanted the power over everybody, and I think that's what's happening now.\"",
      "One young woman said, \"This country is steeped in conflict and a fight for liberty. But I truly hope I get to live in a world where I have rights to my body.\"",
      "\"Abortion,\" asked Koppel. \"You feel strongly about that?\"",
      "\"I do,\" she replied.",
      "It's a subject on which Martha Washington also has her own views on, c. 1800. In that era, she said, the issue was dealt with from within the home: \"Birth and a woman's health is a woman's sphere,\" she said. \"One does not need to ascertain the services of a midwife if that is the course that you are wishing. These remedies are known amongst female kind. It is known in the indigenous communities. It is known in the African culture. It is known in our European cultures as well, be it different herbs, be it different techniques, in order to rid one's self of an unwanted child. But generally, they are held within the female sex. But I know that my husband, General Washington, would be in full support of whatever I wanted to do with my own person.\"",
      "An even more contentious issue, then and now, was race. In Jefferson's day, that meant slavery. Despite owning more than 600 enslaved men, women and children, Jefferson put forward legislation in 1779 to end the practice. \"But here's the problem,\" Jefferson said. \"Bill 51, making the slave trade illegal, has to be presented to a body of men, all of whom own \u2026 what?\"",
      "Williamsburg chooses to depict slavery in a particularly dramatic, and unrepresentative, fashion, in the person of James Lafayette, an enslaved man who was directed to meet with the Marquis de Lafayette, the French nobleman who served the American cause (and whose name James would ultimately adopt).",
      "Lafayette asked James to sneak across the British lines as a fake runaway slave, to ingratiate himself with the officers of the British army, and then report back what he heard. James succeeded so brilliantly that he eventually worked directly under General Lord Cornwallis. \"I could take that British intelligence and information and share it with the American side over and over again, which I did,\" James said.",
      "He faithfully served the American cause, but he said, \"I was not to be given my freedom for what I had done for American independence. I was sent back to slavery. I was sent back to Master William for six more years.\"",
      "Only after the Marquis de Lafayette petitioned the Virginia legislature for his freedom would it eventually be granted.",
      "Given that extraordinary backstory, I wondered how Stephen Seals (who interprets James) deals with taking on that role. \"You understand that so many of the issues that we deal with today are connected to many of the decisions that were made in the colonial area,\" Seals said. \"You can see the line from one to the other. And when you come to terms and you see that, I got very depressed, and I almost left. I almost quit.\"",
      "Then, a colleague reminded him he was giving a voice to ancestors denied one during their own lifetimes. \"And the moment she said that to me, I had few issues with the fact that I had to play an enslaved person every single day, because I now understood why I was doing it,\" he said. \"So, I love what I do, it's an honor doing what I do, but I live out in the middle of nowhere for a reason, because when I'm done here, I want to go and be away from it all. It's how I cope.\"",
      "Finally, there's the father of our nation, George Washington. \"When we began, I mentioned that we should avoid seeing factions arise,\" he said. \"I specifically mentioned by regional distinction, but it is just as important that we endeavor to avoid seeing factions arise by the spirit and fury of party politics.\"",
      "Asked by a visitor whom he would support in the 2024 presidential race, Washington replied, \"I'm not sure what you mean by presidential race, sir. Do you mean the election? Race? Can you imagine how lacking of any sort of virtue or dignity a race would have? We stand for elections, sir; we certainly don't run for it!\"",
      "Ron Carnegie gives a striking portrayal of the man who could have been president for life, but chose a different path. \"Very often when I'm talking to people at the end, somebody in that group will say, 'I wish President Washington was running today,'\" Carnegie said. \"There's no way a man like President Washington could be president today.\"",
      "Because? \"He is aloof, he's not friendly, he's not outgoing, he doesn't like to talk in public. And he doesn't want the job. And how are you gonna become President today if you don't want the job?\"",
      "That wasn't a problem in 1800. John Adams very much wanted to keep the job; Thomas Jefferson wanted to take it.",
      "Smith noted, \"Things are just as nasty in the 18th century as they are in the 21st. There are newspapers that called John Adams pretty awful things. And there were terrible things thrown in Jefferson's corner. There were New Englanders and New England newspapers that were certain that if Jefferson was elected president, he would personally go into their homes and steal their Bibles.\"",
      "John Adams lost that election, and conceded. \"Jefferson calls that election of 1800 the Second American Revolution,\" said Smith. \"And it was precisely because, for the first time in this country, there was a change in political party at the very top of government, and it was peaceful. It was a peaceful transfer of power. That's powerful.\"",
      "That had never happened before, but it set a precedent that lasted \u2013 until our time.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 07:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Run for Recovery, a new program, offers a boot camp for people in recovery from substance use who dream of holding political office.",
    "story": [
      "Thomas Higdon was a politics fanatic his entire life: He kept up on the news cycle, he door-knocked for candidates, and he volunteered for a number of campaigns.",
      "He long dreamed of working in government, but he and everyone around him felt it wouldn't be possible because of his substance use. His use of alcohol and other drugs began causing problems when he was in law school in the mid-1990s, and in 2014, the consequences of his substance use left him living under an overpass. He is now abstinent from the drugs, but even years later, he felt he had ruined his chances of running for office.",
      "\"I allowed this internalized stigma, over decades, to blind me to what I could really do,\" Higdon, now 52, told CBS News.",
      "That thought stayed with him for years. He moved into grassroots organizing and advocacy spaces, but in 2023, he learned about the Recovery Advocacy Project's upcoming \"Run for Recovery\" program \u2014 and realized that working in public office might still be possible.",
      "Building a political bootcamp for people in recovery",
      "Courtney Gary-Allen, who began using drugs at a young age and overdosed multiple times before getting sober in 2015, has successfully run for office twice. In 2020, she was elected to the position of at-large City Councilor in Augusta, Maine. She was reelected to the same role in 2023. Both times, she won in a landslide, but the experience made her realize the need for a campaign bootcamp centered around people in recovery. Similar bootcamps are conducted by major political parties, but she wanted to create a bipartisan space tailored to the recovery community's specific experiences and needs.",
      "\"For the last decade or so, the recovery movement in America has been very focused on telling our stories and advocating and pushing for better policy around substance use disorder and recovery efforts, and I think this is a new chapter in the story of the recovery advocacy movement,\" said Gary-Allen, who is also the organizing director at the Maine Advocacy Recovery Project. \"We're no longer just advocating to policymakers. We are running for office to become the policymakers that are making decisions around these issues and many more.\"",
      "From that idea, Run for Recovery was born. The program graduated its inaugural class, made up of five Democrats, five Republicans, and five Independents, in August 2024. The 15 participants were selected from across the country. Once a month for a year, they met online to talk the ins and outs of mounting a campaign. Lessons ranged from learning about finance laws to drafting position statements to preparing to talk openly about their substance abuse.",
      "Higdon was one of the selected participants. Even though he had \"been around campaigns all (his) life,\" he said the Run for Recovery class educated him about the technicalities of running for office. But it wasn't just the classroom learning that inspired him. When he started the class, \"there was still that sort of nagging voice in the back of your head of 'You can't run,'\" Higdon said. The time with his classmates helped change his perspective.",
      "\"I just can't express how good it felt to be around people who also wanted to do this thing,\" Higdon said. \"There are a number of reasons why I ultimately may not run, but fear of what people will say and that stigma won't be one of them.\"",
      "Mobilize Recovery founder Ryan Hampton, who completed the Run for Recovery program and is campaigning for a seat in Nevada's state assembly, said that stigma has affected his campaign. He said his campaign has been subject to attack ads bringing up his history of substance use and calling his policy positions to a \"dangerous drug agenda.\"",
      "It's a stressful time, Hampton said, but lessons he's learned throughout his recovery journey and from the Run for Recovery program have helped him continue his campaign.",
      "\"I am certainly the underdog in this race, but I'm used to it,\" Hampton said. \"Am I afraid of losing an election? No, I have lost a lot more in my life than an election. I am not afraid of losing. I'm running to win, but I'm also running because I believe our community is yearning for something different.\"",
      "Growing a movement",
      "There's no compiled list of every single person in recovery running for office. Gary-Allen said she was aware of several people in recovery running for office in Maine. Higdon is weighing a run for a seat in Maryland's state legislature. Racquel Garcia, a Run for Recovery graduate who holds an appointed position in Colorado, is considering a campaign for a state position in 2026.",
      "Gary-Allen said she hopes to see more of the Run for Recovery program graduates start their own campaigns \u2014 and see others in recovery, even people who didn't go through the program, make the jump into politics.",
      "\"I think we're on this cusp of a revelation. Not only are people in recovery voting and showing up and advocating, we're running for office, and we're going to serve in these seats,\" Gary-Allen said. \"We're going to help create solutions to substance use across the country. I'm excited for the next couple of election seasons.\"",

      "The stunt was in response to remarks made by President Biden on Tuesday in which he appeared to call Trump supporters \"garbage\" on a video call with Latino activists. The White House has denied that was Mr. Biden's intention.",

      "Harris made the surprise trip to New York City with the election looming, briefly stepping away from the battleground states where she's been furiously campaigning in favor of the iconic sketch comedy show, where she was hoping to generate buzz and appeal to a nationwide audience.",

      "They all said Moore, 59, was a changed man who loved God, doted on his new grandchildren the best he could, helped guards keep the peace and mentored other prisoners after his addiction to drugs clouded his judgment and led to the shootout in which James Mahoney was killed, according to the clemency petition.",
      "Moore previously had two execution dates postponed as the state sorted through issues that created a 13-year pause in the death penalty, including companies' refusal to sell the state lethal injection drugs, a hurdle that was solved by passing a secrecy law.",
      "Moore is the second inmate executed in South Carolina since it resumed executions. Four more are out of appeals and the state appears ready to put them to death in five-week intervals through the spring. There are now 30 people on death row.",
      "The governor said before the execution that he would carefully reviewing everything sent by Moore's lawyers and, as is customary, would wait until minutes before the execution starts to announce his decision once he hears by phone that all appeals are finished.",
      "\"Clemency is a matter of grace, a matter of mercy. There is no standard. There is no real law on it,\" McMaster told reporters Thursday.",
      "In an interview for a video that accompanied his clemency petition, Moore expressed remorse for the killing of Mahoney.",
      "\"This is definitely part of my life I wish I could change. I took a life. I took someone\u2019s life. I broke the family of the deceased,\" Moore said. \"I pray for the forgiveness of that particular family.\"",
      "Prosecutors and Mahoney's relatives have not spoken publicly in the weeks leading up to the execution. In the past, family members have said they suffered deeply and want justice to be served.",
      "Moore\u2019s lawyers said his original attorneys did not analyze the crime scene carefully and left unchallenged prosecutors' contention that Moore, who came into the store unarmed, fired at a customer and that his intention from the start was a robbery.",
      "According to their account, the clerk pulled a gun on Moore after the two argued because he was 12 cents short for what he wanted to buy.",
      "Moore said he wrestled the gun from Mahoney's hand and the clerk pulled a second weapon. Moore was shot in the arm and fired back, hitting Mahoney in the chest. Moore then went behind the counter and stole about $1,400.",
      "No one else on South Carolina\u2019s death row started their crime unarmed and with no intention to kill, Moore\u2019s current attorneys say.",
      "Jon Ozmint, a former prosecutor who was director of the South Carolina Department of Corrections from 2003 to 2011 and who added his voice to those seeking clemency, said Moore's case was not the worst-of-the-worst kind of crime that would usually prompt a death penalty case.",
      "There are plenty of people who were not sentenced to death but committed much more heinous crimes, Ozmint said, citing the example of Todd Kohlhepp, who was given a life sentence after pleading guilty to killing seven people including a woman he raped and tortured for days.",
      "Lawyers for Moore, who is Black, also said his trial was not fair. There were no African Americans on the jury even though 20% of Spartanburg County residents were Black.",

      "Moore\u2019s son and daughter said he remained engaged in their lives. He once asked them about schoolwork and gave advice in letters. He now had grandchildren whom he saw on video calls.",
      "\"Even though my father has been away, that still has not stopped him from making a big impact on my life, a positive impact,\" said Alexandria Moore, who joined the Air Force at her father\u2019s encouragement."

    "summary": "The blistering remarks come after HuffPost first revealed that Tim Sheehy accused wildland firefighters of laziness and \u201cmilking\u201d fires for overtime pay.",
    "story": [
      "A union representing thousands of federal wildland firefighters excoriated Montana GOP Senate hopeful Tim Sheehy after he accused firefighters of dragging their feet to put out infernos and \u201cmilking\u201d disasters for overtime pay.",
      "\u201cSheehy\u2019s comments are not only unfounded and disrespectful of wildland firefighters across the country, but they also show a severe lack of understanding of the essential and dangerous work these brave men and women do to defend our country from devastating fires \u2013 especially communities in Montana,\u201d said Randy Erwin, the national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, in a press release dated Thursday.",
      "\u201cSheehy\u2019s disdain for firefighters is out of step with true Montanans and the rest of America,\u201d he added.",
      "Erwin\u2019s blistering takedown comes about two weeks after HuffPost first reported that Sheehy, who made millions running an aerial firefighting company that relies heavily on lucrative federal contracts, has repeatedly claimed, with little evidence, that a significant number of boots-on-the-ground firefighters are standing around while wildfires rage.",
      "In the 2023 book \u201cMudslingers: A True Story of Aerial Firefighting,\u201d Sheehy described an encounter with firefighters battling blazes in Idaho in 2015. He wrote that one firefighting pilot told him of the blaze: \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to go too fast. ... There\u2019s a lot of overtime pay to be earned out there! We put it out, it\u2019s back on salary!\u2019\u201d",
      "That conversation \u201csmacked less of concern or common sense than it did laziness \u2014 or, worse, greed,\u201d Sheehy wrote. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it malevolence; anyone who climbs into a plane or picks up a shovel to fight wildfires clearly has a capacity for goodness and a desire to help. That said, even in positions that are demonstrably service-oriented, there is the potential for self-interest, if not outright corruption, leading to a response that is not necessarily in the public\u2019s best interest.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf there is no fire, there is no money,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the faster that a fire is extinguished, the sooner the money dries up or goes elsewhere. It might seem ridiculous to worry about a shortage of work to keep the wildfire industry busy given the extraordinary expansion of the season in recent years, not to mention the gnawing sense that firefighters will forever be overmatched against nature. But old beliefs and protocols die hard, and clearly there were some in the industry who saw nothing wrong with milking every fire for what it was worth despite the risks and the blurring of ethical boundaries.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not the only time Sheehy has hurled such accusations at public servants who work in the same field as him. Sheehy is the founder of Belgrade, Montana-based Bridger Aerospace, a company that has a fleet of firefighting aircraft, and he has consistently highlighted his company\u2019s work in campaign ads and speeches. At a book signing in Huntsville, Alabama, in April, months after launching his campaign against three-term incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, Sheehy told attendees, \u201cThere\u2019s a very real dynamic in wildfire that a lot of those people don\u2019t want to put the fire out.\u201d",

And he highlighted the myriad challenges these workers are facing.",
      "\u201cWildland firefighters have been doing more with less for decades, and the current shortage of firefighters places them and other first responders at greater risk while they work longer deployments fighting hotter and bigger fires each year,\u201d Erwin said. \u201cSheehy and his arial company have profited heavily from taxpayer-funded contracts to fight wildfires while many wildland firefighters struggle to pay the rent because of low pay.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "VEGA BAJA, Puerto Rico \u2014 Eliezer Concepci\u00f3n worked for years at his roadside mechanic shop to save enough money to buy a piece of his hometown before it was too late.",
      "In 2020, he finally purchased a dilapidated house in this beachside enclave roughly 45 minutes west of the sprawling capital of San Juan. It took him two years to renovate a dwelling destroyed in 2017\u2019s Hurricane Mar\u00eda into a functioning Airbnb. But he saw it as a way to earn extra money by tapping into the Caribbean island\u2019s $10 billion tourism industry \u2014 and to keep the cash circulating locally.",
      "For years, Puerto Rico\u2019s controversial tax haven laws have drawn wealthy Americans looking to avoid income taxes and sparked a property gold rush that pits lower-paid, Spanish-speaking natives against cash-rich Anglophone newcomers. But Concepci\u00f3n, 43, was determined to keep at least his piece of the town in the hands of a real Vegabaje\u00f1o.",
      "\u201cMy neighbors are all selling,\u201d Concepci\u00f3n, 43, said on a July afternoon, leaning back in the leather chair of the tiny office of his auto body shop. \u201cBut I wanted a good chance for someone from here to buy and rebuild.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s getting harder to reject the routine cash offers from real estate speculators. Since the privately held LUMA Energy took over operations of Puerto Rico\u2019s electrical grid from the bankrupt state-owned utility PREPA in 2021, the power goes out weekly, if not daily, and bills keep going up. A lack of consistent air conditioning or refrigeration deters guests, leaving Concepci\u00f3n\u2019s vacation rental business struggling. He wonders how long he can hold out \u2014 and how Puerto Rico\u2019s historic election next week could forever change the dynamics in what is considered the world\u2019s oldest colony.",
      "While they are full U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans living on the island can\u2019t vote for the president, and the lone delegate they send to Congress has no real legislative powers. That makes the gubernatorial race the territory\u2019s most important election \u2014 and this year\u2019s is unlike any other in the 76 years since the U.S. began allowing Puerto Ricans to vote for their own governor.",
      "That\u2019s because, when Concepci\u00f3n goes to the polls next week, he\u2019ll be among the first American citizens since the Civil War with a real shot at electing a governor from a party pushing for independence from the United States.",
      "Juan Dalmau, the gubernatorial nominee from the once-marginalized Puerto Rican Independence Party, is now in second place, and polls show the race tightening amid the island\u2019s fury over remarks a speaker made last Sunday at former President Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Manhattan calling Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "The front-runner, Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, is a Republican and Trump ally representing the New Progressive Party, the pro-statehood party that has ruled Puerto Rico continuously since 2016.",
      "Jes\u00fas Manuel Ortiz Gonz\u00e1lez, the nominee from the traditional opposition Popular Democratic Party, which advocates retaining Puerto Rico\u2019s territorial status, struggled to break through but is now competing with Dalmau for second place in the most recent poll.",
      "The Fraught History That Led To This Point",
      "The central faultline in Puerto Rican politics has long been the territory\u2019s relationship with the mainland U.S. After seizing the island as a colony in the spoils of Washington\u2019s victory in the Spanish-American War of 1898, the U.S. violently suppressed Puerto Rico\u2019s independence movement for decades.",
      "As Europe began dismantling its empires after World War II, the U.S. granted the Philippines its independence but cut a separate deal with Puerto Rico, giving the island limited autonomy as a \u201ccommonwealth\u201d and U.S. territory.",
      "Puerto Rican rebels, under the command of the Harvard-trained lawyer and independence leader Pedro Albizu Campos, attempted an armed uprising in 1950. But the U.S. military, in a singular act of deploying the Air Force against its own citizens, bombed a rebel stronghold in the mountains, leveling almost the entire town. Even waving a pro-independence flag became an offense punished with years of jail time.",
      "From that point on, local control of Puerto Rico passed between the two main political parties duking it out each election cycle. On one side was the Popular Democratic Party, known by its Spanish acronym PPD, which supported the commonwealth status quo. On the other was the New Progressive Party, or PNP, which called for U.S. statehood. The pro-independence PIP remained a minor third party akin to the Green Party, earning at most a tiny single-digit percentage of the vote each election.",
      "That arrangement worked for much of the rest of the 20th century, when federal support helped industrialize Puerto Rico and raise living standards. In 1996, however, Clinton-era reforms saw the federal government phase out the tax credit that had drawn manufacturers to the island. As factories closed, Puerto Rico\u2019s government tried to make up for the jobs by hiring more teachers and police officers. But as the industrial tax base evaporated, Puerto Rico borrowed more and more money by issuing bonds that Wall Street expected would be backed up by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury.",
      "By 2016, Puerto Rico\u2019s debt and unfunded pension obligations reached a combined $126 billion. The island went bankrupt.",
      "Not an independent country, Puerto Rico could not get help refinancing from international lenders. Not a fully incorporated part of the U.S., either, the territory could not access the bankruptcy protections from which states and municipalities like Detroit benefit.",
      "Instead, Congress \u2014 which legally considers Puerto Rico and the four other permanently populated U.S. territories \u201cpossessions\u201d \u2014 passed a law called the PROMESA Act, after the Spanish word for \u201cpromise,\u201d which gave a White House-appointed board of financial overseers veto power over all the spending of the island\u2019s elected government.",
      "The fiscal control board \u2014 known pejoratively among locals as \u201cla junta,\u201d the term for a ruling council in military dictatorships \u2014 instituted harsh austerity measures, closing hundreds of schools and slashing pensions in a place with worse poverty than the poorest U.S. state.",
      "Then came Hurricane Mar\u00eda, a catastrophe from which Puerto Rico\u2019s infrastructure has yet to recover. While the precise death toll is debated, most scholars agree the aftermath of the storm killed thousands who might have otherwise survived if they had had access to refrigerated medicine or clean water after the blackout disabled groundwater pumps.",
      "In the summer of 2019, text messages between then-Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 and his inner circle showed the pro-statehood leader making jokes about the bloated bodies of Puerto Ricans killed during the storm two years earlier. As many as 1 million Puerto Ricans flooded the streets in protest, demanding his resignation.",
      "The chaos didn\u2019t stop when Rossell\u00f3 stepped down in disgrace. He tried appointing Pedro Pierluisi, a former coal lobbyist, as governor. But state courts intervened and instead selected Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced to lead the island from 2019 to 2021 (Pierluisi then won the 2020 election to succeed her, and is the island\u2019s current governor). In 2022, just as protests over the LUMA contract were growing, federal authorities arrested V\u00e1zquez in a corruption scandal.",
      "To Dalmau, the events showed Puerto Rico was primed for radical change. Sure enough, when he ran for governor in 2020, he won 14% of the vote \u2014 seven times the largest share of ballots the Independence Party had ever won and the first time it had earned a double-digit share of the vote.",
      "How A \u2018Radical\u2019 Candidate Went Mainstream",
      "Like Albizu Campos, Juan Manuel Dalmau Ram\u00edrez is a Harvard-trained lawyer. Dalmau, 51, served in Puerto Rico\u2019s Senate before becoming the standard-bearer for the Puerto Rican Independence Party, or PIP, in the 2020 election.",
      "His surprisingly strong performance wasn\u2019t the only sign the two-party duopoly on Puerto Rico\u2019s politics was crumbling. That same year saw upstart parties that eschewed the status question field competitive nominees.",
      "On the right, the Christian-democratic Dignity Project party sought to unite the largely Catholic island around conservative social reforms, like tighter abortion restrictions and a ban on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. On the left, the Citizens Victory Movement endorsed more liberal social policies but advocated primarily for ending Puerto Rico\u2019s colonial arrangement with the U.S. In a bid to cleave voters from both traditional parties, neither new party openly backed statehood or independence.",
      "In 2020, the Citizens Victory Movement came close to winning the race for San Juan mayor, arguably the island\u2019s second-most influential position after governor. This year, the Independence Party and the Citizens Victory Movement formed a coalition called Alianza, or \u201cAlliance.\u201d",
      "The Citizens Victory Movement\u2019s energetic organizing, combined with the Independence Party\u2019s experience running in elections for decades, has launched Dalmau into second place in recent polls.",
      "Dalmau\u2019s pitch for breaking off from the U.S. is really something closer to a conscious uncoupling. He envisions weaning Puerto Rico off federal funding over a 25-year period and striking a deal to give members of the Puerto Rican diaspora \u2014 twice as many Puerto Ricans live in states like New York and Florida as on the island \u2014 the option for dual passports.",
      "The recently privatized power grid will need to come back under government management, but Dalmau wants to attract big companies with tax breaks like the ones the U.S. government once used to develop a manufacturing industry in Puerto Rico.",
      "\u201cOur platform is going to support a democratic decolonization process,\u201d Dalmau told HuffPost in July after a press conference at a landmark building in the upscale San Juan neighborhood of Miramar. \u201cPuerto Ricans are a nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople lost their fear that you can vote for an independentista, and the next day Puerto Rico will become independent.\u201d",
      "During the world wars, the U.S. military\u2019s outposts in Puerto Rico helped Washington maintain control over the Caribbean and routes to the Panama Canal. During the Cold War, Puerto Rico served as a vital defense hub and a model for the benefits of American capitalism over communism once Fidel Castro took power in neighboring Cuba.",
      "But now, Dalmau said, Puerto Rico no longer hosts major military operations, and its debt crisis is an ongoing embarrassment to the U.S.",
      "\u201cPuerto Rico has become a burden,\u201d he said.",
      "Puerto Ricans are split over the island\u2019s future relationship with the U.S. A survey released last month by El Nuevo D\u00eda, the territory\u2019s newspaper of record, showed 44% of voters back statehood and a combined 44% favor sovereignty. Of the latter set, 25% support a compact of free association with the U.S. \u2014 a deal akin to what Palau and Micronesia have, allowing the former U.S. Pacific territories to represent themselves at the United Nations but still benefit from federal funding \u2014 and 19% back independence.",
      "Either way, Dalmau has sought to play down the independence issue, particularly as voters prepare to cast ballots simultaneously in a nonbinding referendum over whether Puerto Rico should become a state, independent or something else. For the first time in the long history of failed plebiscites over Puerto Rico\u2019s status, where one side or the other often boycotted the vote to make the results meaningless, this referendum does not include the option for the status quo.",
      "Rather than peg his candidacy to independence, Dalmau has pitched himself as a crusader against what he called the \u201ctwo-headed monster\u201d of the traditional two parties.",
      "\u201cPeople lost their fear that you can vote for an independentista, and the next day Puerto Rico will become independent,\u201d Dalmau said. \u201cPeople tell me, \u2018I was PNP, I was PPD, we have to get these people out of office.\u2019\u201d",
      "The MAGA Front-Runner",
      "Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, who leads the gubernatorial race, has sought to revive old fears of independence by linking Dalmau to socialist authoritarians in Latin America. Ads running on TV show him alongside Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro, Cuban leader Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel and Nicaraguan dictator Daniel Ortega.",
      "Ironically, it\u2019s her party, the pro-statehood PNP, that has the closest connections to Venezuela\u2019s embattled regime.",
      "As part of a massive corruption investigation, federal authorities arrested the former PNP governor, V\u00e1zquez, in 2022 on bribery charges. Among those charged with her was Julio Martin Herrera Velutini, a banker who financed her failed election campaign in 2020. The Department of Justice accused Herrera Velutini of bribing V\u00e1zquez as part of a deal to take control of Puerto Rico\u2019s financial regulator to hide a multimillion-dollar portfolio of dirty money linked to the Venezuelan regime.",
      "Like Dalmau, Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n \u2014 who currently serves as Puerto Rico\u2019s resident commissioner, a nonvoting delegate to the U.S. Congress \u2014 ran on changing the contract between the island and LUMA Energy after it took over the territory\u2019s electrical grid three years ago under a privatization effort the fiscal control board promoted.",
      "Her tough-talking ads on radio and television helped her defeat incumbent governor Pierluisi in the PNP\u2019s primary earlier this year.",
      "A spokesperson for Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n declined HuffPost\u2019s request to meet in Puerto Rico over the summer and initially offered to set up an interview remotely a week later. But multiple subsequent emails and phone calls went unanswered.",
      "On the campaign trail, Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n has claimed credit for the increase in federal funding the Biden administration has provided to Puerto Rico, and promised to hold LUMA accountable for ongoing blackouts. But Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, a Republican in her stateside politics and a close ally of former President Donald Trump, was among the strongest supporters of privatizing Puerto Rico\u2019s electrical system. While the Biden administration has promoted solar energy, Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n joined her fellow Republicans in advocating for Puerto Rico\u2019s controversial natural gas buildout.",
      "\u201cI see her as arrogant. She talks tough,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Rosario Borres, 53, a retired school janitor from the southern coastal town of Santa Isabel. \u201cShe kept lying and lying. It\u2019s written in black and white history. When you lie to Puerto Ricans, you disrespect us and underestimate our intelligence.\u201d",
      "Rosario Borres, who depends on an electric wheelchair due to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, said he needed cheaper, more reliable power. On a July afternoon, he came to an evangelical church in Santa Isabel to see U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm unveil a new program to provide solar panels to low-income households.",
      "He said he voted for Pierluisi in the primary. Now, he said, he may not vote at all. If he does, he said, his vote may go to Dalmau.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather vote for Juan than the PPD,\u201d he said, referring to the status-quo commonwealth party that served as the statehood party\u2019s traditional opposition.",
      "In Cata\u00f1o, a densely populated city neighborhood across the bay from scenic Old San Juan, Lissette Avil\u00e9s R\u00edos, a nun and environmentalist, criticized Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n\u2019s support for fossil fuel projects, including a controversial natural gas import terminal operating with federal permits.",
      "\u201cShe was pushing for more natural gas as the resident commissioner all while she was planning a run for governor,\u201d Avil\u00e9s R\u00edos said.",
      "Back in Vega Baja, Angel Manuel Ciordia, 75, said he would vote for Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n because he believes statehood is the best path forward for Puerto Rico. But he said it\u2019s unlikely to make any difference if Trump wins back the White House.",
      "\u201cIt all depends on who the president is,\u201d said Ciordia, a retired radio executive, during an interview outside his home. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t want us.\u201d",
      "Historically, Republicans championed statehood for Puerto Rico. In recent years, however, liberals have seized on the issue, conflating the movement with the push to admit the District of Columbia as its own state. The GOP has dismissed the effort as a bid to inflate Democratic power in the Senate, since D.C. is a liberal stronghold, though there\u2019s little evidence to suggest that socially conservative Puerto Rico would yield similar partisan outcomes.",
      "Recent GOP rhetoric suggesting Puerto Rican statehood would yield two liberal senators appears to have taken hold among voters. A YouGov poll released Thursday showed 79% of Democrats and just 41% of Republicans supporting statehood. Asked whether they would back Puerto Rico\u2019s independence, Democratic support plunged to 56%, while Republican backing rose slightly to 46%.",
      "Overall, however, 59% of Americans said they would support admitting Puerto Rico as a state if that\u2019s what voters on the island wanted. Just 16% opposed statehood, and 25% said they did not know enough to answer.",
      "Some voters themselves seemed to shrug off the sovereignty stakes of the election.",
      "\u201cI just want the government to help fishermen,\u201d Miguel Santiago said outside a bar on Vega Baja\u2019s main beach.",
      "He didn\u2019t have strong opinions about either top gubernatorial candidate but said the effects of climate change are shrinking the fish populations, and those whose livelihoods depend on large catches need the government to provide more subsidies and curbs on imported seafood.",
      "William Gibson, 60, a retired teacher sunbathing on the beach, said he had decamped permanently for Colombia. But he rolled his eyes when asked about Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n and said he would not cast a ballot for her.",
      "In July, Concepci\u00f3n worried that Dalmau could not possibly compete with the well-funded campaigns from the traditional two parties.",
      "\u201cDalmau has a good message, but that isn\u2019t what people see,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThey hear radio ads. They see TV ads. They get what the people with money to pay for them want us to see. And that\u2019s not the Independence Party.\u201d",

    "summary": "A federal jury has convicted a former Kentucky detective of using excessive force on Breonna Taylor the night she was shot to death by police officers in 2020.",
    "story": [
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 A federal jury on Friday convicted a former Kentucky police detective of using excessive force on Breonna Taylor during a botched 2020 drug raid that left her dead.",
      "The 12-member jury returned the late-night verdict after clearing Brett Hankison earlier in the evening on a charge that he used excessive force on Taylor\u2019s neighbors.",
      "It was the first conviction of a Louisville police officer who was involved in the deadly raid.",
      "Some members of the jury were in tears as the verdict was read around 9:30 p.m. They had earlier indicated to the judge in two separate messages that they were deadlocked on the charge of using excessive force on Taylor, but chose to continue deliberating. The six man, six woman jury deliberated for more than 20 hours over three days.",
      "Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, celebrated the verdict with friends outside the federal courthouse, saying: \u201cIt took a lot of time. It took a lot of patience. It was hard. The jurors took their time to really understand that Breonna deserved justice.\u201d",
      "Hankison fired 10 shots into Taylor\u2019s glass door and windows during the raid, but didn\u2019t hit anyone. Some shots flew into a next-door neighbor\u2019s adjoining apartment.",
      "The death of the 26-year-old Black woman, along with the May 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked racial injustice protests nationwide.",
      "Bernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., called the verdict \u201ca long-awaited moment of accountability.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile it cannot restore Breonna to her family, it represents a crucial step in the pursuit of justice and a reminder that no one should be above the law,\u201d King said in a social media post Friday night.",
      "A separate jury deadlocked on federal charges against Hankison last year, and he was acquitted on state charges of wanton endangerment in 2022.",
      "The conviction against Hankison carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. He will be sentenced on March 12 by U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings.",
      "Hankison, 48, argued throughout the trial that he was acting to protect his fellow officers after Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired on them when they broke down Taylor\u2019s door with a battering ram.",
      "This jury sent a note on Thursday to the judge asking whether they needed to know if Taylor was alive as Hankison fired his shots.",
      "That was a point of contention during closing arguments, when Hankison\u2019s attorney Don Malarcik told the jury that prosecutors must \u201cprove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Taylor was alive\u201d when Hankison fired.",
      "After the jury sent the question, Jennings urged them to keep deliberating.",
      "Walker shot and wounded one of the officers. Hankison testified that when Walker fired, he moved away, rounded the corner of the apartment unit and fired into Taylor\u2019s glass door and a window.",
      "Meanwhile, officers at the door returned Walker\u2019s fire, hitting and killing Taylor, who was in a hallway.",
      "Hankison\u2019s lawyers argued during closing statements Wednesday that Hankison was acting properly \u201cin a very tense, very chaotic environment\u201d that lasted about 12 seconds. They emphasized that Hankison\u2019s shots didn\u2019t hit anyone.",
      "Hankison was one of four officers charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2022 with violating Taylor\u2019s civil rights. Hankison\u2019s verdict is the second conviction from those cases. The first was a plea deal from a former officer who was not at the raid and became a cooperating witness in another case.",
      "Malarcik, Hankison\u2019s attorney, spoke at length during closing arguments about the role of Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, who fired the shot that hit former Sgt. John Mattingly at the door. He said Walker never tried to come to the door or turn the lights on as police were knocking and instead armed himself and hid in the dark.",
      "\u201cBrett Hankison was 12 inches away from being shot by Kenneth Walker,\u201d Malarcik said.",
      "Prosecutors said Hankison acted recklessly, firing 10 shots into doors and a window where he couldn\u2019t see a target.",

      "The attack on a United Airlines flight Monday from San Francisco to Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia lasted about a minute.",
      "\u201cThanks to the quick action of our crew and customers, one passenger was restrained after becoming physically aggressive toward another customer,\u201d United said in a statement. \u201cThe flight landed safely and was met by paramedics and local law enforcement.\u201d",
      "United said there were 82 customers and six crew members on the flight.",
      "According to an FBI affidavit, Nelson left his seat in the rear of the plane and used a lavatory near the front before attacking the other man, who suffered bruises around his eyes and a gash on the nose. Blood was splattered on the the sleeves of Nelson\u2019s windbreaker.",
      "The agent said Nelson was moved to a seat near the front of the plane and was watched by the passenger who had stopped the assault. There was no indication that Nelson knew the victim, who was not identified.",
      "The public defender listed as Nelson\u2019s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A federal magistrate ruled that Nelson should be held in custody until trial, which is scheduled for Dec. 11 in Alexandria, Virginia. The magistrate cited the evidence against Nelson and his history of lacking stable employment and residence.",
      "There have been more than 1,700 reports of unruly passengers on planes this year, on pace for an increase in the number of incidents last year. Reports of unruly passengers spiked in 2021 and, although declining the next two years, have remained higher than before the coronavirus pandemic.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 18:47:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Gallatin County Sheriff Dan Springer said DNA on a beer can at the campsite where Dustin Kjersem was killed led authorities to Daren Christopher Abbey.",
    "story": [
      "A Montana man accused of killing a camper in a brutal attack initially believed to have been caused by a bear has been arrested, Gallatin County officials said Thursday at a news conference.",
      "Daren Christopher Abbey, 41, was charged with deliberate homicide in the killing of Dustin Kjersem, 35, who was found dead inside his tent near Big Sky on Oct. 12 by his girlfriend, officials said. It was not immediately clear if Abbey had an attorney representing him.",
      "Gallatin County Sheriff Dan Springer said Kjersem had planned a weekend camping trip with his girlfriend and arrived early on Oct.10 to set up the campsite. He was supposed to pick her up the following day after she finished working, but he did not show up.",
      "Springer said Kjersem\u2019s girlfriend went to the campsite on Oct.12 with a friend and found him dead inside his tent.",
      "In an earlier news release by the sheriff\u2019s office, authorities said that because of the viciousness of the attack, the caller who reported Kjersem dead said it may have been caused by a bear. However, there were no signs of bear activity at the campsite, and an autopsy determined Kjersem\u2019s death was a homicide.",
      "During the course of the investigation, detectives collected DNA evidence from a beer can at the scene, which led them to Abbey, Springer said.",
      "Abbey was taken into custody in Butte on an unrelated charge on Saturday, and he allegedly confessed to killing Kjersem on Tuesday. Springer said Abbey had been employed in the Big Sky area at different times. Booking records note his tattoos include a swastika, an iron cross and SS lightning bolts.",
      "According to Springer, Abbey told investigators he was looking for a place to camp on Oct.10 when he ran into Kjersem, who welcomed him to the campsite and offered him a beer.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 18:33:50 -0400",
    "summary": "The president visited the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania to talk about Democrats' pension rescue and how it's helping retirees.",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden reminded Pennsylvanians on Friday that he, Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats safeguarded more than 1 million people\u2019s pensions without any help from the GOP.",
      "Visiting a union hall in Philadelphia, Biden and local union leaders highlighted the American Rescue Plan of 2021 and how it funded union pension plans that were facing insolvency. The pensions of an estimated 1.2 million workers and retirees have been protected from cuts due to the legislation.",
      "It was no accident that the event took place in Pennsylvania, perhaps the most critical of battleground states for Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and for her opponent, former President Donald Trump. Democrats have worried about Harris\u2019 strength with the kind of blue-collar union voters whose pensions were backstopped by the bill.",
      "Biden made sure anyone listening knew that the pension rescue got no Republican backing when Democrats muscled it through Congress over three years ago as part of a larger, pandemic-era stimulus package. It passed on a party-line vote in the Senate, with Harris casting a tie-breaker at a critical juncture for the bill.",
      "The president said the vote underscored the hyperpartisan nature of Congress these days.",
      "\u201cWe used to have real differences in the Senate. But at least when the critical things, we ended up getting together. But not anymore,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis is a different deal we\u2019re working with. Not a single, solitary Republican in the House or the Senate, not one, voted to help with the pensions. Not one single one.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the way things have gotten,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong.\u201d",
      "He said that he and Harris \u201cworked like hell\u201d to include the pension rescue, known as the Butch Lewis Act, as part of the American Rescue Plan, and theorized that some Republicans would have voted for it but were afraid to cross party leaders.",
      "\u201cI believe a lot of those Republicans who voted no thought it was wrong. But they\u2019re afraid to vote the right way,\u201d Biden said.",
      "The legislation provided an estimated $74 billion to $91 billion to shore up troubled multiemployer pension plans, which are funds that employers pay into under collective bargaining agreements. The funds can run into trouble when union membership declines over time, with more retirees drawing down benefits and fewer contributions going in on behalf of active workers.",
      "The White House said Pennsylvania is home to an estimated 65,000 of the workers and retirees helped by the legislation. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a government-run entity that insures multiemployer pension plans, said Friday it had approved an application to pump $684 million into a plan covering 29,000 workers and retirees in the service sector.",
      "The pension rescue became something of a campaign story after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters\u2019 executive board declined to make an endorsement in the presidential race. The Teamsters had the largest pension plan saved from cuts, and so the decision not to back Harris angered many members and labor allies",
      "John Pishko, a retired Teamster from western Pennsylvania, spoke at the Philadelphia event about how the legislation helped save his retirement. He said he was set to lose 30% of his pension benefit, or about $1,000 a month, before Democrats stepped in with the bailout.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty substantial cut to any working man,\u201d Pishko said. \u201cIt was devastating.\u201d",
      "He had assumed he would \u201cnever\u201d be able to stave off those cuts.",
      "\u201cIt matters when you have a president and vice president who has your back,\u201d he said.",

      "FRISCO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Brandon Aubrey was pretty sure being the kicker for the Dallas Cowboys was going to get him out of jury duty.",
      "It\u2019s safe to say he was surprised to end up serving on a domestic violence case that lasted a week and ended with his jury sentencing the defendant to 65 years in prison.",
      "\u201cEye-opening, long, frustrating, depressing, hearing the story,\u201d Aubrey said Thursday in an interview conducted by a member of the Cowboys\u2019 media relations staff. \u201cThe story was a sad one. I don\u2019t really want to get into all the details of the story, but it was very depressing and dragged on longer than anybody expected it to. So, glad it\u2019s over.\u201d",
      "Aubrey wasn\u2019t in the Dallas locker room during the team\u2019s media availability on Thursday. A team staffer emailed a transcript of the interview with the kicker to the media later in the day.",
      "A year ago, Aubrey set an NFL record as a 28-year-old rookie by making the first 35 kicks of his career. A record streak of eight consecutive games with at least one field goal of 50 yards or longer ended last weekend in a 30-24 loss to San Francisco. The Cowboys (3-4) visit Atlanta (5-3) on Sunday.",
      "With Aubrey\u2019s anonymity likely blown by that kind of eventful start to his career, he said the judge told everyone during jury selection who he was.",
      "Aubrey said he has a sister-in-law who is a prosecutor, and she had assured him his celebrity would disqualify him.",
      "Aubrey, who had postponed his jury summons once but wasn\u2019t allowed to do it again, also thought he had a suitable conflict to present to the judge \u2014 being at the team\u2019s facility to prepare for last weekend\u2019s game in San Francisco.",
      "The judge acknowledged him by name and said he could come back to him on the issue of conflicts, Aubrey said. The next thing the kicker knows, the judge is saying Aubrey won\u2019t have any conflicts because the court won\u2019t be in session over the weekend.",
      "\u201cI could have been more assertive and at that point, everyone knows who I am there, and I don\u2019t want to sound like I think I\u2019m better than anyone else or that I\u2019m above the job,\u201d Aubrey said. \u201cSo kind of sat there quietly and didn\u2019t say anything, which was probably a mistake. I figured at that point still, he\u2019s not going to pick me.\u201d",
      "As it turned out, Aubrey had to scramble to get in his kicking work during the week. He didn\u2019t get to the facility until close to sundown Thursday of last week, first fighting the sunset and actually kicking in the dark for a spell with long snapper Trent Sieg and his holder, punter Bryan Anger.",
      "Aubrey couldn\u2019t kick in the comfort \u2014 and under the lights \u2014 of the team\u2019s indoor practice facility because of a high school game.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t really see where you\u2019re kicking, and for Bryan in particular, trying to catch the snaps, he had a hard time at first tracking the ball and hitting the spot,\u201d Aubrey said. \u201cSo, it was a lot harder, but really just wanted to get the leg moving and keep the body fresh for game day.\u201d",
      "Aubrey wasn\u2019t really tested against the 49ers, making his only field-goal attempt from 29 yards and all three extra points.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 13:18:37 -0400",
    "summary": "Still, the tech mogul's ploy to move a civil lawsuit against him to federal court made the point of the suit nearly moot.",
    "story": [
      "In his face-off against Elon Musk, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has already earned at least one important win.",
      "A judge on Friday granted Krasner\u2019s request to keep a civil lawsuit he filed against Musk and Musk\u2019s pro-Trump America PAC in state court, rather than having it moved to federal court as the tech billionaire wished.",
      "Musk, for his part, filed a motion seeking to quash any personal appearance he is ordered to make in court, saying that his attendance is unnecessary because the case is largely focused on actions of America PAC.",
      "Earlier Friday morning, Musk had accused Krasner of engaging in a \u201crushed stage play\u201d and a \u201cspectacle\u201d as he urged a federal judge to deny Krasner\u2019s emergency request to keep the suit in state court.",
      "Krasner sued the billionaire and his pro-Donald Trump America PAC over their pledge to give away $1 million daily to registered voters. Musk claims the giveaway is random, but Krasner alleges that Musk is intentionally targeting people in battleground states with an \u201cillegal lottery scheme\u201d meant to influence voters.",
      "Musk has argued that Krasner must square off with America PAC attorneys in federal court because the lawsuit raises questions about a federal election and the federal laws that govern political action committees, not state matters.",
      "Krasner is adamant that his lawsuit isn\u2019t about whether Musk and America PAC are violating federal laws that ban vote-buying. Rather, the district attorney wants a state court, not a federal one, to determine whether the program violates Pennsylvania\u2019s prohibitions against illegal lotteries.",
      "Attorneys for Musk\u2019s PAC filed a notice in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania federal court this week requesting to have the case remanded there. Explaining this maneuver in a brief filed Friday, a lawyer for the PAC wrote that the group\u2019s expenditures are \u201cpolitical speech\u201d and thus \u201centitled to First Amendment protections,\u201d which is a federal jurisdictional issue.",
      "But U.S. District Judge Gerald Pappert disagreed.",
      "Musk and America PAC \u201chave not identified any question of federal law that must be resolved in Plaintiff\u2019s favor in order to prove either state-law claim,\u201d Pappert\u2019s memorandum states.",
      "\u201cDefendants argue the Complaint\u2019s references to \u2018the forthcoming Federal Presidential Election\u2019 show the lawsuit necessarily raises questions of federal law,\u201d Pappert wrote. \u201cBut federal question jurisdiction does not turn on a plaintiff\u2019s motivations in filing suit; it turns on whether the legal issues arising from the claims originate in federal or state law.\u201d",
      "The ploy to have the lawsuit remanded to federal court may have been a boon for Musk anyway. The giveaway ends on Nov. 5, meaning that by the time the courts decide the next steps, the initiative will already be over.",
      "The Justice Department warned Musk in a letter last month that he may run afoul of federal election laws against compensating voters, but Musk was undeterred.",
      "Four giveaway winners are from Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state, according to a website for the program. So far, the PAC has given away a total of $14 million to voters who signed the petition that states they agree to support the First and Second Amendments. The website indicates that winners will be declared through Nov. 5. As of Friday, the site specified that those winners would be selected in Arizona and Wisconsin, which are also battleground states in the 2024 election.",
      "Musk and Krasner were initially meant to face off in court on Friday, but the hearing was brought forward to Thursday. Krasner had asked to move the hearing to a more secure venue following a deluge of threats he said he received.",

    "summary": "William Luna started carving faces of deceased loved ones in 2017 to honor his rmother. Now he does them for others -- and strives to make them as accurate as possible.",
    "story": [
      "EL ALTO, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 During the Day of the Dead celebrations that take place in late October and early November, Latin Americans honor their departed loved ones by setting up altars adorned with food, flowers and photographs. But what about carving the actual face of your deceased spouse or family member on a plaster to decorate a piece of bread?",
      "That is exactly what one artist in Bolivia is doing.",
      "As part of a centuries-old tradition to honor their dead on Nov. 2, Bolivians share a sweet bread called \u201ctantawawa\u201d (Aymara for \u201cbaby bread\u201d) in a symbolic way to connect the living with the dead.",
      "Traditionally, the \u201ctantawawa\u201d are decorated with generic, plastered faces, but Bolivian artist William Luna thought it would be even more symbolic if he could carve out a feature that resembles the loved ones that people are remembering.",
      "Inspired by the loss of his mother, Luna began sculpting her face onto a \u201ctantawawa\u201d for the first anniversary of her death in 2017. He then introduced this idea to local markets, and now receives requests from families eager to honor their loved ones in this unique way.",
      "\u201cFamilies ask for the masks to resemble their deceased loved ones as closely as possible,\u201d Luna explains. \u201cI focus on each person\u2019s distinctive features, as we all have something special that sets us apart.\u201d",
      "Luna meticulously crafts each mask, starting with a photo of the departed individual. He then shapes clay using his fingers and modeling tools to capture the person\u2019s likeness. Once satisfied with the clay model, he creates a plastic mold and fills it with plaster. The final step involves painting the mask, sometimes with the help of the family.",
      "The entire process takes about a week.",
      "Milton Eyzaguirre, an anthropologist from the National Museum of Ethnography and Folklore in La Paz, said that there\u2019s not an exact record of the origin of the \u201ctantawawa\u201d, only that they are pre-Hispanic. Historically, the bread was made with quinoa flour, but now wheat is commonly used.",
      "\u201cOur tradition holds that souls return hungry and thirsty, and that is why families have food waiting for them,\u201d he said.",
      "Luna, the artist, says that his idea is to give people a way to see their deceased loved ones again.",
      "\u201cEven if it\u2019s only in this way,\u201d he said, gazing at some of the plastered faces.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 11:39:55 -0400",
    "summary": "It took three ER visits and 20 hours before a hospital admitted Nevaeh Crain, 18, as her condition worsened. Doctors insisted on two ultrasounds to confirm \u201cfetal demise.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "This story was originally published by ProPublica.",
      "Candace Fails screamed for someone in the Texas hospital to help her pregnant daughter. \u201cDo something,\u201d she pleaded, on the morning of Oct. 29, 2023.",
      "Nevaeh Crain was crying in pain, too weak to walk, blood staining her thighs. Feverish and vomiting the day of her baby shower, the 18-year-old had gone to two different emergency rooms within 12 hours, returning home each time worse than before.",
      "The first hospital diagnosed her with strep throat without investigating her sharp abdominal cramps. At the second, she screened positive for sepsis, a life-threatening and fast-moving reaction to an infection, medical records show. But doctors said her six-month fetus had a heartbeat and that Crain was fine to leave.",
      "Now on Crain\u2019s third hospital visit, an obstetrician insisted on two ultrasounds to \u201cconfirm fetal demise,\u201d a nurse wrote, before moving her to intensive care.",
      "By then, more than two hours after her arrival, Crain\u2019s blood pressure had plummeted and a nurse had noted that her lips were \u201cblue and dusky.\u201d Her organs began failing.",
      "Hours later, she was dead.",
      "Fails, who would have seen her daughter turn 20 this Friday, still cannot understand why Crain\u2019s emergency was not treated like an emergency.",
      "But that is what many pregnant women are now facing in states with strict abortion bans, doctors and lawyers have told ProPublica.",
      "\u201cPregnant women have become essentially untouchables,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor emerita at George Washington University.",
      "Texas\u2019s abortion ban threatens prison time for interventions that end a fetal heartbeat, whether the pregnancy is wanted or not. It includes exceptions for life-threatening conditions, but still, doctors told ProPublica that confusion and fear about the potential legal repercussions are changing the way their colleagues treat pregnant patients with complications.",
      "In states with abortion bans, such patients are sometimes bounced between hospitals like \u201chot potatoes,\u201d with health care providers reluctant to participate in treatment that could attract a prosecutor, doctors told ProPublica. In some cases, medical teams are wasting precious time debating legalities and creating documentation, preparing for the possibility that they\u2019ll need to explain their actions to a jury and judge.",
      "Dr. Jodi Abbott, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston University School of Medicine, said patients are left wondering: \u201cAm I being sent home because I really am OK? Or am I being sent home because they\u2019re afraid that the solution to what\u2019s going on with my pregnancy would be ending the pregnancy, and they\u2019re not allowed to do that?\u201d",
      "There is a federal law to prevent emergency room doctors from withholding lifesaving care.",
      "Passed nearly four decades ago, it requires emergency rooms to stabilize patients in medical crises. The Biden administration argues this mandate applies even in cases where an abortion might be necessary.",
      "No state has done more to fight this interpretation than Texas, which has warned doctors that its abortion ban supersedes the administration\u2019s guidance on federal law, and that they can face up to 99 years in prison for violating it.",
      "ProPublica condensed more than 800 pages of Crain\u2019s medical records into a four-page timeline in consultation with two maternal-fetal medicine specialists; reporters reviewed it with nine doctors, including researchers at prestigious universities, OB-GYNs who regularly handle miscarriages, and experts in emergency medicine and maternal health.",
      "Some said the first ER missed warning signs of infection that deserved attention. All said that the doctor at the second hospital should never have sent Crain home when her signs of sepsis hadn\u2019t improved. And when she returned for the third time, all said there was no medical reason to make her wait for two ultrasounds before taking aggressive action to save her.",
      "\u201cThis is how these restrictions kill women,\u201d said Dr. Dara Kass, a former regional director at the Department of Health and Human Services and an emergency room physician in New York. \u201cIt is never just one decision, it\u2019s never just one doctor, it\u2019s never just one nurse.\u201d",
      "While they were not certain from looking at the records provided that Crain\u2019s death could have been prevented, they said it may have been possible to save both the teenager and her fetus if she had been admitted earlier for close monitoring and continuous treatment.",
      "There was a chance Crain could have remained pregnant, they said. If she had needed an early delivery, the hospital was well-equipped to care for a baby on the edge of viability. In another scenario, if the infection had gone too far, ending the pregnancy might have been necessary to save Crain.",
      "Doctors involved in Crain\u2019s care did not respond to several requests for comment. The two hospitals, Baptist Hospitals of Southeast Texas and Christus Southeast Texas St. Elizabeth, declined to answer detailed lists of questions about her treatment.",
      "Fails and Crain believed abortion was morally wrong. The teen could only support it in the context of rape or life-threatening illness, she used to tell her mother. They didn\u2019t care whether the government banned it, just how their Christian faith guided their own actions.",
      "When they discovered Crain was pregnant with a girl, the two talked endlessly about the little dresses they could buy, what kind of mother she would be. Crain landed on the name Lillian. Fails could not wait to meet her.",
      "But when her daughter got sick, Fails expected that doctors had an obligation to do everything in their power to stave off a potentially deadly emergency, even if that meant losing Lillian. In her view, they were more concerned with checking the fetal heartbeat than attending to Crain.",
      "\u201cI know it sounds selfish, and God knows I would rather have both of them, but if I had to choose,\u201d Fails said, \u201cI would have chosen my daughter.\u201d",
      "Crain had just graduated from high school in her hometown of Vidor, Texas, in May of 2023 when she learned that she was pregnant.",
      "She and her boyfriend of two years, Randall Broussard, were always hip to hip, wrestling over vapes or snuggling on the couch watching vampire movies. Crain was drawn to how gentle he was. He admired how easily she built friendships and how quickly she could make people laugh. Though they were young, they\u2019d already imagined starting a family. Broussard, who has eight siblings, wanted many kids; Crain wanted a daughter and the kind of relationship she had with her mom. Earlier that year, Broussard had given Crain a small diamond ring \u2014 \u201ca promise,\u201d he told her, \u201cthat I will always love you.\u201d",
      "On the morning of their baby shower, Oct. 28, 2023, Crain woke with a headache. Her mom decorated the house with pink balloons and Crain laid out Halloween-themed platters. Soon, nausea set in. Crain started vomiting and was running a fever. When guests arrived, Broussard opened gifts \u2014 onesies and diapers and bows \u2014 while Crain kept closing her eyes.",
      "Around 3 p.m., her family told her she needed to go to the hospital.",
      "Broussard drove Crain to Baptist Hospitals of Southeast Texas. They sat in the waiting room for four hours. When Crain started vomiting, staff brought her a plastic pan. When she wasn\u2019t retching, she lay her head in her boyfriend\u2019s lap.",
      "A nurse practitioner ordered a test for strep throat, which came back positive, medical records show. But in a pregnant patient, abdominal pain and vomiting should not be quickly attributed to strep, physicians told ProPublica; a doctor should have also evaluated her pregnancy.",
      "Instead, Baptist Hospitals discharged her with a prescription for antibiotics. She was home at 9 p.m. and quickly dozed off, but within hours, she woke her mother up. \u201cMom, my stomach is still hurting,\u201d she said into the dark bedroom at 3 a.m. \u201cI\u2019m in a lot of pain.\u201d",
      "Fails drove Broussard and Crain to another hospital in town, Christus Southeast Texas St. Elizabeth. Around 4:20 a.m., OB-GYN William Hawkins saw that Crain had a temperature of 102.8 and an abnormally high pulse, according to records; a nurse noted that Crain rated her abdominal pain as a seven out of 10.",
      "Her vital signs pointed to possible sepsis, records show. It\u2019s standard medical practice to immediately treat patients who show signs of sepsis, which can overtake and kill a person quickly, medical experts told ProPublica. These patients should be watched until their vitals improve. Through tests and scans, the goal is to find the source of the infection. If the infection was in Crain\u2019s uterus, the fetus would likely need to be removed with a surgery.",
      "In a room at the obstetric emergency department, a nurse wrapped a sensor belt around Crain\u2019s belly to check the fetal heart rate. \u201cBaby\u2019s fine,\u201d Broussard told Fails, who was sitting in the hallway.",
      "After two hours of IV fluids, one dose of antibiotics, and some Tylenol, Crain\u2019s fever didn\u2019t go down, her pulse remained high, and the fetal heart rate was abnormally fast, medical records show. Hawkins noted that Crain had strep and a urinary tract infection, wrote up a prescription and discharged her.",
      "Hawkins had missed infections before. Eight years earlier, the Texas Medical Board found that he had failed to diagnose appendicitis in one patient and syphilis in another. In the latter case, the board noted that his error \u201cmay have contributed to the fetal demise of one of her twins.\u201d The board issued an order to have Hawkins\u2019 medical practice monitored; the order was lifted two years later. (Hawkins did not respond to several attempts to reach him.)",
      "All of the doctors who reviewed Crain\u2019s vital signs for ProPublica said she should have been admitted. \u201cShe should have never left, never left,\u201d said Elise Boos, an OB-GYN in Tennessee.",
      "Kass, the New York emergency physician, put it in starker terms: When they discharged her, they were \u201cpushing her down the path of no return.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s bullshit,\u201d Fails said as Broussard rolled Crain out in a wheelchair; she was unable to walk on her own. Fails had expected the hospital to keep her overnight. Her daughter was breathing heavily, hunched over in pain, pale in the face. Normally talkative, the teen was quiet.",
      "Back home, around 7 a.m., Fails tried to get her daughter comfortable as she cried and moaned. She told Fails she needed to pee, and her mother helped her into the bathroom. \u201cMom, come here,\u201d she said from the toilet. Blood stained her underwear.",
      "The blood confirmed Fails\u2019 instinct: This was a miscarriage.",
      "At 9 a.m, a full day after the nausea began, they were back at Christus St. Elizabeth. Crain\u2019s lips were drained of color and she kept saying she was going to pass out. Staff started her on IV antibiotics and performed a bedside ultrasound.",
      "Around 9:30 a.m., the OB on duty, Dr. Marcelo Totorica, couldn\u2019t find a fetal heart rate, according to records; he told the family he was sorry for their loss.",
      "Standard protocol when a critically ill patient experiences a miscarriage is to stabilize her and, in most cases, hurry to the operating room for delivery, medical experts said. This is especially urgent with a spreading infection. But at Christus St. Elizabeth, the OB-GYN just continued antibiotic care. A half-hour later, as nurses placed a catheter, Fails noticed her daughter\u2019s thighs were covered in blood.",
      "At 10 a.m., Melissa McIntosh, a labor and delivery nurse, spoke to Totorica about Crain\u2019s condition. The teen was now having contractions. \u201cDr. Totorica states to not move patient,\u201d she wrote after talking with him. \u201cDr. Totorica states there is a slight chance patient may need to go to ICU and he wants the bedside ultrasound to be done stat for sure before admitting to room.\u201d",
      "Though he had already performed an ultrasound, he was asking for a second.",
      "The first hadn\u2019t preserved an image of Crain\u2019s womb in the medical record. \u201cBedside ultrasounds aren\u2019t always set up to save images permanently,\u201d said Abbott, the Boston OB-GYN.",
      "The state\u2019s laws banning abortion require that doctors record the absence of a fetal heartbeat before intervening with a procedure that could end a pregnancy. Exceptions for medical emergencies demand physicians document their reasoning. \u201cPretty consistently, people say, \u2018Until we can be absolutely certain this isn\u2019t a normal pregnancy, we can\u2019t do anything, because it could be alleged that we were doing an abortion,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Tony Ogburn, an OB-GYN in San Antonio.",
      "At 10:40 a.m, Crain\u2019s blood pressure was dropping. Minutes later, Totorica was paging for an emergency team over the loudspeakers.",
      "Around 11 a.m., two hours after Crain had arrived at the hospital, a second ultrasound was performed. A nurse noted: \u201cBedside ultrasound at this time to confirm fetal demise per Dr. Totorica\u2019s orders.\u201d",
      "When doctors wheeled Crain into the ICU at 11:20 a.m., Fails stayed by her side, rubbing her head, as her daughter dipped in and out of consciousness. Crain couldn\u2019t sign consent forms for her care because of \u201cextreme pain,\u201d according to the records, so Fails signed a release for \u201cunplanned dilation and curettage\u201d or \u201cunplanned cesarean section.\u201d",
      "But the doctors quickly decided it was now too risky to operate, according to records. They suspected that she had developed a dangerous complication of sepsis known as disseminated intravascular coagulation; she was bleeding internally.",
      "Frantic and crying, Fails locked eyes with her daughter. \u201cYou\u2019re strong, Nevaeh,\u201d she said. \u201cGod made us strong.\u201d",
      "Crain sat up in the cot. Old, black blood gushed from her nostrils and mouth.",
      "Crain is one of at least two pregnant Texas women who died after doctors delayed treating miscarriages, ProPublica found.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has successfully made his state the only one in the country that isn\u2019t required to follow the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to ensure that emergency departments don\u2019t turn away patients like Crain.",
      "After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, the administration issued guidance on how states with bans should follow the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The federal law requires hospitals that receive funding through Medicare \u2014 which is virtually all of them \u2014 to stabilize or transfer anyone who arrives in their emergency rooms. That goes for pregnant patients, the guidance argues, even if that means violating state law and providing an abortion.",
      "Paxton responded by filing a lawsuit in 2022, saying the federal guidance \u201cforces hospitals and doctors to commit crimes,\u201d and was an \u201cattempt to use federal law to transform every emergency room in the country into a walk-in abortion clinic.\u201d",
      "Part of the battle has centered on who is eligible for abortion. The federal EMTALA guidelines apply when the health of the pregnant patient is in \u201cserious jeopardy.\u201d That\u2019s a wider range of circumstances than the Texas abortion restriction, which only makes exceptions for a \u201crisk of death\u201d or \u201ca serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit worked its way through three layers of federal courts, and each time it was met by judges nominated by former President Donald Trump, whose court appointments were pivotal to overturning Roe v. Wade.",
      "After U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix, a Trump appointee, quickly sided with Texas, Paxton celebrated the triumph over \u201cleft-wing bureaucrats in Washington.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe decision last night proves what we knew all along,\u201d Paxton added. \u201cThe law is on our side.\u201d",
      "This year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the order in a ruling authored by Kurt D. Engelhardt, another judge nominated by Trump.",
      "The Biden administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, urging the justices to make it clear that some emergency abortions are allowed.",
      "Even amid news of preventable deaths related to abortion bans, the Supreme Court declined to do so last month.",
      "Paxton called this \u201ca major victory\u201d for the state\u2019s abortion ban.",
      "He has also made clear that he will bring charges against physicians for performing abortions if he decides that the cases don\u2019t fall within Texas\u2019 narrow medical exceptions.",
      "Last year, he sent a letter threatening to prosecute a doctor who had received court approval to provide an emergency abortion for a Dallas woman. He insisted that the doctor and her patient had not proven how, precisely, the patient\u2019s condition threatened her life.",
      "Many doctors say this kind of message has encouraged doctors to \u201cpunt\u201d patients instead of treating them.",
      "Since the abortion bans went into effect, an OB-GYN at a major hospital in San Antonio has seen an uptick in pregnant patients being sent to them from across Southern Texas, as they suffer from complications that could easily be treated close to home.",
      "The well-resourced hospital is perceived to have more institutional support to provide abortions and miscarriage management, the doctor said. Other providers \u201care transferring those patients to our centers because, frankly, they don\u2019t want to deal with them.\u201d",
      "After Crain died, Fails couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how Christus Southeast Hospital had ignored her daughter\u2019s condition. \u201cShe was bleeding,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they do anything to help it along instead of wait for another ultrasound to confirm the baby is dead?\u201d",
      "It was the medical examiner, not the doctors at the hospital, who removed Lillian from Crain\u2019s womb. His autopsy didn\u2019t resolve Fails\u2019 lingering questions about what the hospitals missed and why. He called the death \u201cnatural\u201d and attributed it to \u201ccomplications of pregnancy.\u201d He did note, however, that Crain was \u201crepeatedly seeking medical care for a progressive illness\u201d just before she died.",

      "Though the human dead usually get their favorite food or drink placed on altars, the nature of pet food can make things a little different.",
      "The holiday has roots in Mexican pre-Hispanic customs, as does the reverence for animals. The small, hairless dogs that Mexicans kept before the Spanish conquest were believed to help guide their owners to the afterlife, and were sometimes given special burials.",
      "But the inclusion of pets on family altars has grown in recent years.",
      "Day of the Dead begins Oct. 31, to remember those humans who died in accidents; it continues Nov. 1 to mark those who died in childhood and then Nov. 2 to those who died as adults.",

      "Multiple anonymous complaints about Peanut \u2014 also spelled P\u2019Nut or PNUT \u2014 brought at least six officers from the state Department of Environmental Conservation to Mark Longo\u2019s home near the Pennsylvania border in rural Pine City on Wednesday, Longo said.",
      "\u201cThe DEC came to my house and raided my house without a search warrant to find a squirrel!\u201d said Longo, who is 34. \u201cI was treated as if I was a drug dealer and they were going for drugs and guns.\u201d",
      "The officers left with Peanut, who amassed hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram, TikTok and other platforms during his seven years with Longo. They also took Fred, a more recent addition to the family.",

      "Longo, who runs an animal refuge inspired by his squirrel buddy called P\u2019Nuts Freedom Farm Animal Sanctuary, took to Instagram to mourn Peanut\u2019s loss.",
      "\u201cWell internet, you WON,\u201d Longo posted. \u201cYou took one of the most amazing animals away from me because of your selfishness. To the group of people who called DEC, there\u2019s a special place in hell for you.\u201d",

      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "On the one hand, they believe they\u2019ve made inroads with voters who are now quietly backing Harris, or with soft Republicans who have reached their end point with Trump. On the other, they\u2019ve never had so much luck in the Trump era in getting their neighbors to put up yard signs for a Democratic presidential nominee as they have this fall.",
      "\u201cThe fear is gone,\u201d Judy Hines, the Mercer County Democratic Party chair, told NBC News.",
      "Traveling through rural Pennsylvania, particularly in the northwest, there\u2019s little doubt of Trump\u2019s dominance. Trump signs are everywhere, though there is a noticeable amount of signage for Vice President Kamala Harris too. But national and state Democrats have placed renewed emphasis on turning out the vote in these sorts of rural areas, especially in Pennsylvania, as there are signs the former president could eat into the Democratic advantage in Philadelphia.",
      "This strategy has resulted in trips to rural Pennsylvania from both Harris, who made a stop in Johnstown in September, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as well as a bevy of visits from prominent Democratic surrogates.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, national Democrats just kind of wrote those communities off and ignored them,\u201d Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said. \u201cShe\u2019s showing up, and we appreciate that. And I think those communities, even though we\u2019re a big state, they\u2019re still retail areas. And we got to have candidates show up there. We got to make sure that they are getting the chance to meet local folks, and local folks ask them questions, kind of kick the tires a little bit.\u201d",
      "Chief among the surrogates is Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has campaigned in 11 red counties in western Pennsylvania alone, including Mercer. Democrats and Republicans in the state pointed to Fetterman\u2019s effort as notable, even if Republicans doubted it would make much of a difference in the presidential race.",
      "In an interview, Fetterman explained his rural campaign schedule by saying he\u2019s \u201calways been committed\u201d to leaving no stone unturned in the state, though he added that \u201cany credit\u201d for gains in rural parts of the state belongs to \u201call of these small red-county Dems, because those are the kinds of heroes throughout all of this.\u201d",
      "In 2022, Fetterman and Shapiro both pushed Democrats in red counties to put up their yard signs as a signal to others that it was acceptable to back the party\u2019s candidates. In Mercer County, both were able to cut into Republican margins, as Fetterman lost by 22 points and Shapiro lost by 18 \u2014\u00a0both an improvement over Trump\u2019s results two years prior.",
      "But Republicans aren\u2019t worried about any such rural slippage this time around. They believe that anyone who would have abandoned Trump after previously voting for him already did so before the 2020 vote.",
      "They also see an especially receptive audience to Trump\u2019s pitch about the dangers of large-scale immigration and rising prices. And they\u2019ve been encouraged by voter registration and early vote trends in places like Mercer County, where Republicans have outvoted Democrats ahead of Election Day while bolstering their voter registration numbers.",

Maybe I\u2019m OK with [a wave of undocumented immigration]. Or maybe I\u2019m OK with inflation,\u2019\u201d this person said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how this works.\u201d",
      "'Beating a dead horse'",
      "Just down the road from Mercer in neighboring Lawrence County, a bus filled with Trump surrogates rolled through in late October to speak to a crowd of roughly 100 supporters. The message was hammered home over and over: vote early.",
      "At one point, David Bossie, a Republican National Committee member from Maryland who was a top official on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, told attendees who said they had not yet voted: \u201cShame on you!\u201d",
      "Kash Patel, a former Trump administration official and key ally, pushed voters to have \u201cuncomfortable\u201d conversations with acquaintances who might not be voting for Trump, adding that whether or not Trump wins could come down to Lawrence County.",

      "Nearly everyone in attendance raised their hand.",
      "Ahead of that event, Joel D\u2019Alessandro, a Trump supporter from neighboring Beaver County, said he sees Republicans more involved and having a \u201cheightened sense of civic engagement\u201d than in past cycles. But he thinks ultimately flipping any votes at this stage of the game is virtually impossible, particularly with how inundated Pennsylvania has been, receiving the most spending on behalf of both major-party candidates as well as the most visits from each.",
      "\u201cI would challenge anybody to find an undecided vote,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cShort of one of the candidates committing a federal crime in public, out in the open \u2014 that might not even \u2014 but short of murder on camera by one of them, it\u2019s like they\u2019re [dug in].

      "D\u2019Alessandro said he had backed Democrats until 2006 and recalled voting for Bill Clinton.

      "During his stop in Johnstown, Clinton promoted Harris\u2019 promise to make \u201cexplicit outreach to people who don\u2019t even agree with her,\u201d discussed falling birth rates and how rising home prices in Nevada explained rising housing costs nationwide. He lambasted Trump\u2019s economic plan as costing far more than Harris\u2019 in part because he would be giving wealthy Americans \u2014 \u201cincluding me,\u201d he noted \u2014 a substantial tax cut.",
      "\u201cI hate the idea of doing that,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cDonald Trump said you can\u2019t do that. \u2018My whole deal is based on division. I need problems. I don\u2019t need solutions. I need people torn up and upset,\u2019\u201d Clinton said, channeling Trump.",

      "Ginny Richardson, the Mercer County GOP chair, gave a simple \u201cno\u201d when asked if she was concerned Democrats may be able to trim Trump\u2019s margins there. She said that on the Republican side as well, it\u2019s been much easier to recruit volunteers for local campaign work than it had been in recent cycles.

We\u2019ve been quiet because we know that we raise all kinds of hell for Democrats, that we\u2019re just going to bring in a bad light into an election. There\u2019s enough bad in this election. There\u2019s enough hate in the election, and if they\u2019re going to bark at us, bark away. But in the end, we\u2019re going to get it done.\u201d"

      "A political video reminded women that they can vote for Vice President Kamala Harris without telling their husbands, enraging prominent conservatives and reigniting a fiery discourse that highlights the central role of gender in this year\u2019s election.",
      "The video, which began circulating last week, opens with a woman about to enter the polling booth after her husband, looking nervously back at him before she makes her choice. She locks eyes with another woman as they fill out their ballots for Harris.",
      "\u201cIn the one place in America where women still have a right to choose,\u201d actor Julia Roberts narrates, alluding to an ongoing partisan battle over reproductive rights, \u201cyou can vote any way you want and no one will ever know.\u201d",
      "The women then leave the polling booth to meet their husbands, who presumably cast their votes for former President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cDid you make the right choice?\u201d one of the husbands asks.",
      "\u201cSure did, honey,\u201d his wife responds with a smile, sharing a knowing glance with the woman beside her.",
      "Though Harris has refrained from talking much about her potential to be the first female president, the video highlights the gender gap that has widened between her and Trump, with recent polls showing notable leads by Harris among women and Trump among men.",
      "Harris\u2019 opponents have used her gender to question her qualifications throughout her campaign. Trump said in July that world leaders would view Harris \u201clike a play toy\u201d based on her appearance, and his allies have suggested that Harris\u2019 political success is attributable to diversity, equity and inclusion policies.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s campaign has embraced an image of traditional masculinity, actively courting influencers and comedians who are popular among young men.",
      "Gender also underlies many of the hot-button issues motivating voters\u2019 choices this election cycle, including abortion, in vitro fertilization, child care and transgender rights.",
      "The campaign spot, created by Vote Common Good, a nonprofit progressive group that works to mobilize religious voters, triggered outrage from Trump and some of his allies.",
      "Though the organization never paid to promote or air the video, its executive director, Doug Pagitt, said the attention it gained online means it tapped into an experience familiar to many households.",
      "\u201cSo many people in that world that I come from, and the subsequent political world around it, believe that women\u2019s responsibility first and foremost in voting is not to have their own voice,\u201d said Pagitt, a pastor and social activist. \u201cIt\u2019s to replicate what their husband tells them.\u201d",
      "In a phone interview with Fox News on Saturday, Trump said that he was \u201cso disappointed at Julia Roberts\u201d and that she will one day look back at the ad and \u201ccringe.\u201d He added that he doesn\u2019t believe the video portrayed a realistic marital dynamic, calling it \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "\u201cI mean, can you imagine a wife not telling her husband who she\u2019s voting for?\u201d Trump said. \u201cEven if you have a horrible, if you had a bad relationship, you\u2019re going to tell your husband.\u201d",
      "Fox News host Jesse Watters said on the air last week that if his wife did the same as the women in the ad, it would violate \u201cthe sanctity of our marriage.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I found out Emma was going into the voting booth and pulling the lever for Harris, that\u2019s the same thing as having an affair,\u201d Watters said, a remark that prompted many online to call him out for his marital affair, which he admitted to in 2018.",
      "Conservative podcast host Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, called the ad \u201cnauseating\u201d as he criticized the wife for lying to \u201cher sweet husband who probably works his tail off to make sure that she can go and have a nice life and provides for the family.\u201d",
      "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., joined the criticism Thursday, telling Fox News that Democrats are telling wives to lie to their husbands: \u201cWhat kind of a totally amoral, corrupt, sick system have the Democrats developed?\u201d",
      "While some conservative men expressed disbelief and disapproval, many online contributed to the discussion by sharing their experiences with women who secretly support Democrats in Republican households, saying they fear for the well-being of women whose husbands insist on controlling or monitoring their votes.",
      "In recent months, sticky notes have also popped up discreetly in public bathroom stalls and on tampon boxes across the country reminding women that no one can see if they vote for Harris.",
      "Several women involved in the grassroots campaign in more conservative areas told NBC News that getting involved in the sticky notes campaign was a way for them to be politically active without dealing with backlash from the Republican-dominated areas in which they live.",
      "The controversy over the ad has prompted some online to draw parallels to Margaret Atwood\u2019s classic novel \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which depicts a dystopian theocratic regime that forcibly categorizes women and strips them of their personal autonomy. In the wake of the discourse, Atwood shared a political cartoon of women entering a voting booth dressed in handmaids\u2019 attire and shedding their red uniforms upon exiting.",
      "To Pagitt, the furious responses from some men online reinforces the need for the video\u2019s message.",
      "\u201cThey took a person\u2019s sanctity of their ballot and turned it into a conversation about men owning the behaviors of the women in their life,\u201d Pagitt said. \u201cAnd like, well, I didn\u2019t think you were going to make our point for us. We\u2019re very grateful that you did.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "With Pennsylvania expected to be a close and crucial state in the 2024 race for the presidency, it's unusual election laws are again under the microscope.",
      "First, there's the counting. The state doesn\u2019t have early voting \u2014 instead offering the time-consuming and paperwork heavy option of on-demand mail balloting. It also doesn\u2019t process its mail ballots ahead of Election Day.",
      "So, in the hours after polls close on Election Day, when many battleground states will be reporting their early, mail and Election Day totals, Pennsylvania will be counting ballots around the clock in a mad dash to catch up.",
      "Then there's the \"fixing\" or \"curing\" of ballots with minor errors, such as a mail-in ballot mixing a signature. If a ballot has errors, each county in the state decides on its own whether it will let voters \"fix\" them, creating significant differences in voting policy throughout the state. (Most states have a statewide policy for curing ballots.)",
      "And finally, after the ballots are counted, there can be challenges. Pennsylvania laws give residents a spate of ways to challenge and delay certification of the results with recounts, appeals, and litigation.",
      "Election experts say Pennsylvania's laws make it fertile ground for rigged election claims to flourish. They also stressed that there is little reason to believe that unsubstantiated voter fraud claims\u2014and any lawsuits associated with them\u2014will actually stop the certification of the results.",
      "\u201cThe Pennsylvania legislature had multiple opportunities to clarify and improve the state\u2019s election law,\u201d said Nate Persily, an NBC News election law expert and professor at Stanford Law School. \u201cIt deliberately chose not to. The gaps in the law provide a vacuum that gets filled with conspiracy theories and require the courts to bring coherence to an incoherent regime.\u201d",
      "Former President Donald Trump and his campaign are already targeting Pennsylvania, falsely claiming there is large-scale \u201ccheating\u201d and \u201cvoter fraud\u201d at play.",
      "Trump's campaign has repeatedly portrayed the long lines in Bucks County during on-demand mail balloting as a form of voter suppression that, according to vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance, was \"voter fraud\" perpetrated by Democrats. (The state's Republican secretary of the commonwealth, Al Schmidt, rejected Vance's claim.)",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve already started\u00a0cheating in Lancaster, they\u2019ve cheated. We caught \u2018em with 2600 votes,\u201d Trump said at a recent rally, misconstruing a real incident where hundreds of fraudulent voter registration applications were identified and rejected in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.",
      "This type of disinformation campaign is what worries Wendy Weiser most. As vice president for democracy at the\u00a0Brennan Center\u00a0for Justice at NYU Law School, Weiser said she isn\u2019t concerned that partisans will somehow block the certification of the results. \"Those are not battles that are going to succeed,\u201d she told NBC News recently.",
      "But she fears that Trump's \"disinformation campaign\" and \"broad propaganda efforts\" will \"cause people to think there is something wrong with the election,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge danger that we\u2019re already in.\u201d",
      "Once the results are counted, there are several ways for the Trump campaign \u2014 if it loses \u2014 and its allies to challenge the results.",
      "\u201cWe\u00a0should\u00a0expect a spate of local litigation throughout the state in the immediate aftermath of the election, not because those suits are meritorious, but because Pennsylvania law is rife with such opportunities,\u201d said Michael Morse, an NBC News election law expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law.",
      "State law allows any \u201caggrieved\u201d person who disagrees with how a county board handled its results to appeal them within two days, something that will delay certification temporarily, Morse said in an email. Limited recounts can be demanded by as few as three voters in a precinct, per state law, something that helped delay Pennsylvania's 2022 result certification by weeks.",
      "But the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania has tightened the standard for such a recount, requiring petitioners to identify and show evidence that fraud or error occurred, Morse said.",
      "Trump supporters on county boards across the country have sought to block the certification of election results by delaying or voting against the certification in the past.",
      "All three experts, though, agreed that Pennsylvania's courts have tools and legal precedents that allow them to force certification of the results when no credible claims of large-scale voter fraud exist.",
      "State courts have also taken steps to ensure that legal challenges are handled swiftly. The state Supreme Court has expedited its election appeal period from ten to three days to ensure that the state certifies its results by the December 11th federal deadline created by the Electoral Count Reform Act, enacted in 2022 to clarify the counting of presidential election results.",
      "\u201cThe concern to me is less certification of the vote by December 11,\" Morse said, \"than the collateral damage to voter confidence that bad-faith actors can easily inflict along the way.\u201d"

      "Once the last voter casts their ballot in a state and the polls close, the process of revealing the winner begins. That\u2019s when Election Day turns into election night, and each state starts reporting its vote totals.",
      "Some states \u2014 like Florida, Georgia and North Carolina \u2014 report their vote quickly, while others like Arizona, Nevada and California typically take longer, upward of a week or two to tabulate most of their ballots. Within many states, the patterns of how votes are reported can make it difficult to tell in the middle of election night who the winner is going to be in the end.",
      "For example, vote returns can skew toward one party early in a night because only a certain type of vote is reported first \u2014 like when mail ballots are counted before any in-person Election Day votes.

      "A vote mirage is when the current vote count shows a candidate getting a higher percentage of the vote than they will ultimately end up with in the final count. Mirages can be \u201cred\u201d or \u201cblue\u201d depending on which party appears to be benefiting \u2014 but \u201cappears\u201d is the really important thing here, because like any other mirage, a vote mirage is fleeting and doesn\u2019t reflect the final reality.",
      "The factors that produce a vote mirage",
      "Generally speaking, there are three factors that produce vote mirages: geography, vote mode and order of tabulation.",
      "Mirages can emerge because of geographic differences in the counties that report more quickly or more slowly. It\u2019s common for small, rural counties or precincts to report their tallies more quickly than large, urban ones, because the logistics of counting votes are simpler when there are fewer ballots to handle. As a result, since voters in rural areas are more likely to be Republican than voters in urban areas, a red mirage can happen when a state\u2019s vote count overrepresents rural areas at a certain point on election night.",
      "Virginia is an example of a state that usually has a geography-driven red mirage early on election night. This is because Fairfax County, a high-population suburb of Washington, D.C., where Joe Biden received 70% of the vote in 2020, tends to be one of the last counties in the state to report most of its results. Until Fairfax County has reported most or all of its votes, Donald Trump will likely have a statewide vote percentage that is higher than his final statewide total.",
      "On election night 2020, Fairfax County reported the results from a majority of its ballots (nearly 375,000 votes) at 11:43 p.m. ET. This single report caused Trump\u2019s statewide vote percentage to shrink in that moment from 50.2% to 45.8%. (That\u2019s close to Trump\u2019s final vote share in Virginia, 44%.)",
      "Another factor that can cause vote mirages is partisan differences by vote mode \u2014 mail ballots, early in-person votes, Election Day in-person votes, and so on.",
      "Many states and counties tend to report the results of each mode one at a time. This can cause vote mirages if one party is more likely than the other to cast its votes using a particular mode. This was the case in 2020, when Democrats voted more by mail than Republicans, and Republicans were much more likely to show up on Election Day.",
      "This difference caused a large blue mirage in North Carolina in 2020. In the first hour after polls closed, most North Carolina counties had reported their mail and early in-person votes. Those votes were heavily Democratic, and at 8:18 p.m. ET, Biden was at 57.6% in the statewide vote count. But over the next three hours, the state reported its heavily Republican Election Day votes, causing Biden\u2019s vote percentage to shrink to his final number there, 48.6%.",
      "The third factor that can produce vote mirages is more complicated: differences in the order that specific modes of ballots are counted. This tends to be the most consequential in states and counties that report the results of their mail ballots in small batches.",
      "Many election offices tend to count their mail ballots in the order that they were received, meaning that ballots returned by voters in mid-October will appear in the vote tallies earlier than those received on Election Day. This will produce a vote mirage if there are partisan differences between the earliest-returned mail ballots and the later-returned ones.",
      "This is what occurred in Arizona in 2020. The mail ballots reported by Maricopa County (which accounts for 60% of the state\u2019s voters) on election night included those returned by voters by the weekend before Election Day. This ended up producing a blue mirage, because those earlier mail votes were more Democratic than the later ones.",
      "The results of the later-returned mail ballots were reported in the days following Election Day. Because those late-arriving mail ballots were heavily pro-Republican, Donald Trump\u2019s vote count grew from 46.8% at 3 a.m. ET on election night to his ultimate vote share of 48.9% \u2014 just shy of Biden\u2019s 49.2%.",
      "Interestingly, Arizona\u2019s pattern in the 2018 midterm election was the opposite. Late-arriving mail ballots were much more heavily pro-Democratic, and, once they were added, the Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema, went from trailing by 0.8 percentage points on Election Night to winning the election by 2 points.",
      "What to watch for in terms of mirages in each state",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk accounts for these mirages when deciding whether to project the winner in a race. For example, we are less likely to project a Republican winner in a state if all the remaining uncounted ballots are expected to come from heavily Democratic counties. Conversely, we are less likely to make a projection if the Democrat is ahead but most of the uncounted ballots are expected to be strongly Republican, in-person Election Day votes.",
      "We are also cautious about assuming that historical patterns will hold in 2024, especially given that the 2020 election was held during a pandemic, with voters more likely to vote by mail and social distancing affecting how election officials tabulated the results. This year, the Trump campaign has also encouraged his supporters to vote early, which may affect partisan differences between vote modes.",
      "Here are specific details about the mirages we have seen in key swing states in the past \u2014 and what could happen on election night this year.",
      "North Carolina: Most of the mail ballots will likely be reported first, causing a blue mirage. In a change for this year\u2019s election, in-person early ballots cannot be tabulated until after polls close on Election Day. We expect the in-person early votes to start coming in around 8 p.m. ET, a half-hour after polls close in the state. But the vote percentages will shift toward Republicans as in-person Election Day votes get reported over the course of the evening.",
      "Georgia: Most counties will report their early in-person and mail ballots first, likely causing a blue mirage before the statewide results move toward Trump as Election Day votes are reported. After that, there may be a small shift back toward the Democrats, as the late-arriving mail ballots are reported from large metro Atlanta counties. Unlike 2020, Georgia counties are not allowed to pause their vote-counting process until they have counted all ballots.",
      "Pennsylvania: We expect the earliest-reported votes to be dominated by mail ballots, including from heavily Democratic Philadelphia and Allegheny counties, causing an early blue mirage. Then, as in-person Election Day votes are reported, the blue mirage will turn into a red one, with the results tipping more Republican than we expect to see in the final margin. Finally those large counties (particularly Philadelphia) will continue to count and report their remaining mail ballots. This will likely shift the race back in Democrats\u2019 direction.",
      "In 2020, the Pennsylvania results at 3 a.m. ET on election night were about 7 percentage points more Republican than the final result. In the 2022 Senate election, the 3 a.m. red mirage was just over 1 percentage point from the final margin.",
      "Michigan: We expect a slight red mirage in Michigan as smaller, more pro-Republican localities report their votes. The total vote count will likely trickle upward as small places report, and the size of the mirage will shrink when large, Democratic cities like Detroit, Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor report. This year, Michigan voters can vote early in person for the first time in a general election, and clerks are now permitted to preprocess their mail ballots, enabling faster counting. Both of these changes may cause differences in vote reporting patterns compared to what we have seen in previous elections.",
      "Wisconsin: In most Wisconsin municipalities, all modes of vote are reported together. This produces a slight red mirage, because smaller, rural municipalities tend to report more quickly.",
      "A handful of large municipalities, including the city of Milwaukee, tabulate their mail ballots centrally and report them separately from their Election Day votes. The state will experience a red mirage until the heavily Democratic mail ballots from most heavily Democratic cities in the state are reported. At 4:42 a.m. ET on election night 2020, Milwaukee reported that Biden had received 85% of its 168,000 mail ballots. This caused Biden\u2019s statewide total to increase from 47.3% to 49.3%.",
      "Arizona: In 2020, about 70% of the state\u2019s votes \u2014 mostly early in-person and early-arriving mail ballots \u2014 were reported in the first hour after polls closed. This generated a statewide Biden lead of over 14 percentage points in a state he ultimately won by 0.3 points.",
      "As Election Day votes were reported in the next few hours of election night, the size of the blue mirage shrunk to about 3.5 points. It continued to shrink after Election Day as the pro-Trump, late-arriving mail ballots were reported. In the 2022 Senate race, the Democrat was ahead in the first hour by 19 points and won by 5. But in the 2018 Senate race, the pattern worked in the opposite direction, with the Republican ahead by 3 points early before ultimately losing by 2 points.",
      "Nevada: Nevada will experience a red mirage until Clark County (Las Vegas) reports. In 2020, Clark\u2019s first report came 90 minutes after the first county in the state had reported its votes. In 2022, this gap was only 10 minutes. Then, the first report in Clark may cause a blue mirage, which will shrink as in-person Election Day votes are tabulated statewide.",
      "Late-arriving mail ballots will be reported in the days after Election Day. In 2020, these ballots moved Biden\u2019s lead from 0.6 percentage points to a final result of 2.4 points."

    "published": "Sat, 02 Nov 2024 11:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "After Donald Trump claimed victory in the early morning hours after election night in 2020, his campaign and supporters turned to the courts to make that claim a reality.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 After Donald Trump claimed victory in the early-morning hours after election night in 2020, his campaign and supporters turned to the courts to make that claim a reality. The Trump campaign and surrogates began filing lawsuits the very same day, challenging the results on a variety of grounds well before the final votes were counted.",
      "The legal process and tactics may provide insight into how Trump or his allies could launch similar efforts should he lose again this time.",
      "Over the remainder of November and into December, Trump and his Republican allies filed dozens of lawsuits in key swing states that, if successful, would have given Trump the Electoral College votes needed to remain in the White House. Their efforts stretched from local county courts all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and were supported by solo practitioners and state attorneys general alike.",
      "Of the more than 60 lawsuits filed in the post-election period, Trump obtained a favorable ruling in only one case \u2014 the remainder were eventually either dismissed, settled or voluntarily withdrawn.",
      "Approximately 12 hours after Trump declared victory in a 2 a.m. speech from the White House, the campaign filed lawsuits seeking to stop the counts in Michigan and Georgia. Later that day, a third lawsuit was filed in Pennsylvania seeking to prevent voters from \u201ccuring\u201d mail-in ballots that lacked proof of identification.",
      "More lawsuits from the campaign and Republican allies swiftly followed in those states and other heated battlegrounds. In Arizona, voters and the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit alleging thousands of people in Maricopa County had their ballots disqualified because of ink-bleed caused by Sharpies. In Nevada, Trump electors sued alleging that faulty signature matching machines cast doubt on over 100,000 Clark County mail-in votes. In Wisconsin, Trump filed a lawsuit alleging widespread voter fraud and demanding a recount, which ultimately reaffirmed Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state.",
      "Over the following days and weeks, all these lawsuits ended in losses for Trump, with the exception of his initial lawsuit in Pennsylvania. That resulted in an order finding that the Pennsylvania secretary of state overstepped by extending the deadline for voters to provide missing proof of identification for mail-in ballots received after Election Day and enjoining counties from counting any ballots \u201ccured\u201d during that time. Even with that ruling, Biden still won Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes.",
      "On Nov. 19, 2020, nearly two weeks after all major media outlets had called the election for Biden, Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis held a press conference in Washington, D.C., to present evidence they claimed showed widespread fraud and election interference by foreign countries.",
      "\u201cThe number of voter fraud cases in Philadelphia could fill a library,\u201d Giuliani said.",
      "\u201cWhat we are really dealing with here, and uncovering more by the day, is the massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba and likely China in the interference with our elections here in the United States,\u201d Powell said.",
      "Powell\u2019s claims at that press conference went too far even for Trump, who behind the scenes dismissed her as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cunhinged,\u201d according to filings in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s criminal election interference case against Trump.",
      "The rate of new lawsuits slowed significantly in December, but Trump and his allies hadn\u2019t given up. One week into the month, Texas sought leave at the U.S. Supreme Court to file a lawsuit against Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin arguing that officials in those states had made illegal changes to election laws and again raising allegations of fraud. Seventeen Republican attorneys general would go on to add their support to Texas\u2019 case. The justices ultimately declined to hear the case, stating that Texas had not shown a \u201cjudicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court, with the exception of justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, never showed any real appetite for taking up other election cases that rose to their level. The justices disposed of a handful of post-election challenges from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin with no further explanation in an order a month after Biden was inaugurated.",
      "\u201cThese cases provide us with an ideal opportunity to address just what authority nonlegislative officials have to set election rules, and to do so well before the next election cycle,\u201d Thomas wrote in a dissent. \u201cThe refusal to do so is inexplicable.\u201d",
      "The legal efforts to keep Trump in power had failed, but the ramifications of these challenges would continue to unfold for their participants over the following years. The federal indictment against Trump mentions these baseless lawsuits as proof of his corrupt intent to remain in power despite knowing he lost the election. Giuliani has been disbarred in New York and D.C., indicted in Georgia and Arizona and has been ordered to turn over his Manhattan apartment and other property to two Georgia election workers he defamed.",
      "Powell and Ellis were indicted in Georgia and have both pleaded guilty. Ellis was also indicted in Arizona and has since agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for her charges being dropped. And dozens of ethics complaints against local attorneys who filed election challenges are still pending nationwide."

    "published": "Thu, 31 Oct 2024 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Some states automatically launch a recount if the results are within a certain margin, while others rely on candidates to ask for one.",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 election looks extremely close in the polls. And if the actual results are that close after Election Day, it's possible the results in a key state could hinge on a recount.",
      "The rules about when recounts happen and the procedures they include vary from state to state, since elections are administered locally. Those rules were in the spotlight in 2020, after Joe Biden won a handful of key battleground states by a razor-thin margin.",
      "Former President Donald Trump requested, and was granted, recounts in a few of these states, but none of them changed the outcome of the election there. Typically, recounts only slightly change the final margin of a race, but when the vote is close enough, they can have a real effect.",
      "Ahead of Election Day, here's a refresher of the recount rules in the states expected to be the closest in the presidential race.",
      "Arizona",
      "Candidates don't request recounts in Arizona, but the state requires an automatic recount if a race is decided by a margin within (or equal to) less than 0.5% of votes cast in a race. The threshold was lower in 2020 (0.1%), but since then, the state enacted a law raising the automatic recount threshold to 0.5%.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers approved new measures in 2024 that would shorten the time needed for a potential recount. That means Arizona would be able to handle a recount and not miss the deadline for the December meeting where members of the Electoral College cast their votes.",
      "Georgia",
      "In Georgia, a candidate can request a recount if the margin of a race is within 0.5 percentage points, as long as the request is made within two business days of certification.",
      "Georgia's 2020 presidential vote got significant scrutiny in the days after Election Day, given both the tight margin and Trump's baseless claims of widespread fraud.",
      "Election officials hand-counted nearly 5 million ballots again after the election, as part of a statewide risk-limiting audit authorized by a new state law.",
      "Then, after the state certified Biden's victory, the Trump campaign requested a machine recount, as was its right under state law. (That recount also didn't change the outcome.)",
      "State law also allows election officials to ask for a recount if there is \"a suspected error or discrepancy in the returns,\" and the secretary of state can ask for one if a candidate believes a \"suspected error or discrepancy\" occurred.",
      "Michigan",
      "Michigan law provides for an automatic recount if the margin of victory in a race is 2,000 votes or fewer. A candidate is also allowed to request a recount if they have a \"good-faith belief that but for fraud or mistake, the candidate would have had a reasonable chance of winning,\" according to state law.",
      "The state recently enacted changes to Michigan's recount law, but none will go into effect before Election Day.",
      "Nevada",
      "There's no provision for automatic recounts here, but a candidate can request one, as long as they cover the cost of the recount and make the request within three days of the certification.",
      "North Carolina",
      "A candidate can request a recount in a race if the margin of victory is within 0.5% of votes cast, or 10,000 votes, whichever is less.",
      "Pennsylvania",
      "The state automatically triggers a recount if the margin between two candidates is within 0.5%. But three voters can also request a recount in a specific precinct if they allege there was fraud or an error in that precinct.",
      "Wisconsin",
      "The state allows candidates to request a recount, as Trump did in 2020. But the candidate who requests the recount has to cover the expenses if the margin of victory is larger than 0.25 percentage points, as Trump did when he paid $3 million for a partial recount that resulted in no substantive change to the 2020 vote count."

      "A loss to Vice President Kamala Harris, however, could see Trump facing a potential jail sentence later in the month for his criminal conviction in New York and the possibility of additional criminal trials in 2025. It could also leave him open to additional civil trials in the near future, while he\u2019s already appealing $500 million in civil judgments against him.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot more arrows in the quiver when you\u2019re the president,\u201d said NBC News legal analyst Chuck Rosenberg.",
      "Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung predicted Trump would prevail at the ballot box and said all of the cases should be tossed. The \u201cwitch hunts against President Trump have imploded\u201d and \u201cshould all be dismissed in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s historic decision on immunity and other vital jurisprudence,\u201d Cheung said in a statement.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at where the legal cases against the Republican presidential nominee currently stand, and how they may \u2014 or may not \u2014 be affected by a Trump win or loss.",
      "Hush money case",
      "Win or lose, Trump\u2019s biggest immediate challenge after the election is his potential sentencing on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in New York. He is tentatively scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 26 \u2014 three weeks after Election Day.",
      "New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan twice postponed the proceeding to give Trump and his attorneys more time to argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s July ruling on the scope of presidential immunity should result in the conviction being thrown out. They also want the charges against Trump either dropped or for him to get a new trial that omits evidence they argue shouldn\u2019t have been allowed in light of the high court\u2019s ruling.",
      "Merchan is supposed to decide on that request by Nov. 12. Trump\u2019s attorneys are expected to immediately appeal if he rules against their client.",
      "If the sentencing proceeds, Merchan could potentially sentence Trump to prison, which would also be immediately appealed. Rosenberg told NBC News in May, after Trump\u2019s conviction, that jail time was unlikely but possible considering the former president spent much of the trial insulting the judge and defying his gag order.",
      "An election victory would give Trump additional fodder for an appeal to stave off jail time; his attorneys have argued in another case that the Constitution bars the president from being restricted from carrying out his official duties.",
      "Federal election interference case",
      "If Trump loses, special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election interference case is also on the horizon.",
      "The case, which charges Trump with conspiracy to defraud the United States for illegally trying to overturn the 2020 election results, was initially slated to go to trial earlier this year but was paused for several months while the Supreme Court weighed Trump\u2019s arguments that he was mostly protected from allegations of wrongdoing because of presidential immunity.",
      "Prosecutors are expected to continue moving forward with the case even if Trump is elected in November, but it\u2019s likely that whoever Trump names to head the Justice Department will fire Smith and scuttle the case.",
      "In an interview last week with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump suggested he might not wait for his new AG. \u201cI would fire him within two seconds,\u201d Trump said, referring to Smith.",
      "Even with Smith out of the picture, the Justice Department would still have to move to have the judge dismiss the case \u2014 a request judges don\u2019t always necessarily grant.",
      "Georgia election interference case",
      "The sprawling case charging Trump and more than a dozen others with illegally conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results is on hold until December when an appeals court will weigh whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and her office should be allowed to remain on the case.",
      "If she is, that could allow the long-stalled case to proceed. Trump\u2019s loss could pave the way for Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee to set a trial date for the case. However, if Trump loses, he is still likely to appeal the case further, which Willis brought against him in 2023, which could pose more delays.",
      "If Willis and her office are booted from the case, that would cause additional delays as well. The process of finding another prosecutor can be lengthy; it took almost two years to name one in another case involving Willis.",
      "If Trump wins the election, those delays could be even longer. At a court hearing in December of last year, McAfee asked Trump attorney Steve Sadow when his client could stand trial if he\u2019s elected.",
      "\u201cThe answer to that is I believe that under the supremacy clause and his duties as president of the United States, this trial would not take place at all until after he left his term in office,\u201d Sadow replied.",
      "Barbara McQuade, an NBC News legal analyst and a former federal prosecutor, said she believes it\u2019s possible both state criminal cases could be stayed during Trump\u2019s time in office and \u201cwould resume upon the expiration of his term.\u201d",
      "Classified documents case",
      "In July, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the criminal case charging Trump with lying and scheming to\u00a0mislead federal investigators\u00a0to retain sensitive classified materials after he left the White House, finding Smith\u2019s appointment as special counsel was illegal.",
      "Smith is appealing the decision, arguing that there\u2019s plentiful precedent for his appointment and that the case should be allowed to proceed.",
      "As with the federal election case, Smith\u2019s office is expected to proceed with business as usual in the appeal even if Trump is elected, although the special counsel\u2019s office would likely be quickly shut down and the appeal dropped.",
      "E. Jean Carroll appeals",
      "Cases that likely won\u2019t be affected by a Trump win or loss are his pending appeals of civil judgments against him totaling more than  $500 million.",
      "The former president is appealing the largest award \u2014 more than $478 million and growing by more than $111,000 a day \u2014 in a civil fraud case in New York state court. During arguments before the state Appellate Division, three members of the five-judge panel indicated they thought the award was too large.",
      "A lawyer for the state attorney general\u2019s office argued that the award is appropriate because the amount of fraud Trump and his company were found responsible for was sizable and went on for an extended period of time.",
      "It\u2019s unclear when the panel will rule.",
      "Trump is also appealing a pair of jury awards totaling about $88 million that he has to pay writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "Carroll filed two suits against Trump, one for allegedly sexually assaulting her in the 1990s and defamation and another for defaming her while he was president.",
      "The appeals court is expected to rule in the sexual assault case first, and that ruling could come at any time.",
      "Jan. 6 suits",
      "Trump is facing eight pending\u00a0civil suits\u00a0related to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including by injured police officers. Similar to the criminal cases, Trump has argued that his actions were protected by presidential immunity.",
      "A federal appeals court allowed the cases to proceed last year after the plaintiffs contended that Trump\u2019s actions weren\u2019t official presidential acts because he was acting as a candidate for the office.",
      "Trump, they noted, would have the opportunity to push back on that stance as the case proceeds.",
      "No trial date has been set in the cases, and with the likelihood of appeals the immunity issues could take months or longer to be determined.",
      "The process could become even more drawn out if Trump wins, because he could attempt to get the Justice Department involved in his defense. He could also try to delay trials in those cases by arguing that they should come after his criminal trial in Georgia, since they cover similar ground and could affect his right against self-incrimination.",
      "\u201cCivil cases are often stayed for that reason,\u201d McQuade said.",
      "\u2018Exonerated 5\u2019 suit",
      "Trump is facing another defamation suit brought against him this month by members of the so-called Central Park Five, who now call themselves the Exonerated Five.",
      "During last month\u2019s presidential debate, Trump incorrectly said that the men, who are Black and Latino, pleaded guilty in a criminal case in which they\u2019d been charged with assaulting and raping a white woman jogging in New York\u2019s Central Park in 1989. He also said they \u201ckilled a person ultimately\u201d although the woman is still alive.",
      "The five, who were teenagers when they were convicted, said they were coerced into confessions by police, and pleaded not guilty to the charges. They were convicted at trial and served lengthy prison sentences while maintaining their innocence.",
      "They were exonerated in 2002 after a review by prosecutors that included DNA evidence that found the jogger had been attacked by a serial rapist who confessed to the crime after the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "That suit is not expected to be affected by Trump\u2019s election given a Supreme Court ruling during the Clinton years that presidents aren\u2019t immune from civil suits that aren\u2019t related to their time in office.",
      "McQuade said she believes the case \u201ccould proceed, just as the Paula Jones case did against Bill Clinton.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The task of counting and announcing vote results from over 100,000 precincts across the country \u2014 mostly within a few hours \u2014 requires a massive operation that involves hundreds of thousands of poll workers, election officials and observers.",
      "We may think of a presidential election as a single nationwide contest, but how elections are administered varies across the 50 states and Washington, D.C. Even within states, different jurisdictions \u2014 counties, cities and so on \u2014 could have different\u00a0administrative practices or logistics in the election process.",
      "In most of the country, counties run elections. In a handful of states, particularly in New England, cities or towns administer them.",
      "Nearly all of those jurisdictions provide multiple vote reports (updates to the vote count) on election night and in the following days. In the November 2020 election, NBC News received over 88,000 updates to its vote totals across 542 different races. More than 45,000 of those vote updates came before 2 a.m. ET on election night.",
      "From 9:15 to 9:30 p.m. ET that night, NBC News received just over four updates per second, on average.",
      "In all, NBC News will report vote results from 4,635 jurisdictions across the U.S. Here\u2019s how it works, from how local governments count to how NBC News monitors, checks and displays the vote totals.",
      "How do states and counties tabulate their vote results?",
      "The vote results reported by NBC News are the product of hundreds of thousands of people working to accurately and efficiently count and report the results. The process begins at your local polling place or precinct. On Election Day 2020, there were over 107,000 physical polling places nationwide, staffed by nearly 700,000 poll workers, many of them volunteers.",

      "Inside NBC News' Decision Desk: When will we know who won the presidential race?",
      "How exit polls work and how NBC News uses them on election night",
      "After polls close in your state and the last voters have cast their ballots, poll workers begin to close the precincts and tabulate the votes. Each state has different requirements for the process, but the steps generally include turning off and securing voting machines and ensuring that the number of voters who checked in corresponds with the number of ballots cast.",
      "Then, each precinct tabulates its vote results and reports those numbers to a central office in its county or town.",
      "In some states, local precincts also count mail ballots from voters who live inside the boundaries of those precincts. Poll workers must scan them through tabulation machines either on Election Day, perhaps while the precincts are not busy, or after polls have closed.",
      "In other places, mail ballots are counted centrally in a jurisdiction\u2019s single facility instead of precinct by precinct. Some of those counties, such as Clark County, Nevada (home of Las Vegas), and Maricopa County, Arizona (home of Phoenix), provide partial reports at regular intervals. Others do not report any mail results until they have tabulated all the mail ballots.",
      "For example, Milwaukee County in Wisconsin released its full tabulation of about 170,000 mail ballots at 4:40 a.m. ET on election night 2020, after it had worked its way through the whole batch.",
      "How does NBC News receive and display counties\u2019 vote tabulations?",
      "In November, NBC News is covering 610 statewide and congressional races. To manage the task of collecting all those results in a relatively short amount of time, NBC News coordinates with ABC News, CBS News and CNN through the National Election Pool, or NEP. Since 2018, the NEP has received vote count data from Edison Research, a firm that specializes in collecting election data.",
      "No centralized, federal government agency collects and reports vote results, so each state determines how it makes\u00a0those results available. Many states have websites where anybody can access the real-time vote counts. Others have websites with results \u2014 but the numbers on election night are not as up to date as what is available from individual counties.",
      "And some states do not have vote results pages that update on election night at all.",
      "Edison Research collects the vote results state by state and county by county. When possible, it uses software to automatically detect updates and collect the vote counts from state or county websites. In other jurisdictions, Edison manually transcribes vote result data from PDFs into its tabulation system.",
      "And because many jurisdictions do not post their results online on election night but the results themselves are public information, Edison also hires thousands of \u201cvote reporters\u201d to physically be at county or town election offices where they can get the totals after votes are tabulated.",
      "After Edison processes the data, it is transmitted to NBC News and the rest of the NEP. That is when you will see vote numbers change on a television graphic or on NBCNews.com. That is also when NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk sees the updated vote count and uses it in its process of determining when it can accurately project the winner of a race.",
      "How does NBC News ensure the vote counts are correct?",
      "Given the high volume of data being reported in a fairly short amount of time, it is not hard to imagine that mistakes can be made. Any process that involves hundreds of thousands of people transmitting millions of numbers has the potential for human-generated error from poor handwriting, typos, miscommunications and so forth.",
      "What makes election results in this country trustworthy, however, are the countless fail-safes that detect and correct such mistakes.",
      "The biggest of those fail-safes is vote certification. The results you see on election night are only unofficial counts, and they can change \u2014 typically by tiny amounts, like when overseas and military ballots are added to vote counts or when a state conducts a recount in a close race and re-examines disputed ballots. Only when a state certifies the results, which happens days or even weeks after Election Day, do they become final. And before certification, states require several postelection audit procedures, which double- and triple-check the accuracy of the counts.",
      "On election night, there are other error-detection fail-safes at every stage of the vote counting process. They begin at the local precincts, where poll workers make sure that the \u201cbooks balance\u201d by verifying, for example, that the number of ballots cast in the precincts correspond with the number of voter check-ins.",
      "Then, when a precinct reports its vote results to its state or county, it performs additional quality assurance checks. Does the number of votes in the precinct make sense when compared with its number of registered voters? Is the turnout rate comparable to the rates in nearby precincts? If any of those questions raise flags about a precinct\u2019s count, the state or the county will resolve the concerns by consulting with the person in charge of the precinct or by re-checking the data before those votes are added to the county\u2019s overall count.",
      "Edison Research performs another set of data quality checks when it receives vote results. It looks for errors, like extra digits added to a candidate\u2019s count or vote counts for two candidates getting flipped accidentally. If Edison\u2019s error detection system suspects a report may include a mistake, the data gets held\u00a0until a trained analyst can verify it with the state or the county.",
      "Finally, NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk also has its own set of data quality assurance tools, which compare the vote results to various administrative and historical data sources. If those tools detect anomalies, they are flagged to Edison and the NEP for further investigation. NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk will not call a race until it is certain that the vote results are error-free."

    "summary": "Several key states are perennially slow vote counters. Others have invested in speeding up the process. But if it\u2019s a very close race, don\u2019t expect a quick resolution.",
    "story": [
      "Americans have two big questions as they head into another election with a deeply divided electorate: who will win, and when will they know it?",
      "In 2020, election week replaced election night: Joe Biden wasn\u2019t declared the winner until Saturday. This year, it could go either way. It may take as long as a week for the NBC News Decision Desk to project a presidential winner, or it could happen as early as Wednesday, even by Wednesday morning.",
      "The truth is the Decision Desk cannot know until election night which scenario will unfold, regardless of how carefully we have analyzed the polls, early vote, and other election-related data. The answer depends not only on how states count their votes but on the unknowable factor of how close the margins will be.",
      "One thing is clear: The days of projecting a winner on election night itself are almost certainly over.",

      "How exit polls work and how NBC News uses them on election night",
      "Projecting a presidential winner as early as Wednesday would require that the key battleground states, particularly Pennsylvania, are not essentially tied. There would need to be a large enough spread between the first and second place to be able to project a winner.Races that are nearly tied, like the presidential race in Georgia and Arizona in 2020 (Joe Biden\u2019s winning margins in these states were 11,779 and 10,457 votes, respectively), require essentially all the vote to be counted before NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk can project a winner. This can take days.",
      "But let\u2019s go through the battleground states where Wednesday calls are at least possible.",
      "Any path to winning the White House will likely go through the \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. In 2020, Pennsylvania was the pivotal Electoral College state to call the presidency, and there is a decent chance it plays that role again. But in 2020, it took four days after Election Day for the NBC News Decision Desk to be able to declare a winner.",
      "It may well happen much earlier this year. This is because 98% to 99% of the vote in Pennsylvania will likely be counted by Wednesday morning.",
      "How Pennsylvania counts its vote remains largely unchanged since 2020, but the process should be more efficient this year. Key counties like Allegheny (home of Pittsburgh) and Philadelphia have invested heavily in new voting machines and have added more personnel to help process ballots. Also, remember that this election is not being administered amid a global pandemic that required strict social distancing between election officials, slowing the count.",
      "We expect several Pennsylvania counties to release large counts of early votes shortly after polls close, followed by the in-person Election Day vote. That would leave the early votes received on Election Day, along with provisional ballots, still to count on Wednesday.",
      "If 99% of the total vote is counted quickly, a Wednesday projection is very possible in Pennsylvania, unless the race is razor tight. In 2022, we had about 90% of the vote counted in Pennsylvania when the NBC News Decision Desk projected Democrat John Fetterman as the winner of the state\u2019s Senate race at 12:51 a.m. ET.",
      "In Wisconsin and Michigan, the bulk of the vote could also be counted by Wednesday if past reporting patterns hold.Based on those patterns, in Wisconsin, the amount counted by Wednesday morning should be over 99%. In Michigan, it should be more than 95%. An important note in Michigan: For the first time, municipalities with more than 5,000 residents can begin pre-processing absentee ballots \u2014 opening envelopes, verifying voter signatures and so on \u2014 several days before the election, which could lead to more efficient counting on election night.",
      "On the other hand, the introduction of early in-person voting in Michigan could add some difficulty in quickly counting the vote. Regardless of these changes, both Michigan and Wisconsin count almost all of their votes quickly. So, unless the races are extremely close, there is a decent chance the NBC News Decision Desk would be able to make a projection sometime on Wednesday.",
      "If the races are that close, however, it could take days or perhaps even a week, depending on the margins.",
      "How the Sun Belt battlegrounds count their votes",
      "Outside of the blue wall, the critical swing states of Georgia and North Carolina are among the best in the nation when it comes to efficiently processing and counting their votes.",
      "These two states are also extremely good at making their data available to the public electronically. In Georgia, over 99% of the vote will be counted on election night. In fact, almost all the vote has been counted in recent past elections by 1 a.m. ET. However, Georgia was so close in 2020 that it took days to call the race.",
      "North Carolina has a similar pattern in how it reports out the vote, with 99% of the vote counted by midnight in past elections. Still, any chance of an election night projection in either of these closely divided states depends on a wide enough spread between the two candidates.",
      "The one electoral vote awarded to the winner in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional District could also be pivotal in the path to 270. With no significant changes in how votes are counted in Nebraska, around 90% of the vote can be expected to be counted by Wednesday morning, which again could lead to a projection if there is enough spread between the candidates.",
      "The last two battleground states, Arizona and Nevada, almost certainly won\u2019t be called quickly. If the presidency comes down to one of these states, forget any thoughts of a Wednesday resolution.",
      "In 2020, NBC News did not project a winner in Arizona until Nov. 12, nine days after Election Day. And unlike some other close states, it wasn\u2019t just because the margin was so thin.",
      "Typically, Arizona has as much as 20% of its vote still to count after election night \u2014mainly late-arriving mail ballots. And there are very substantial differences between Republicans and Democrats in terms of who votes when (early versus on Election Day). This makes it nearly impossible to project a winner in Arizona on election night.",
      "Nevada is a state that has a large amount of early voting, both absentee and in person, that is not counted on election night. In the past, nearly a quarter of the vote is still not counted by the Wednesday morning after Election Day.",
      "Given that the state has been historically close in presidential elections, the probability of calling a close race with a large amount of uncounted vote is very low.",
      "The bottom line: In Arizona and Nevada, it will likely take a few days, perhaps longer, to know the winner."

    "summary": "Exit polls, large-scale studies of voters, now include phone calls to early and mail voters as well as interviews outside polling places on Election Day.",
    "story": [
      "On Election Day, as votes are being tallied and news organizations await results and race projections that can be reported, exit polls are a critical tool providing an early look at who is voting and what\u2019s motivating their choices.",
      "An exit poll is a survey of voters taken as they leave (or exit) their voting location. It\u2019s the only national survey of known voters in the country. It allows news organizations, researchers and voters to understand what\u2019s happening in an election as the results flow in.",
      "Here\u2019s how exit polling works, where they are conducted and how NBC News will be using the exit poll results on election night and the days after.",
      "Who conducts the exit poll?",
      "Since 2003, Edison Research, a firm that specializes in collecting election data, has conducted exit polls on behalf of the National Election Pool. The NEP is a consortium of media networks \u2014 ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC News \u2014 that pools together resources for one collective vote count and exit poll operation. NBC News independently analyzes and reports on the exit poll results.",

      "Inside NBC News' Decision Desk: When will we know who won the presidential race?",
      "What questions are asked?",
      "The exit poll asks voters which candidates they supported for president and in other races. But a number of other attitudinal and issue-based questions are usually included, such as: \u201cWhat is the most important issue to your vote?\u201d The other key component of an exit poll is asking about a voter\u2019s demographics such as age, gender, race, education. These types of questions help illustrate how different groups voted and what mattered to them, and they are also used to weight the exit poll \u2014 that is, to make sure that the exit poll properly reflects the demographic composition of the electorate as well as the election results.",
      "Members of each news organization in the NEP jointly determine in which states the exit polls will be conducted (in addition to the national exit poll survey), and they work together to decide what questions are included on the national and state questionnaires. The exit poll questionnaires include about 25 questions and take around 5 minutes to complete.",
      "How are exit polls conducted?",
      "The exit poll is then conducted in a random sample of selected polling places across the country and in states with their own exit polls (more on that later). At least one interviewer is assigned to each polling place on Election Day. This year, interviewers will be stationed at 600 polling locations throughout the country, with each of them following local rules about where they can stand in relation to the polling location. The interview is self-administered, meaning the respondent fills out the survey on their own. Then, the interviewers call in their results throughout the day, and the results are reported to news organizations.",
      "What about state exit polls?",
      "In addition to a national exit poll, which captures voters across the country, there are exit polls specifically for states that are pivotal to winning the presidency or include important down-ballot races, such as Senate or governor. This year, NBC News will have coverage of state exit polls in Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. The exit poll will be conducted in 40 balloting locations in each state.",
      "How does the exit poll capture the growing percentage of people voting early or by mail?",
      "The exit poll supplements in-person Election Day interviews by contacting early voters through a telephone poll of people on voter lists in all 50 states, as well as by collecting interviews during early in-person voting periods.",
      "This year, the exit poll is conducting interviews at early in-person voting locations in Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada and Ohio. All voters in a given state, regardless of whether they vote early or on Election Day, are asked the same questions.",
      "Are exit polls anonymous?",
      "Yes. In person, voters are handed a piece of paper and pencil to fill out a paper questionnaire and they answer anonymously. When they are done, they put their folded questionnaire into a box, much like casting a ballot. Interviews conducted by telephone do not retain any personal information about the voter who was interviewed.",
      "How many people are interviewed?",
      "The national exit poll will include approximately 20,000 interviews in total, including in-person on Election Day, in-person during early voting and via telephone to capture other early voters, including those who cast their ballots by mail. For each state exit poll in Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin, there will be sample sizes of 1,500 to 2,500 respondents per state.",
      "How do we use exit polls?",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk uses some exit poll data to help project election results. However, the exit poll is primarily used as a reporting tool on election night.",
      "The data gives viewers and readers a look into what issues are motivating voters, how they feel about the country and who they are. It\u2019s the nation\u2019s first look into what the electorate looks like and how voters are feeling about the election, the candidates and their choices.",
      "What data do news organizations report and when?",
      "Participants in the NEP do not report any exit poll results before 5 p.m. ET on Election Day, and no exit poll results that can be indicative of the outcome of a race get reported until after all the polls are scheduled to close in a state. As election night goes on and interviewers on the ground call in more exit poll results, the data is updated and re-weighed in real time."

Sign the form swearing \u2014 under penalty of perjury \u2014 that you\u2019re a citizen and eligible to vote, and you\u2019re good to go.",
      "Election officials will then check your information against government databases, which typically verify your identity and citizenship. If officials can\u2019t find corroborating information, you\u2019ll be asked to prove your citizenship with a passport, birth certificate, naturalization certificate or similar document before you are fully registered to vote.",
      "Staying on the roll",
      "Georgia checks its voter rolls against lists of people who have died or been convicted of a felony, while also routinely checking in with voters who change their address with the U.S. Postal Service or cancel their Georgia driver\u2019s license.",
      "They also use the interstate Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) to find voters who die elsewhere, or move and register out of state.",
      "Casting a ballot",
      "You must show a photo ID to vote. If you choose to vote by mail, you\u2019ll have to request a ballot with your driver\u2019s license number or a photocopy of your photo ID.",
      "All ballots are fed into tabulators to be tallied, totals are reconciled (ensuring that there are an equal number of both ballots cast and voters who voted) and the results are driven to the county election office.",
      "Checking the count",
      "After the results are tallied, the state conducts a risk-limiting audit by physically counting randomly selected batches of ballots and hand-counting them. The state also runs all the ballot images through a computer program that tallies the results."

Vicente Gonzalez is looking to hang on against Mayra Flores, a Mexican-born millennial who has promoted far-right rhetoric and is seeking to channel a resistance to transgender rights.",
      "Gonzalez is favored in this Democratic-friendly district, but surveys show Trump could make gains with Latino voters. The size of those gains, and whether the district has the appetite to be represented by a MAGA-aligned Latina, could potentially produce a shocker.",
      "California\u2019s 47th District: Republicans eye an open seat in Newport Beach",
      "Two-term Rep. Katie Porter vacated this Orange County district to launch an unsuccessful run for Senate. The Republican candidate is Scott Baugh, a former California state legislator and Orange County GOP chair who lost to Porter by less than 4 points 2022. The Democrat is state Sen. Dave Min, who made headlines early in his bid by getting cited for misdemeanor drunk driving.",
      "California is emerging as a bright spot for House Democrats this cycle. If the GOP wants to dent their gains, this Newport Beach-area district \u2014 a onetime Republican stronghold that trended blue in the era of Trump \u2014 may be their best shot at flipping a district."

      "Voters across the country are set to decide on nearly 150 ballot measures next week that will shape the future of a wide variety of policy issues in their states.",
      "Constitutional amendments related to abortion rights have drawn the most national attention in an election year that has otherwise been dominated by the presidential race.",
      "But ballot measures in dozens of other states will also put decisions about how to handle marijuana regulations, voting procedures, economic issues and immigration laws directly in the hands of voters.",
      "\u201cThe major trends that we\u2019re seeing in 2024 are reproductive freedom, democracy and economic justice,\u201d said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, the executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which works with progressive organizations to help advance citizen-led ballot measures.",
      "Follow live updates on the 2024 election",
      "According to her group, there are 147 ballot measures on ballots next Tuesday in 41 states. Of those, 77 were referred to the ballot by state lawmakers, while 57 were initiated by citizens. The others are considered bond proposals, advisory questions and constitutional convention questions. (In addition, Louisiana will let voters decide on four constitutional amendments on its Dec. 7 ballot.)",
      "Here's a rundown of the various issues the proposed amendments seek to address.",
      "Abortion",
      "Constitutional amendments to expand or protect abortion access will be on the ballot in 10 states, including the presidential battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada and the Senate battlegrounds of Montana and Florida.",
      "\u201cEveryone knows this is a big issue this year \u2014 it\u2019s the most we\u2019ve ever seen for reproductive freedom ballot measures in history,\u201d Fields Figueredo said.",
      "In Arizona, Florida, Missouri and South Dakota, proposed amendments would effectively protect abortion rights until fetal viability, with some exceptions that differ in each state after that point, and undo existing abortion laws on the books.",
      "In Maryland, Montana, Nevada and New York, abortion is already legal through fetal viability, and in Colorado, there are no laws restricting abortion and no gestational limits for women seeking abortions. As a result, the proposals in those states are intended to formally enshrine those existing rights, which organizers have said is designed to prevent lawmakers from undoing them in the future.",
      "Nebraska is the only state where two dueling constitutional amendments will appear on the November ballot.",
      "One measure would amend the state constitution to protect abortion rights until fetal viability, with exceptions for the life and health of the woman after that.",
      "The other would protect abortion rights in the first trimester, but it would bar the procedure in the second and third trimesters, except in medical emergencies or when pregnancies are the result of sexual assaults or incest. Passage would effectively codify the state's existing law banning abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy, with some exceptions, in the state constitution.",
      "Voting and elections",
      "There are 39 ballot measures on the November ballot related to democracy, elections and voting procedures, according to the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center.",
      "Some seek to create or further tighten voting restrictions, while others seek to broaden access.",
      "For example, eight states \u2014 Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin \u2014 will have constitutional amendments, referred to the November ballot by Republican lawmakers, designed to make it clear that only American citizens can vote in elections in those states. It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in elections in each of those states and at the federal level, and it rarely happens. Election experts have warned that the measures amount to an effort by Republicans to drive the unsubstantiated narrative that noncitizens are voting in large numbers.",
      "In Nevada, a constitutional amendment on the ballot would require people to show identification when they vote in person. Under state rules, voters would need to pass it in two consecutive elections for it to take effect.",
      "Meanwhile, at least three states will have measures on their ballots that would make it more difficult for citizen-led initiatives to qualify for the ballot. A proposal in Arizona would raise signature requirements for citizen-led constitutional amendments to include 15% of registered voters in each of the state\u2019s 30 legislative districts, while another would allow any person to contest an initiative or proposed amendment in court after it has been filed.",
      "A proposal in North Dakota would require any ballot initiative to be solely about one subject and constitutional amendments to be passed in both the primary and general elections to take effect.",
      "In addition, ballot measures in a handful of other states will let voters decide about implementing open primaries, as well as ranked-choice voting, in some elections.",
      "Marijuana",
      "Nearly half the states have already legalized use of recreational or medical marijuana. Voters in four more states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota \u2014 will decide next week whether to join them.",
      "A ballot measure in Florida will let voters decide whether to make recreational weed \u2014 sold at designated dispensaries \u2014 legal for everyone over 21. Medical marijuana is already legal in Florida.",
      "In Nebraska, where the use of all marijuana remains illegal, a pair of measures would legalize and regulate the use and sale of medical marijuana.",
      "And in North Dakota and South Dakota, where marijuana is legal for medical purposes, voters will decide on whether to legalize its use recreationally.",
      "Immigration",
      "Arizona is the only state with an immigration-related measure on the ballot this year \u2014 and the stakes are big.",
      "Arizona\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature referred a controversial immigration policy to the ballot that would increase the use of a federal database to check employment eligibility and give state and local law enforcement agencies the authority to detain and deport undocumented border crossers, despite court rulings that have established that that power belongs to the federal government.",
      "Democrats and progressive groups have described the measure as effectively resurrecting controversial 2010 anti-illegal immigration legislation. And voting rights groups have argued it is designed to galvanize conservative turnout and counter enthusiasm for the state\u2019s abortion rights proposal.",
      "Economy and crime",
      "Several states will also allow voters to decide on an array of proposals related to economic issues and crime.",
      "California voters will be asked whether they approve of gradually raising the state\u2019s minimum wage to $18 per hour, while voters in Alaska and Missouri will be asked whether they approve of gradually raising it to $15 per hour.",
      "In Arizona, voters will decide on a constitutional amendment that would effectively revise the rules for a minimum wage for tipped workers.",
      "In Colorado, voters will decide on a list of amendments that would cap property tax revenues for local districts, while voters in Washington state will decide whether state employees may opt out of coverage of various insurance programs.",
      "And in California, voters will determine the fate of a ballot measure that would raise criminal penalties for many drug-related crimes."

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 10:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Sheriff Dar Leaf and other \"constitutional sheriffs\" have become prominent figures in the election denial movement, and among the most dangerous, critics say.",
    "story": [
      "A few months after Election Day 2020, a sheriff\u2019s deputy and a second man walked into the office of the Rutland Charter Township clerk in southwest Michigan. Clad in dress clothes, the man identified himself as a private investigator and said he was conducting a criminal investigation into election fraud.",
      "\u201cIt was kind of a shock,\u201d recalled the clerk, Robin Hawthorne. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any discrepancies. We passed the canvass with flying colors, so it was like, \u2018What are they doing here?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hawthorne is a Republican in a solid-red township of 4,100 people. She had been Rutland Charter\u2019s clerk since 2001 and had never encountered anything like this.",
      "Hawthorne answered the private investigator\u2019s questions, she said, as the deputy recorded the conversation on his phone. But when they asked to see her vote-counting machines, she was adamant.",
      "You can look at them, she recalled telling the men, but you can\u2019t touch anything.",
      "They got up to leave instead. But before doing so, Hawthorne said, they insisted that she not mention their visit to anybody to protect the investigation.",
      "\u201cI was like bull crap,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to come in here, grill me like this and I\u2019m not going to find out what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "She soon learned that the deputy and the private investigator had visited other township offices as part of an effort to find evidence of election fraud. And the man responsible for it was the top lawman in the area \u2014 Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf.",
      "Leaf fashions himself as a \u201cconstitutional sheriff.\u201d Sheriffs like him see themselves as holding supreme authority in their counties, exceeding that of state and federal law enforcement officials. They have become prominent figures in the election denial movement, and according to critics, among the most dangerous. \u201cConstitutional sheriffs\u201d believe they have the authority to seize voting machines, assemble armed posses to patrol near polling stations and refuse to enforce any law they view to be unconstitutional.",
      "\u201cThis is vigilantism hiding behind a badge,\u201d said Matt Sanderson, an election lawyer in Washington. \u201cNo official in this country has unchecked power, and it\u2019s absurd to say that a local sheriff of all people would have some constitutional superpower to disregard courts and laws in pursuit of an extralegal agenda.\u201d",
      "Even though efforts to prove election fraud in 2020 fizzled out, constitutional sheriffs have only grown in stature in recent years. Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, said he fears the possibility of one of these sheriffs interfering in the election process in a pivotal state like Michigan or Wisconsin.",
      "\u201cThe worst case scenario is in a key swing state one of these knucklehead sheriffs tries, and somehow succeeds, in seizing ballots or stopping the voting process,\u201d Figliuzzi said. \u201cThat allows Trump to claim victory and then their trained militia members come in and do who knows what.\u201d",
      "Leaf did not respond to phone or email messages seeking comment.",
      "Trump world celebrities",
      "It\u2019s difficult to say how many constitutional sheriffs exist in the U.S. The most prominent group, the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, was founded in 2011 by Richard Mack, a former Arizona sheriff and member of the Oath Keepers militia. He has claimed that 10% of the nation\u2019s 3,000 sheriffs are members, along with 10,000 ordinary citizens.",
      "The group held a conference in Las Vegas last May, drawing a crowd of current and former sheriffs as well as election-denying Trump-world celebrities like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mack delivered a speech in which he called federal and state agencies \u201cthe gestapo of America\u201d and said \u201cthe sheriffs are going to have to stop it.\u201d",
      "The 2020 election has become a central focus. Multiple sheriffs aligned with Mack, including Chris Schmaling of Racine County, Wisconsin, and Calvin Hayden of Johnson County, Kansas, have trumpeted their ongoing election fraud investigations.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got a cyber guy,\u201d Hayden said at a 2022 conference, according to the Associated Press. \u201cI sent him through to start evaluating what\u2019s going on with the machines.\u201d",
      "But perhaps no sheriffs in Mack's group have drawn as much attention as Dar Leaf in Michigan.",
      "Elected in 2003, Leaf first made national headlines a month before the 2020 election when he weighed in on the actions of 13 men charged with plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.",
      "\u201cA lot of people are angry with the governor and they want her arrested,\u201d Leaf told Fox 17 News in Grand Rapids. \u201cSo were they trying to arrest, or was it a kidnap attempt? Because you can still, in Michigan, if it\u2019s a felony, you can make a felony arrest.\u201d",
      "The 2020 election was a seminal moment for Leaf. After Joe Biden was declared the winner, Trump claimed without evidence that the election had been rigged against him.",
      "In Leaf and other members of the constitutional sheriffs movement, Trump attracted allies willing to take action. Leaf worked with Stefanie Lambert, a Detroit lawyer who was part of the Trump team led by Sidney Powell, a conspiracy theory-espousing attorney who filed several frivolous lawsuits alleging widespread voter fraud and rigged machines that flipped votes from Trump to Biden.",
      "Leaf took legal action on his own in early December 2020, seeking an emergency order to stop local clerks from deleting certain election records, as is standard procedure. The chief judge of the federal court in Grand Rapids denied the request in a scathing order.",
      "Leaf and his co-plaintiffs \u201cinvite the court to make speculative leaps toward a hazy and nebulous inference that there has been numerous instances of election fraud and that defendants are destroying the evidence,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cThere is simply nothing of record to infer as much.\u201d",
      "During this period, Doug Van Essen, a lawyer in Grand Rapids, said he received a call from a sheriff in a nearby county with a pointed question: \u201cWould you get Dar off my back?\u201d",
      "The sheriff said Leaf wanted him to talk to an Army colonel who allegedly had evidence of election fraud in one of the reddest counties in the state. Van Essen said he agreed to call the colonel, and then found himself listening to a man spouting nonsense.",
      "Biden garnered 40% more votes than Barack Obama did in the 2008 election, the colonel said, according to Van Essen.",
      "\u201cThat was true,\u201d Van Essen said. \u201cBut this was the fastest-growing county in Michigan, and Trump got 40% more votes than (John) McCain. It was the same percentage.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of so-called evidence they had,\u201d added Van Essen, who considers himself a traditional Republican and Leaf \u201can embarrassment.\u201d",
      "Good ol\u2019 boys",
      "It was in early 2021 that Leaf\u2019s deputy and the private investigator marched into Hawthorne\u2019s office in Rutland Charter Township. Trump had soundly defeated Biden in Barry County, garnering 65% of the vote, but lost the state of Michigan by 154,000 votes.",
      "Leaf\u2019s deputy and private investigator grilled several town clerks and managed to seize one voting machine, according to local reports and the Michigan Attorney General\u2019s Office. He had also sought warrants to seize vote tabulators in Barry County and Woodlawn Township, according to documents obtained by Reuters.",
      "Leaf began touting his election fraud investigation at public events, drawing cheers and applause. He has claimed that \u201cSerbian foreign nationals\u201d remotely accessed voting machines in Michigan, and at other times that Venezuelans had programmed the machines to jam.",
      "For Hawthorne, it\u2019s only brought headaches and dismay.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s stirred up Barry County terrible,\u201d said Hawthorne. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see that people are not trusting me to do my job. That\u2019s a sacred duty of mine and I take it seriously.\u201d",
      "At an event in July 2021, Leaf said he launched the probe after a retired sergeant from his office came to him with \u201csome documentation\u201d from \u201cthe MyPillow guy\u201d \u2014 Lindell, an outspoken election denier and conspiracy theorist.",
      "Leaf added that the voter fraud investigation was the \u201cbiggest task I got going on right now.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping that other sheriffs will catch on, actually get a backbone and do their own investigations,\u201d he said.",
      "Leaf\u2019s has stretched on for four years but has yet to produce clear evidence of fraud or misconduct. In a twist, the sheriff and his associates found themselves under investigation by the state attorney general for their role in a plot to access voting machines across Michigan. In August 2023, three people were charged in the scheme \u2014 including Lambert, the Trump team lawyer Leaf worked with \u2014 but not Leaf himself.",
      "The special prosecutor who brought the case, D.J. Hilson, said in a statement at the time that the decision not to charge Leaf and others was based on an evaluation of the law and \u201ccareful consideration of the totality of the evidence gathered by investigators.\u201d",
      "Lambert, who has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial, said in an email that she didn\u2019t violate the law. She described herself as an attorney who began working for Leaf after the 2020 election.",
      "Leaf, meanwhile, is still focused on digging up election fraud from four years ago but appears to have moved beyond Michigan. Just last week, he posted a memo on his social media pages that said he\u2019s made \u201creferrals for criminal investigation\u201d to the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s still out there talking, blabbering, stirring up the masses,\u201d said Hawthorne, the Rutland Charter clerk. \u201cPeople are coming up here saying they\u2019re sure the machines are flipping the vote.\u201d",
      "Hawthorne said early voting has gone smoothly but she\u2019s worried about the period after the election if Vice President Kamala Harris is declared the winner.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good ol\u2019 boys around here who think what happened on Jan. 6 was great,\u201d Hawthorne said.",
      "The veteran clerk said she\u2019s hoping things remain calm in her little corner of Michigan. But one thing is certain: If there is an emergency, she\u2019s not going to call the sheriff\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m calling the state police,\u201d Hawthorne said. \u201cI don\u2019t trust the Barry County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "FEMA and NOAA have become politicized as the frequency and severity of natural disasters have increased. Their futures hang in the balance of the election. Project 2025, a conservative policy road map, recommends that NOAA be \u201cbroken up and downsized\u201d and that much of the burden for disaster recovery be shifted away from FEMA. Experts and current and former agency officials said such changes could leave the U.S. more vulnerable to extreme weather.",

      "Project 2025, a conservative policy road map, recommends that NOAA be \u201cbroken up and downsized\u201d and that much of the burden for disaster recovery be shifted away from FEMA.",
      "Experts and current and former agency officials said such changes could leave the U.S. more vulnerable to extreme weather.",
      "With the neck-and-neck 2024 election just days away, the futures of the federal agencies responsible for weather forecasting, climate change research and disaster recovery hang in the balance.",
      "Those agencies, namely the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and\u00a0the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), have become increasingly politicized in recent years despite the offices\u2019 history of remaining above the fray. But with natural disasters fueled by climate change now regularly slamming the U.S. \u2014 this year has already seen 24 weather events that each caused at least $1 billion in damage \u2014 the agencies have taken on a greater role. And with it, they\u2019ve become a target for some conservatives who are skeptical of climate change and want to slash government budgets.",
      "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has promised deep cuts to federal budgets, and Elon Musk, one of his most vocal surrogates, said last week that he would cut at least $2 trillion from the budget if he served in a second Trump administration. Project 2025, a 922-page conservative policy road map put together by the Heritage Foundation, a right-leaning think tank, recommends that NOAA be \u201cbroken up and downsized\u201d and takes aim at FEMA, suggesting that much of the financial burden for disaster recovery be shifted to state and local governments.",
      "That could dramatically change what disaster relief looks like in the United States.",
      "\u201cIt almost becomes unthinkable that states would ever be able to recover without long, costly recovery periods that would come out of state and local budgets,\u201d said Craig Fugate, who served as FEMA\u2019s administrator under the Obama administration.",
      "It\u2019s not entirely clear what a second Trump administration would mean for FEMA or NOAA. Trump has publicly distanced himself from Project 2025, even though many of its authors were advisers of his. Trump campaign officials told NBC News in emails that \u201cProject 2025 has NOTHING to do with President Trump or his campaign\u201d and that only the president \u201cand not any other organization or former staff represent policies for the second term.\u201d The campaign did not respond to follow-up questions about its plans for NOAA and FEMA.",
      "FEMA has already become the target of scrutiny and criticism from some Republican leaders in the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Trump and several other prominent Republicans went as far as pushing false claims about FEMA money going to immigrants in the U.S. illegally. At the same time, rampant misinformation about the two storms led meteorologists to become the target of threats despite the remarkable accuracy of their forecasts.",
      "Those forecasts might cease to be freely available to the public or state governments if Project 2025\u2019s recommendations are implemented, as NOAA oversees the National Weather Service.",
      "In interviews, academic experts and current and former agency officials said that even an agenda partially informed by the conservative road map could leave the U.S. more vulnerable to extreme weather, in a world in which major disasters have already become more intense and frequent.",
      "Currently, FEMA aid covers at least 75% of the cost of major disasters, but Project 2025\u2019s proposals would reduce that share to as little as 25%.",
      "Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., who served as Florida\u2019s Director of Emergency Management under Gov. Ron DeSantis from 2019 to 2021, said that limiting relief aid could turn some communities into ghost towns. He pointed to Hurricane Michael, which hit Florida in 2018 as a Category 5 storm.",
      "\u201cThose areas would not have recovered but for the fact that the federal government came in and paid for the response and for the recovery efforts,\u201d Moskowitz said.",
      "The hardest-hit areas that benefited most from the federal aid, he added, \u201cvoted for Donald Trump, voted for Rick Scott, voted for Ron DeSantis.\u201d",
      "Since hurricanes Helene and Milton, the federal government has approved more than $1.2 billion in aid for recovery efforts, according to FEMA. That includes more than $185 million in assistance for 116,000 North Carolina households and over $413 million for more than 125,000 households in Florida, where both storms made landfall.",
      "If Project 2025\u2019s proposals had been in place during Helene, Fugate said, they would likely have resulted in \u201cmore loss of life, much slower response and very little financial assistance to help communities recover.\u201d",
      "Project 2025 recommends that NOAA be \u201cdismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.\u201d",
      "Matthew Sanders, the acting deputy director of the Environmental Law Clinic at Stanford University, said that privatizing weather forecasting could lead companies\u2019 profits to be valued over providing a robust public service, which could compromise the quality of forecasts.",
      "\u201cThere is an important role for a neutral, centralized government agency to play that private companies cannot or will not play in this space,\u201d Sanders said.",
      "Matthew Burgess, an assistant professor in the College of Business at the University of Wyoming, said privatizing weather forecasting could also create situations in which state or local governments with more resources get access to better quality forecasts, while those with fewer means get left in the dark. Or, he said, a region at higher risk for hurricanes or tornadoes could be forced to pay more for those forecasts.",
      "\u201cRight now Florida gets their hurricane forecasts from the federal government for free,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cIf we privatize that, the private sector probably does operate more efficiently, on average, but is that going to be offset by an incentive to price gouge? Because basically, when you\u2019re about to have a hurricane, you really need that forecast, and you\u2019re going to pay whatever they charge.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the Heritage Foundation said: \u201cProject 2025 does not call for the elimination of NOAA or the NWS. The claim is false and ridiculous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a distinction between privatization and commercialization,\u201d the statement added. \u201cUsing commercial products to provide a better result for taxpayers at a lower cost is nothing new.\u201d",
      "Beyond its proposals for particular agencies, Project 2025 also calls for the disbanding of federal climate change research. But understanding climate change's effects is an integral part of forecasting, particularly for storms, since warmer oceans are driving more rapid intensification of hurricanes and a warmer atmosphere makes them capable of dumping more rain.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why everybody gets up each and every day to come in here and do their research so that people are better prepared ... to make decisions that are critical for them and their families,\u201d said DeNa Carlis, director of NOAA\u2019s National Severe Storms Laboratory.",
      "Ending climate research would leave the U.S. more vulnerable to its consequences, Fugate said.",
      "\u201cJust because you don\u2019t like the answer doesn\u2019t mean the information isn\u2019t important,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we prepare ourselves if we ignore what is coming?\u201d",
      "Amid the growing lack of faith in government institutions, Sanders said, major cuts to research or to weather or disaster agencies could further erode trust.",
      "\u201cClimate change is a very unique problem in that, like most environmental problems, it doesn\u2019t respect our political boundaries and it doesn\u2019t respect our state boundaries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need centralized federal agencies to respond to climate change, agencies that can handle big, significant, multistate disasters at the appropriate scale.\u201d"

      "Israel announced Sunday that it carried out a special ground operation in Syria \"in recent months,\" the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement.",
      "The IDF also said it detained an \"Iranian terror network operative\" during the mission, whom it identified as Ali Soleiman al-Assi. It accused the man of gathering intelligence about IDF troops along the border and transferred him to Israel for interrogation.",
      "The IDF said al-Assi's arrest \"prevented a future attack and led to the exposure of the operational methods of Iranian terror networks located near the Golan Heights.\"",
      "\"The IDF will continue to operate to defend the sovereignty of the State of Israel and will not allow Iranian proxies in southern Syria to operate and threaten Israeli civilians,\" it said.",
      "Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on targets in government-controlled parts of war-torn Syria in recent years, but it rarely acknowledges or discusses them. The strikes often target Syrian forces or Iranian-backed groups.",
      "Last month, the Israeli military launched aerial strikes on western Syria, the Syrian Defense Ministry said. It added that the strikes hit a military site in Hama and a car assembly plant in Hassia.",

    "summary": "Secret audio, overturned convictions and a jail death: The legal saga of an art dealer\u2019s murder",
    "story": [
      "INDIO, Calif. \u2014\u00a0For people who were close to Cliff Lambert, the still-unresolved legal saga surrounding his brutal killing more than a decade ago has been agonizing.",
      "Lambert, a retired art dealer described by a friend as a \u201crich, gay socialite\u201d in the California desert city of Palm Springs, was fatally stabbed in 2008 in what prosecutors have described as an elaborate plot orchestrated by two grifters \u2014 one who posed as an exiled prince from Nepal and the other who once captured media attention when he accused a prominent San Francisco financier of sexual abuse.",
      "With four accomplices, prosecutors have said, Kaushal Niroula and Daniel Garcia took Lambert\u2019s money, identity and life.",
      "A series of arrests, trials and convictions for murder and other crimes followed. But nearly 16 years after Lambert\u2019s murder, the case remains unfinished.",
      "In 2020, four murder convictions were overturned after illegally recorded courtroom audio revealed that the judge in the proceedings made derogatory and biased comments about two defendants, including remarks suggesting that he hadn\u2019t reviewed filings because of Niroula\u2019s sexual orientation and HIV status.",
      "After a new round of trials that ended in October 2023, all three of the surviving defendants were convicted again. (Niroula was fatally assaulted in jail while awaiting a new trial; two defendants previously pleaded guilty, and their convictions weren\u2019t overturned.) But amid claims of ineffective lawyering, health problems and other issues, two of those defendants \u2014 including Garcia, whom prosecutors have described as the plot\u2019s \u201cidea man\u201d \u2014 haven\u2019t yet been sentenced.",
      "The delays have stoked frustration, anger and charges of bias among Lambert\u2019s friends.",
      "\u201cIf Cliff\u2019s family had a ton of females crying in the courtroom and all that, you bet your ass this would have been over,\u201d said Eddie Mullikin, a friend who was a witness at both trials and spoke exclusively to NBC News. \u201cI think this would have been different if this was a straight person with a straight family.\u201d",
      "\"We need some closure on this,\u201d said another friend, Steven Kilkullen, 59. \u201cWe need to see these terrible people receive their punishment. We need to see them pay for what they did to Cliff.\u201d",
      "A court spokesperson for Riverside County Superior Court Judge Anthony Villalobos, who is presiding over the case, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "A spokesperson for the Riverside County District Attorney\u2019s Office wouldn\u2019t comment. Lawyers for the defendants didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "At an Oct. 11 court hearing for Garcia, 42, and another defendant, David Replogle, 75, the judge agreed to push sentencing back again, this time to November. A prosecutor objected, saying the government couldn\u2019t agree to further delays, but the judge responded: \u201cI\u2019m trying to make sure that Mr. Garcia gets all of his rights.\u201d",
      "A self-made success",
      "Lambert, 74, was originally from the Midwest, and by the time Kilkullen met him in the mid-\u201990s, he\u2019d become wealthy by developing a process for duplicating master artworks, his friend recalled. Lambert was theatrical and gregarious and a celebrity of his own making \u2014 someone who\u2019d come from nothing and become well-known in the art world, Kilkullen said.",
      "Mullikin met Lambert while he was working as a go-go dancer after he arrived in Palm Springs in the mid-2000s with a plan to stay sober. To him, Lambert was a role model because he was a successful gay man who hadn\u2019t died from HIV/AIDS and offered sincere friendship, Mullikin said.",
      "\u201cIt was just a really stunning example of a good friend,\u201d said Mullikin, 55.",
      "Lambert was also lonely. After the sudden death of his partner, he created an online dating profile, according to Robert Hightower, the former Riverside County prosecutor who tried Lambert\u2019s killers the second time. That\u2019s how Lambert met Garcia, then in his mid-20s, and he flew him to Palm Springs in spring 2008, an appeals decision in the case shows.",
      "Mullikin, who met Garcia during the visit, recalled that he seemed like a nice kid who was looking for someone to fund his business.",
      "The realization of what Garcia was really after \u2014\u00a0an investor, not a romantic partner \u2014 prompted Lambert to throw him out, Hightower told the jury last year. Enraged, Garcia stole Lambert\u2019s credit card and upgraded his airline ticket to first-class, Hightower said. Then, he and Niroula began developing a plot to defraud and murder Lambert, the prosecutor said.",
      "A high-profile sex abuse case",
      "Garcia and Niroula had met at a San Francisco bar a few years before, after Niroula saw a magazine story about a lawsuit Garcia filed in 2002 against financier Thomas White, Garcia\u2019s cousin told \u201cDateline.\u201d A separate suit filed the next year in federal court by nearly two dozen young men and boys in Mexico also accused White of sexual abuse.",
      "All of the litigation was handled by a San Francisco lawyer \u2014 David Replogle.",
      "White maintained that the claims were false, but he settled both actions, paying Garcia and another plaintiff $500,000, according to a lawsuit White filed in 2013 related to the allegations. The suit, which didn\u2019t say how much White paid the Mexican plaintiffs, alleges that he was coerced into making the settlements. The plaintiffs and their legal team carried out an \u201corchestrated fraud\u201d to extort him, his suit alleged.",
      "At least four of the 22 boys who accused him had recanted their statements, and one said he\u2019d been paid to fabricate the claim, according to White\u2019s lawsuit.",
      "Garcia hasn\u2019t recanted his account. In a filing the following year, his attorney said White was \u201cengaged in an unrelenting vendetta\u201d against him and accused White of libel.",
      "White, who was imprisoned in Mexico in connection with the allegations, died in custody after he filed the 2013 lawsuit, according to one of his former lawyers, Stuart Hanlon.",
      "Always 'over the top'",
      "Hightower described Niroula as an \u201cexceptionally charming\u201d personality \u2014 someone who falsely claimed to be a prince and liked to appear as a high roller. Tyson Wrensch, who recalled meeting Niroula and Garcia in San Francisco\u2019s Castro neighborhood after his settlement with White, told \u201cDateline\u201d that the pair would arrive in three Lincoln Town Cars to make it appear like \u201ca Secret Service kinda thing.\u201d",
      "Niroula \u201cwould go to the bar and throw down hundreds and buy everybody a drink,\u201d Wrensch said. \u201cEverything was over the top.\u201d",
      "At one point after Niroula and Garcia embarked on the plan to kill Lambert, Niroula texted Garcia: \u201cHoney, everyone believes me until they have been conned,\u201d according to the appeals decision. \u201cSome even after that.\u201d",
      "To help defraud Lambert, they enlisted Garcia\u2019s lawyer from the sex abuse case \u2014 Replogle \u2014 and a Coachella Valley man whom Niroula had a brief relationship with, Hightower said. To carry out the killing, Niroula also recruited a San Francisco bartender and a former cook in the Marines who was the bartender\u2019s roommate, according to the prosecutor.",
      "In November 2008, Niroula \u2014 posing as a lawyer acting on behalf of a deceased art collector and friend of Lambert\u2019s \u2014 called Lambert and said the collector had left him some artwork, according to the appeals decision. All Lambert needed to do was sign documents to get it, the decision says.",
      "\"Cliff Lambert believed it,\u201d Hightower told the jury.",
      "On Dec. 5, while they were having cocktails with Lambert in his home, Niroula let the bartender and the cook in through the kitchen, Hightower said. They fatally stabbed Lambert, rolled him up in a rug and loaded his body into the trunk of his Mercedes, Hightower said.",
      "On their way to the Bay Area, the prosecutor said, they buried Lambert in a shallow grave on a mountain pass north of Los Angeles.",
      "The unraveling",
      "In the weeks after Lambert\u2019s death, the group fabricated powers of attorney in Lambert\u2019s name, drained roughly $200,000 from his bank account and met with a pair of real estate agents in an effort to sell his home, the prosecutor said.",
      "But by January, the conspiracy had begun to unravel after the bartender returned with a moving truck. He was arrested after concerned neighbors dialed Palm Springs police, Hightower said.",
      "Within months, the others had been arrested. Four of them, including Niroula and Garcia, were charged with murder, conspiracy, grand theft and other crimes, court records show.",
      "The former cook confessed to the killing and cooperated with authorities, Hightower said. He pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 25 years, records show. The sixth suspect pleaded guilty to fraud and was sentenced to five years in prison. (He was later released and died in 2021, public records show.)",
      "The four others were convicted of murder at separate trials in 2011 and 2012. They were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.",
      "But in less than a decade, those verdicts and prison terms were thrown out after Niroula made an explosive series of claims in an appeal and other post-conviction filings.",
      "The allegations were linked to secret recordings made on Garcia\u2019s courtroom laptop that captured off-the-record conversations between Judge David Downing and his clerk.",
      "In a comment detailed in a 2016 petition that sought to overturn Niroula\u2019s conviction, Downing\u2019s clerk said the defendant \u201clikes licking envelopes\u201d and noted Niroula\u2019s HIV-positive status. The judge responded: \u201cEwww lord knows where his tongue has been and for that very reason I don\u2019t like to touch or read anything he gives me and I deny everything as I don\u2019t read it. It\u2019s a tough world folks,\u201d the petition says.",
      "In another comment, the petition says, Downing used an expletive to describe the defendants and said they \u201ccan file anything they want, but I won\u2019t grant any important motions. I have given them just enough money so no court will believe I was biased but besides that let the DA hang them.\u201d",
      "During a private meeting with Garcia at which the defendant confronted the judge about the recordings, Downing said he was protected by the First Amendment and had treated everyone in the case appropriately, according to the appeals decision.",
      "Downing\u2019s California law license has been listed as inactive since 2013, state records show. A message left on a phone number listed under his name wasn\u2019t returned.",
      "On May 15, 2020, the Riverside County prosecutor\u2019s office said it didn\u2019t oppose new trials to \u201cprevent even an appearance of impropriety,\u201d case filings show. Less than a month later, a judge overturned the four murder convictions and set the cases for retrial.",
      "To Mullikin, who had reported Lambert missing and testified at the trial, the entire experience of dealing with his friend\u2019s murder and its aftermath was surreal and overwhelming \u2014 like \u201ca nightmare soap opera,\u201d he said.",
      "When he learned why the convictions were reversed, Mullikin said, he wasn\u2019t angry at the judge \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m a gay man in the United States; we are insulted, f\u2014-- with and, our entire lives, you learn to just move past these people,\u201d he said \u2014 and he didn\u2019t believe Downing\u2019s comments exonerated the defendants.",
      "\"That doesn\u2019t excuse you from this,\u201d Mullikin said. \u201cYou still murdered my friend.\u201d",
      "Where the cases stand",
      "On Sept. 6, 2022, while he was awaiting retrial at a Riverside County jail, Niroula was beaten and strangled to death by another inmate, according to a wrongful death lawsuit Niroula\u2019s family filed last year. The suit accuses the county sheriff\u2019s office of allowing Niroula \u2014 who at the time of the killing identified as a transgender woman, according to the suit \u2014 to be preyed upon by a man officials understood to be a violent predator.",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office denied the allegations, a filing shows, and the case is ongoing.",
      "In 2022, Replogle was retried and convicted of murder and other crimes. The next year, the bartender\u2019s retrial also ended with a guilty verdict, as did Garcia\u2019s retrial four months later. Yet only the bartender has been sentenced. Last November, he was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.",
      "The delays in sentencing Garcia and Replogle stem in part from their legal representation. Since their convictions, both defendants have parted ways with the lawyers who represented them at trial, and at the Oct. 11 hearing, Replogle sought to have a newly appointed attorney thrown off the case over what he described as \u201ca conflict.\u201d",
      "Villalobos, the judge, denied the request, saying it had taken a long time to find the new lawyer.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be no more playing games,\u201d he said.",
      "Garcia, meanwhile, initially sought to represent himself but then requested a new lawyer. A representative for that attorney appeared at the Oct. 11 hearing and reported having obtained only half of the 11,000 pages of transcripts from Garcia\u2019s second trial.",
      "In court hearings and filings, Garcia has raised other issues, as well, including that he hasn\u2019t been provided accommodations compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. In a 2022 petition, Garcia said he has a rare genetic disorder that causes extreme sensitivity to sunlight.",
      "That and other matters would be discussed at a Nov. 13 hearing, the judge said last month.",
      "Lambert\u2019s friend Kilkullen remains baffled that the judge keeps delaying the sentencing hearings.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t understand for the life of me: Why is he giving more time?\u201d Kilkullen said. \u201cI personally am ready for this closure, and I need to know that the court places value on Cliff\u2019s life, on Cliff as a human being, on the experience that he went through with these people. I am tired of feeling like the court values these criminals more than the person that they did this to.\u201d",
      "Tim Stelloh reported from Alameda, California. David Ketterling reported from Indio."

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 23:22:13 GMT",
    "summary": "The Carolina signal-caller completed 16 of his 26 passes for 171 yards, a touchdown and interception in a victory against New Orleans.",
    "story": [
      "Given a second chance to resuscitate his young career, Bryce Young produced something equally as rare during Week 9 of the NFL season \u2014 a victory for the Carolina Panthers.",
      "Young, the No. 1 overall pick of the 2023 NFL draft, who was benched earlier this season after just 18 career starts, led Carolina on a game-winning drive to beat New Orleans 23-22.",
      "After the Panthers took over with 3:26 left in the fourth quarter trailing 22-17, Young threw a pair of incompletions before he found Xavier Legette for 26 yards. On the next play, Young threw the ball high downfield, inducing a pass interference penalty that moved the ball 16 yards from the end zone. Panthers running back Chuba Hubbard scored on the next play, and Young was sacked on the two-point conversion.",
      "The drive ended a day in which Young completed 16 of his 26 passes for 171 yards, with a short touchdown to Legette and an interception in which Legette initially caught the pass, only for a Saints defensive back to rip the ball away. The outing wasn\u2019t spectacular \u2014 his 61% completion rate was only a tick higher than his 59% career average \u2014 but it was efficient, and it ended with a clutch victory over a team that had beaten the Panthers 47-10 in Week 1 while making Young look overwhelmed.",
      "For Young, who is now 3-17 as a starter, that counts as progress.",
      "The win ended the Panthers\u2019 five-game home losing streak, dating to last season.",
      "Carolina traded up to select Young out of Alabama first overall in 2023 and quickly installed him as the franchise\u2019s face and starter. But in September, after just 18 starts and paltry production, he was benched in favor of veteran backup Andy Dalton. His struggles were magnified by the contrast between him and Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud, who was drafted immediately after him and found early success as he led the Texans to the playoffs as a rookie.",
      "In September, four teams inquired about trading for Young after he was benched, according to Fox\u2019s Jay Glazer, but were told Carolina would not consider a trade. Glazer added the Panthers \u201cstill think there\u2019s a future here.\u201d",
      "That future arrived last week, when Dalton sprained a thumb in a car accident, bringing Young back into the lineup before a loss to Denver in which he completed 64% of his passes and threw two touchdowns but also two interceptions.",
      "Young is yet another reminder that being a high draft pick alone \u2014 even one a team has given up assets to trade for \u2014 doesn\u2019t provide career insulation in the NFL. This week, Indianapolis benched quarterback Anthony Richardson, the fourth pick in the same draft as Young, and earlier this season Tennessee sat its own second-year quarterback, Will Levis, who was a second-round pick in 2023.",
      "First- and second-round quarterbacks who don\u2019t pan out in their first homes often get more opportunities elsewhere, such as Sam Darnold, thriving in Minnesota after stumbling with the New York Jets and the Panthers, or Baker Mayfield in Tampa Bay following time in Cleveland and Carolina. Less common is the benched starter who returns to earn full favor within an organization that had lost enough confidence to initially sit him. Young appears to have that opportunity now."

    "story": [
      "A tropical disturbance in the Caribbean is likely to become a hurricane as it passes over Cuba and into the Gulf of Mexico by midweek, federal forecasters said Sunday.",
      "Residents of the west coast of Florida and other Gulf Coast states should monitor developments and expect at least heavy rain later in the week, the National Hurricane Center said in a series of updates and forecast discussions.",
      "Potential Tropical Cyclone 18 is about 345 miles south of Kingston, Jamaica, the hurricane center said in a 7 p.m. update, and moving northeast at 7 mph. Sustained winds of 35 mph have been recorded, it said.",
      "The Air's Force 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, using Super Hercules fixed-wing aircraft, got a close look Sunday, the hurricane center said in an afternoon forecast discussion.",
      "\"Their data\u00a0indicates that the system has developed a closed center,\" it said, indicating the storm is organizing.",
      "Still, the upward movement of warm air and precipitation wasn't intense enough to call the disturbance a tropical depression, the hurricane center said. That would most likely come overnight, it said.",
      "Hurricane formation likely",
      "Hurricane center forecasters said there was a 100% chance the disturbance would become at least a tropical depression and a 100% chance it would strengthen after that during the week.",
      "Wind speeds for a tropical depression max out at 38 mph. At 39 mph it becomes a tropical storm, which could happen early Tuesday, according to hurricane center forecasts.",
      "The system is likely to organize into a hurricane, which would require sustained winds of at least 74 mph, by early Tuesday afternoon and remain one when it reaches Cuba on Tuesday or Wednesday, the center said.",
      "But its strengthening could pause as it reaches the Gulf of Mexico, where drier air would work against it, the center said.",
      "\u201cIntrusions of dry air should end the\u00a0strengthening process and likely induce some weakening,\" it said in an afternoon forecast discussion.",
      "By the time it reaches the northern Gulf Coast, it could have weakened to a tropical storm, the center said, noting that there are uncertainties in the long-range forecast.",
      "If the system forms into a hurricane, it will be the 11th of the 2024 season in the Atlantic, Colorado State University meteorologist Philip Klotzbach said on X. Names available for the system include Rafael and Sara, according to the hurricane center.",
      "Storm threats",
      "In the meantime, the hurricane center said, hurricane conditions are possible within 48 hours on the Cayman Islands. Jamaica was under a tropical storm warning, which means winds of 39 to 73 mph should be expected in 24 to 36 hours.",
      "The northward storm was expected to move near Jamaica on Monday and the Cayman Islands on Tuesday, federal forecasters said. It could bring coastal flooding from a storm surge and heavy rainfall of up to 9 inches, they said.",
      "High surf will also be possible in the western Caribbean through at least midweek, the forecasters said.",
      "Warm water as fuel",
      "U.S. forecasters expect it to shift its north-northeast movement to the north-northwest and enter the Gulf of Mexico through the Yucat\u00e1n Channel before it heads toward the Gulf Coast later in the week.",
      "It's still uncertain where Potential Tropical Cyclone 18 would aim once it is inside the Gulf, which has experienced extreme average sea surface temperatures that peaked at roughly 88 degrees in August and remain warm at around 75 degrees this month.",
      "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration experts say storms prefer sea surface temperatures of at least 80 degrees to form into hurricanes.",
      "Tropical cyclones are fueled by warm sea water, which encourages vertical movement of warm air that helps the storms spin counterclockwise as they spit out rain and wind.",
      "\u201cWhen the surface water is warm, the storm sucks up heat energy from the water, just like a straw sucks up a liquid,\u201d according to a NOAA video about how tropical storms form.",
      "Gulf water temperatures have consistently tracked a few degrees higher than average since summer, according to data posted to X by Kim Wood, an atmospheric sciences professor at the University of Arizona.",
