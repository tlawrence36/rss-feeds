      "The debate over abortion rights is leading to expensive campaigns for state Supreme Courts in several states this year",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Abortion and reproductive rights have been central to the races for president and governor in North Carolina, a battleground state that has more moderate abortion restrictions than elsewhere across the South.",
      "That's been even truer in the fight for a seat on the state Supreme Court that abortion rights supporters say will play an important role in determining whether Republicans can enact even more restrictions. Registered Republicans currently hold five of seven seats and could expand that majority even further in Tuesday's election.",
      "Justice Allison Riggs, a Democrat who is running for reelection, is focusing heavily on the issue and touts her support for reproductive rights. Her first television ad featured images of Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the Republican nominee for governor, who prefers to restrict abortions earlier than the current 12 weeks. She says her GOP rival for the court could be a deciding vote on the bench for such restrictions.",
      "\u201cThis is an issue that is landing in front of state Supreme Courts, and it is one that is very salient to voters now,\u201d Riggs said in an interview.",
      "Her Republican opponent, Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin, said Riggs is saying too much about an issue that could come before the court.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an inappropriate manner, a clear violation of our judicial standards, our code of conduct,\u201d he said.",
      "The North Carolina race emphasizes how much abortion is fueling expensive campaigns for Supreme Courts in several states this year. Groups on the right and left are spending heavily to reshape courts that could play deciding roles in legal fights over abortion, reproductive rights, voting rights, redistricting and other hot-button issues for years to come.",
      "Experts say the campaigns show how the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning constitutional abortion protections that had been in place for half a century has transformed races for state high courts.",
      "\u201cWhat Dobbs did was made clear to both political stakeholders and the public that these state courts that hadn't got a lot of attention are actually going to be really important and they're going to be deciding some of the biggest cases that people might have expected to go to the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the judiciary program at the Brennan Center, which has tracked spending on state court races.",
      "Thirty-three states are holding elections for 82 Supreme Court seats this year. The 2024 election cycle follows record-breaking spending for judicial races in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania last year.",
      "Groups on the left have ramped up their spending on state courts considerably this year. The American Civil Liberties Union has spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.",
      "\u201cWe have never invested this heavily in state Supreme Courts before,\u201d said Katie Rodihan, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Votes. \u201cThis is really a groundbreaking move for us, and I expect this will be the norm for us moving forward.\u201d",
      "The targets include Ohio, where Republicans hold a 4-3 majority on the court. Democrats are defending two seats on the court, while a third is open, and Democratic victories in all three races are considered a longshot in the Republican-leaning state.",
      "Control of the court could be key if the state appeals a judge's ruling that struck down the most far-reaching of the state's abortion restrictions. The ruling said the law banning most abortions once cardiac activity is detected \u2014 as early as six weeks into pregnancy and before many women know they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 violated a constitutional amendment approved by voters last year that protected reproductive rights.",
      "Two seats are up for election on Michigan's court, where Democratic-backed justices hold a 4-3 majority. Court races are technically nonpartisan, but candidates are nominated at party conventions. Republicans would need to win both seats to flip the court in their favor.",
      "Justice Kyra Harris Bolden is defending the seat she was appointed to two years ago by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Bolden was the first Black woman to sit on Michigan\u2019s bench. She faces Republican-backed circuit court Judge Patrick O\u2019Grady for the remaining four years of the eight-year term.",
      "Republican state Rep. Andrew Fink is competing against University of Michigan law professor Kimberly Anne Thomas, who was nominated by Democrats, for the other open seat that is being vacated by a Republican-backed justice.",
      "Michigan voters already have locked abortion rights in the state constitution, though groups backing Bolden and Thomas are framing the races as crucial to defending those rights, with one group\u2019s ad warning that \u201cthe Michigan state Supreme Court can still take abortion rights away.\u201d",
      "The most heated races are for two seats on the Montana Supreme Court, which has come under fire from GOP lawmakers over rulings against laws that would have restricted abortion access or made it more difficult to vote.",
      "Former U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerry Lynch is running against county attorney Cory Swanson for chief justice, while state judge Katherine Bidegaray is running against state judge Dan Wilson for another open seat on the court.",
      "Progressive groups have been backing Lynch and Bidegaray. Both said in an ACLU questionnaire that they agreed with the reasoning and holding of a 1999 state Supreme Court ruling that the constitutional right to privacy includes the right to obtain a pre-viability abortion.",
      "Groups on the right have been painting them both as too liberal and echoing national Republicans' rhetoric, with text messages invoking the debate over transgender athletes on women's sports teams.",
      "The Republican State Leadership Committee, a longtime player in state court races, said its Judicial Fairness Initiative planned to spend seven figures in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.",
      "The group's ads are focusing on issues other than abortion. In one touting three Republicans running for Ohio's court, the group shows images of President Donald Trump along with images related to immigration.",
      "A super PAC backed by conservative donor and shipping executive Richard Uihlein also has given to groups involved in state Supreme Court races in Montana and Ohio.",
      "Progressive groups are even focusing attention on longshot states such as Texas, where Republicans hold all the seats on the Supreme Court. They're trying to unseat three GOP justices who were part of unanimous rulings rejecting challenges to the state's abortion ban.",
      "One group, Find Out PAC, has been running digital ads in San Antonio, Dallas and Houston criticizing justices Jimmy Blacklock, John Devine and Jane Bland. In its ad, the group accuses the three of \u201cplaying doctor from the bench.\u201d",
      "In North Carolina, Riggs' campaigning on abortion rights has prompted complaints from Republicans who say she's stepping outside the bounds of judicial ethics. But Riggs said she's not saying how she would rule in any case and is merely sharing her values with voters.",
      "\u201cI'm going to keep talking about my values because, at the core, our democracy works best when people cast informed votes,\u201d she said.",

      "Former Police Chief Alicia Ford did not address the specific reasons for the Thursday resignations, but wrote in a social media post that the decision was difficult.",
      "\u201cIt is with great sadness that I and the rest of the Geary police officers will no longer be serving this community,\u201d Ford wrote, \u201cbut it was the right decision for me and the other officers.\u201d",

      "Ford did not immediately return a phone message for comment on Saturday.",
      "A woman who answered a phone call to a number listed for Mayor Waylan Upchego on Saturday said \u201cnot at this time\u201d when a reporter asked to speak with Upchego about the resignations.",

      "Miller did not immediately return a phone call to a number listed for her.",
      "The city did not identify the interim chief, but JJ Stitt \u2014 who described himself as a 27-year law enforcement veteran, as a county deputy, a member of a task force investigating internet crimes against children and a distant cousin of Gov. Kevin Stitt \u2014 told The Oklahoman that he is the interim chief.",
      "Stitt did not return a phone call to a number listed for him, but told the newspaper that he hopes to add officers in the coming days. He said he has \u201cthe ability\u201d to pick up the phone and get experienced officers over to the town to help out.",
      "\u201cI've been in the game a long time,\u201d Stitt said.",
      "The resignations come more than a year after the entire police department of the small town of Goodhue, Minnesota, resigned over low pay."

      "Conservationists and a Native American tribe are suing to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources",
      "RENO, Nev. -- Conservationists and a Native American tribe are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources.",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.",
      "The new lawsuit says the Interior Department\u2019s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat was \u201cin danger of extinction now\u201d when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.",
      "\u201cOne cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,\u201d said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno.",
      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",
      "Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and \u201cvigorously defend\u201d approval of the project, \u201cwhich was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d"

James Comer, the Republican chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, and House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik demanded the White House produce the records.

      "Biden created an uproar earlier this week with his remarks to Latino activists responding to racist comments at a Trump rally made by the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to the U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "Biden, according to a transcript prepared by the official White House stenographers, told the Latino group on a Tuesday evening video call, \u201cThe only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters \u2014 his \u2014 his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it\u2019s un-American.\u201d",
      "The transcript released by the White House press office, however, rendered the quote with an apostrophe, reading \u201csupporter\u2019s\u201d rather than \u201csupporters,\u201d which aides said pointed to Biden criticizing Hinchcliffe, not the millions of Americans who are supporting Trump for president."

      "ERIE, Pa. -- It wasn\u2019t much when he bought it, but Michael Hooks has made the old garage his own haven. And the city of Erie knows it. Half a dozen cars honk as they pass by one October afternoon, the people hanging out of car windows to wave hello at him.",
      "About a dozen cars await servicing in the shop as a dog Hooks adopted the day before barks in its new cage. Exercise equipment, motorcycles and power tools abut the kitchen on the side of the renovated building where his wife cooks a meal. At 6 feet, 2 inches, and with a sturdy build, Hooks has a graying beard and a head of curls he says could be laced with snow flurries by this time of year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got to be one of the only Black businesses on this street,\u201d he says, noting that his repair shop stands on Peach Street, one of the city's main traffic arteries. He appreciates the greetings from passersby. But he says many people who know him from the neighborhoods where he grew up will never step foot in the shop. Almost all his customers are white.",
      "Hooks, 58, is a member of a coveted demographic in this year's election \u2014 a Black man and a business owner in a swing state. Both presidential campaigns have targeted Black entrepreneurs with their messaging, offering a range of economic policies and legislation that each side says will boost the careers and lives of African Americans.",
      "How Erie business owners and voters such as Hooks view each candidate's economic vision could determine control of the White House. Erie County has gone for the candidate who won Pennsylvania in every presidential election since 1992. Both Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris have visited the city of 94,000 in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cErie is a pivot point,\u201d said Rhonda Matthews, co-founder of Erie Black Wall Street, a business group that supports local Black entrepreneurs. From population rates to business startups, the future of Erie's economy and politics have shown where the country may be heading. \u201cI think if you want to know about what's happening economically writ large in the country, you can look and see what's happening in Erie.\"",
      "Harris has rolled out a series of economic proposals meant to tackle affordability and boost small businesses. Trump has stressed his promise of sweeping tariffs, new corporate tax cuts and an unprecedented crackdown on illegal and legal immigration to the country.",
      "Local leaders are weighing the impact of each agenda on their plans to renew the Rust Belt.",
      "\u201cA lack of predictability would be the worst possible thing,\u201d said Drew Whiting, CEO of the Erie Downtown Development Corporation, which is directing more than $100 million in private investment to the downtown area.",
      "Whiting praised federal policies such as Qualified Opportunity Zones, which are meant to spur economic development in low-income communities and were created as part of the Trump administration\u2019s 2017 tax overhaul, as well as the investments in Erie enabled by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law spearheaded by Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "But Whiting added that \u201cbroad brush\u201d policies such as Trump\u2019s proposed 20% tariffs on all foreign goods threatened to be \u201can inflation bomb that would crush small businesses\u201d like those he works with. Whiting viewed Harris\u2019 proposed investments for small businesses to be a potential boon. A no tax on tips policy, which both Harris and Trump favor, would be a welcome innovation for workers, he said.",
      "The Harris campaign has zeroed in on affordability as a key concern of voters amid rising inflation. Her proposals to punish companies that gouge prices and her promises to expand support for health care and child care are issues where the campaign believes they can lower costs for working families. Trump, by contrast, would lower the corporate tax rate to 15%, extend his tax cuts and further cut other individual and family taxes, including by eliminating taxes on Social Security.",
      "Most mainstream economists agree that Trump\u2019s proposals would worsen inflation.",
      "Local business owners who spoke with The Associated Press expressed cautious optimism about Harris\u2019 proposals to support small businesses, though most were largely skeptical about the impact that federal policy could have on their lives.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just so many factors, things to consider from right here and global factors,\u201d said Gus Paliouras, owner of New York Lunch, a local diner. Paliouras\u2019 family immigrated to the United States from Greece and bought the diner in 1970, when it was one of dozens of bustling businesses on top of a post office, school and church. Now Paliouras\u2019 diner is the only storefront left on the block.",
      "\u201cI try to keep it like Geneva in here,\u201d he said, referring to the city in famously neutral Switzerland. \u201cIn this town, we could have Trump, Kamala and Kennedy supporters sitting right next to each other at the bar.\u201d Independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was in the race until August, when he suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump.",
      "Hooks considers himself a survivor.",
      "Born and raised in Erie, Hooks grew up in poverty and with few options, support or direction for his life. At 23, he was sentenced to 30 years for dealing marijuana. He served eight years in prison, an experience he described as \u201cthe best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d",
      "Prison was the first place Hooks was exposed to scripture \u2014 the Bible and Quran \u2014 as well as stories about travel, business and history.",
      "While he has transformed his circumstances and overcome \u201ctrials and tribulations that made me a better man,\u201d he finds the distinctions that some draw between poor, working and middle-class people to be meaningless.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s because we have people in this country that want to be better than someone else,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cYou drive a Toyota Camry, I drive the Lexus. It\u2019s the same ... car. It\u2019s just a different name, but it\u2019s a higher status.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor example, (Harris) says she wants to give us a $50,000 tax break or whatever,\u201d he added, referring to the vice president\u2019s proposed tax credit for new small businesses. \u201cBut that could never come into fruition with people that think they better than somebody, but you live next door to me, and your sign says Trump.\u201d",
      "In addition to his car care company, Hooks now runs a food catering business. On the weekends he goes back to the neighborhoods where he grew up to feed, clothe and cut hair for kids for free. His charity efforts are focused on making sure children never have the experiences he once faced.",

      "Ameen Hurst, 20, shackled to a wooden chair, entered the plea Friday to 28 counts \u2014 including four counts of third-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder as well as escape, conspiracy and firearms crimes, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.",
      "Hurst was arrested at age 16 in 2021 and charged in four killings and two armed robberies. Law enforcement authorities said he was affiliated with two allied Philadelphia gangs responsible for a wave of violence.",

He said, however, that it was \"difficult to imagine that four young lives were extinguished by somebody who was 16 years old. That\u2019s a tragedy in and of itself.\u201d",

      "GASTONIA, N.C. -- GASTONIA, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump will rally supporters in North Carolina every day until Tuesday's election, a flurry of late activity in the only swing state that he won in both his 2016 and 2020 campaigns.",
      "Even as Trump looks to expand the electoral map and project strength with trips to New Mexico and Virginia, two Democratic states not widely viewed as competitive, he is putting considerable time into North Carolina, which last backed a Democrat for president in 2008.",
      "The former president's path to the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency gets significantly more complicated if he loses North Carolina. The fast-growing Southern state gave Trump his smallest margin of victory \u2014 1.3 percentage points \u2014 over Democrat Joe Biden four years ago.",
      "Trump campaigned in Gastonia, west of Charlotte, and Greensboro on Saturday, with a stop in Salem, Virginia, in between. He will be in the eastern city of Kinston on Sunday and in Raleigh on Monday. Those four rallies will bring his total events in North Carolina since Oct. 1 to nine. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has been in the state six times during the same period, most recently on Friday.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic rival, also was in North Carolina on Saturday for a concert and rally in Charlotte. Her campaign has not announced any other travel to the state before Election Day, though she's sending her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, to Greenville on Monday.",
      "The extensive damage from Hurricane Helene across western North Carolina has created a dose of uncertainty about the state of play here. Flooding destroyed homes and displaced residents in several counties, including the liberal city of Asheville and the conservative rural areas surrounding it.",
      "Trump's team has said it is confident about his chances in North Carolina. Democrats see Trump's attention on the state as a signal of optimism for Harris.",
      "\u201cThe repeat appearances may signal Trump\u2019s campaign is in trouble,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Marcia Morey of Durham. \u201cIf Trump continues with his dangerous, violent rhetoric these last few days, it may backfire. A campaign of personal retribution does not win votes from people.\u201d",
      "Trump adviser Jason Miller said Trump's late-campaign travels are not a signal of alarm.",
      "\u201cI'm not worried about anything,\" Miller told reporters Friday. \"We have a smart strategy that's going to get President Trump across 270, maybe even a couple of states that surprise you, that slide in there. But we\u2019re going to follow our strategy. Our strategy comes from our data and our targeting.\u201d",
      "As he does at most of his events in North Carolina, Trump said in Gastonia that his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, whom he installed as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, is from the state, and that Lara and Eric Trump named their daughter Carolina.",

You\u2019ve been through a lot,\u201d Trump said, alluding to the hurricane before repeating a debunked claim that the Federal Emergency Management Agency prioritized people living in the country illegally over hurricane victims. \u201cYour government has not helped you too much, I can tell you. Your government, FEMA, has let you down because they wanted to spend the money on illegal migrants instead.\u201d",
      "Later in Greensboro, only about half of the seats were filled in a massive 22,000-seat arena when Trump started speaking after 9 p.m. Trump spoke at another arena that\u2019s part of the same complex just 11 days earlier, though Harris filled the larger venue when she spoke there recently.",

      "Entering the final days of the campaign, over 50,000 more GOP registered voters than Democrats had voted early or by absentee ballot, even though there are over 100,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans statewide, according to state elections data. It is unclear whether the Republicans' early vote surge will result in a higher overall turnout for Trump supporters.",

      "Harris took the stage in Charlotte after rocker Jon Bon Jovi warmed up the crowd, sticking closely to the speech she's been delivering in her final tour of the battleground states.",
      "Harris supporter Gwen Garnett, 66, said Trump barnstorming North Carolina is \u201cjust part of the process. It does not worry me at all.\u201d She gave Harris\u2019 candidacy a spiritual dimension.",

      "The 2024 presidential contest speeds into its final weekend with Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump locked in a razor-thin contest",
      "NEW YORK -- The 2024 presidential contest speeds into its final weekend with Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump locked in a razor-thin contest.",
      "At this late stage in the campaign, every day matters. And while few voters might change their minds this late in a typical election, there is a sense that what happens in these final days could shift votes.",
      "Harris and Trump are crisscrossing the country to rally voters in the states that matter most. They're trying \u2014 with varying degrees of success \u2014 to stay focused on a clear and concise closing message. At the same time, each side is investing massive resources to drive up turnout for the final early voting period. And in these critical days, the flow of misinformation is intensifying.",
      "Here's what we're watching on the final weekend before Election Day, which is Tuesday:",
      "You only need to look at the candidates' schedules this weekend to know where this election will likely be decided.",
      "Note that schedules can and likely will change without warning. But on Saturday, Trump began with an appearance in North Carolina, with one eyebrow-raising stop in Virginia next, and planned to return to the Tar Heel state in the evening.",
      "No Democratic presidential candidate has carried North Carolina since Barack Obama in 2008, although it has been decided by less than 3 points in every election since. Trump's decision to spend Saturday there suggests Harris has a real opportunity in the state. But Trump is also trying to convey confidence by stopping in Virginia, a state that has been safely in the Democratic column since 2008.",
      "There is perhaps no more important swing state than Pennsylvania, where Trump is expected to campaign Sunday. But he also has another appearance scheduled for North Carolina in addition to Georgia, another Southern state that has leaned Republican for almost three decades \u2014 that is, until Joe Biden carried it by less than a half percentage point four years ago.",
      "Harris campaigned in Atlanta on Saturday before a rally in North Carolina's capital \u2014 signs that her team is sensing genuine opportunity in the South. She\u2019s planning to make multiple stops in Michigan on Sunday, shifting to a Democratic-leaning state in the \u201cblue wall\u201d where her allies believe she is vulnerable.",
      "Trump's campaign leadership wants voters to be focused on one key question as they prepare to cast ballots, and it's the same question he opens every rally with: Are you better off today than you were four years ago?",
      "Harris' team wants voters to be thinking about another: Do they trust Trump or Harris to put the nation's interests over their own?",
      "Whichever candidate can more effectively keep voters focused on their closing arguments in the coming days may ultimately win the presidency. Yet both candidates are off to a challenging start.",
      "Trump opens the weekend still facing the fallout from his recent New York City rally in which a comedian described Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating pile of garbage.\u201d Things got harder for Trump late Thursday after he raised the prospect of Republican rival Liz Cheney's death by gunfire.",
      "It was exactly the kind of inflammatory comment his allies want him to avoid at this critical moment.",
      "Harris' campaign, meanwhile, is still working to shift the conversation away from President Biden's comments earlier in the week that described Trump supporters as \u201cgarbage.\u201d The Associated Press reported late Thursday that White House press officials altered the official transcript of the call in question, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity.",
      "The spotlight of presidential politics always burns brightly. But it will burn brightest, perhaps, this final weekend, leaving the campaigns virtually no margin for error. In what both sides believe is a true tossup election, any final-hours missteps could prove decisive.",
      "Trump's graphic attack against Cheney was especially troublesome given his allies' heightened concerns about women voters.",
      "Polling shows a significant gender gap in the contest with Harris generally having a much better rating among women than Trump has. Part of that may be the result of the GOP's fight to restrict abortion rights, which has been disastrous for Trump's party. But Trump's divisive leadership has also pushed women away.",
      "Going into the weekend, Trump allies, including conservative firebrand Charlie Kirk, are warning that far more women than men appear to be casting early ballots. While it's impossible to know whom they're voting for, Kirk clearly believes that's bad news for Trump.",
      "Trump isn't helping his cause. A day before his violent rhetoric about Cheney, the former president made waves by insisting that he would protect women whether they \u201clike it or not.\u201d",
      "Harris, who would be the nation's first female president, said Trump doesn't understand women\u2019s rights \u201cto make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies.\u201d",
      "It remains to be seen whether the Democrat's argument can break through on this packed weekend. But Harris\u2019 team believes there's still a significant chunk of persuadable voters out there. And they say the undecideds are disproportionately Republican-leaning suburban women.",
      "More than 66 million people have already cast ballots in the 2024 election, which is more than one-third the total number who voted in 2020.",
      "They include significantly more Republicans compared with four years ago, largely because Trump has backed off his insistence that his supporters must cast ballots in person on Election Day.",
      "And while early in-person voting has ended in many states, there will be a huge push for final-hours early voting in at least three key states as the campaigns work to bank as many votes as possible before Election Day.",
      "That includes Michigan, where in-person early voting runs through Monday. Voters in Wisconsin can vote early in-person through Sunday, although it varies by location. And in North Carolina, voters have until 3 p.m. Saturday to cast early ballots in-person.",
      "The early voting period officially ended Friday in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania.",
      "Meanwhile, questions remain about the Trump campaign\u2019s get-out-the-vote operation, which is relying heavily on well-funded outside groups with little experience \u2014 including one group funded largely by billionaire Elon Musk that\u2019s facing new questions about its practices.",
      "Harris\u2019 campaign, by contrast, is running a more traditional get-out-the-vote operation that features more than 2,500 paid staffers and 357 offices in battleground states alone.",
      "Trump's allies appear to be intensifying baseless claims about voter fraud, and some are being amplified by Trump himself. He has spent months sowing doubts about the integrity of the 2024 election in the event he loses \u2014 just as he did four years ago.",
      "His unfounded accusations are becoming more specific, in some cases, as wild claims begin to show up on social media.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump claimed on social media that York County, Pennsylvania had \u201creceived THOUSANDS of potentially FRAUDULENT Voter Registration Forms and Mail-In Ballot Applications from a third party group.\u201d He has also pointed to Lancaster County, which he claimed had been \u201ccaught with 2600 Fake Ballots and Forms, all written by the same person. Really bad \u201cstuff.\u201d\u201d",
      "Trump was referring to investigations into potential fraud related to voter registration applications. The discovery and investigation into the applications provide evidence the system is working as it should.",
      "The Republican nominee has also raised baseless claims about overseas ballots and noncitizens voting, and suggested without evidence that Harris might have access to some kind of secret inside information about election results.",
      "Expect such claims to surge, especially on social media, in the coming days. And remember that a broad coalition of top government and industry officials, many of them Republicans, found that the 2020 election was the \u201cmost secure\u201d in American history.\"",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina had already surpassed its early-voting record set in 2020, but the State Board of Elections announced Sunday that more than 4.2 million voters cast ballots at early in-person voting sites, with turnout in western counties hit by Hurricane Helene outpacing the rest of the state.",
      "Early in-person voting, which ended Saturday, has become increasingly popular in the presidential battleground state over several election cycles. People can simultaneously register to vote and cast ballots at early voting sites.",
      "Four years ago, a record 3.63 million people voted at hundreds of sites in all 100 counties during the early-voting period. This year, the state exceeded that total by Thursday, days before the period ended, the board said.",
      "Including absentee voting, 4,465,548 voters \u2014 or 57% of the state\u2019s 7.8 million registered voters \u2014 cast ballots in the general election as of Sunday morning, officials said, noting that turnout may be slightly higher because of a lag between when ballots are cast and when data is uploaded.",
      "Turnout in the 25 western counties affected by Hurricane Helene was stronger than the rest of the state at 58.9% \u2014 about 2% higher than statewide turnout, officials said.",
      "\u201cI am proud of all of our 100 county boards of elections and the thousands of election workers who are making this happen in their communities,\u201d state board Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell said in a statement. \u201cAnd I am especially proud of the workers and voters of Western North Carolina. You are an inspiration to us all.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s strong early turnout has come partly in response to a push by state and national Republicans to get people to vote early. Their message marks a sharp contrast to the 2020 election, when former President Donald Trump \u2014 without any evidence to back the claim \u2014 said mail-in voting was rife with fraud.",
      "In addition to president, North Carolina residents are choosing a new governor, attorney general and several other statewide positions, along with members of the U.S. House and state General Assembly."

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Warren Buffett is now sitting on more than $325 billion cash after continuing to unload billions of dollars worth of Apple and Bank of America shares this year and continuing to collect a steady stream of profits from all of Berkshire Hathaway's assorted businesses without finding any major acquisitions.",
      "Berkshire said it sold off about 100 million more Apple shares in the third quarter after halving its massive investment in the iPhone maker last quarter. The remaining stake of roughly 300 million shares was valued at $69.9 billion at the end of September remains Berkshire's biggest single investment, but it has been cut drastically since the end of last year when it was worth $174.3 billion.",
      "Investors will also be disappointed to learn that Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its own shares in the quarter.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said shareholders will wonder why Buffett is continuing to accumulate so much cash. \u201cAre they more pessimistic about the future economic and market picture than perhaps others are?\u201d she said.",
      "Buffett said at the annual meeting in May that part of why he started selling some of his Apple shares is that he expects tax rates to go higher in the future. But Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said he wonders if part of the reason Buffett started selling Apple is tied to last year's death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger because the sales started shortly after Munger's death. Shanahan said Buffett has never been as comfortable with technology businesses as his longtime partner was.",
      "\u201cIf Charlie Munger were still alive, perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have sold down the position quite as aggressively \u2014 maybe at all,\u201d Shanahan said.",
      "Berkshire said Saturday that investment gains again drove its third quarter profits skyward to $26.25 billion, or $18,272 per Class A share. A year ago, unrealized paper investment losses dragged the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's earnings down to a loss of $12.77 billion, or $8,824 per Class A share.",
      "Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire\u2019s operating earnings if they want to get a good sense of how the businesses it owns are doing because those numbers exclude investments. Berkshire\u2019s bottom-line profit figures can vary widely from quarter to quarter along with the value of its investments regardless of whether the company bought or sold anything.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire said its operating earnings were only down about 6% at $10.09 billion, or $7,023.01 per Class A share. That compares to last year's $10.8 billion, or $7,437.15 per Class A share.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted that Berkshire would report operating earnings of $7,335.11 per Class A share.",
      "Berkshire's revenue didn't change much at $92.995 billion. A year ago, it reported $93.21 billion revenue. That number was ahead of the $92.231 billion revenue that three analysts surveyed by FactSet predicted.",
      "Berkshire owns an assortment of insurance businesses, including Geico, along with BNSF railroad, several major utilities and a varied collection of retail and manufacturing businesses, including brands like Dairy Queen and See\u2019s Candy.",
      "One of Berkshire's insurers, Guard, reported some additional losses on previous years after managers reassessed its policies.",
      "Berkshire did resolve one mystery from the quarter by spelling out how much it paid to acquire the rest of the shares in its utility business from the estate of former Berkshire board member Walter Scott.",
      "Berkshire said it paid $2.4 billion cash, issued $600 million in debt and gave the Scott family Class B Berkshire shares worth a little over $1 billion. So the total compensation was about $4 billion. That means the Scott family didn\u2019t get nearly as good of a price for their 8% stake in the utilities as when Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel sold his 1% stake in the utility business two years ago for $870 million.",
      "Abel is slated to succeed the 94-year-old Buffett as CEO in the event of his death."

      "Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has approved a revised plan for a massive proposed wind farm after he rejected a slimmed-down version earlier this year",
      "OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has approved a revised plan for a massive proposed wind farm after he rejected a sharply slimmed-down version earlier this year.",
      "Inslee urged permitting officials to work quickly to allow the construction of as many Horse Heaven Wind Farm turbines as possible, The Seattle Times reported. Washington state won't meet its \u201curgent clean energy needs\u201d if officials take years to authorize the turbines, he said.",
      "The original $1.7 billion project included up to 222 wind turbines across 24 miles (38.6 kilometers) of hillsides in the Tri-Cities area of eastern Washington and three solar arrays covering up to 8.5 square miles (22 square kilometers).",
      "But then Washington\u2019s Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, a clearinghouse for permits required by large projects, recommended slashing the proposal in half because nests of the endangered ferruginous hawk were found in the area. It wanted a 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) buffer around each nest.",
      "Most nests were empty, but the hawks can return to them years later.",
      "In May, Inslee rejected the council's recommendation to shrink the project, prompting the panel to suggest a compromise that would examine turbines and nests on a case-by-case basis. Under this plan, which Inslee formally approved Oct. 18, a technical advisory group would recommend whether to reduce individual nest setbacks to 1 kilometer (0.6 mile.)",
      "This could allow the developer, Boulder, Colorado-based Scout Clean Energy, to build all but 30 of the turbines originally proposed.",
      "Inslee, a Democrat, has sought to make climate initiatives key to his legacy. He is not seeking reelection after three terms in office.",
      "The wind farm project has pitted local opponents against the state\u2019s ever-growing need for renewable energy since it was first proposed in 2021. In a letter to the site evaluation council, Inslee noted that Washington\u2019s energy demands could nearly double by 2050."

      "The trial of a man accused of killing two teenage girls in a small Indiana community has passed its midway point following more than two weeks of testimony about the 2017 killings",
      "DELPHI, Ind. -- The trial of a man accused of killing two teenage girls in a small Indiana community has passed its midway point following more than two weeks of testimony about the 2017 killings.",
      "Prosecutors rested their case Thursday against Richard Allen after jurors heard recorded phone calls in which he told his wife that he killed Abigail Williams, 13, and Liberty German, 14.",
      "Allen's trial began Oct. 18 at the Carroll County Courthouse in Delphi, the girls\u2019 hometown. Jurors have been sequestered since the begining of the trial, which is scheduled to run through Nov. 15.",
      "The defense began calling its first witnesses Thursday. A psychologist for the Indiana Department of Correction told jurors Friday that Allen was seriously mentally ill when he began confessing to the killings while housed at the Westville Correctional Facility.",
      "Allen, 52, faces up to 130 years in prison if he is convicted on two counts of murder and two additional counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping.",
      "Here are some key moments in the trial so far:",
      "Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas McLeland opened the trial by telling jurors they would see and hear evidence, including incriminating statements Allen has made, that will convince them he forced the girls off a hiking trail into a secluded area while armed with a gun and cut their throats.",
      "Allen was the person seen on cellphone video German recorded on the day the girls disappeared and an unspent bullet found between their bodies came from Allen's gun, McLeland said.",
      "Defense attorney Andrew Baldwin told jurors Allen is innocent. Baldwin said the jury would hear witness statements and forensic evidence that would raise \u201creasonable doubt\u201d that Allen is not the killer and said the state's timeline does not match the evidence in the case.",
      "Someone else may have kidnapped the teens and returned them early the next day to the scene where they were found dead, Baldwin said.",
      "In the first full week of the trial, jurors were shown photographs of the area where the teens' bodies were found in a wooded area off the hiking trail. The girls, known as Abby and Libby, had crossed an abandoned railroad trestle called the Monon High Bridge during their hike.",
      "Some jurors and others in the courtroom gasped or turned away when gruesome images of their bloody bodies were shown, and the girls' mothers wept.",
      "Jurors also viewed cellphone video that German recorded just before the youths vanished showing a man wearing a blue jacket and jeans following Williams as she crosses the Monon High Bridge.",
      "In an enhanced version of the video shown to jurors, one of the girls says, \u201cThere\u2019s no path so we have to go down here.\u201d Just before the video ends, prosecutors said, the man seen in the video tells the teens, \u201c Down the hill.\u201d",
      "Investigators said in an affidavit released about a month after Allen's October 2022 arrest that he became a suspect after they went back and reviewed \u201cprior tips\u201d and found that he had been interviewed by an officer in 2017.",
      "Trial testimony has revealed more details about how they zeroed in on the former pharmacy worker.",
      "A retired state government worker who volunteered in March 2017 to help police with the investigation told jurors that in September 2022 she found paperwork that caught her eye.",
      "Kathy Shank testified she found a \u201clead sheet\u201d saying that two days after German and Williams\u2019 bodies were found, a man contacted authorities and said he had been on the trail the afternoon the girls went missing. His name was listed incorrectly as Richard Allen Whiteman and marked \u201ccleared,\u201d Shank said.",
      "She determined the man\u2019s name was actually Richard Allen and recalled that a young girl had been on the trail at the same location and time and had seen a man.",
      "\u201cI thought there could be a correlation,\u201d Shank testified, adding that she notified officers of her find.",
      "The girls' bodies were found Feb. 14, 2017, the day after they went missing.",
      "Two days later, Allen contacted authorities and told them he was on the hiking trail the afternoon of Feb. 13, during the time period when the girls disappeared, according to testimony.",
      "Dan Dulin, an Indiana Department of Natural Resources captain, told the court he spoke to Allen, who said he was on the hiking trail between 1 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. and remembered seeing three girls.",
      "After Shank brought Allen to investigators\u2019 attention, they interviewed him in October 2022. Allen told investigators he arrived at the trail around noon and left no later than 2 p.m., not 3:30 p.m. as he told Dulin in 2017.",
      "Steve Mullin, who was Delphi's police chief when the girls were killed and later became an investigator at the county prosecutor\u2019s office, said Allen told him and another officer that he was wearing a blue or black Carhartt jacket, jeans and a beanie on the day the teens vanished.",
      "Mullin said he asked Allen if he was the similarly dressed person seen in German\u2019s cellphone video.",
      "\u201cHis response was if the picture was taken with the girls\u2019 camera, there was no way it was him,\u201d Mullin testified.",
      "Prosecutors also showed jurors police interviews with Allen videotaped before his arrest in which he repeatedly professed his innocence.",
      "On Thursday the jury heard several recorded phone calls of Allen speaking with his wife from prison in which he told her that he killed German and Williams. In one of the calls, he said, \u201cI did it. I killed Abby and Libby.\u201d",
      "The jury heard testimony earlier from the former warden of the Westville Correctional Facility, where Allen was previously held, who said Allen claimed to have killed the girls with a box cutter that he later discarded.",
      "Dr. Monica Wala, Allen\u2019s prison psychologist during his time at Westville, testified Allen began confessing to killing the girls in early 2023 during his sessions with her. She said he provided details of the crime in some of the confessions, including telling her he slashed the girls\u2019 throats and put tree branches over their bodies.",
      "A report written by Wala and presented to the jury as an exhibit states Allen also told her he had planned to rape the teens but did not do so after he saw a van traveling nearby.",
      "A state trooper testified Thursday that Allen's remark corroborated a statement by a man whose driveway passes under the Monon High Bridge and who said he was driving home in his van around that time.",
      "Allen's attorneys have said their client made the incriminating statements while under the pressure and mental stress of being locked up and watched 24 hours a day and being taunted by people incarcerated with him.",
      "During cross-examination, Wala acknowledged she followed Allen\u2019s case with interest during her personal time even while she was treating him and that she was a fan of the true crime genre.",
      "Court documents released weeks after Allen\u2019s arrest state that testing determined an unspent bullet found between the girls' bodies \u201chad been cycled through\u201d a pistol Allen owned.",
      "Melissa Oberg, an Indiana State Police firearms expert, told the jury her analysis tied the round to Allen\u2019s Sig Sauer, a .40-caliber handgun.",
      "Allen\u2019s attorney tried to cast doubt on the accuracy of firearms testing during cross-examination. Oberg said she is not aware of making any identification mistakes in her more than 17 years of analyzing firearms."

      "Firefighters in Massachusetts are continuing to battle stubborn brush fires across the state with officials urging residents to take precautions to help avoid sparking new blazes",
      "BOSTON -- Firefighters in Massachusetts are continuing to battle stubborn brush fires across the state with officials urging residents to take precautions to help avoid sparking new blazes.",
      "Hundreds of acres (hectares) in the greater Boston area have already burned in the past week with new fires cropping up in the western and central parts of the state.",
      "In Massachusetts, an average of 15 wildland fires are reported each October. This year, the month\u2019s total capped at about 200 \u2014 an increase of about 1,200% over the average, rivalling the monthly numbers usually seen in the traditional early spring brush fire season.",
      "About 100 fire were reported over the last seven days of the month and preliminary information indicates that all of them started with human activity, according to fire officials. The fires prompted some communities last week to cancel school classes and Halloween activities.",
      "On Friday, the National Weather Service declared a \u201cred flag\u201d warning for much of eastern Massachusetts. The warning means that the region, which has been experiencing dry and warm weather, is at high risk of fire.",
      "Fire officials have reminded residents that open burning is prohibited statewide through January and in many communities year-round.",
      "They also urged residents to avoid outdoor cooking and heating and to use caution when using power equipment like lawnmowers and leaf blowers. The engines can become hot enough to ignite dry leaves and grass.",
      "Fire officials also cautioned against tossing cigarette butts, matches, or other smoking materials over the edge of a balcony, stub them out on stairs or railings, or toss them in dry vegetation or debris.",
      "On Saturday, a Boston man was arrested in connection to a brush fire in Milford, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. The man was charged with setting fire to another\u2019s land and burning land, trees, lumber and produce.",
      "More than a quarter of this year's brush and wildland fires took place in October, according to Chief Fire Warden David Celino of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. The October fires have also accounted for more than half of the 1,158 acres (469 hectares) burned so far this year.",
      "\u201cThe weather conditions and dry surface fuels that have contributed to these fast-moving fires are expected to continue in the days ahead,\" Celino said in a press release. \"Any outdoor fire will grow quickly, become difficult to control, and require numerous firefighting resources.\u201d",
      "State Fire Marshal Jon Davine said about 45% of Massachusetts homes are in or near wooded areas at risk for brush and wildland fires. Many of those fires have started with activity around the house, like outdoor cooking and using lawn tractors and other power equipment, he added.",

      "U.N. experts say Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have been transformed from a local armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization with support from Iran, Iraqi armed groups, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militants and others",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have been transformed from a local armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization with support from Iran, Iraqi armed groups, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militants and others, U.N. experts said in a new report.",
      "The Iranian-backed Houthis have exploited the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and worked to enhance their status in Iran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d to gain popularity in the region and beyond, the experts monitoring sanctions against the Houthis said in the 537-page report to the U.N. Security Council.",
      "To support Iranian-backed Hamas militants, whose surprise attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, sparked the war in Gaza, the Houthis have been attacking vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, disrupting global shipping in a key geopolitical area.",
      "Despite Houthi claims that they would target ships linked to Israel, the panel said its investigations revealed the rebels have been targeting vessels indiscriminately.",
      "Its analysis of data from the International Maritime Organization, the U.S. and the United Kingdom revealed that at least 134 attacks were carried out from Houthi-controlled areas against merchant and commercial vessels and U.S. and U.K. warships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden between Nov. 15, 2023, and July 31, 2024.",
      "\u201cThe group\u2019s shift to actions at sea increased their influence in the region,\u201d the U.N. experts said. \u201cSuch a scale of attacks, using weapon systems on civilian vessels, had never occurred since the Second World War.\u201d",
      "In their attacks, the experts said, the Houthis used a new and previously undisclosed ballistic missile, the Hatem-2.",
      "The five-member U.N. panel includes experts on arms, finance, regional affairs, international humanitarian law and armed groups. The experts hail from India, Egypt, Switzerland, Belgium and Cabo Verde. Confidential sources told the panel that the Houthis are coordinating operations with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and strengthening ties to the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab militant group in Somalia.",
      "The Houthis have been engaged in a civil war with Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they took control of the capital Sanaa and most of the north. Hopes for peace talks to end the war vanished after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks.",
      "The U.N. experts said the Yemen conflict, which started as an internal fight and expanded into a regional confrontation, \u201chas now escalated into a major international crisis.\u201d",
      "According to the experts, the number of Houthi fighters is estimated at 350,000 now, compared with 220,000 in 2022 and 30,000 in 2015.",
      "\u201cThe panel observes the transformation of the Houthis from a localized armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization, extending their operational capabilities well beyond the territories under their control,\u201d the report said.",
      "The experts said the transformation has been possible due to the transfer of military materiel and training provided by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard\u2019s elite Quds Force, Hezbollah and Iraqi specialists and technicians.",
      "Military experts, Yemeni officials and even officials close to the Houthis indicated that the rebel group couldn\u2019t produce complex weapons systems such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surveillance and attack drones, portable air defense systems, and thermal sights, which they have used without foreign support, the U.N. experts said.",
      "\u201cThe scale, nature and extent of transfers of diverse military materiel and technology provided to the Houthis from external sources, including financial support and training of its combatants, is unprecedented,\u201d the experts said.",
      "The panel said it observed similarities between multiple military items used by the Houthis and those produced and operated by Iran or its allies in the Axis of Resistance, which includes Hezbollah and Hamas and armed groups in Iraq and Syria.",
      "It said joint operations centers have been set up in Iraq and Lebanon with Houthi representatives \u201caimed at coordinating joint military actions of the Axis of Resistance.\u201d",
      "Inside Yemen, the panel said the Houthis have been intensifying military operations against the government. \u201cThe internal military situation is fragile, and any internal or external trigger could lead to the resumption of military confrontations,\u201d it said.",
      "The Houthis also have been recruiting large numbers of Yemeni youths and children as well as exploiting Ethiopian migrants, forcing them to join the fight against the government and engage in trafficking narcotics, it said.",
      "\u201cExploiting high illiteracy rates, particularly in tribal areas, they have reportedly mobilized boys as young as 10 or 11, often despite parental opposition,\u201d they said. \u201cRecruitment sermons and weekly classes on jihad are reportedly delivered in schools.\u201d",
      "Child recruitment reportedly increased after the war in Gaza started and the U.S. and U.K. airstrikes in Yemen, the experts said. Yemen\u2019s government said it received 3,298 reports of child recruitment in the first half of 2024, with youngsters reportedly used as human shields, spies and in combat \u2014 and for planting landmines and explosives, reconnaissance and as cooks."

    "story": [
      "The FBI is investigating the death of a Black man in Alabama who was found hanging in an abandoned house",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- The FBI is investigating the death of a Black man in Alabama, who was found hanging in an abandoned house, following a request from a local sheriff amid fears among community members who accuse local law enforcement of longstanding, unchecked misconduct.",
      "Sheriff's deputies found Dennoriss Richardson, 39, in September in a rural part of Colbert County, miles away from his home in Sheffield, a city of approximately 10,000 people near the Tennessee River.",
      "The Colbert County Sheriff's Office ruled Richardson\u2019s death a suicide. But Richardson\u2019s wife, Leigh Richardson, has said that is not true, explaining her husband did not leave a note and had no connection to the house where he was found.",
      "Instead, the 40-year-old fears her husband\u2019s death was related to a lawsuit he filed against the local police department in February. Dennoriss Richardson, who coached kids in baseball and football, had alleged he was assaulted, denied medical attention, sprayed with tear gas and shocked with a Taser while in jail.",
      "Leigh Richardson said she is not accusing a specific person but is adamant her husband didn't kill himself.",
      "She is not alone in her belief. Widespread skepticism about Richardson\u2019s death underscores deep-seated distrust of local law enforcement in Colbert County. In a region where hanging invokes a long history of state-sanctioned lynchings for Black people, residents in the county allege a pattern of excessive force among local law enforcement.",
      "Sheriff Eric Balentine, who confirmed the FBI accepted his request to investigate, said his department \u201cexhausted all resources\u201d in its investigation.",
      "\u201cWe feel confident in what our findings were, but we feel like by doing this we can give the family more peace of mind,\u201d Balentine said.",
      "A spokesperson for the FBI's field office in Birmingham confirmed the FBI is aware of Dennoriss Richardson's death and is reviewing the allegations of criminal misconduct.",
      "Tori Bailey, the president of the local NAACP chapter and the only Black member of the six-person county commission in Colbert County, said the community\u2019s reaction to Richardson's death was partially informed by the region\u2019s harrowing history with lynchings.",
      "In Alabama, there were 359 reported lynchings between 1877 and 1943, according to the Equal Justice Initiative, a criminal justice reform nonprofit. In Colbert County alone, there were 11.",
      "Bailey said, although there may be nothing to these accusations, it makes sense the community would have a \u201cvisceral\u201d reaction to a Black man hanging and want a more thorough investigation. She said while some officers are trying to do the right thing, in her 12 years as NAACP president she has documented and investigated many cases of excessive force in the county.",
      "\u201cThere has long been a kind of disconnect between communities of color and law enforcement. Unfortunately, many of us do not feel that law enforcement is actually there to serve and protect,\u201d Bailey said.",
      "Marvin Long, a 57-year-old Black man and lifelong Colbert County resident, knew Dennoriss Richardson\u2019s family well growing up. He shares the skepticism about the suicide ruling and said Richardson\u2019s death has intensified his fear of retaliation.",
      "\u201cTo this day I hate seeing a police car,\u201d Long said. \u201cI\u2019m still more afraid now than ever.\u201d",
      "Long sued the Sheffield Police department last year. After he inquired about an unrelated arrest taking place just outside his property in 2021, body camera footage appears to show officers following Long to his house, dragging him down his porch steps and siccing the police K9 on him as he screams for help. Long was unarmed, according to the complaint.",
      "Richardson and Long are among five Black and Latino men represented by civil rights attorney Roderick Van Daniel who have filed lawsuits against the department in recent years.",
      "\u201cCitizens are living in fear of retaliation,\u201d Van Daniel said.",
      "In one case, an off-duty Sheffield police officer was caught on surveillance footage punching and pulling a gun on a Black man at a liquor store. The officer was later convicted of assault and menacing and reckless endangerment. He was fired from the department.",
      "In a separate lawsuit, a 57-year-old chiropractor claims he was shocked with a Taser 18 times while in handcuffs after he asked an officer to help him find his wife\u2019s iPhone. Photos included in the suit show several large burn marks allegedly from the assault.",
      "The Sheffield Police Department did not respond to numerous phone calls and emails seeking comment. Lawyers for the officers named in pending lawsuits did not respond to emails.",
      "Balentine, the sheriff since 2023, declined to comment on specific cases. But he said that based on his almost 30 years as an officer in the area, he thought residents in Colbert County generally trusted law enforcement.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s proven that it was excessive, then I\u2019m sure that there will be accountability,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Balentine said he hoped the FBI investigation would help assuage concerns.",
      "\u201cTransparency is always a good way to mend some fences with the community,\u201d he said.",
      "Leigh Richardson had known her husband since he was 17. She remembers Dennoriss, known affectionately as \u201cNa-Na,\u201d as a warm father to their five children. But she also said his fear of the police was not new.",
      "\u201cHe was scared at that young age,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "Richardson said that after filing the lawsuit her husband was frequently stopped by police. In those months, he was \u201ctrying to stay out of the way,\u201d she said.",
      "Sheffield Mayor Steve Stanley said Dennoriss Richardson had come to his office at least once to express concerns that he was being profiled. Stanley said he assured Richardson that any officers reported through official channels would be investigated.",
      "The Sheffield Police Department did not confirm whether or how frequently the department pulled over Richardson.",
      "Court records show Dennoriss Richardson had a long history of run-ins with local law enforcement, but the majority of the charges in federal and state courts did not stick.",
      "Dennoriss Richardson pleaded guilty to drug possession in 2006 and was sentenced to five years in prison. In more than 15 years since then, court records show Richardson was arrested at least six additional times by the Sheffield Police Department, for charges ranging from disorderly conduct to robbery to assault.",
      "None of those charges, except for a traffic violation for expired tags, resulted in a conviction, according to available court records.",
      "In the same week that Richardson filed his lawsuit against the department, he was charged with trafficking meth. He had been arrested in a house where drugs allegedly were found. Richardson was out on bond when he died.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 12:50:21 -0500",
    "summary": "No one knows how Tuesday&rsquo;s presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year",
    "story": [
      "No one knows how Tuesday\u2019s presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve\u2019s move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- No one knows how Tuesday's presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve's move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year.",
      "The presidential contest might still be unresolved when the Fed ends its two-day meeting Thursday afternoon, yet that uncertainty would have no effect on its decision to further reduce its benchmark rate. The Fed's future actions, though, will become more unsettled once a new president and Congress take office in January, particularly if Donald Trump were to win the White House again.",
      "Trump's proposals to impose high tariffs on all imports and launch mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants and his threat to intrude on the Fed's normally independent rate decisions could send inflation surging, economists have said. Higher inflation would, in turn, compel the Fed to slow or stop its rate cuts.",
      "On Thursday, the Fed's policymakers, led by Chair Jerome Powell, are on track to cut their benchmark rate by a quarter-point, to about 4.6%, after having implemented a half-point reduction in September. Economists expect another quarter-point rate cut in December and possibly additional such moves next year. Over time, rate cuts tend to lower the costs of borrowing for consumers and businesses.",
      "The Fed is reducing its rate for a different reason than it usually does: It often cuts rates to boost a sluggish economy and a weak job market by encouraging more borrowing and spending. But the economy is growing briskly, and the unemployment rate is a low 4.1%, the government reported Friday, even with hurricanes and a strike at Boeing having sharply depressed net job growth last month.",
      "Instead, the central bank is lowering rates as part of what Powell has called \u201ca recalibration\u201d to a lower-inflation environment. When inflation spiked to a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, the Fed proceeded to raise rates 11 times \u2014 ultimately sending its key rate to about 5.3%, also the highest in four decades.",
      "But in September, year-over-year inflation dropped to 2.4%, barely above the Fed's 2% target and equal to its level in 2018. With inflation having fallen so far, Powell and other Fed officials have said they think high borrowing rates are no longer necessary. High borrowing rates typically restrict growth, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as housing and auto sales.",
      "\u201cThe restriction was in place because inflation was elevated,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed economist. \u201cInflation is no longer elevated. The reason for the restriction is gone.\u201d",
      "Fed officials have suggested that their rate cuts would be gradual. But nearly all of them have expressed support for some further reductions.",
      "\u201cFor me, the central question is how much and how fast to reduce the target for the (Fed's key) rate, which I believe is currently set at a restrictive level,\u201d Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Directors, said in a speech last month.",
      "Jonathan Pingle, an economist at Swiss bank UBS, said that Waller's phrasing reflected \u201cunusual confidence and conviction that rates were headed lower.\"",
      "Next year, the Fed will likely start to wrestle with the question of just how low their benchmark rate should go. Eventually, they may want to set it at a level that neither restricts nor stimulates growth \u2014 \u201cneutral\u201d in Fed parlance.",
      "Powell and other Fed officials acknowledge that they don't know exactly where the neutral rate is. In September, the Fed's rate-setting committee estimated that it was 2.9%. Most economists think it's closer to 3% to 3.5%.",
      "The Fed chair said the officials have to assess where neutral is by how the economy responds to rate cuts. For now, most officials are confident that at 4.9%, the Fed's current rate is far above neutral.",
      "Some economists argue, though, that with the economy looking healthy even with high borrowing rates, the Fed doesn't need to ease credit much, if at all. The idea is that they may already be close to the level of interest rates that neither slows nor stimulates the economy.",
      "\u201cIf the unemployment rate stays in the low 4's and the economy is still going to grow at 3%, does it matter that the (Fed's) rate is 4.75% to 5%?\u201d said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, asked. \u201cWhy are they cutting now?\u201d",
      "With the Fed's latest meeting coming right after Election Day, Powell will likely field questions at his news conference Thursday about the outcome of the presidential race and how it might affect the economy and inflation. He can be expected to reiterate that the Fed's decisions aren't affected by politics at all.",
      "During Trump's presidency, he imposed tariffs on washing machines, solar panels, steel and a range of goods from China, which President Joe Biden maintained. Though studies show that washing machine prices rose as a result, overall inflation did not rise much.",
      "But Trump is now proposing significantly broader tariffs \u2014 essentially, import taxes \u2014 that would raise the prices of about 10 times as many goods from overseas.",
      "Many mainstream economists are alarmed by Trump\u2019s latest proposed tariffs, which they say would almost certainly reignite inflation. A report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that Trump\u2019s main tariff proposals would make inflation 2 percentage points higher next year than it otherwise would have been.",
      "The Fed could be more likely to raise rates in response to tariffs this time, according to economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics, \"given that Trump is threatening much bigger increases in tariffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cAccordingly,\" they wrote, \u201cwe will scale back the reduction in the funds rate in our 2025 forecasts if Trump wins.\u201d",

      "In 1989, Americans were riveted by the shotgun murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills mansion by their own children",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- In 1989, Americans were riveted by the shotgun murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills mansion by their own children. Lyle and Erik Menendez were sentenced to life in prison and lost all subsequent appeals. But today, more than three decades later, they unexpectedly have a chance of getting out.",
      "Not because of the workings of the legal system. Because of entertainment.",
      "After two recent documentaries and a scripted drama on the pair brought new attention to the 35-year-old case, the Los Angeles district attorney has recommended they be resentenced.",
      "The popularity and proliferation of true crime entertainment like Netflix\u2019s docudrama \u201cMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story\u201d is effecting real life changes for their subjects and in society more broadly. At their best, true crime podcasts, streaming series and social media content can help expose injustices and right wrongs.",
      "But because many of these products prioritize entertainment and profit, they also can have serious negative consequences.",
      "The use of true crime stories to sell a product has a long history in America, from the tabloid \u201cpenny press\u201d papers of the mid-1800s to television movies like 1984's \u201cThe Burning Bed.\" These days it's podcasts, bingeable Netflix series and even true crime TikToks. The fascination with the genre may be considered morbid by some, but it can be partially explained by the human desire to make sense of the world through stories.",
      "In the case of the Menendez brothers, Lyle, who was then 21, and Erik, then 18, have said they feared their parents were about to kill them to prevent the disclosure of the father\u2019s long-term sexual molestation of Erik. But at their trial, many of the sex abuse allegations were not allowed to be presented to the jury, and prosecutors contended they committed murder simply to get at their parents\u2019 money.",
      "For years, that's the story that many people who watched the saga from a distance accepted and talked about.",
      "The new dramas delve into the brothers' childhood, helping the public better understand the context of the crime and thus see the world as a less frightening place, says Adam Banner, a criminal defense attorney who writes a column on pop culture and the law for the American Bar Association\u2019s ABA Journal.",
      "\u201cNot only does that make us feel better intrinsically,\" Banner says, \u201cbut it also objectively gives us the ability to think, \u2018Well, now I can take this case and put it in a different bucket than another situation where I have no explanation and the only thing I can say is, \u2018This child just must be evil.'\u201d",
      "Much true crime of the past takes particularly shocking crimes and explores them in depth, generally with the assumption that those convicted of the crime were actually guilty and deserved to be punished.",
      "The success of the podcast \u201c Serial,\u201d which cast doubt on the murder conviction of Adnan Syed, has given birth to a newer genre that often assumes (and intends to prove) the opposite. The protagonists are innocent, or \u2014 as in the case of the Menendez brothers \u2014 guilty but sympathetic, and thus not deserving of their harsh sentences.",
      "\u201cThere is an old tradition of journalists picking apart criminal cases and showing that people are potentially innocent,\u201d says Maurice Chammah, a staff writer at The Marshall Project and author of \u201cLet the Lord Sort Them: The Rise and Fall of the Death Penalty.\"",
      "\u201cBut I think that the curve kind of goes up exponentially in the wake of \u2018Serial,\u2019 which was 2014 and obviously changed the entire landscape economically and culturally of podcasts,\" Chammah says. \"And then you have \u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 come along a few years later and become a kind of behemoth example of that in docuseries.\u201d",
      "Roughly during the same time period, the innocence movement gained traction along with the Black Lives Matter movement and greater attention on police custody deaths. And in popular culture, both fiction and nonfiction, the trend is to mine a villainous character's backstory.",
      "\u201cAll these superheroes, supervillains, the movie \u2018Joker' \u2014 you\u2019re just inundated with this idea that people\u2019s bad behavior is shaped by trauma when they were younger,\u201d Chammah said.",
      "Banner often represents some of the least sympathetic defendants imaginable, including those accused of child sexual abuse. He says the effects of these cultural trends are real. Juries today are more likely to give his clients the benefit of the doubt and are more skeptical of police and prosecutors. But he also worries about the intense focus in current true crime on cases where things went wrong, which he says are the outliers.",
      "While the puzzle aspect of \u201cDid they get it right?\u201d might feed our curiosity, he says, we run the risk of sowing distrust in the entire criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to take away the positive ramifications that putting that spotlight on a case can bring. But you also don\u2019t want to give off the impression that this is how our justice system works. That if we can get enough cameras and microphones on a case, then that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to save somebody off of death row or that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to get a life sentence overturned.\u201d",
      "Adds Chammah: \"If you open up sentencing decisions and second looks and criminal justice policy to pop culture \u2014 in the sense of who gets a podcast made about them, who gets Kim Kardashian talking about them \u2014 the risk of extreme arbitrariness is really great. ... It feels like it\u2019s only a matter of time before the wealthy family of some defendant basically funds a podcast that tries to make a viral case for their innocence.\u201d",
      "Whitney Phillips, who teaches a class on true crime and media ethics at the University of Oregon, says the popularity of the genre on social media adds another layer of complications, often encouraging active participation of viewer and listeners.",
      "\u201cBecause these are not trained detectives or people who have any actual subject area expertise in forensics or even criminal law, then there\u2019s this really common outcome of the wrong people being implicated or floated as suspects,\" she says. \"Also, the victims' families now are part of the discourse. They might be accused of this, that, or the other, or at the very least, you have your loved one's murder, violent death, being entertainment for millions of strangers.\u201d",
      "This sensibility has been both chronicled and lampooned in the streaming comedy-drama series \u201cOnly Murders in the Building,\u201d which follows three unlikely collaborators who live in a New York apartment building where a murder has taken place. The trio decide to make a true crime podcast while simultaneously trying to solve the case.",
      "Nothing about true crime is fundamentally unethical, Phillips says. \u201cIt\u2019s that the social media system \u2014 the attention economy \u2014 is not calibrated for ethics. It\u2019s calibrated for views, it\u2019s calibrated for engagement and it\u2019s calibrated for sensationalism.\"",
      "Many influencers are now vying for the \u201cmurder audience,\u201d Phillips says, with social media and more traditional media feeding off each other. True crime is now creeping into lifestyle content and even makeup tutorials.",
      "\u201cIt was sort of inevitable that you would see the collision of these two things and having these influencers literally just put on a face of makeup and then tell a very kind of \u2014 it\u2019s very informal, it\u2019s very dishy, it\u2019s often not particularly well researched,\" she says. \u201cThis is not investigative journalism.\u201d"

      "But real incidents are now being catalogued and shared online to an unprecedented degree and being used, alongside fake posts, as evidence of widespread cheating.",
      "In southern California, dozens of ballots were found in a storm drain. Despite the unknown circumstances around the event, online partisans immediately suspected deliberate fraud.",
      "\u201cThey WILL cheat,\u201d says one of the thousands of comments posted.",
      "As cases have cropped up in recent days - including those in Pennsylvania and a Chinese student being charged with illegally voting in Michigan - authorities have repeatedly pointed to their investigations as examples of the robustness of election safeguards.",
      "But those who believe conspiracy theories about widespread fraud see these incidents as evidence of a co-ordinated plan by Democrats to \u201crig\u201d the election.",
      "\u201cLook at this new cheat voter fraud,\u201d read one typical comment responding to the news from Pennsylvania. \u201cDems already doing their best to steal another election.\u201d",
      "The overall effect can have a disastrous impact on trust in democracy, experts say.",
      "\u201cThese incidents are catnip for those who seek to undermine confidence in the election result,\u201d said Luis Lozada, chief executive of Democracy Works, a not-for-profit group that distributes information about voting.",

      "Groups behind the deluge",
      "The mass of election fraud claims spreading on social media have been aided by a network of groups that crowdsource allegations.",
      "Groups like Texas-based True The Vote, founded in 2009, have long been on the forefront of questioning election security.",
      "On an app developed by True the Vote called VoteAlert, supporters post examples of alleged election irregularities.",
      "They have collected a wide range of claims, from minor security oversights to allegations of deliberate vote tampering. The organisation also has people monitoring live-streamed cameras that have been pointed on ballot drop boxes in a number of states. Many local officials have repeatedly outlined the steps they have taken to make the boxes secure.",
      "\u201cOur hope is we see exactly nothing at these drop boxes,\u201d said True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht during one of her recent regular online meetings for supporters.",
      "But she also hinted that Democratic-aligned groups were aiming to commit election fraud on a vast scale.",

      "The BBC contacted True the Vote for comment.",
      "A number of other groups are asking supporters to report alleged irregularities.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s America political action committee has started a community \u2013 akin to a message board \u2013 on X, filled with rumours and allegations about voting. With 50,000 members, several posts go up every minute, almost around the clock.",
      "Other efforts include the Election Integrity Network, a group founded by a former Trump lawyer who is challenging voter registrations and recruiting poll watchers \u2013 partisan observers who attend polling places.",
      "The volume of messages on these platforms \u2013 along with the vagueness of some of the claims, with often anonymous sources \u2013 makes it nearly impossible to verify each allegation.",

      "The effect of this is unpredictable.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security, in a memo reported on by US outlets including the BBC\u2019s partner CBS, said on Monday that election conspiracy theories could spark action by domestic extremists.",
      "And observers expect the wave of misinformation to continue well beyond election day. Polls suggest the election will be among the closest in modern US history. It may take days to count all the votes and determine the winner.",
      "Luis Lozada of Democracy Works says the election is being conducted in an \u201cecosystem of distrust\u201d.",
      "But despite the doubts being sown, he says, \u201caccurate information is getting out there\".",
      "\u201cElection officials work very hard to ensure that elections are run properly, as they were in 2020,\u201d Mr Lozada said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to stop folks from taking anecdotes, and trying to punch holes.\u201d",

    "summary": "Alexandr Stoianoglo, backed by the pro-Russian Party of Socialists, has promised a closer relationship with Moscow.",
    "story": [
      "The man challenging Moldova's pro-EU leader Maia Sandu for the presidency has taken a narrow lead, according to preliminary results, in a pivotal presidential election run-off seen as a choice between Europe and Russia.",
      "Alexandr Stoianoglo, who was backed by the pro-Russian Party of Socialists, had promised a closer relationship with Moscow, after Sandu spearheaded Moldova into talks on EU membership.",
      "The Central Election Commission said with more than 89% of the vote counted, Stoianoglo was on 50.97% of the vote and Sandu 49.03%.",
      "During the vote, the president's national security adviser said there had been \"massive interference\" from Russia in Moldova's electoral process that had \"high potential to distort the outcome\".",
      "Russia had already denied meddling in the vote, which came a week after another key Eastern European election in Georgia, whose president said it had been a \"Russian special operation\".",
      "Alexandr Stoianoglo, who was fired as prosecutor general by Sandu, has denied being pro-Kremlin.",
      "Voting ended in Moldova at 21:00 (19:00 GMT), with a 54% turnout higher than four years ago, and especially high among expat voters at polling stations abroad. The result is likely to become even tighter as results from polling stations in the EU and the US become clear.",
      "As polls closed, both Maia Sandu and her rival thanked voters, with Stoianoglu speaking in Russian as well as Romanian. Although Romanian is Moldova's main language, Russian is widely spoken because of its Soviet past.",
      "Casting his ballot, he promised to be an \"apolitical president\" for everyone, telling reporters he had voted for \"a Moldova that should develop in harmony with both the West and the East\".",
      "Sandu appealed after casting her ballot for Moldovans to preserve their independence, warning of \"thieves\" who sought to buy their vote and their country.",
      "Presidential national security adviser Stanislav Secrieru said Russia had organised buses and large charter flights to bring voters to polling stations. Bomb scares had briefly disrupted voting in Moldova, at UK polling stations in Liverpool and Northampton and at Frankfurt and Kaiserslautern in Germany, he added.",
      "A Soviet republic for 51 years, Moldova is flanked by Ukraine and Romania and one of Europe's poorest countries. It has a population of 2.5 million and an expat population of 1.2 million.",
      "Moldova's authorities have long warned that a fugitive oligarch called Ilan Shor has spent $39m (\u00a330m) trying to buy the election for Moscow with handouts to 138,000 Moldovans.",
      "Shor, who is based in Moscow, denies wrongdoing but did promise cash payments to anyone prepared to back his call for a \"firm No\" to the EU.",
      "Commentators and politicians had warned that a Stoianoglu victory could radically change the political landscape in the Danube and Black Sea region, not because he was some kind of \"Trojan horse\", but rather because Russia has thrown its weight behind him.",
      "There were queues at polling stations in Moscow, Italy and among voters from a mainly Russian-speaking breakaway region of Transnistria, who had to cross the River Dniester into Moldovan-controlled territory to vote. Transnistria is home to a Russian military base and a huge arms depot.",
      "Moldova's election commission said it was aware of reports of organised and illegal transports of voters by air and land in Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Turkey, and appealed to the public to report further violations.",
      "Although Sandu had easily won the first round of the vote, several candidates swung behind Stoianoglo, although the third-placed candidate refused to back either of the two.",
      "The first round coincided with a nail-biting referendum on backing a change to the constitution embracing the commitment to join the EU.",
      "In the end the vote passed by a tiny margin in favour, and Maia Sandu said there had been clear evidence of attempts to buy 300,000 votes."

      "A polio vaccination campaign in north Gaza is expected to resume on Sunday, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) said six people, including four children, were injured following a strike on the Sheikh Radwan clinic.",
      "The agency did not say who was responsible for the attack but an official from Gaza's civil defence agency told AFP news agency it was carried out by an Israeli quadcopter. Israel said it is investigating but does not believe it was responsible.",
      "Unicef, the UN's children's agency which is helping to lead the vaccination rollout, described the strike on the Sheikh Radwan clinic as \"another example of the indiscriminate strikes on civilians\".",
      "The second phase of the vaccine rollout began on Saturday after being postponed in October due to intense Israeli bombardments, mass displacement and lack of access in the region.",
      "Gaza recorded its first case of polio in 25 years in August, which left a baby boy paralysed and prompted the rollout of the programme.",

      "The WHO had aimed to give 119,000 children in the area a second dose of the oral polio vaccine.",
      "The agency added that achieving this target \"is now unlikely due to access constraints\".",
      "The first round of the vaccine campaign successfully reached 559,000 children under 10 years old over three phases in south, central and north Gaza between 1 and 12 September, during which there were local \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d agreed by Israel and Palestinian groups.",
      "However, the area agreed in the latest humanitarian pause \"has been substantially reduced\" compared to the first round of vaccinations and is now limited to just Gaza City, according to the WHO.",
      "From the start of the polio vaccination campaign in Gaza, medical experts stressed that delays in administering the second dose could jeopardise overall efforts to halt transmission of the contagious, potentially deadly disease.",
      "To interrupt transmission, at least 90% of all children need to be given a minimum of two doses.",

      "The joint statement from UN agencies, including the WHO, released on Friday, said the situation was \"apocalyptic\", with the entire Palestinian population in the area \"at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence\".",

    "summary": "A look back at the Democratic candidate's career in California shows her struggle to define herself to the public began long before she came to Washington.",
    "story": [
      "Just over three months ago, Vice-President Kamala Harris walked up to a microphone to make a speech that would define both her past and her future.",
      "A day before, President Joe Biden had dropped out of the election race and endorsed her to succeed him as Democratic candidate. With only a short period of campaigning ahead of her, Harris had no time to waste.",
      "There is a saying in politics: define yourself or be defined by your opponent. And in that moment, when Harris made her first pitch to the American people, she defined herself not just in terms of her record in the White House or as a US senator, but the years she spent as a California prosecutor.",
      "\u201cI took on perpetrators of all kinds - predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type,\u201d she said of her Republican challenger.",
      "The line has been repeated often at her campaign rallies and stump speeches, as the 60-year-old has sought to frame this election as a contest between a hard-bitten prosecutor and a convicted felon, constantly reminding voters of Trump\u2019s legal troubles.",
      "How Donald Trump came back from the political abyss",
      "How Donald Trump came back from the political abyss",
      "But a look back at Harris\u2019s time in and out of California's courtrooms reveals her enduring struggle to define herself, what her opponents say is a history of pivoting on issues depending on the political weather, as well as her uncanny ability to seize the moment when others have counted her out.",
      "Street murders and rough San Francisco politics",
      "Harris\u2019s time in law enforcement began just out of law school in Alameda County, California - which includes the cities of Berkeley and her hometown of Oakland.",
      "During the 1990s, in the midst of the government's \"war on drugs\", Oakland struggled with violent crime.",
      "For a junior prosecutor, the job was daunting. But the severity of the cases you had to deal with meant it was considered a top job for a young and ambitious attorney, said Teresa Drenick, who worked with Harris at the time.",
      "\u201cIt was like a potboiler of an atmosphere. The amount of grief and agony you ingested every day was hard to process. For us, it was intense. The stakes being high, the crimes being so serious,\u201d she told the BBC.",
      "\"It was near the height of the crack-cocaine epidemic. There were gang murders, street corner murders taking place. There was a lot going on in Oakland that enabled you as a prosecutor to handle some of the most serious cases that a prosecutor is ever going to handle.\"",
      "Ms Drenick and Harris were on the same trial team together. She admired Harris\u2019s confidence in front of a jury, and her respect for her colleague only grew when Harris was transferred to a different team in the same courthouse focused on child sexual assault.",
      "\"She was very, very caring of victims of child abuse. She was able to speak to them in a way that allowed them to open up to her,\u201d she said.",
      "It was at this time that Harris dated Willie Brown, a local political kingmaker and speaker of the California State Assembly who helped launch the careers of some of the state\u2019s other most prominent political leaders, including Gavin Newsom, the current governor, and San Francisco Mayor London Breed.",
      "Brown appointed her to two state boards and introduced her to some of San Francisco\u2019s highest-profile Democratic donors. The short-lived romance ended by the time Brown was elected as the city\u2019s mayor in 1995. Three years later, Harris took a job at the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office.",
      "During her relationship with Brown, who was 30 years her senior, Harris had begun mingling with some of the city\u2019s political heavyweights.",
      "San Francisco's political machine, which Harris has described as \u201ca bare-knuckled sport\u201d, has launched the careers of some of the nation\u2019s biggest political stalwarts including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the late Senator Dianne Feinstein.",
      "Harris forged relationships with both of them, rising alongside contemporaries like Newsom, as she found her feet in the political world.",
      "Her swift rise through San Francisco\u2019s rough-and-tumble politics were defined by days in courtrooms representing victims and nights at glitzy political galas.",
      "This was also around the time that Harris met one of her closest friends \u2013 and most significant donors - Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.",
      "Jobs donated $500 to Harris\u2019s 2003 campaign for San Francisco district attorney, which she won, toppling the man who had hired her. Twenty years later, the billionaire philanthropist donated nearly $1m to the Biden-Harris re-election campaign, according to Fortune Magazine. It\u2019s not known how much she has directly contributed to Harris\u2019s bid for the presidency, but the amount is considered substantial.",
      "\u2018No exception to principle\u2019",
      "On the day before Easter in 2004, just four months into Kamala Harris\u2019s tenure as the district attorney of San Francisco, a gang member brandishing an AK-47 rifle fatally shot a 29-year old police officer named Isaac Espinoza.",
      "The slaying stunned the city, with many politicians and prominent members of the police calling for the death penalty.",
      "But Harris, who had made opposition to capital punishment a key part of her political campaign to become the city\u2019s top prosecutor, instead decided to pursue a life sentence without parole. She made her decision public just 48 hours after the murder, without informing the widow first.",
      "\u201cShe did not call me,\u201d Espinoza told CNN in 2019. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why she went on camera to say that without talking to the family. It\u2019s like, you can\u2019t even wait till he\u2019s buried?\u201d",
      "The backlash was swift. Speaking at the officer\u2019s funeral, Senator Feinstein demanded his killer \u201cpay the ultimate price\u201d. While walking out of the church service, she told reporters that had she known Harris was against the death penalty, she probably wouldn't have endorsed her.",
      "\u201c[T]here can be no exception to principle,\u201d Harris later wrote in an opinion piece in the San Francisco Chronicle, defending her decision.",
      "Long-time civil rights attorney John Burris, who supported Harris\u2019s decision at the time, said he thought it was \u201cpolitically was not wise for her, but it was a philosophical position she took\u201d.",
      "\"She was pretty bold in her position and she did take a lot of heat for it,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThat was a pretty progressive stand.\u201d",
      "The incident could have been the end of her political ambitions, but Harris, who had grown up with a single mother in the working-class city of Oakland, carried on.",
      "\u201cIs she a political animal? Absolutely not. Is she naturally skilled? Yes,\u201d said Brian Brokaw, who managed Harris\u2019s two successful campaigns for California attorney general in 2010 and 2014. \u201cFor her, politics is the means to the end. She is focused on the end result and the impact she can have on people\u2019s lives less than the process.\u201d",
      "Harris seemed to absorb some lessons from her first major decision as San Francisco district attorney. Four years later, she again declined to pursue the death penalty after a dramatic killing, but this time, she better understood how her decision would reverberate.",
      "Tony Bologna had been driving in San Francisco with his three sons when their vehicle was barraged by gunfire. Bologna and two of his sons were killed; his third son was critically injured.",
      "Shortly after the killing, police arrested Edwin Ramon Uma\u00f1a, an undocumented member of the MS-13 gang who had evidently mistaken the 49-year old Bologna for a sworn enemy.",
      "This time, Harris opted to deliver the difficult news about her prosecutorial decision to Bologna\u2019s widow Danielle herself, recalls Matt Davis, who was representing Danielle Bologna in a civil suit against the city at the time.",
      "\u201cIt was no surprise that Danielle had a very strong, negative reaction to the news,\u201d Mr Davis told the BBC in a recent interview. \u201cShe made it clear that she was upset, and Kamala listened to her and expressed her sympathies but stayed pretty firm.\u201d",
      "The meeting left an indelible impression on Davis. He had befriended Harris in law school in San Francisco, and when she had first revealed her plans to run for D.A., he remembers thinking she didn\u2019t have a chance.",
      "But he says that painful conversation made him realise he had underestimated her.",
      "\u201cThat was not an easy thing to do,\u201d Mr Davis said.",
      "Progressive prosecutor?",
      "Over the span of her law enforcement career, Harris\u2019s allies sought to paint her as a \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d committed to criminal justice reform but also tough on crime.",
      "It was a fine line to walk in a liberal city in the country\u2019s largest left-leaning state, and one that critics on both sides of the political aisle say she did not stick to.",
      "As district attorney, she adopted a so-called \u201csmart-on-crime\u201d philosophy, which included initiatives to keep non-violent offenders out of prison by steering them into job training programs and ensuring young offenders remained in school.",
      "Niki Solis, an attorney in the San Francisco public defender\u2019s office who worked opposite Harris in the early 2000s, said she had been receptive to her concerns about how young victims of sex trafficking were being charged with prostitution, as opposed to being treated as victims.",
      "\u201cI realised that she understood issues that a lot of her predecessors and a lot of [district attorneys] up and down the state failed to understand or even acknowledge,\u201d said Ms Solis.",
      "Trump and his allies on the right have sought to play up this time in her career, depicting her as part of a \u201cSan Francisco liberal elite\u201d. But on the left of politics, she has been accused of not being reform-minded enough, with some on social media nicknaming her \u201cKamala the cop\u201d.",
      "But by the time Harris was elected as California\u2019s attorney general, in 2010, her progressive tendencies appeared to have given way to political pragmatism.",
      "\"She was seeking more of a national profile. She wanted to make a mark. There was definitely an expectation of an interesting future to come,\u201d said Gil Duran, who worked for Harris in the attorney general\u2019s office for a few months.",
      "\"The attorney general - usually a sleepy backwater of an office - was now home to a rising star.\"",
      "On the national stage, Harris began to make her mark. In 2012, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Harris threatened to walk away from negotiations on a financial settlement between state attorneys general and five US banks. California was set to receive around $4 billion in the initial deal, and Harris eventually secured $18 billion for the state.",
      "The Harris campaign has highlighted this case on the campaign trail as more proof she\u2019s willing to stand up to powerful interests.",
      "But more recent reporting shows that only $4.5 billion of the settlement ended up going towards California homeowners who had been ripped off by lenders.",
      "In moves that angered some liberals, she implemented a school truancy program state-wide, which some county prosecutors used to arrest parents. And she defied a Supreme Court order to reduce overcrowding in the state\u2019s prisons.",
      "She also reversed her previous position on the death penalty in 2014 when, as attorney general, she appealed a lower court\u2019s ruling that found it was unconstitutional. Now, the prosecutor who once refused to sentence violent murderers to death on the basis that \"there is no exception to principle\" was defending the state\u2019s right to do just that.",
      "Hadar Aviram, a criminal justice and civil rights professor who petitioned Harris to leave the decision in place, was one of many critics of her stance.",
      "\u201cYou are not under any obligation to defend things that are morally unjust,\u201d she told CNN in 2019 of the episode. \u201cIf you truly believe that they\u2019re morally unjust and you have an opportunity to take a stand, I think it\u2019s an imperative to do so.\u201d",
      "Former San Francisco city attorney Louise Renne, who worked with Harris when she first left Oakland, said the torrent of criticism she faced over her support for the death penalty was unfair.",
      "\u201cThe thing is when you\u2019re state attorney general, you have to defend the law. That\u2019s your obligation,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201c I don\u2019t regard that as a weakness or a valid criticism at all.\u201d",
      "But Harris was selective about which laws she enforced. In 2004, when Gavin Newsom, then San Francisco's mayor, decided to allow same-sex weddings, in violation of state law, Harris helped officiate a few of the ceremonies, calling it \u201cone of the most joyful\u201d moments of her career.",
      "Her long record as a prosecutor would prove tricky when, after being elected to the US Senate in 2016, Harris decided to run for the Democratic presidential nomination.",
      "She chose to kick off her 2020 presidential run just blocks away from the Alameda County Courthouse, the same place where she first uttered the words, \u201cfor the people\u201d \u2013 which would become part of her campaign slogan.",
      "But in the midst of her campaign, George Floyd, an unarmed black man, was murdered by a police officer during an arrest, igniting a nationwide racial reckoning and demand for criminal justice reform. Her past defence of the death penalty, and resistance to prison reform, earned her criticism from her party\u2019s left-flank.",
      "She dropped out of the presidential race before the primary contests to choose a Democratic contender had even begun.",
      "Reinvented again",
      "Now, as Harris campaigns for president against Donald Trump, she is again calling attention to her prosecutorial bona-fides, but reframed in a new political atmosphere.",
      "While many cities, including San Francisco, experimented with progressive police reform after Floyd\u2019s murder, a spike in crime and homelessness during the pandemic has triggered a public backlash against so-called \u201csoft on crime\u201d policies. Republicans have also heavily focused on political messaging around crime and public safety in recent years.",
      "Harris\u2019s past as a prosecutor is no longer such a liability, and in a race against the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes, the narrative aligns with the political moment.",
      "Notably, at the Democratic National Convention this summer, abolishing the death penalty was dropped from the party platform.",
      "And while in 2020, Harris was trying to win over left-leaning Democrats, she is now explicitly making a pitch for moderate Republicans who may be fed up with Trump. To do that, she has shifted a number of her positions - from border security to single-payer health care - to the centre.",
      "This has led to accusations from her opponents that she is a flip-flopper.",
      "She\u2019s \u201ca chameleon\u201d, Trump\u2019s running mate and Ohio Senator JD Vance told CNN in August. \u201cShe pretends to be one thing in front of one audience and she pretends to be something different in front of another audience.\u201d",
      "But Mr Duran, Harris's former colleague in the attorney general\u2019s office, sees it less as a matter of political scrupulousness and more simply a sign of her political pragmatism.",
      "\"I think she does have conviction but it\u2019s really hard to run a campaign on your convictions alone, for the most part,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Kamala Harris we\u2019re seeing now is very much poll and focus-group driven.\u201d",
      "What Harris really stands for has been a question that has dogged her throughout her career - and continues to follow her on her bid for the Oval Office. But to Mr Brokaw, her former campaign manager, she has always operated on her own terms.",
      "\u201cShe has carved her own path and left a whole bunch of people behind who counted her out and underestimated her,\u201d he said.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 02:45:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Two UK-based Africans tell the BBC how they are digging deep into their culture to change home decor.",
    "story": [
      "After more than a decade as a lawyer at high-powered banking firms like Goldman Sachs and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Nigerian-British Kelechi Ejikeme left the corporate world to follow her passion for interior design.",
      "Her rug collection is inspired by Nigeria's diverse terrain - rolling hills, winding rivers, sprawling savannahs and dense forests, and reminds me of the view from planes.",
      "\"So, when you interpret that into a rug or a carpet, it\u2019s symbolic,\" she said when I met her at her stall at the Decorex interior design show held in London last month.",
      "\"It\u2019s like, every minute, this is what we're actually every day stepping on.\"",
      "Made from jute, a durable and eco-friendly material, each rug integrates these natural elements.",
      "Jute is typically cultivated locally for its edible leaves, not for fibre. It comes from the same plant used for ewedu soup, a staple in south-western Nigeria.",
      "To bring her vision to life, Ejikeme has her rugs produced in India and Nepal, where jute is more widely developed into a thriving industry.",
      "Also at the event was Amechi Mandi, a Cameroonian-Nigerian interior designer who won House & Garden magazine\u2019s Rising Star award in 2022.",
      "He was not showcasing any of his work but had just spoken in a side session about his transition from fashion to interior design.",
      "Mandi holds a degree in furniture and product design, but after working in the fashion industry and later at a design firm, he became increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of genuine African-inspired interior textiles.",
      "Too often, he found, they relied on \"clich\u00e9d\", post-colonial motifs.",
      "This led him to explore his Cameroonian and Nigerian heritage, with a focus on pre-colonial traditions.",
      "Recognising the untapped potential of indigenous textiles fading from memory -especially with the rise of \"ankara\" wax prints, a European import that has come to symbolise African design - Mandi set out to revive these cultural elements.",
      "He began integrating traditional techniques and patterns into his designs, and his work now includes a popular collection of cushions and throws, as well as a successful wallpaper collaboration.",
      "\"People have told me, 'Oh, your work is not African,' because they want to see ankara prints. It's been so impressed in the minds,\" Mandi told me.",
      "\"I get inspiration from indigenous traditions and cultures, and then, I give it a more contemporary spin,\" he added.",
      "Listening to Mandi made me realise how much I, too, had come to associate modern African design with ankara fabrics.",
      "This textile has dominated African fashion and design, making its mark on global stages in recent decades.",
      "And so, as I wandered through the exhibition, it was easy to assume that African designs were absent from this notable gathering.",
      "When she first started, Ejikeme juggled both law and interior design, working in one during the week and the other on weekends. It did not take long for her to realise where her true passion lay.",
      "\"In one world, you\u2019re trying to contain your energy or yourself or your expression just so that you don\u2019t ruffle feathers, while in another world your energy, you can\u2019t even extinguish it,\" she said.",
      "Since making the leap to full-time design six years ago, she has tackled a variety of projects, from homes and workplaces to movie sets.",
      "Last year, she launched her own rug collection, adding a new dimension to her work from her Swallow and Tea studio.",
      "\"It\u2019s a really new thing and I\u2019ve only had two shows but so far I\u2019ve had mostly residential and retail buyers mainly from Europe probably because my first show was in Belgium. Decorex was my first UK show,\" Ejikeme said.",
      "Most of Mandi\u2019s customers are Europeans, a trend he attributes to a prevailing preference among many Africans for foreign products.",
      "\"Most Africans still prefer to buy a Gucci,\" he said.",
      "\"I do have a few Africans buying but they are not like everyday Africans. They were all people who were born and bred abroad and are deep into African heritage and culture.\"",
      "Both Ejikeme and Mandi concur that interior design in Africa is still in its developmental stages.",
      "In contrast to fashion, which has long been a significant focus for Africans and has recently experienced remarkable growth, the field of African interior design is just starting to establish itself.",
      "Ejikeme reflected on her first independent project in 2013, which coincided with a new wave of Africans in London entering high-paying fields like investment banking.",
      "She aimed to create spaces that not only exuded luxury and comfort but also captured a sense of home for her African clients, reflecting their heritage in a meaningful way.",
      "\"I was stumped because I'm somebody who loves antiques. I love old design. When I was in design school in London, my favourite thing was history of design, like learning about all the different periods - Victorian, Edwardian, etc - and what distinguished one from the other.",
      "\"But there was no such thing in Africa. There's nothing like the history of African design because we haven't really kept that track,\" she said.",
      "This realisation motivated her to begin categorising African design periods to better understand and preserve the continent's design evolution, an ongoing project she began during her past 10 years living in Nigeria before returning to London last year.",
      "Ejikeme visited places like the Bogobiri art gallery in Lagos, which displayed a mixture of old sculpture and modern art.",
      "She also visited sellers in quiet corners of Nigerian markets, where she came across staffs of office used by Igbo elders in precolonial times. She began categorising these objects she came across according to their period in history, whether late 1990s or pre-colonial.",
      "She has not yet finished and wants to devote more time to it to use them in her interior design projects.",
      "Mandi believes that following trends in how we design our homes and other spaces was historically never an African thing, especially with the centuries of the transatlantic slave trade.",
      "\"Traditionally, interiors have never been a priority. We have always been into functionality. We were more into decorating our exteriors, like painting the walls, painting the outside,\" he said.",
      "\"Each civilization has evolved, but we didn\u2019t have the chance to evolve because of the 400 years we were arrested with the transatlantic slave trade.\"",
      "He added that Africans were in \"constant flight\" during the slave trade, so \"how can you think, 'I have this house, I have to make the inside fine, let me put that bench, let me weave this cloth'? Our society didn't have the chance to evolve like that.\"",
      "Both Ejikeme and Mandi noted that many wealthy and prominent Africans, from celebrities to entrepreneurs, often have interiors that lack a distinctly African identity.",
      "However, Ejikeme believes this is changing as more Africans gain disposable income, they are increasingly investing in decorating their homes in a way that tells their personal story and captures their experiences.",
      "\"If you have a product that can be made beautiful, and exquisite, and sort of memorable, that tells some kind of story or has some kind of meaning, it will appeal to Africans and other people that are not African,\" she says.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 00:51:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Why are still no closer to unmasking the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto?",
    "story": [
      "Bitcoin underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry, is now traded by the world's biggest investment houses and is even an official currency in one country.",
      "But despite its meteoric rise, a deep mystery remains at its heart: what is the true identity of its founder, the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto?",
      "Many have tried to answer that question, but so far all have failed. In October, a high-profile HBO documentary suggested that a Canadian bitcoin expert called Peter Todd was he. The only problem: he said he was not, and the crypto world largely shrugged it off.",
      "So, inevitably, ears pricked up across our newsroom - and the crypto world at large - when on Thursday a call went out that the mysterious creator of Bitcoin was to, finally, unmask himself at a press conference.",
      "There is deep interest in who Satoshi Nakamoto is in part because they are considered a revolutionary programmer who helped spawn the crypto industry.",
      "Their voice, opinions and world view would be extremely influential on an industry with such a devoted and zealous fanbase.",
      "But the fascination also stems from the fact that, as the holder of more than one million bitcoins, Satoshi would be a multi-billionaire, not least because the price of the coins is currently close to an all-time high.",
      "Given that vast wealth, it was somewhat unusual to be asked by the organiser of Thursday\u2019s press conference to pay for my seat at his grand unveiling.",
      "A front row seat would be \u00a3100. It was another \u00a350 if I wanted unlimited questions. Organiser Charles Anderson even encouraged me to spend \u00a3500 in exchange for the privilege of interviewing \"Satoshi\" on stage.",
      "I declined.",
      "Mr Anderson said I could come along any way but cautioned there might not be a seat for me, such was the level of anticipation.",
      "As it happened, seating wasn\u2019t a problem.",
      "Only around a dozen reporters turned up to the prestigious Frontline Club - which interrupted proceedings at one point to stress it only provided a room, and not any official endorsement.",
      "Very soon it became clear that all attendees were extremely sceptical.",
      "After some digging it emerged both the organiser and the purported Satoshi were currently embroiled in a complex legal fight over fraud allegations - linked to claims to be Satoshi.",
      "It was an unpromising start, and things only got worse from there.",
      "Mr Anderson invited \"Satoshi\" to come on stage.",
      "A man called Stephen Mollah, who had been sat silently on the side the whole time walked up and resolutely declared: \u201cI am here to make a statement that yes: I am Satoshi Nakamoto and I created the Bitcoin on Blockchain technology.\u201d",
      "Over the following hour, reporters went from amused to irritated as he failed to provide any of the promised evidence for his claims.",
      "Mr Mollah promised that he would make the Hail-Mary move of unlocking and interacting with the first-ever Bitcoins to be created - something that only Satoshi could do.",
      "But he didn't.",
      "I departed, along with other bemused reporters, taking with us any lingering doubts that this would prove to be yet another dead-end in the quest to unmask Satoshi.",
      "What is Bitcoin? Key crypto terms and what they mean",
