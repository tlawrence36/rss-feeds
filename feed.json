      "Music giant Quincy Jones has been laid to rest in a private ceremony in Los Angeles, a week after his death at age 91",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Music giant Quincy Jones was laid to rest in a private ceremony in Los Angeles, a week after his death at age 91. A larger, more public memorial is also being planned.",
      "The family of the 28-time Grammy winning producer, arranger and composer said in a statement to The Associated Press that the \u201cintimate ceremony included Mr. Jones\u2019 seven children, his brother, two sisters, and immediate family members.\u201d",
      "The family did not reveal the cemetery where the ceremony took place. They added that they remain \u201cenormously grateful for the outpouring of condolences and tributes from his friends and fans from around the world. Details for a memorial celebration of Mr. Jones\u2019 life will be announced at a later date.\u201d",
      "Jones died surrounded by his family at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles on Nov. 3.",
      "His seven decades of musical mastery included producing Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller\u201d album, writing prize-winning film scores and collaborating on classic recordings with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of others.",
      "Tributes to him after his death came from some of the biggest figures in media and politics. \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which he once hosted, paid tribute to him a night before his service with a memorial photo in a quiet moment of the show.",
      "In lieu of flowers, Jones' family asks for donations to the Jazz Foundation of America."

      "Pop superstar Beyonc\u00e9 and her expansive cultural legacy will be the subject of a new course next year at Yale University",
      "With a record 99 Grammy nominations and acclaim as one of the most influential artists in music history, pop superstar Beyonc\u00e9 and her expansive cultural legacy will be the subject of a new course at Yale University next year.",
      "Titled \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 Makes History: Black Radical Tradition, Culture, Theory & Politics Through Music,\u201d the one-credit class will focus on the period from her 2013 self-titled album through this year's genre-defying \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d and how the world-famous singer, songwriter and entrepreneur has generated awareness and engagement in social and political ideologies.",
      "Yale University's African American Studies Professor Daphne Brooks intends to use the performer's wide-ranging repertoire, including footage of her live performances, as a \u201cportal\u201d for students to learn about Black intellectuals, from Frederick Douglass to Toni Morrison.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be taking seriously the ways in which the critical work, the intellectual work of some of our greatest thinkers in American culture resonates with Beyonc\u00e9's music and thinking about the ways in which we can apply their philosophies to her work\" and how it has sometimes been at odds with the \u201cBlack radical intellectual tradition,\u201d Brooks said.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9, whose full name is Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter, is not the first performer to be the subject of a college-level course. There have been courses on singer and songwriter Bob Dylan over the years and several colleges and universities have recently offered classes on singer Taylor Swift and her lyrics and pop culture legacy. That includes law professors who hope to engage a new generation of lawyers by using a famous celebrity like Swift to bring context to complicated, real-world concepts.",
      "Professors at other colleges and universities have also incorporated Beyonc\u00e9 into their courses or offered classes on the superstar.",
      "Brooks sees Beyonc\u00e9 in a league of her own, crediting the singer with using her platform to \u201cspectacularly elevate awareness of and engagement with grassroots, social, political ideologies and movements\u201d in her music, including the Black Lives Matter movement and Black feminist commentary.",
      "\u201cCan you think of any other pop musician who\u2019s invited an array of grassroots activists to participate in these longform multimedia album projects that she\u2019s given us since 2013,\" asked Brooks. She noted how Beyonc\u00e9 has also tried to tell a story through her music about \u201crace and gender and sexuality in the context of the 400-year-plus history of African-American subjugation.\"",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a fascinating artist because historical memory, as I often refer to it, and also the kind of impulse to be an archive of that historical memory, it's just all over her work,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cAnd you just don\u2019t see that with any other artist.\u201d",
      "Brooks previously taught a well-received class on Black women in popular music culture at Princeton University and discovered her students were most excited about the portion dedicated to Beyonc\u00e9. She expects her class at Yale will be especially popular, but she's trying to keep the size of the group relatively small.",
      "For those who manage to snag a seat next semester, they shouldn't get their hopes up about seeing Queen Bey in person.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too bad because if she were on tour, I would definitely try to take the class to see her,\" Brooks said."

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 \u201cOutlander\u201d is returning with the concluding episodes of its seventh season this month, but its stars have already wrapped official production on the show\u2019s eighth and final season.",
      "Caitr\u00edona Balfe and Sam Heughan, who have played time traveler Claire and 18th century Highlander Jamie since the show began, recently teased their bittersweet goodbye. Speaking less than a fortnight after their official wrap day, with only a few pick-up shots left to shoot, the stars described filming their final scene for the upcoming season.",
      "\u201cIt was very emotional. I was very emotional,\u201d Balfe said.",
      "\u201cI was, too,\u201d Heughan agreed. \u201cWe ended on a scene, well, I think \u2014 it was quite tough to do because it was a real Jamie-Claire moment, so it felt quite fitting. And I think they scheduled it like that. But it was also quite intense because a lot of the crew came to sort of celebrate or watch the final take of the final scene.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd there was a lot of words,\u201d added Balfe. \u201cIt was really hard to get through it because it also felt like everything had sort of this double meaning, you know, it\u2019s a lot of talk about goodbyes and things.\u201d",
      "Based on the books by Diana Gabaldon and mostly filmed in Scotland, the long-running show has leapt across time periods, including the Jacobite Rising, 1740s Versailles, 1960s Boston, the Revolutionary War \u2014 and more.",
      "\u201cI played Jamie when he was 23 and now he\u2019s sort of around 60. So it\u2019s quite a journey,\u201d said Heughan. \u201cThe show is always changing, always moving, it\u2019s a real journey that they\u2019ve been on from Scotland to America. And I think it\u2019s very rewarding. I\u2019m glad we weren\u2019t in a sort of procedural where we had to sort of be in the same location all the time.\u201d",
      "The concluding half of Season 7, premiering Nov. 22 on Starz, begins with the couple returning to Jamie\u2019s homeland of Scotland, before America \u2014 and the rebel cause in the Revolutionary War \u2014 calls again, testing their marriage like never before.",
      "\u201cReturning home obviously is going to be so rewarding for Jamie, but also for the fans,\u201d Heughan said, \u201cbecause I think the fans, they get to see a lot of, their favorite characters and their favorite locations.\u201d",
      "The latest episodes weave in storylines involving Claire and Jamie\u2019s time-traveling daughter Brianna and her husband Roger (Sophie Skelton and Richard Rankin) and Jamie\u2019s nephew Ian (John Bell), as well as Jamie\u2019s secret son William (Charles Vandervaart) and the British lord who is raising him.",
      "Season 7 also features one of Heughan's favorite co-stars \u2014 one he confirms fans won\u2019t be seeing in Season 8.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually the last time you see Sleepy,\u201d Heughan says. \u201cHe was my horse throughout first seasons. And he\u2019s a black Friesian with a white spot on him. And actually, if you look closely, he somehow transports himself to America as well because he doubles up as a horse in America. But yeah, I mean, we say goodbye to a lot of locations, a lot of characters in Season 7B.\u201d",
      "With the last season still to come, and the \u201cOutlander\u201d universe expanding with the upcoming prequel \u201cOutlander: Blood of My Blood,\u201d the story will continue for fans \u2014 although Balfe and Heughan will be getting used to their \u201cDroughtlander,\u201d the term fans coined for periods without the show.",
      "\u201cIt has been our lives for the last 11 years. We\u2019ve built families and homes in Scotland,\u201d said Heughan. \u201cSo, yes, it\u2019s quite a change that we\u2019re about to face.\u201d"

      "It\u2019s not often that a historical novel is set in the Vietnam of the 1920s, a period when the land in Indochina was occupied and exploited by French colonizers. It\u2019s also unusual that such a novel would be a whodunit murder mystery.",
      "\u201cThose Opulent Days,\u201d the debut novel of Jacquie Pham, is both \u2014 and a grim coming-of-age story as well.",
      "Pham, who grew up in Vietnam before moving to Australia, ably describes the land of her youth, its history and culture, including the well-heeled Vietnamese who were complicit in the French plunder of resources a century ago.",
      "\u201cThe French ruled the colony,\u201d she writes in the novel, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t understand its people \u2014 they needed locals, rich enough, corrupt and ambitious enough, to supply them with insight and cash.\u201d",
      "She vividly describes the Vietnamese peasants working long hours in rice paddies, bare feet in muddy water, pale yellow conical hats to block the harsh sun. \u201cThe fields were a vast, luscious green carpet,\u201d Pham writes, \u201calways filled with the fresh, intoxicating scent of young shoots.\u201d But little of this bounty went to impoverished, starving peasant families. \u201cThey would pay ground rent on a monthly basis, with hardly anything to call their own,\u201d Pham writes.",
      "As a mystery novel, \u201cThose Opulent Days\u201d is well-plotted, with a tangled web of possible outcomes. But the allure of the book\u2019s guessing-game narrative and its historical context does not carry over into a fully satisfying reading experience.",
      "The story is beset in part by a cast of vile characters and an overdose of melodramatic scenes. The French rulers and their prosperous Vietnamese collaborators, while living in regal splendor, partake of casual cruelty and horrid murders to such an extent they resemble cardboard cutouts of villains.",
      "This extends partly to the four boys whose fate growing up is at the core of the coming-of-age story. The four are Duy, Minh and Phong, sons of well-to-do families in Annam, as the region then was known, and Edmond, a French youth who met them at a boarding school. They are a mix of friends, rivals and would-be lovers. They binge on opium and alcohol. When they reach their early 20s, they near a dreaded, deadly end predicted by a fortune teller years earlier.",
      "The author understandably wants to convey the reality of the raw power held by the occupying masters over helpless underlings in the French Indochina era. But she has done so at the expense of solid storytelling.",
      "Pham is a young writer with a lot to offer. She succeeds admirably in laying out an enticing mystery, which makes for easy reading even when overwrought. And by linking it to a faded period of history, presaging the United States\u2019 own tragedy in the Vietnam War, she establishes herself as a writer to watch.",

      "Tim Matheson has portrayed a president and vice president. A police officer and military officer. And more than a few doctors.

      "The section on the making of the classic 1978 film is almost worth the book's purchase price alone.

The description of the cast's visit to a real frat party in Eugene is a particular highlight.",
      "\u201cDamn Glad to Meet You\" isn't all fun and games, though.

      "In 2019",
      "An entire generation of literary-minded women has not stopped telling itself stories influenced by master storyteller Joan Didion. The same, alas, cannot be said of Eve Babitz, a Hollywood bad girl whose life briefly intersected with Didion\u2019s in the late 1960s and early \u201970s.",
      "Few writers, of course, have the stature of Didion, and Babitz does have a contingent of ardent and influential admirers. Her biggest fangirl might be Lili Anolik, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair whose 2014 article about Babitz, followed by her 2019 biography \u201cHollywood\u2019s Eve,\u201d fueled a revival of interest in her work.",
      "Now Anolik is back with a new book, \u201cDidion & Babitz,\u201d in which she explores the complicated relationship between the frenemies and declares her devotion to the less well-known of the two: \u201cI\u2019m crazy for Eve, love her with a fan\u2019s unreasoning abandon. Besides, Joan is somebody I naturally root against: I respect her work rather than like it; find her persona \u2014 part princess, part wet blanket \u2014 tough going; and resent her for siccing on us, the innocent reading public, an army, seemingly unending, of middle-class young-women personal essayists who take their feelings very ultra-seriously and expect us to do the same.\u201d",
      "The two women met in 1967 when Didion and her husband, John Gregory Dunne, were living at 7406 Franklin Avenue in Hollywood, a louche time and place that Didion immortalized in her breakout collection of nonfiction, \u201cSlouching Towards Bethlehem.\u201d",
      "In 1971, Didion helped Babitz get a story published in Rolling Stone magazine \u2014 \u201cShe is a painter, not a writer,\u201d Didion told the editor. Eventually, that led to a book deal. But their friendship fractured when Didion and Dunne were enlisted by Babitz\u2019s publisher to edit the book, which became \u201cEve\u2019s Hollywood,\u201d and Babitz bristled at their criticism. Later, she boasted to a friend, \u201cI fired Joan.\u201d",
      "Anolik makes a convincing case for Babitz\u2019s literary genius and sets up an interesting contrast between the two women\u2014 one loose, libidinous and joyfully debauched; the other shy, cerebral and tightly controlled.",
      "But don\u2019t expect the calm, organized, even-handed approach of a literary critic or biographer. In the breathless, gossipy style of the tabloids, and with frequent, winking asides to the \u201cReader,\u201d Anolik dishes dirt on all the major and minor players in their haute bohemian circle, especially Didion and Dunne. In the end, everyone ends up looking bad, including, sadly, Babitz.",

    "story": [
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d isn\u2019t quite the prestige film that the first one, a best-picture winner, was",
      "Rome teeters on the brink in Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Its fall is said to be imminent. The dream it once symbolized is dead. The once high-minded ideals of the Roman Empire have deteriorated across a venal land now ruled by a pale-faced emperor.",
      "On the throne is Geta (Joseph Quinn), who sits alongside his sniveling brother, Caracalla (Fred Hechinger). The heart of this Rome, of course, is the Coliseum, where throngs cheer for the gladiators who fight and die. There, the ageless Scott remains remarkably at home. The arena, with its eruptions of spectacle and violence, is a stand in for the director\u2019s own vision of the big screen: Go big or go home.",
      "This dichotomy \u2014 a fallen society and its insatiable need for entertainment \u2014 is the clever and not altogether flattering backdrop of the \u201cGladiator\u201d films. Part two, set 20 years after the events of the first movie, brings a new combatant to the Coliseum \u2014 a mysterious outsider named Lucius Verus, played by Paul Mescal. And to answer the inevitable question, yes. Yes, I was quite entertained.",
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d isn\u2019t quite the prestige film the first one, a best-picture winner, was in 2001. It\u2019s more a swaggering, sword-and-sandal epic that prizes the need to entertain above all else. No one in \u201cGladiator II\u201d understands that more than Denzel Washington. His performance as the Machiavellian power broker Macrinus is a delicious blur of robes and grins \u2013 so compellingly over-the-top that he nearly reaches 1990s Al Pacino standards.",
      "Inside this Rome are scattered interests in toppling it, including Marcus Acacius, a decorated general who has just returned from a successful campaign taking Numidia in northwest Africa. (That siege makes the movie\u2019s blistering opening, with an armada racing at almost NASCAR speed toward the walled city, with towers on the bows of the boats to scale the parapets.)",
      "Acacius is a loyal Roman but, when he learns that the emperors have only more bloodlust for further territory and more war, he and his wife, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) begin plotting to overthrow the brothers.",
      "In a movie where everyone nurtures some secret, few stay hidden long. Foremost among them is Lucius Verus, a warrior in Numidia who\u2019s taken prisoner and forced to fight as a gladiator. He\u2019s the son of Lucilla and Maximus (Crowe in \u201cGladiator\u201d). Following the events of that film, Lucilla sent him, an heir to the empire, to Numidia to grow up outside of the empire\u2019s power struggles.",
      "Mescal, the terrific Irish actor of \u201cAftersun\u201d and \u201cAll of Us Strangers,\u201d smoothly steps into a blockbuster arena for the first time. \u201cThis one is interesting,\u201d says Macrinus, eyeing him for the first time. Mescal\u2019s Lucius is vengeful \u2014 the Roman army kills his warrior wife in the Numidia battle. \u201cRage pours out of you like milk,\u201d Macrinus says, admiringly. The glint of mischief in Mescal\u2019s eyes gives Lucius a little more character than your average revenge-seeking gladiator.",
      "We watch as Lucius cunningly survives arena after arena. Meanwhile, Macrinus manipulates him to steer the public\u2019s routing interest away from the emperor. It\u2019s a rich if slightly cartoonish tapestry of palace intrigue, with Macrinus deftly pulling all the strings.",
      "But, really, none of the power machinations are as compelling as the increasingly carnivalesque scenes of the Coliseum. In the gladiators' first trip there, they\u2019re greeted by man-eating monkeys. Next, it\u2019s a rider atop a giant, charging rhinoceros. Then, the piece de resistance: a flooded Coliseum festering with sharks. There are even little mock islands with palm trees spread about.",
      "Now, \u201cGladiator II\u201d may not stand up to much inquiry from historians. (Some issues were also taken with Scott\u2019s last historical epic, \u201cNapoleon,\u201d which likewise was scripted by David Scarpa). But this is not a movie built for accuracy. It\u2019s made for taking a few bits of history and inflating them into a feast and the charms of watching Washington\u2019s Macrinus brandish a head recently relieved of its body.",
      "Yes, heads do roll in Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator\u201d sequel. Macrinus succeeds in whipping Rome into a frenzy. In fact, he does it so easily and guilefully that, once things begin unraveling for him, the air leaves \u201cGladiator II.\u201d You don\u2019t quite believe his recklessness after he so patiently and artfully turned the screws.",
      "Nevertheless, two possible successors emerge \u2013 Lucius, who has a birthright to the throne, and Macrinus, who comes to within its grasp purely by his own wit. Is it any wonder that I was rooting for Macrinus, all the way? How could you not, with Washington chewing scenery like this and making zestful (and rather apt) pronouncements like: \u201cThat, my friend, is politics!\u201d",
      "\u201cGladiator II,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release. is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cstrong bloody violence.\u201d Running time: 148 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "She fled her village after it was attacked by extremists, leaving her husband and her farm behind. Since then, she has been moving from place to place, struggling to pay rent and to buy enough food for her children, including a 2-year-old toddler.",
      "But last month, she got to be a queen.",
      "Every day for a week, together with dozens of other Burkinabe men and women who have been displaced by extremist violence, she swirled, danced and chanted for almost two hours in front of captivated audiences at Recreatrales, an international theater festival held in Ouagadougou, the country's capital.",
      "\u201cI was so happy about it,\" she said. \"I don't even know how to explain how it felt.\u201d",
      "Burkina Faso, a landlocked nation of 23 million in Sahel, an arid strip of land south of the Sahara, used to be known for its bustling arts scene, including renowned film and theater festivals, and its sophisticated craftsmanship.",
      "But in recent years, the country has become the symbol of the security crisis in the region. It has been shaken by violence from extremist groups and the government forces fighting them, much of it spilling over the border with Mali, and by two ensuing military coups.",
      "The military junta, which took power by force in 2022, failed to provide the stability it promised. Instead, the situation deteriorated: According to conservative estimates, more than 60% of the country is now outside of government control, more than 2 million people have lost their homes and almost 6.5 million need humanitarian aid to survive.",
      "The country's leader, Capt. Ibrahim Traore, installed a system of de-facto censorship, where those critical of the regime disappear or get forcefully drafted into the army, and where even friends are afraid to discuss politics with each other.",
      "But against all odds, last month the Bougsemtenga district in the capital turned into a festival grounds to host Recreatrales for the 13th time.",
      "Bougsemtenga derives its name from \u201cbougtenga,\u201d which means \u201chappiness district\u201d in Moore, one of the local languages. True to its origins, this year its streets were transformed into a dreamy universe, resembling a crossover between a traditional village festival and \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\" More than 150 African and European artists performed and over 4,500 theater lovers were able to escape the country's grim reality, if just for a little while.",
      "Improvised theater stages were constructed inside people\u2019s courtyards. The streets were decorated with colorful lights and abstract sculptures made by locals from plastic bottles and scraps of wax-printed fabrics. Residents put up hand decorated stands, selling beer and meat sticks to multinational crowds of theatergoers, ranging from Western diplomats to local mechanics. The ticket booth was a giant frog, its mouth wide open.",
      "Aristide Tarnagda, the festival\u2019s artistic director, said he was convinced that regardless of the insecurity engulfing the country, the festival had to take place as planned.",
      "Theater is an affirmation of \u201cthe primacy of life over death,\u201d Tarnagda said. He added that getting together to perform and watch theatrical productions is a form of resistance against adversity and violence. This is why this year's theme was \"Turning the face to the sun.\u201d",
      "\u201cHumans are capable of love and freedom, but sometimes they forget it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe role of the theater is to remind them about it.\u201d",
      "Held every two years, the festival is the culmination of the yearlong work that the organizers do with residents of the Bougsemtenga district, which was home to two theaters and a theater association even before the first Recreatrales in 2002.",
      "They run art workshops, including in writing, theater, dance and scenography, for young people from the district and from all of Africa, and organize mentoring sessions and business skills classes for local women. The goal is to get as many people as possible involved, said Odile Sankara, the festival's director.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a working class district,\" Sankara said. \u201dWe want to encourage people to take an interest in art, to get a taste of it.\"",
      "She added: \u201cArt is a powerful weapon to fight for more light, more humanity and more love,\u201d especially while her country and the whole Sahel region were going through a security and humanitarian crisis.",
      "Claude Ilboudo, a 30-year-old from Bougsemtenga, has performed in the opening ceremonies of Recreatrales as a dancer since its first edition. He used to work as a glazier, and dancing was just his past time. But Ilboudo's life took a turn when five years ago he severely injured his right hand at work and could no longer do his job.",
      "It was then that Ilboudo discovered a passion for theater and started working for the Recreatrales association. \u201cTheater saved me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt made me discover what I could do.\u201d",
      "This year, Ilboudo was part of the team that prepared the opening play with the internally displaced actors from scratch, including the concept, scenario and choreography. It was also the first time he personally interacted with people who had to flee their homes because of extremist violence.",
      "For internally displaced people, theater is not just a tool for therapy, helping them to process trauma, said Sankara, the artistic director. It's a way for a group that has been marginalized and isolated in Burkinabe society to be seen by others.",
      "During the play, Dabone, the displaced mother of three, stood at center stage with her toddler tied to her back and spit out a long, white paper strip. It symbolized all the haunting thoughts leaving her body, she said. But the question remains \u2014 for how long.",
      "\u201cLife is very difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when I am on the stage, I feel joy. It\u2019s when I have to go back home that all these thoughts are coming back to my head.\"",

      "Ah, the Christmas movie. That old chestnut. That cozy perennial pastime where \u2014 let\u2019s just pick one scene from \u201cRed One\u201d \u2014 Dwayne Johnson, playing Santa\u2019s body guard, faces off with a witch-possessed mercenary (Nick Kroll) and ice-sword-wielding CGI snowmen on the sandy beaches of Aruba. Can\u2019t you just taste the eggnog?",
      "Such are the ugly-sweater clashes of \u201cRed One,\u201d a big-budget gambit to supersize the Christmas movie. Countless movies before have wrestled with who Santa is. Does he really exist? But \u201cRed One\u201d is the first one to answer doubters with a superhero-like St. Nick who runs his North Pole operation like the army, who bench presses and counts carbs and who, given that he\u2019s played by J.K. Simmons, looks like he could teach one heck of a jazz class.",
      "There is ample time during \u201cRed One,\u201d which opens in theaters Thursday, to ponder who, exactly, put a Marvel-ized Santa on their wish list. The movie, directed by the \u201cJumanji\u201d reboot filmmaker Jake Kasdan and scripted by the veteran \u201cFast & Furious\u201d screenwriter Chris Morgan, was conceived by producer Hiram Garcia as the start of a holiday franchise for Amazon MGM Studios \u2014 presumably to satisfy those who have pined for a Christmas movie but with, you, know, more military industrial complex.",
      "\u201cRed One,\u201d which is brightened by its other A-list star, Chris Evans, is a little self-aware about its own inherent silliness. But not nearly enough. There is a better, funnier movie underneath all the CGI gloss. But overwhelmed by effects and overelaborate world building (there are trolls, ogres and a headless horsemen here, all loosely connected as mythical creatures), \u201cRed One\u201d feels like an unwanted high-priced Christmas present.",
      "\u201cI love the kids. It\u2019s the grown-ups that are killing me.\u201d",
      "So announces Callum Drift (Johnson), a long-serving security operative for Santa. He\u2019s not an elf but a member of ELF, Enforcement Logistics and Fortification. (Don\u2019t you just feel the holiday cheer welling up inside?) But after years, even centuries on the job, Callum\u2019s faith in Christmas traditions is waning. For the first time, those on the naughty list outnumber the nice. On a mall visit two days before Christmas, he looks despondently at adults bickering over presents, if not outright stealing them.",
      "Callum and other operatives with earpieces shuttle Santa (\u201cRed One\u201d in their secret service-styled lingo) in a fleet of Suburbans to his sleigh, which, while pulled by reindeer, moves more like a spaceship. Back at the North Pole \u2014 picture a sort of wintery Abu Dhabi \u2014 Santa is kidnapped. The culprits leave only spilt milk behind. The ensuing hunt, overseen by the chief of a special ops group protecting mystical beings (Lucy Liu), leads immediately to a hacker who helped an anonymous client geolocate Santa.",
      "The for-hire hacker, Jack O\u2019Malley (Evans) is a deadbeat dad to his son (Wesley Kimmel), and, we\u2019re informed, a \u201clevel-four naughty-lister.\u201d Evans might be most famous for his Captain America, but smarmy smart-aleck (like in \u201cKnives Out\u201d) is really his wheelhouse. And he gives \u201cRed One\u201d some comic energy as it transitions into a sort of buddy comedy with him and Johnson.",
      "But \u201cRed One\u201d keeps overdoing it. As they race to rescue Santa before Christmas Eve, the hunt brings in the villainous Christmas Witch, Gryla (Kiernan Shipka) and Krampus (Kristofer Hivju), here defined as Santa's brother. The sensation, with these characters and others, is of stuffing too much into an already gaudy stocking, and yet somehow forgetting to add any charm.",
      "\u201cRed One\u201d comes off a little like the holiday version of \u201cCowboys and Aliens\" \u2014 enough so to make you nostalgic for leaner tales about folkloric figures starring Johnson, like \u201cThe Tooth Fairy.\u201d But if we're to have every possible brand of Christmas movie, it seems a shame that when the phrase \u201cThe North Pole has been taken!\u201d Gerard Butler is nowhere to be seen.",
      "\u201cRed One,\u201d an Amazon MGM Studios release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for action, some violence, and language. Running time: 133 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "Richard Price may be the street\u2019s premiere storyteller",
      "Is there a better writer of urban American stories than Richard Price? His resume is hart to beat: To episodes of HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Wire,\u201d and \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d and novels like \u201cClockers,\u201d \u201cLush Life,\u201d and \u201cFreedomland,\u201d fans can now add \u201cLazarus Man.\u201d",
      "The story opens with a boom, literally. A five-story tenement in East Harlem collapses, killing dozens and leaving survivors milling about in a \u201cmix of hot tar, cement dust and burning trash.\u201d Into that setting step our main characters: Royal Davis, the owner of a funeral home forced to chase after tragedies for bodies; Mary Roe, a city detective working the community affairs beat; Felix Pearl, a 20-something new to the city who\u2019s talented with a camera; and Anthony Carter, middle-aged, unemployed, and six months sober, found in the ruins days after the explosion and who becomes the novel\u2019s title character.",
      "Price\u2019s screenplay writing experience is noticeable as he hops from character to character, sometimes offering just a paragraph or two about their past and what\u2019s happening to them in the present before skipping to the next. It\u2019s jarring at times, but you fall into an easy rhythm as the pages turn. All the characters collide at one point or another following the explosion, and the novel draws you in with its authenticity.",
      "Here\u2019s Price inside Felix\u2019s head as he watches the \u201cgigantic neighborhood simpleton, Robert Cornish, aka Green Mile, aka the Rooster\u201d wandering the streets before his 80-year-old aunt comes outside to retrieve him: \u201cNot to say that his neighbors were nonstop hearts and flowers toward each other, but no one ever passed judgment on you for just being who you naturally were.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the details. too, that Price always nails. Mary, reminded of her time working an open-air morgue outside Bellevue Hospital after the 9/11 attacks: \u201c(She\u2019d) been part of an assembly line of detectives set up to collect whatever IDs they could from wallets and phones, jewelry and watches, the constant sharp snap of fingers being broken in order to remove rings still with her after all these years.\u201d",
      "The book is more of a tapestry than any traditional storytelling structure. There\u2019s no great mystery to solve besides how Anthony survived the explosion, and even when the truth is revealed, most readers will have known it long before. Price\u2019s overarching message is a simple one amid the hard-luck stories: People want someone to root for them. Or as Anthony, aka Lazarus Man, tells a crowd at a community event following another death on the streets outside the projects: \u201cWho here, not just in these houses, but anywhere in the world young hearts need to be nurtured and protected, couldn\u2019t use a helping hand?\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- There are few images more indelible in the history of American dance: Judith Jamison, regal and passionate in white leotard and long ruffled skirt, punching the air in \u201cCry\" \u2014 Alvin Ailey\u2019s piercing solo about Black womanhood.",
      "That searing 1971 piece made her an international star. But it was truly only the beginning of Jamison\u2019s decades-long career atop modern dance, onstage and off. As Ailey\u2019s hand-picked successor beginning in 1989, she led his namesake company for more than 20 years, helping it become the most successful modern dance troupe in the nation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Jamison, who died Saturday at 81 after a brief illness, reflected in an interview with The Associated Press in 2018, marking the company\u2019s then-60th anniversary. \u201cI find it remarkable that we still exist today,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think Mr. Ailey would be absolutely beside-himself happy, that something he started 60 years ago could blossom into everything he imagined.\u201d",
      "And likely much more. Jamison brought the company not only continued global exposure and crossover cultural appeal but economic stability and growth, putting it in \u201ca stratosphere that Ailey couldn\u2019t even imagine,\u201d said Wendy Perron, author and former longtime editor of Dance Magazine.",
      "Perron attributes Jamison\u2019s success, in a world when many dance companies struggle to survive, to her unique personality and ability to forge relationships. \u201cThere was a warmth and magnetism about her \u2014 everyone wanted to be with her,\u201d said Perron. \u201cThere was a light shining around her.\u201d",
      "Taking the reins as artistic director upon Ailey\u2019s death at 58, Jamison introduced new works and choreography, but also made sure to keep front and center her predecessor's undisputed masterpiece: \u201cRevelations,\u201d a 1960 classic that has defined the company and powered its success like few others, if any, in the history of dance.",
      "It was in \u201cRevelations,\u201d a telling of Black history through spirituals and blues, that Jamison also made a mark as a dancer, holding a white parasol with one arm as she undulated the rest of her body in a baptismal scene \u2013 \u201cthe umbrella woman,\u201d as the part became known.",
      "To this day, \u201cRevelations\u201d appears on most of the company\u2019s programs, at home in New York and on tour, and is referred to as the most-seen work of modern dance. (It's hard to conceive of anything comparable.) \u201cRevelations\u201d was even performed at the White House, at a dance event hosted by Michelle Obama in 2010, in which the first lady paid tribute to Jamison, calling her \u201can amazing, phenomenal, \u2018fly\u2019 woman.\u201d",
      "Obama also told Jamison from the stage that a photo of her in \u201cCry\u201d had been \u201cthe only piece of art\u201d in the Obamas' home before the White House, and that her daughters, Malia and Sasha, had asked her: \u201cIs that the lady in the picture?\u201d",
      "A year later, retiring as artistic director, Jamison exclaimed to a cheering crowd at New York City Center gathered to honor her: \u201cI have come a long way from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania!\u201d That\u2019s where Jamison was born in 1943 and raised, her childhood spent training in various dance forms, including ballet, modern and tap.",
      "\u201cI knew I had so much energy back then \u2013 just too much for everybody,\u201d she quipped in a 2023 podcast interview. \u201cBut my parents went, \u2018OK, lets direct her this way.\u2019\u201d She credited her mother\u2019s dedication \u2014 she made her daughter\u2019s costumes, and \u201cwould massage my legs when I got home from class.\u201d",
      "In 1964, famed choreographer Agnes de Mille had seen Jamison in a class and brought her to New York to participate in a production of American Ballet Theatre. Soon after, the young dancer went to an audition for a TV special \u2014 and flubbed it, she said. But Ailey was there, and she soon was invited to join his fledgling company.",
      "She wasn\u2019t sure what he saw in her, she has said, other than a look: \u201cSmall head, broad shoulders, long arms and long legs.\u201d",
      "With the young company, Jamison traveled to Europe and Africa. Even then, it took her a few years to appreciate that this could be a career. Partly this was because, as she noted in the 2023 podcast, \u201cWe were getting paid doodly-squat\u201d \u2013 envelopes that sometimes contained a $20 bill, and sometimes just a thank-you note.",
      "But she soon realized that she loved dancing, traveling and being around other dancers. The Ailey troupe was also a rare outlet at the time for Black talent. \u201cThere were no outlets,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no place for us to say, \"Hey look, this is our artistry, this is our culture, and guess what else we can do?\u201d",
      "Ailey chose Jamison for \u201cCry\u201d in 1971, a work he dedicated to Black women everywhere, but especially mothers. On opening night, Jamison has said, she didn\u2019t know if she was going to make it though the demanding, 16-minute solo.",
      "She told the Hollywood Reporter that \u201cwhen the curtain went down, I was on the floor.\u201d She got up to take a bow, \u201cand I kept taking bows over and over until I don\u2019t know which number it was, but they were still screaming and yelling.\u201d",
      "Over the next two decades, Jamison often appeared as a guest artist with companies around the world, and left the Ailey troupe in 1980 to star on Broadway in \u201cSophisticated Ladies.\" She also formed her own company, The Jamison Project.",
      "Then an ailing Ailey told her he\u2019d like her to run the company after him.",
      "Jamison recalled, in the AP interview in 2018, being present as Ailey died, along with fellow dancer Sylvia Waters and Ailey\u2019s mother.",
      "\u201cWe were in his room as he passed, and usually you see in movies, that people have their last breath and they breathe out. But Mr. Ailey breathed IN. We expected him to breathe out, and he didn\u2019t. So I think what we\u2019re living on now, is his breath OUT ... that air, that vision, that dream.\u201d",
      "Among her many laurels, Jamison was awarded Kennedy Center Honors in 1999 and a National Medal of the Arts in 2001.",
      "Perron, the former Dance Magazine editor, said she felt Jamison had been overlooked somewhat as a choreographer. She pointed to \u201cA Case of You\u201d \u2014 a duet to Diana Krall\u2019s version of the Joni Mitchell classic and part of Jamison\u2019s 2005 \u201cReminiscin.'\" The duet, Perron said, was \u201chappy and sad and passionate and inventive .. you really believe these people are passionately in love.\u201d",
      "Jamison passed the artistic director baton to choreographer Robert Battle in 2011. Looking back, she has said one of her proudest moments at the company was the creation of the Joan Weill Center for Dance in 2005, a midtown Manhattan home for the company.",
      "\u201cMajestic\u201d and \u201cqueenly\u201d is how Waters, now Ailey II Artistic Director Emerita, described her late colleague.",
      "\u201cShe was a unique, spectacular dancer,\" Waters said. \u201cTo dance with her and to be in her sphere of energy was mesmerizing.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Lou Donaldson, a celebrated jazz saxophonist with a warm, fluid style who performed with everyone from Thelonius Monk to George Benson and was sampled by Nas, De La Soul and other hip-hop artists, has died. He was 98.",
      "Donaldson died Saturday, according to a statement on his website. Additional details were not immediately available.",
      "A native of Badin, North Carolina and a World War II veteran, Donaldson was part of the bop scene that emerged after the war and early in his career recorded with Monk, Milt Jackson and others. Donaldson also helped launch the career of Clifford Brown, the gifted trumpeter who was just 25 when he was killed in a 1956 road accident. Donaldson also was on hand for some of pianist Horace Silver's earliest sessions.",

His notable albums included \u201cAlligator Bogaloo,\u201d \u201cLou Donaldson at His Best\u201d and \u201cWailing With Lou.\u201d Donaldson would open his shows with a cool, jazzy jam from 1958, \u201cBlues Walk.\u201d",

Tommy James, with hits including \u201dMony Mony,\u2033 \u201dCrimson and Clover\u2033 and \u201dI Think We\u2019re Alone Now,\u2033 has also earned a nod.",
      "If Jackson, whose 1989 album \u201cRhythm Nation\u201d was a landmark, gets into the Hall, it will be more than two decades after her late brother Michael. The Canadian songwriter Morissette, whose influential \u201cJagged Little Pill\u201d has won Grammys, Tonys, Junos and MTV awards would also add to the Hall's rocking women.

It's even harder to believe that it became an Emmy-winning hit with a cast invited to the White House to talk about mental health.",

So you see it layered on and there are interesting moments along that process. But it was always at the end of the day when I would take my clothes off and I would sort of have this old German caretaker face and then my sort of scrawny sort of 40-year-old body underneath. That was very disjointed and odd.",
      "LYNCH: That\u2019s one thing that this show does really well and what Ronan (Bennett), our writer, did really well in that, that running in parallel happened so seamlessly that you don\u2019t really see it coming. And every single episode you feel like you want to root for someone like Bianca but the Jackal just makes sense. Even though he\u2019s just done something completely heinous. You almost want to be him, which is, I think, the point.",
      "LYNCH: No, although we crossed over with the spy training. Spy training, which was us just walking around Covent Garden, looking through shop windows, using our phones and car mirrors to find people, to track people and record them without them seeing. This is not just regular people on the street. This is someone that we\u2019ve specifically said!",
      "REDMAYNE: Did they? Oh no! They\u2019ve stolen our thunder.",
      "REDMAYNE: We didn\u2019t do it on the same day. I would have to ask Paul, our spy expert, about that, but I imagine Lashana was better.",
      "LYNCH: No, no.",
      "REDMAYNE: You\u2019re sort of more deft around a corner, certainly with the guns you are. Because I spent most of my gun training working on sniper rifles. So when it came to bits when I had to do that thing and move like that (mimes holding a gun) around the corner, I was a bit crap."

      "NEW YORK -- Latin music has taken the world by storm, sparking industry conversations for the past few years. Across platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, numbers have skyrocketed, making it the fastest growing streaming genre in the United States.",
      "The Latin Grammy Awards, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, has worked to recognize and promote Latin music worldwide. This year, the Latin Recording Academy brings its star-studded celebration to Miami, the heart of Latin culture in the U.S., where they are headquartered. Here is what to know:",
      "The 25th Annual Latin Grammy Awards will take place Nov. 14 at the Kaseya Center in Miami. It will air live on Univision, UniM\u00e1s, Galavisi\u00f3n and ViX beginning at 8 p.m. EST.",
      "For the second consecutive year, producer and songwriter \u00c9dgar Barrera leads the nominations. Known for his work with artists like Madonna, Karol G, Peso Pluma, Shakira and Grupo Frontera \u2014 Barrera is up for nine awards. Last year he received 13 nominations and won three.",
      "Close behind him are some of his collaborators, reggaet\u00f3n superstars Karol G and Bad Bunny, who are tied with eight nominations each.",
      "Performers at this year's bash include Barrera, Residente, Myke Towers, DJ Khaled, Jon Bon Jovi, Joe Jonas, Anitta, Becky G, Eladio Carri\u00f3n, Grupo Frontera, Kali Uchis, Pitbull, Luis Fonsi, Juan Luis Guerra, Car\u00edn Le\u00f3n and more.",
      "Colombian singer Carlos Vives, the recipient of the 2024 Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year, will also perform.",
      "There are also two new categories this year: best Latin electronic music performance, housed within the new electronic music field, and best contemporary Mexican music album.",
      "Latin Recording Academy CEO Manuel Abud likens the Recording Academy \u2014 the governing body behind the Grammys \u2014 and the Latin Recording Academy to sister organizations.",
      "\u201cOr maybe even mother and daughter,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThe basis is the same: We are membership-based organizations for music creators and music professionals. So, we\u2019re celebrating musical excellence. We have the exact DNA. Our entire process is a Grammy process.\"",
      "While the Grammys focus on the U.S. market, he says, the Latin Grammys have different global considerations. \"Our voting process is, I would say, identical, but it has some adjustments for the international component that we have that they don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "He adds that artists can be dual members of the Recording Academy and the Latin Recording Academy, if they are Latin artists based in the U.S.",
      "The trophies themselves are also very similar: Both are gramophone-shaped, but the base of a Latin Grammy is burgundy, while the Grammys' is black.",
      "\"We are a licensee of the Recording Academy,\u201d said Abud. \u201cThe Recording Academy has four members on my board, including their chair and their CEO.\u201d",
      "In the late \u201990s and early \u201900s, Latin artists had success when they \u201ccrossed over\u201d and performed in English: \u201cThe Ricky Martins and the Gloria Estefans,\u201d as Abud describes them. But today, he said, artists are singing in Spanish. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to do the crossover.\u201d",
      "And even more noteworthy: English-speaking artists now want to work with Spanish-speaking artists in their native language.",
      "Gabriel Abaroa Jr., the Latin Recording Academy's former president and CEO (2003-2021) and current president emeritus agrees.",
      "He traces the story of the Latin Grammys to 1997, when the Recording Academy started paying closer attention to Latin music. That same year, the Latin Recording Academy was established to celebrate the diverse musical landscape of Latin music in Latin America, Spain, Brazil, Portugal and beyond \u2014 not just the artists breaking through in the U.S.",
      "The inaugural Latin Grammy Awards were held in Los Angeles in 2000, followed by shows in Miami, New York City, Houston, Seville, Spain and Las Vegas.",
      "Initially, the awards ceremony was broadcast in English, a decision that proved to be a misstep. \u201cAsking our talent to communicate in English was pretty bad,\u201d recalls Abaroa Jr. \u201cThe artists didn\u2019t want to (participate) because they felt that we were disrespecting them by making them speak in a language other than theirs.\"",
      "The worst part, he said, was that even the Mexican audience, which \u201ccomprised 75% of the market at the time,\u201d didn't turn on the TV to watch the show because \"they hated to see it in English.\u201d",
      "In response, the Latin Grammys transitioned to Spanish-language broadcasts in 2005, a transformative decision for its audience \u2014 and one that directly reflects the ways in which Latin music would be enjoyed in the years to come.",
      "The Latin Grammys will continue its global expansion by holding future awards shows in various international locations.",
      "Last year, the 2023 Latin Grammys were held in Seville, Spain, marking the first time the show took place outside the U.S.",
      "The move, facilitated by a nearly 19 million-euro deal between the government of Andalusia and the Latin Recording Academy, sparked some controversy, with some criticizing the Latin Grammys decision to hold the show in the very European country that colonized much of Latin America.",
      "Both Abud and Abaroa Jr. consider the Seville event a great success.",
      "\u201cIn the next couple of years, you will see another international edition of the Latin Grammys,\u201d said Abud.",

      "Dogs 4 Valor, operated through the Olathe, Kansas-based organization called The Battle Within, helps retired veterans and first responders work with their service dogs to help manage depression, anxiety and other challenges.",
      "\u201cA lot of times the veteran with severe PTSD is homebound,\u201d said Sandra Sindeldecker, program manager for Dogs 4 Valor. \u201cThey\u2019re isolated. They\u2019re very nervous. They won\u2019t make eye contact. Some won\u2019t leave the house at all.\u201d",
      "The program involves both group and one-on-one training. The goal is to get the veteran and the dog comfortable with each other and understanding each other. The group takes outings to help the veterans regain their footing in public places like airports. Program leaders also provide mental health therapy at no cost.",
      "The veterans and dogs graduate in six to nine months, but group gatherings continue.",
      "There is growing evidence of the value of service dogs for veterans with PTSD. A small study published in JAMA Network Open in June looked at a program operated by K9s For Warriors. Service dogs in the program are taught to pick up a veteran\u2019s physical signs of distress and can interrupt panic attacks and nightmares with a loving nudge.",
      "Researchers compared 81 veterans who received service dogs with 75 veterans on the waiting list for a trained dog. After three months, PTSD symptoms improved in both groups, but the veterans with dogs saw a bigger improvement on average.",

      "O\u2019Brien says she can now go out in public again \u2014 she even went on vacation to Branson, Missouri, \u201cthings that I never would have thought I would do really, probably ever again.\u201d",
      "Mark Atkinson, 38, served in Afghanistan as a corporal in the Marine Corps. He returned home with PTSD and major depressive disorder, causing sleeplessness and anxiety. He adopted Lexi, now 5, in 2020.",
      "Lexi, a muscular cane corso breed, needed Atkinson as much as he needed her. Her previous owner had kept Lexi in chains before surrendering her. Since joining Dogs 4 Valor, the two can get out together and enjoy life.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really like leaving the house because I\u2019m safe there, you know?\" Atkinson said. \u201cAnd having Lexi has just made me get out to be more social.\u201d",
      "Having a group of fellow veterans facing the same challenges has also helped, Atkinson said.",
      "\u201cWe come from the same backgrounds, different branches,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cSame issues. You know, PTSD or traumatic brain injuries. And they\u2019re all very welcoming, as well. There\u2019s no judgment.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Brien compared living with Albus to a relationship with a sometimes pushy best friend who often wants to go out.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m able to talk, not fly off the handle and just get along with people and not be as stressed, not have as much anxiety,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cOr even if I do, she (Lexi) is right there with me.\u201d",
      "Timothy Siebenmorgen, 61, said his relationships also are better with help from his 1-year-old American bulldog, Rosie, and Dogs 4 Valor, which he joined in July. He served in both the Marines and the Army, deploying 18 times.",

      "WHO said the Burundi outbreak is also being driven by the newer variant, which causes less severe symptoms \u2014 meaning people who are infectious may not realize they are spreading it. In the last two weeks, Burundi has reported more than 200 new mpox cases every week, mostly in children and young adults.",
      "In Uganda, which reported 100 new cases last week, WHO said the virus is spreading mostly through sex, with the vast majority of cases in adults.",
      "Mpox -- previously known as monkeypox because it was first seen in research monkeys \u2014 is spread primarily through close skin-to-skin contact with infected people or their soiled clothes or bedsheets. It often causes visible skin lesions that could make people less likely to be in close contact with others.",
      "In August, WHO declared the rapid spread of mpox in Congo and elsewhere in Africa to be a global health emergency. To date, Africa has reported more than 46,000 suspected cases, including 1,081 deaths.",
      "WHO said it would convene an expert meeting on Nov. 22 to determine if mpox still constitutes an international emergency.",
      "Last week, Britain announced the first instance of the more infectious kind of mpox spreading beyond Africa. It identified mpox in a person who had recently traveled to Africa and in three of their household contacts. All the individuals are currently being treated in two London hospitals.",

      "Four-year-old Hussein Mikdad survived an Israeli airstrike on his home in a Beirut suburb last month",
      "BEIRUT -- Curled up in his father \u2019s lap, clinging to his chest, Hussein Mikdad cried his heart out. The 4-year-old kicked his doctor with his intact foot and pushed him away with the arm that was not in a cast. \u201cMy Dad! My Dad!\" Hussein said. \"Make him leave me alone!\u201d With eyes tearing up in relief and pain, the father reassured his son and pulled him closer.",
      "Hussein and his father, Hassan, are the only survivors of their family after an Israeli airstrike last month on their Beirut neighborhood. The strike killed 18 people, including his mother, three siblings and six relatives.",
      "\u201cCan he now shower?\u201d the father asked the doctor.",
      "Ten days after surgery, doctors examining Hussein's wounds said the boy is healing properly. He has rods in his fractured right thigh and stitches that assembled his torn tendons back in place on the right arm. The pain has subsided, and Hussein should be able to walk again in two months \u2014 albeit with a lingering limp.",
      "A prognosis for Hussein's invisible wounds is much harder to give. He is back in diapers and has begun wetting his bed. He hardly speaks and has not said a word about his mother, two sisters and brother.",
      "\u201cThe trauma is not just on the muscular skeletal aspect. But he is also mentally hurt,\u201d Imad Nahle, one of Hussein\u2019s orthopedic surgeons, said.",
      "Israel said, without elaborating, that the strike on the Mikdad neighborhood struck a Hezbollah target. In the war that has escalated since September, Israeli airstrikes have increasingly hit residential areas around Lebanon. Israel accuses the Lebanese militant group of hiding its capabilities and fighters among civilians. It vows to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "But children have been caught in the midst.",
      "With more strikes on homes and in residential areas, doctors are seeing more children affected by the violence. More than 100 children have been killed in Lebanon in the past six weeks and hundreds injured. And of the 14,000 wounded since last year, around 10% are children. Many have been left with severed limbs, burned bodies, and broken families \u2014 scars that could last for a lifetime.",
      "Ghassan Abu Sittah, a renowned British-Palestinian surgeon who is also treating Hussein, sees that long road ahead. This is his worry: \u201cIt leaves us with a generation of physically wounded children, children who are psychologically and emotionally wounded.\"",
      "At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which is receiving limited cases of war casualties, Nahle said he operated on five children in the past five weeks \u2014 up from no cases before. Most were referred from south and eastern Lebanon.",
      "A few miles away, at the Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui, one of the country\u2019s largest burns centers increased its capacity by nearly 180% since September so it could accommodate more war wounded, its medical director Naji Abirached said. About a fifth of the newly admitted patients are children.",
      "In one of the burn center\u2019s ICU units lies Ivana Skakye. She turned 2 in the hospital ward last week. Ivana has been healing from burns she sustained following an Israeli airstrike outside their home in southern Lebanon on Sept. 23. Israel said it struck ammunition depots and launchers in southern Lebanon that day when its warplanes launched hundreds of airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, making it the deadliest day of the war so far. More than 500 people were killed.",
      "Six weeks later, the tiny Ivana remains wrapped in white gauze from head to toe except her torso. She sustained third-degree burns over 40 percent of her body. Her hair and head, her left side all the way to her legs, both her arms and her chest were burned. Her family home was damaged, its ceiling set afire. The family\u2019s valuables, packed in their car as they prepared to leave, were also torched. Ivana\u2019s older sister, Rahaf, 7, has recovered faster from burns to her face and hands.",
      "Fatima Zayoun, their mother, was in the kitchen when the explosion hit. Zayoun jumped up to grab the girls, who were playing on the terrace.",
      "It was, Zayoun said, \"as if something lifted me up so that I can grab my kids. I have no idea how I managed to pull them in and throw them out of the window. She spoke from the ICU burns unit. \u201cThey were not on fire, but they were burned. Black ash covered them. ... (Ivana) was without any hair. I told myself, `That is not her.'\u201d",
      "Now, Ivana's wound dressings are changed every two days. Her doctor, Ziad Sleiman, said she could be discharged in a few days. She\u2019s back again to saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cBye \u2014 shorthand for wanting to go out.",
      "Like Hussein, though, Ivana has no home to return to. Her parents fear collective shelters could cause an infection to return.",
      "After seeing her kids \u201csizzling on the floor,\u201d Zayoun, 35, said that even if their home is repaired, she wouldn\u2019t want to return. \u201cI saw death with my own eyes,\u201d she said.",
      "Zayoun was 17 last time Israel and Hezbollah were at war, in 2006. Displaced with her family then, she said she almost enjoyed the experience, riding out of their village in a truck full of their belongings, mixing with new people, learning new things. They returned home when the war was over.",
      "\u201cBut this war is hard. They are hitting everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do they want from us? Do they want to hurt our children? We are not what they are looking for.\"",
      "Abu Sittah, the reconstructive surgeon, said most of the children's injuries are from blasts or collapsing rubble. That attack on a space they expect to be inviolable can have lingering effects.",
      "\u201cChildren feel safe at home,\" he said. \"The injury makes them for the first time lose that sense of security \u2014 that their parents are keeping them safe, that their homes are invincible, and suddenly their homes become not so.\u201d",
      "One recent morning, children were playing in the courtyard of a vocational school-turned-shelter in Dekwaneh, north of Beirut, where nearly 3,000 people displaced from the south are now living. The parents were busy with an overflowing bathroom that serves one floor in a building that houses nearly 700 people.",
      "Only playtime brings the children, from different villages in the south, together. They were divided in two teams, ages ranging between 6 and 12, competing to get the handkerchief first. A tiny girl hugged and held hands with strangers visiting the shelter. \u201cI am from Lebanon. Don't tell anyone,\u201d she whispered in their ears.",
      "The game turned rowdy when two girls in their early teens got into a fist fight. Pushing and shoving began. Tears and tantrums followed. The tiny girl walked away in a daze.",
      "Maria Elizabeth Haddad, manager of the psychosocial support programs in Beirut and neighboring areas for the U.S.-based International Medical Corps, said parents in shelters reported signs of increased anxiety, hostility and aggression among kids. They talk back to parents and ignore rules. Some have developed speech impediments and clinginess. One is showing early signs of psychosis.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be residual symptoms when they grow up, especially related to attachment ties, to feeling of security,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cIt is a generational trauma. We have experienced it before with our parents. ... They don\u2019t have stability or search for (extra) stability. This is not going to be easy to overcome.\u201d",
      "Children represent more than a third of over 1 million people displaced by the war in Lebanon and following Israeli evacuation notices, according to U.N. and government estimates (more than 60,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel). That leaves hundreds of thousands in Lebanon without schooling, either because their schools were inaccessible or have been turned into shelters.",
      "Hussein's father says he and his son must start together from scratch. With help from relatives, the two have found a temporary shelter in a home \u2014 and, for the father, a brief sense of relief. \u201cI thank God he is not asking for or about his mother and his siblings,\u201d said Hassan Mikdad, the 40-year-old father.",
      "He has no explanation for his son, who watched their family die in their home. His two sisters \u2014 Celine, 10, and Cila, 14 \u2014 were pulled out of the rubble the following day. His mother, Mona, was pulled out three days later. She was locked in an embrace with her 6-year-old son, Ali.",
      "The strike on Oct. 21 also caused damage across the street, to one of Beirut\u2019s main public hospitals, breaking solar panels and windows in the pharmacy and the dialysis unit. The father survived because he had stepped out for coffee. He watched his building crumble in the late-night airstrike. He also lost his shop, his motorcycles and car \u2014 all the evidence of his 16 years of family life.",
      "His friend, Hussein Hammoud, arrived on the scene to help sift through rubble. Hammoud spotted young Hussein Mikdad\u2019s fingers in the darkness in an alley behind their home. At first, he thought they were severed limbs \u2014 until he heard the boy\u2019s screams. He dug out Hussein with glass lodged in his leg and a metal bar in his shoulder. Hammoud said he didn\u2019t recognize the boy. He held the child's almost-severed wrist in place.",
      "In the hospital now, Hussein Mikdad sipped a juice as he listened to his father and his friend. His father turned to him, asking if he wanted a Spider-Man toy \u2014 an effort to forestall a new outburst of tears. He said he buys Hussein a toy each day.",
      "\u201cWhat I am living through seems like a big lie. ...The mind can\u2019t comprehend,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank God for the blessing that is Hussein.\u201d",

      "There's some good news about sexually-transmitted diseases in newly released U.S. health data",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. syphilis epidemic slowed dramatically last year, gonorrhea cases fell and chlamydia cases remained below prepandemic levels, according to federal data released Tuesday.",
      "The numbers represented some good news about sexually transmitted diseases, which experienced some alarming increases in past years due to declining condom use, inadequate sex education, and reduced testing and treatment when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.",
      "Last year, cases of the most infectious stages of syphilis fell 10% from the year before \u2014 the first substantial decline in more than two decades. Gonorrhea cases dropped 7%, marking a second straight year of decline and bringing the number below what it was in 2019.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m encouraged, and it\u2019s been a long time since I felt that way\u201d about the nation\u2019s epidemic of sexually transmitted infections, said the CDC\u2019s Dr. Jonathan Mermin. \u201cSomething is working.\"",
      "More than 2.4 million cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia were diagnosed and reported last year \u2014 1.6 million cases of chlamydia, 600,000 of gonorrhea, and more than 209,000 of syphilis.",
      "Syphilis is a particular concern. For centuries, it was a common but feared infection that could deform the body and end in death. New cases plummeted in the U.S. starting in the 1940s when infection-fighting antibiotics became widely available, and they trended down for a half century after that. By 2002, however, cases began rising again, with men who have sex with other men being disproportionately affected.",
      "The new report found cases of syphilis in their early, most infectious stages dropped 13% among gay and bisexual men. It was the first such drop since the agency began reporting data for that group in the mid-2000s.",
      "However, there was a 12% increase in the rate of cases of unknown- or later-stage syphilis \u2014 a reflection of people infected years ago.",
      "Cases of syphilis in newborns, passed on from infected mothers, also rose. There were nearly 4,000 cases, including 279 stillbirths and infant deaths.",
      "\u201cThis means pregnant women are not being tested often enough,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine at the University of Southern California.",
      "What caused some of the STD trends to improve? Several experts say one contributor is the growing use of an antibiotic as a \u201cmorning-after pill.\u201d Studies have shown that taking doxycycline within 72 hours of unprotected sex cuts the risk of developing syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia.",
      "In June, the CDC started recommending doxycycline as a morning-after pill, specifically for gay and bisexual men and transgender women who recently had an STD diagnosis. But health departments and organizations in some cities had been giving the pills to people for a couple years.",
      "Some experts believe that the 2022 mpox outbreak \u2014 which mainly hit gay and bisexual men \u2014 may have had a lingering effect on sexual behavior in 2023, or at least on people's willingness to get tested when strange sores appeared.",
      "Another factor may have been an increase in the number of health workers testing people for infections, doing contact tracing and connecting people to treatment. Congress gave $1.2 billion to expand the workforce over five years, including $600 million to states, cities and territories that get STD prevention funding from CDC.",
      "Last year had the \"most activity with that funding throughout the U.S.,\u201d said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors.",
      "However, Congress ended the funds early as a part of last year\u2019s debt ceiling deal, cutting off $400 million. Some people already have lost their jobs, said a spokeswoman for Harvey's organization.",
      "Still, Harvey said he had reasons for optimism, including the growing use of doxycycline and a push for at-home STD test kits.",
      "Also, there are reasons to think the next presidential administration could get behind STD prevention. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump announced a campaign to \u201celiminate\u201d the U.S. HIV epidemic by 2030. (Federal health officials later clarified that the actual goal was a huge reduction in new infections \u2014 fewer than 3,000 a year.)",
      "There were nearly 32,000 new HIV infections in 2022, the CDC estimates. But a boost in public health funding for HIV could also also help bring down other sexually transmitted infections, experts said.",
      "\u201cWhen the government puts in resources, puts in money, we see declines in STDs,\u201d Klausner said.",

      "Toxic smog has shrouded Pakistan's cultural capital of Lahore and 17 other districts in Punjab since last month. Health officials say more than 40,000 people have been treated for respiratory ailments.",
      "UNICEF's representative in Pakistan, Abdullah Fadil, in a statement urged the government to make urgent and greater efforts to reduce air pollution for the 11 million affected children under the age of 5 and others.",
      "\u201cPrior to these record-breaking levels of air pollution, about 12% of deaths in children under 5 in Pakistan were due to air pollution,\" Fadil said. \"The impact of this year\u2019s extraordinary smog will take time to assess, but we know that doubling and tripling the amount of pollution in the air will have devastating effects, particularly on children and pregnant women.\u201d",
      "Pakistan has shut schools until Nov. 17 in parts of Punjab as part of measures aimed at protecting children\u2019s health. Authorities on Friday ordered the closure of all parks and museums for 10 days, and they have been urging people to avoid unnecessary travel.",
      "According to the Environmental Protection Department in Punjab, Multan remained the most polluted city on Monday, with air quality index readings of about 800. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous to health.",

      "An attorney representing a conservate prosecutor is struggling to convince Wisconsin's liberal-leaning Supreme Court to reactivate the state's 175-year-old abortion ban",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A conservative prosecutor's attorney struggled Monday to persuade the Wisconsin Supreme Court to reactivate the state's 175-year-old abortion ban, drawing a tongue-lashing from two of the court's liberal justices during oral arguments.",
      "Sheboygan County\u2019s Republican district attorney, Joel Urmanski, has asked the high court to overturn a Dane County judge\u2019s ruling last year that invalidated the ban. A ruling isn't expected for weeks but abortion advocates almost certainly will win the case given that liberal justices control the court. One of them, Janet Protasiewicz, remarked on the campaign trail that she supports abortion rights.",
      "Monday's two-hour session amounted to little more than political theater. Liberal Justice Rebecca Dallet told Urmanski's attorney, Matthew Thome, that the ban was passed in 1849 by white men who held all the power and that he was ignoring everything that has happened since. Jill Karofsky, another liberal justice, pointed out that the ban provides no exceptions for rape or incest and that reactivation could result in doctors withholding medical care. She told Thome that he was essentially asking the court to sign a \u201cdeath warrant\u201d for women and children in Wisconsin.",
      "\u201cThis is the world gone mad,\u201d Karofsky said.",
      "The ban stood until 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide nullified it. Legislators never repealed the ban, however, and conservatives have argued the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe two years ago reactivated it.",
      "Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit challenging the law in 2022. He argued that a 1985 Wisconsin law that prohibits abortion after a fetus reaches the point where it can survive outside the womb supersedes the ban. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation.",
      "Urmanski contends that the ban was never repealed and that it can co-exist with the 1985 law because that law didn\u2019t legalize abortion at any point. Other modern-day abortion restrictions also don\u2019t legalize the practice, he argues.",
      "Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled last year that the ban outlaws feticide \u2014 which she defined as the killing of a fetus without the mother\u2019s consent \u2014 but not consensual abortions. The ruling emboldened Planned Parenthood to resume offering abortions in Wisconsin after halting procedures after Roe was overturned.",
      "Urmanski asked the state Supreme Court in February to overturn Schlipper\u2019s ruling without waiting for a lower appellate decision.",
      "Thome told the justices on Monday that he wasn't arguing about the implications of reactivating the ban. He maintained that the legal theory that new laws implicitly repeal old ones is shaky. He also contended that the ban and the newer abortion restrictions can overlap just like laws establishing different penalties for the same crime. A ruling that the 1985 law effectively repealed the ban would be \u201canti-democratic,\u201d Thome added.",
      "\u201cIt's a statute this Legislature has not repealed and you're saying, no, you actually repealed it,\u201d he said.",
      "Dallet shot back that disregarding laws passed over the last 40 years to go back to 1849 would be undemocratic.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed a separate lawsuit in February asking the state Supreme Court to rule directly on whether a constitutional right to abortion exists in the state. The justices have agreed to take the case but haven't scheduled oral arguments yet.",

    "story": [
      "Anti-abortion advocates say they will quickly dismantle some of President Joe Biden's abortion policies once President-elect Donald Trump makes his return to the White House next year",
      "WASHINGTON -- Anti-abortion advocates say there is still work to be done to further restrict access to abortion when Republican Donald Trump returns to the White House next year.",
      "They point to the federal guidance that the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden released around emergency abortions, requiring that hospitals provide them for women whose health or life is at risk, and its easing of prescribing restrictions for abortion pills that have allowed women to order the medication online with the click of a button.",
      "\u201cNow the work begins to dismantle the pro-abortion policies of the Biden-Harris administration,\" the Susan B. Anthony List, the powerful anti-abortion lobby, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s first-term pro-life accomplishments are the baseline for his second term.\u201d",
      "The group declined to release details about what, specifically, they will seek to undo. But abortion rights advocates are bracing for further abortion restrictions once Trump takes office. And some women are, too, with online abortion pill orders spiking in the days after Election Day.",
      "Trump has said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government. Yet, during the campaign, he pointedly noted that he appointed justices to the Supreme Court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion. And there are things his administration can do, from picking judges to issuing regulations, to further an anti-abortion agenda.",
      "The Trump administration is expected to pull back Biden's controversial directive that requires emergency rooms to provide abortions when necessary to stabilize a woman's health or life. The Biden administration had argued that the decades-old federal law, which requires hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment for patients in exchange for Medicare funding, also applies in cases where an abortion might be needed.",
      "Reports of women being sent home or left untreated by hospitals in dangerous scenarios have proliferated across the United States since the Supreme Court overturned the national right to an abortion in 2022. In some cases, hospitals said state abortion bans had stopped them from terminating a pregnancy.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing the lives of pregnant people be put in jeopardy,\" Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said Wednesday. \"We're seeing women who have become infertile, who have been subject to sepsis and we're now hearing reports with death.\"",
      "Even if a Trump administration abandons the guidance of the law, Goss Graves said advocacy groups like hers will continue a legal fight for the Biden administration's interpretation of the law.",
      "Some doctors and hospitals also have said the federal guidance offered a protection for them to perform emergency abortions in states like Idaho and Texas, where threat of prosecution for performing an abortion hangs over their decision-making.",
      "Trump has said he supports exceptions for rape and incest cases, as well as when a woman's life is at risk. But he has not gone as far as saying he supports exemptions when a woman's health is on the line.",
      "Abortions might be necessary to prevent organ loss, significant hemorrhage or dangerous infections for pregnant women in rare but serious scenarios. In cases like ectopic pregnancy, premature rupture of membranes and placental abruptions, a fetus might still be alive but continuing the pregnancy can be detrimental. Doctors have argued that the legal gray area has put them in a bind.",
      "In Idaho, for example, one hospital resorted to airlifting women out of the state after a strict abortion ban, which only allowed for abortions to prevent a woman's death, was enacted.",
      "The Biden administration sued Idaho, arguing its state law conflicted with federal law requiring hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment, which might include abortions, for patients. The state amended its law to allow abortions for ectopic pregnancies, but other dangerous scenarios still remain unaccounted for. The Supreme Court declined to address the issue earlier this year, issuing a limited order that cleared the way for hospitals to provide emergency abortions while the case worked its way through lower courts.",
      "Enforcement of the federal law, however, is on hold in Texas, which challenged the Biden administration's guidance on emergency abortions.",
      "A patchwork of state laws governing abortion will remain in place under the Trump administration. Voters in Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota on Tuesday defeated constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "In Missouri, however, voters approved a ballot measure on Tuesday to undo one of the nation's strictest bans. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect.",
      "The ease with which women have been able to get abortion pills could also be up for reconsideration under Trump.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration made it easier to obtain abortion pills, including mifepristone, allowing women to access the medication over telehealth. The agency has approved the drug's safety through 10 weeks of pregnancy, saying that adverse effects happen for .32% of patients.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates have challenged that, arguing the medications are not safe and at the very least not fit for eased access without in-person supervision by a doctor.",
      "Although the Supreme Court preserved access to the drug earlier this year, anti-abortion advocates and conservative states have renewed their challenge in lower courts.",
      "Some women are worried. Telehealth company Wisp saw an immediate spike in abortion pill orders between Election Day and the following day, with a 600% increase. In states like Florida and Texas, where the medication cannot be legally shipped, the company saw a nearly 1000% percent increase in orders of so-called \u201cmorning after\u201d pills, also known as emergency contraception.",
      "The company fills about tens of thousands of orders monthly for reproductive products including birth control pills and abortion pills, CEO Monica Cepak told the Associated Press.",
      "Right now women typically take a two-step regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol to complete a medication abortion. Cepak said the company will keep a \u201cclose eye\u201d on mifepristone under a Trump administration and is prepared to shift to a misoprostol-only regimen should restriction to mifepristone be implemented.",
      "But Trump could be a wild card on the issue, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis who is an expert on reproductive health issues. In the final months of the campaign, he backed away from a more rigid stance on abortion \u2014 even saying he would not sign a national abortion ban if it came across his desk.",
      "Although he has enjoyed firm backing from anti-abortion groups, he is willing to break with allies when he wants.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a clear sense from him about what he would do,\u201d Ziegler said.",

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 10:58:50 -0500",
    "summary": "The majority of strokes could be prevented, according to new guidelines aimed at helping people and their doctors do just that",

      "The majority of strokes could be prevented, according to new guidelines aimed at helping people and their doctors do just that",
      "The majority of strokes could be prevented, according to new guidelines aimed at helping people and their doctors do just that.",
      "Stroke was the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than half a million Americans have a stroke every year. But up to 80% of strokes may be preventable with better nutrition, exercise and identification of risk factors.",
      "The first new guidelines on stroke prevention in 10 years from the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association, include recommendations for people and doctors that reflect a better understanding of who gets strokes and why, along with new drugs that can help reduce risk.",
      "The good news is that the best way to reduce your risk for stroke is also the best way to reduce your risk for a whole host of health problems \u2014 eat a healthy diet, move your body and don't smoke. The bad news is that it's not always so easy to sustain.",
      "Dr. Sean Duke, a stroke doctor at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, blames the forces in society that keep people sedentary and eating poorly, like cell phones and cheap, unhealthy food. \u201cOur world is stacked against us,\u201d he said.",
      "Here's what to know about stroke and the new guidelines:",
      "A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked or if a blood vessel in the brain bursts. That deprives the brain of oxygen which can cause brain damage that can lead to difficulty thinking, talking and walking, or even death.",
      "Eating healthy can help control several factors that increase your risk for stroke, including high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and obesity, according to the heart association.",
      "The group recommends foods in the so-called Mediterranean diet such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and olive oil, which can help keep cholesterol levels down. It suggests limiting red meat and other sources of saturated fat. Instead, get your protein from beans, nuts, poultry, fish and seafood.",
      "Limit highly processed foods and foods and drinks with a lot of added sugar. This can also reduce your calorie intake, which helps keep weight in check.",
      "Getting up and walking around for at least 10 minutes a day can \u201cdrastically\u201d reduce your risk, said Dr. Cheryl Bushnell, a neurologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine who was part of the group that came up with the new guidelines. Among the many benefits: Regular exercise can help reduce blood pressure, a major risk factor for stroke.",
      "Of course, more is better: The heart association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic or 75 minutes of vigorous activity \u2014 or some combination \u2014 per week. How you do it doesn't matter so much, experts said: Go to the gym, take a walk or run in your neighborhood or use treadmills or stepper machines at home.",
      "Diet and exercise can help control weight, another important risk factor for strokes. But a new class of drugs that can drastically reduce weight have been approved by regulators, providing new tools to reduce stroke risk since guidelines were last updated.",
      "The guidelines now recommend that doctors consider prescribing these drugs, including those sold under the brand names Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, to people with obesity or diabetes.",
      "But while those drugs can help, people still need to eat well and get exercise, cautions Dr. Fadi Nahab, a stroke expert at Emory University Hospital.",
      "The new guidelines for the first time recommend doctors screen patients for other factors that could increase stroke risk, including sex and gender and non-medical factors such as economic stability, access to health care, discrimination and racism. For example, the risk for having a first stroke is nearly twice as high for Black adults in the U.S. as it is for white adults, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cIf somebody doesn\u2019t have insurance or they can\u2019t get to a doctor\u2019s office because of transportation issues or they can\u2019t get off work to get health care ... these are all things that can impact the ability to prevent stroke,\" Bushnell said.",
      "Doctors may be able to point to resources for low-cost health care or food, and can give ideas about how to be active without breaking the bank for a gym membership.",
      "The guidelines also now recommend doctors should screen for conditions that could increase a woman's risk for stroke, such as high blood pressure during pregnancy or early menopause.",
      "Three of the most common stroke symptoms include face weakness, arm weakness and difficulty speaking. And time is important, because brain damage can happen quickly and damage can be limited if a stroke is treated quickly. Stroke experts have coined an acronym to help you remember: FAST. F for face, A for arm, S for speech, and T for time. If you think you or a loved one could be having a stroke, call 911 right away.",

    "story": [
      "A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste has been allowed to dock at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection",
      "TIRANA, Albania -- A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste was allowed to dock on Friday at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection on the orders of the prosecutor, officials said.",
      "Albania had prevented the Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A from docking early last week at the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital, Tirana, after a watchdog alerted authorities that it was carrying hazardous waste.",
      "Instead, the ship was kept at an anchorage place away from the port.",
      "The prosecutors then ordered the containers to be seized and stored \u201cat an environmentally\" safe place. Once unloaded, the containers are expected to be sent to an agency in Porto Romano, 6 kilometers (4 miles) away, for inspection.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s office has asked different institutions to conduct lab tests of the cargo.",
      "The Seattle-based non-government organization Basel Action Network, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, flagged the ship to authorities in August after receiving information from a whistleblower that the containers on board are suspected to be carrying an estimated 2,100 tons of toxic dust from pollution control filters from the steel industry.",
      "The dust is suspected to have originated at an Albanian company and that it was also illegally smuggled to Albania from neighboring Kosovo and Germany.",
      "BAN said the containers left Durres on July 4 on two Maersk-chartered ships with the intended destination of Thailand. The group said it alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment.",
      "Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the containers were loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said.",
      "The customs documentation stated the containers contained iron oxide, according to local reports.",
      "\u201cThe case is under investigation from the Durres prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Tourism and Environment is cooperating for anything that the justice institution asks for,\u201d ministry spokesperson Erjon Uka told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "Albania's opposition accused the government in August of taking part in illegally trafficking hazardous material.",
      "Prime Minister Edi Rama said in Parliament in September that the shipment\u2019s documents were verified and that iron oxide is \u201cnot considered as toxic waste in the European catalogs on which the environmental and customs procedure of our country is based.\u201d",
      "Speaking to a parliamentary commission on Friday, Environment Minister Mirela Kumbaro said the case should not be politically exploited to spread panic.",
      "She urged for calm to allow the investigation to proceed.",
      "The ship, she said, is suspected of carrying hazardous waste but \u201chazardous waste does not mean toxic\u201d waste, adding that transport companies had declared the cargo consisted of \u201cnormal goods\u201d \u2014 and that it was only now being described as hazardous waste.",
      "The Seattle-based NGO has called on Albanian authorities to have a public opening and sampling of the containers to ensure transparency of the investigation.",
      "BAN has also said that while Albania is looking to join the European Union and the government has been eager to align its hazardous waste policy with that of the 27-nation bloc, it should ban \u201cthe export of hazardous wastes, household wastes, electronic wastes and plastic wastes to developing countries.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Health officials say it's important to get flu and COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the holidays when respiratory bugs tend to spread",
      "WASHINGTON -- If you missed the early fall push for flu and COVID-19 vaccines, it's not too late.",
      "Health officials say it's important to get vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when respiratory bugs tend to spread with travel and indoor celebrations.",
      "Those viruses haven't caused much trouble so far this fall. But COVID-19 tends to jump in the winter months, a rise that usually starts around Thanksgiving and peaks in January.",
      "And that coincides with flu season, which tends to start in November or December and peak in January or February.",
      "It takes the body about two weeks to build up immunity after either shot \u2014 meaning vaccination is needed before these viruses start spreading. A lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.",
      "Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters \u2014 they're not just another dose of last year\u2019s protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body\u2019s immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains.",
      "While they\u2019re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 \u2014 or dying from it.",
      "\u201cIt may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cI would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.\u201d",
      "Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot.",
      "\u201cOur best defense to protect ourselves, our loved ones and all those around us is a simple shot,\u201d Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a recent statement.",
      "While it may have faded from the headlines, the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year.",
      "\u201cMaybe we believe that it\u2019s not going to be me but let\u2019s not take a chance,\u201d said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. \u201cWhy not get a vaccine that\u2019s going to help you reduce that risk?\u201d",
      "The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge.",
      "Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year.",
      "Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu \u2013 and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too.",
      "In addition, the CDC is recommending that people 65 and older get a second COVID-19 shot six months after their fall dose to boost their year-round protection, since the coronavirus isn't just a winter threat. People with weakened immune systems are eligible for extra doses, too.",
      "Last fall\u2019s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that\u2019s no longer spreading while this year\u2019s are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older.",
      "High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot.",
      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics \u2014 although next year it's set to be available for use at home.",
      "All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems.",
      "The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination \u2013 but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter.",
      "And while \u201cyour arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,\u201d it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said.",
      "The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.",
      "About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access. Call your local health department to ask about options.",

      "Farmworkers in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered treatment even if they show no symptoms, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The new guidance comes after blood tests for 115 farmworkers in Michigan and Colorado showed that eight workers \u2014 or 7% \u2014 had antibodies that indicated previous infection with the virus known as Type A H5N1 influenza.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of these actions is to keep workers safe, to limit the transmission of H5 to humans and to reduce the possibility of the virus changing,\u201d Shah told reporters.",
      "The CDC study provides the largest window to date into how the bird virus first detected in March in dairy cows may be spreading to people. It suggests that the virus has infected more humans than the 46 farmworkers identified in the U.S. as of Thursday. Nearly all were in contact with infected dairy cows or infected poultry.",
      "Outside experts said it\u2019s notable that the study prompted the CDC to take new action. Previous recommendations called for testing and treating workers only when they had symptoms.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant move towards the assessment that these H5N1 viruses are a greater risk than the CDC estimated before,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "Every additional infection in animals or humans gives the virus the chance to change in potentially dangerous ways, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt shows yet again that we are not responding effectively to the H5N1 cattle outbreak in humans or animals and if we continue to let this virus spread and jump from species to species, our luck will eventually run out,\u201d Rasmussen said in an email.",
      "The CDC study included 45 workers in Michigan and 70 in Colorado tested between June and August. Of the eight workers with positive blood tests, four reported no symptoms. All eight cleaned milking parlors and none used respiratory protection such as face masks. Three said they used eye protection.",
      "High levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows, increasing the risk of exposure and infection, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said that efforts to monitor dairy workers for illness have been hindered by several barriers including the reluctance of farm owners and farmworkers to allow testing.",
      "Rasmussen and others have criticized the federal response to the outbreak as too slow and \u201clackluster.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese studies should have been performed months ago and should have been prioritized,\u201d she said.",
      "The virus has been confirmed in at least 446 cattle herds in 15 states. Last week, the Agriculture Department said a pig at an Oregon farm was confirmed to have bird flu, the first time the virus was detected in U.S. swine.",

      "\u201cYou chose to blame your cat,\u201d Nachmanoff said.",
      "The court records in the case are carefully redacted to remove any reference to Ginsburg, but during the trial and at Thursday's sentencing hearing, all sides openly acknowledged that Ginsburg was the victim of the privacy breach.",
      "Her status as a public figure, in fact, prompted a debate about the severity of Russell's crime. Prosecutors said her high public profile, in addition to her age and illness, made her a particularly vulnerable victim.",
      "\u201cHe went with the Supreme Court justice who was old, who was sick, and whose sickness was a public concern,\u201d Bedell argued.",
      "Russell's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that Ginsburg's high office and the power that comes with it is the opposite of vulnerability.",
      "Nachmanoff, in issuing his sentence, said he took into account the fact that Russell has a sick step parent who might need care. The judge noted \u201cwith some irony\u201d that the details of the stepparent's health problems are under seal.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because it is sensitive health information \u2014 a benefit you did not provide to Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he said.",
      "Russell and his lawyer declined to comment after Thursday's hearing on whether they plan to appeal."

      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cKing\u201d doesn\u2019t disclose his real name. Even clients of his Sao Paulo newsstand have to call him by his moniker. The Brazilian online sports gambling addict lowered his profile after a loan shark threatened to put bullets in his head if he didn\u2019t pay up.",
      "Broke and embarrassed, King sought treatment and support earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI was once addicted to slot machines, but then sports betting was so easy that I changed. I got carried away all the time,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "King\u2019s story is that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years. The country has become the third-biggest market in the world for sports betting, following the U.S. and the U.K., a report by data analysis company Comscore said last year. But unlike those countries, rampant advertising and sponsorship have been coupled with an unregulated market. The government is now \u2014 belatedly, some say \u2014 striving to get a handle on the epidemic.",
      "On a recent evening, King's Gamblers Anonymous meeting took place in an improvised classroom inside a church, with coffee and cookies to keep everyone awake, and supportive messages scrawled onto the blackboard. One that's become ubiquitous in Brazil and beyond: \u201cOnly for today I will avoid the first bet.\u201d",
      "King and other attendees, all Christian, started a prayer and the meeting began.",
      "King said his financial problems arose from his addiction to online sports betting, chiefly on soccer.",
      "\u201cI miss the adrenaline rush when I don\u2019t bet,\" he said before the gathering. \"I have managed to stop for a couple of months, but I know that if I do it once again, even a small bet, it will all come back.\u201d",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver for Brazilians embracing sports betting. King said he transformed almost every sale during that time into a bet. His hook was the non-stop advertising on TV, radio, social media as well as sponsorship of local soccer teams' jerseys. He asked for bank loans to pay his gambling debts and then, to cover those, went to the moneylender. His total debt now amounts to 85,000 reais ($15,000) \u2014 impossible to pay off with his monthly income of 8,000 reais.",
      "Digging oneself out of debt in Brazil is especially daunting with its sky-high interest rates. Loans from Brazilian banks could add interest of almost 8% per month to the borrowed sum, and from loan sharks could be even more.",
      "Four Gamblers Anonymous meetings attended by the AP in October featured discussions about difficulties paying down debts, forcing working-class members to postpone housing payments and cancel family vacations.",
      "Some members of impoverished Brazilian families have used welfare money for betting instead of paying for groceries and housing, official data suggests. In August, beneficiaries of Brazil\u2019s flagship program Bolsa Familia spent 3 billion reais ($530 million) on sports betting, according to a report from the central bank. That was more than 20% of the program\u2019s total outlay in the month.",
      "Sports betting was made legal in 2018 in a bill signed by former President Michel Temer. The subsequent turmoil has recently been setting off alarm bells, with addicts venting on social media and media reports of people losing huge sums.",
      "On Oct. 1, the economy ministry prevented more than 2,000 betting companies from operating in Brazil for having failed to provide all the required documents. Soccer-loving President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said in an interview on Oct. 17 that he will shut down the entire market in Brazil if his administration\u2019s new regulations \u2014 presented at the end of July\u2014 fail to work. And Brazil\u2019s Senate on Oct. 25 opened an investigation into betting companies, focusing on crime and addiction.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tax evasion, money laundering of organized crime, the use of influencers to trick people into betting. These companies need to be audited,\u201d Sen. Soraya Thronicke, who proposed the inquiry, told journalists in Brasilia.",
      "S\u00e9rgio Peixoto, a ride-sharing app driver in Rio, is one of many lower-middle-income Brazilians who have reduced their spending due to sports betting debt. Peixoto\u2019s debt currently amounts to 25,000 reais ($4,400). His monthly income is four times less than that.",
      "\u201cIt stopped being a game, it wasn\u2019t fun. I just wanted to get the money back, so I lost even more,\u201d said Peixoto, 26. \u201cI could have invested that money. It would surely have given me more benefits.",
      "Pressure on people to gamble is everywhere. Current and former soccer players, including Vinicius J\u00fanior, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio and Roberto Rivellino, are among the poster boys for local and foreign brands. All but one of the top-tier soccer clubs have betting companies among their main sponsors, with their name and logo emblazoned on their kits. There have been cases of kids and teenagers setting up accounts using their parents' personal information and money, multiple local media outlets have reported.",
      "Brazil's economy ministry estimates that Brazil's sports betting market had $21 billion in transactions last year, a 71% increase compared with the first year of the pandemic, 2020.",
      "The ministry's newly presented regulations include facial recognition systems for gamblers to bet, the identification of a single bank account for transactions involving sports betting, new protections against hackers and the government-authorized domain, bet.br, which will host all betting sites that are legal in Brazil. Once they are in place, come January, between 100 and 150 betting companies will continue to operate in the South American nation.",
      "The changes in Brazil have prompted some companies to take preemptive action. A report by Yield Sec, a technical intelligence platform for online marketplaces, said several betting companies voluntarily restricted their operations in different places after the latest editions of the European Championships and Copa America in the hopes of presenting \u201cthe best possible license application face to the Brazilian authorities.\u201d",
      "Magnho Jos\u00e9 Santos de Sousa, the president of the Legal Gambling Institute, a betting think tank, said Brazil has been flooded by some legal platforms that have licenses in Malta, Cura\u00e7ao, Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, and also illegal sites based in China.",
      "De Sousa expressed hope that the new regulations for advertising, responsible gambling and qualification of sports betting companies will transform the country's deregulated arena into a more serious one that doesn't exploit the vulnerable.",
      "\"The whole operation could turn from water into wine,\u201d he said.",
      "Meantime, the demand for Gamblers Anonymous meetings in Sao Paulo has grown so much in recent years that the weekly gathering, in place since the 1990s, was no longer enough. Many groups have added a second day in the week to help new people recover, mostly sports bettors.",
      "Earlier in October, a group on Sao Paulo's northern edge admitted a man who was struggling with sports betting and card games. The 13 other people in the room stressed that he wasn't alone.",

      "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.",
      "The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.",
      "Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.",
      "A look at what Trump has proposed:",
      "\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d from his 2016 campaign has become creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He\u2019s pitched \u201cideological screening\u201d for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he\u2019d reinstitute first-term policies such as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.",
      "Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk \u2014 a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden\u2019s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That\u2019s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.",
      "Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It\u2019s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income \u2014 a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy \u201cessential\u201d medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of \u201cany vital infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.",
      "Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.",
      "On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end \u201cboys in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.",
      "The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households\u2019 utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration \u2014 even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations \u2014 though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end \u201cfrivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.\u201d",
      "The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.",
      "He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government\u2019s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.",
      "Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers\u2019 budget actions \u201cset a ceiling\u201d on spending but not a floor \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.",
      "As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.",
      "The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the \u201cMarxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.",
      "As in other policy areas, Trump isn\u2019t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed\u2014none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of \u201cmaking America healthy again.\"",
      "Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy \u2013 and transportation infrastructure spending \u2013 anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America\u2019s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden\u2019s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump \u201cthe union bosses and CEOs\u201d together as complicit in \u201cthis disastrous electric car scheme.\u201d In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield \u2014 an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them leaders,\u201d Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans \u201csee on television.\u201d He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",

      "An expensive campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state Supreme Court seats has yielded mixed results",
      "A costly campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state Supreme Court seats yielded mixed results in Tuesday's election, with Republicans expanding their majority on Ohio's court while candidates backed by progressive groups won in Montana and Michigan.",
      "One of the most expensive and closely watched Supreme Court races in North Carolina, where a Democratic justice campaigned heavily on abortion rights and Republicans hope to expand their majority, remained too early to call Thursday.",
      "Groups on both the right and left spent millions in the leadup to the election hoping to reshape courts that'll be battlegrounds for voting rights, redistricting, abortion and other issues.",
      "Abortion-rights supporters touted victories in states that Donald Trump won, saying it's a sign that reproductive rights will be key in judicial campaigns after the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. In states like Montana and Arizona, state courts may soon be tasked with interpreting how abortion-rights amendments voters passed this week would impact existing laws.",
      "\u201cState Supreme Court judges don't really have anything to say about the economy, but they certainly do have something to say about reproductive rights and voting rights and democracy and what your life is going to be like from a right to liberty perspective in your state,\" said Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cSo I think we have a real opportunity to define these judges and this level of the ballot by reproductive rights.\u201d",
      "The ACLU spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in those states, as well as in Arizona and Texas.",
      "Conservative groups also spent heavily in those states, but with ads focusing on issues other than abortion such as immigration and crime.",
      "In Ohio, all three Democrats running for the state Supreme Court lost their race. The victory gives Republicans a 6-1 majority on the court. A county judge in October struck down the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban and the state Supreme Court is expected to hear more cases aiming to undo regulations that, for example, require 24-hour waiting periods or in-person appointments for patients.",
      "\u201cOhioans made a strong statement tonight that will keep the court under Republican control for years to come,\u201d said Dee Duncan, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee's Judicial Fairness Initiative, which spent nearly $1 million on the race.",
      "Michigan Democrats won two seats on the state\u2019s Supreme Court, expanding their majority to 5-2. While the elections are nonpartisan, parties nominate the candidates.",
      "\u201cWith the liberal majority protected, Michigan Dems\u2019 hard work past and future will not be threatened by the MAGA fanatics that threaten our values here in Michigan,\u201d Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Lavora Barnes said in a statement.",
      "In North Carolina, Justice Allison Riggs trailed narrowly Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin in their race for an eight-year term on the state\u2019s highest court. The Associated Press has not called the race, for which nearly 5.5 million ballots have been counted. Tens of thousands of additional provisional and absentee ballots still had to be reviewed by county election officials, and the trailing candidate could seek a recount if the final margin is narrow enough.",
      "Riggs' campaign focused on reproductive rights, running ads that said Griffin could be a deciding vote on the 5-2 majority Republican court for further abortion restrictions. Griffin had said it was inappropriate for Riggs to talk about an issue that could come before the court.",
      "Heated bids for a pair of seats on Montana's court were a split decision, with county attorney Cory Swanson defeating former U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerry Lynch for chief justice. State judge Katherine Bidegaray defeated state judge Dan Wilson for another open seat on the court.",
      "Progressive groups backed Lynch and Bidegaray, casting the races as key to protecting abortion rights in a state where Republicans control the Legislature and the governor's office. Republicans who complained about the court's rulings against laws that would have restricted abortion access or made it more difficult to vote supported Swanson and Wilson.",
      "A longshot effort by abortion-rights advocates to unseat three justices on Texas' all-Republican Supreme Court fell short, with Jimmy Blacklock, John Devine and Jane Bland winning reelection. The three were part of unanimous rulings rejecting challenges to the state\u2019s abortion ban.",
      "In Arizona, two justices won retention elections despite efforts to oust them over the court decision that cleared way for a long-dormant 1864 law banning nearly all abortions to be enforced. The state Legislature swiftly repealed it, and voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion access up to fetal viability, typically after 21 weeks.",
      "Conservatives also won in Oklahoma, where voters removed one of three Supreme Court justices appointed by a former Democratic governor who were up for retention. A 5-4 ruling by the court last year overturned a portion of the state\u2019s near total ban on abortion. It was the first time any Oklahoma appellate judge had been removed through a retention election.",
      "An Arkansas justice who wrote a blistering dissent when the court's Republican-backed majority blocked an abortion rights measure from the ballot was elected chief justice. That race, however, won't change the court's majority.",
      "The next big battleground comes next year in Wisconsin, where a race will determine whether liberals maintain their 4-3 majority on the court. The open race for retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley's seat comes after the court flipped from conservative control in a 2023 election marked by record-breaking spending.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like state Supreme Court elections are going to go back to the way they were 10 years ago anytime soon,\u201d said Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the judiciary program at the Brennan Center, which has tracked spending on state court races.",

      "Abortion rights advocates prevailed in ballot measures in seven states, but that doesn't resolve the issue",
      "WASHINGTON -- Abortion rights advocates prevailed on seven ballot measures across the U.S. in Tuesday's election and lost on three.",
      "The losses are the first on statewide reproductive rights ballot measures anywhere in the U.S. since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a ruling that struck down the nearly 50-year nationwide right to abortion, proving that abortion opponents can win on ballot measures.",
      "There were firsts on the other sides, too: Three amendments call for rolling back abortion bans, including one in Missouri that bars it at all stages of pregnancy with exceptions only under limited circumstances to save the life of the woman.",
      "Here's a look at takeaways from the results.",
      "Missouri is the most populous state where a ballot measure could roll back a current ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy.",
      "But the work isn\u2019t done there.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri filed in a state court Wednesday seeking to invalidate the state's abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care.",
      "The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead, the measure left it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Planned Parenthood leaders said Wednesday on a Zoom call with reporters that they want to start offering abortions at clinics in Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis if they get the judicial ruling they're requesting \u2014 starting with blocking enforcement of laws on the book.",
      "\"This is only the first step to realizing and fully implementing the protections of Amendment 3. It\u2019s certainly not the last step,\u201d said Richard Muniz, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers.",
      "Clinics had stopped providing abortions in Missouri even before the state\u2019s ban took effect in 2022. They said a list of regulations made it impossible for them to operate. In its legal filing, the Planned Parenthood affiliate that covers much of the state says the onerous requirements include clinicians who provide abortion have surgical licenses and that they conduct pelvic exams on all patients \u2014 even if they offer only medication abortions.",
      "\u201cSome of these patients choose medication abortion precisely because they do not want instruments inserted into their vagina,\u201d Dr. Selina Sandoval, an associate medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a legal filing. \u201cI cannot and will not subject my patients to unnecessary exams.\u201d",
      "Planned Parenthood also objects to laws requiring clinicians to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, mandating a 72-hour waiting period for abortions and banning telemedicine for abortion. Besides the ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, the group is calling for having other bans that kick in after eight, 14, 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to be struck down.",
      "Abortion rights advocates heralded victories at the ballot box as a signal of widespread support for abortion rights, even in conservative states.",
      "The three states where abortion measures were defeated had special circumstances that weren't present in the others.",
      "In Florida, the threshold for passing a constitutional amendment is 60% while most states require a simple majority. Most voters supported adding abortion rights \u2014 but it fell short of the requirement.",
      "There, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, also presented a challenge to proponents by steering state GOP funds to counter the measure and defending a state agency for publishing a webpage attacking it, among other government efforts.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure is different from the others because it would have allowed the state to regulate abortion in the second trimester \u2014 but only in ways that protect the health of the woman. Because of that provision, most national abortion rights groups did not put money into promoting it, which could have been a factor in its failure in a conservative state.",
      "In Nebraska, both sides had questions on the ballot. Voters passed the one that bars abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 which is in line with current state law \u2014 and also allows the possibility of more stringent bans. They also rejected the measure that aimed to enshrine into the state constitution the right to abortion until viability, which is considered to be sometime after 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there's not a fixed time.",
      "Abortion rights advocates condemned the novel strategy by anti-abortion groups of putting a competing measure on the ballot as an attempt to confuse voters. The approach was considered by anti-abortion groups elsewhere.",
      "Republican Donald Trump reclaimed the presidency, despite his consistently shifting stances on reproductive rights.",
      "If Republicans win the House, in addition to their victories in the Senate and White House, it could open the door to the passage of a national ban.",
      "Trump has said he would veto a national ban, despite previously declining to answer questions about it.",
      "But Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as \u201cminimum national standards\u201d in order to distort their own stances on the issue, given the political unpopularity of the GOP\u2019s position on abortion.",
      "Judicial appointments have already shaped the national abortion landscape. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned Roe v. Wade. It's not just the Supreme Court. Trump-nominated U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has issued rulings with nationwide consequences, including one impacting access to the abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "Through executive power, a president could also restrict abortion pills sent through the mail and declare that a law that requires doctors to stabilize emergency room patients does not require them to provide abortion. A new administration could also pull back on a federal lawsuit that challenges aspects of Idaho's ban.",
      "One interpretation of the presence of some of the ballot measures was that they were put up in part to drive turnout of Democratic voters in candidate elections.",
      "If that was the plan \u2014 and some abortion rights advocates say it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t seem to sway other statewide races.",
      "The mostly Republican states of Montana and Missouri passed abortion rights protections and also elected GOP candidates for president, U.S. Senate and governor.",
      "In Montana, Republican Tim Sheehy defeated three-term incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, who attempted to pair his campaign with the abortion rights push.",
      "Three other Republican states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 rejected abortion ballot measures and supported Trump for president and GOP senators where they were on the ballot.",
      "The Democratic states of Colorado and Maryland expanded abortion rights and voted for Democrats in statewide elections. The same is true in New York, where the ballot measure bars discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d and does not mention abortion specifically \u2014 but was championed by abortion rights advocates, who say it will preserve access.",
      "The measures also passed in Arizona and Nevada, where the presidential and U.S. Senate races had not been called by midday Wednesday.",
      "Democrats in the most competitive Senate races centered their closing argument and ads around abortion, an issue they hoped to capitalize on after it has previously motivated voters up and down the ballot. But abortion rights failed to put them over the top \u2014 including in Montana.",
      "Texas Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat, failed in his bid to defeat Sen. Ted Cruz after investing $5 million in an ad campaign focused on abortion and invoking the issue in campaign trail speeches and during an October debate. Allred leaned on the personal stories of Texas women impacted by the state's abortion ban that have sparked national outrage.",
      "In Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno defeated incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown after Brown and his allies pounced on cellphone video that emerged late in the campaign showing Moreno criticizing suburban women who base their votes on abortion rights.",
      "A hotly contested race between Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Republican Eric Hovde has also focused heavily on abortion and appeared to be close enough early Wednesday for a recount to be requested.",
      "In the Texas city of Amarillo, located in the state\u2019s conservative Panhandle region, voters overwhelming rejected an anti-abortion proposal that would have essentially banned travel for those seeking abortions out of state by allowing civil lawsuits against anyone who helps a local resident obtain an abortion.",
      "The \u201cSanctuary Cities for the Unborn\u201d ordinance was rejected by nearly 60% of voters.",
      "\u201cWe hope to set the tone for not only the state, but the nation, that we will not penalize anyone for seeking health care when they\u2019re facing an extreme travel ban in their own state,\" said Lindsay London, a nurse who helped found a group to oppose the effort.",

      "Questions have been raised about whether the 27-nation EU\u2019s commitment to Ukraine would remain firm with Russia appearing to have an edge in the war, which began on Feb. 24, 2022, and following the reelection of Donald Trump, who has vowed to end the conflict as U.S. president.",

      "Danish police are closing the investigation into the devastating fire that destroyed more than half of Copenhagen\u2019s Old Stock Exchange",
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Danish police said Tuesday that they were closing the investigation into the devastating fire that destroyed more than half of Copenhagen\u2019s Old Stock Exchange, saying nothing points at the blaze being the result of a criminal act.",
      "Despite extensive forensic investigations, review of surveillance and the questioning of a large number of witnesses, \u201cit is not possible to determine the cause of the fire in the historic stock exchange building,\" said Brian Belling, the Copenhagen police officer in charge of the investigation.",
      "\u201cOur assessment is that we have explored all relevant investigative possibilities in the case,\u201d Belling told a press conference, adding that no one has been charged in the case.",
      "Belling said the video material included hours of footage from inside the Stock Exchange that had not been damaged by the fire. He added that no inflammable liquid has been found.",
      "In the early morning of April 16, a violent fire tore through the 400-year-old building, a major tourist attraction. The blaze toppled its green copper roof and iconic dragon-tail spire. Two days later, a large section of the building\u2019s outer wall collapsed inwards.",
      "As the fire raged, many, including ordinary people, ventured in to rescue artworks and around 90% of the cultural objects were rescued from the building.",
      "One of the hypotheses was that the fire started in connection with the renovation, Belling said.",
      "He said that the fire is believed to have started under the roof, which had been wrapped in scaffolding because of ongoing renovation work to be completed for its anniversary in 2024.",
      "\u201cThere is guidance regarding listed buildings when renovating them.

      "Hezbollah launched at least four drones toward Israel during the day, the Israeli military said, with the air force intercepting some of them. The Lebanese militant group has so far not claimed responsibility for the drones fired Tuesday but has said it fired rockets into Israel.",
      "Drones have challenged Israel\u2019s robust aerial defense systems, and many have evaded interception, causing damage and killing people, including one of the worst mass-casualty strikes in Israel during the past year of war, when four soldiers were killed and dozens wounded by a drone strike.",
      "Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,200 people have been killed and more than 14,000 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reported.",

      "The aid was delivered on a U.S.-imposed deadline that called on Israel to \u201csurge\u201d more food and other emergency aid into Gaza.",
      "It warned that failure to comply could trigger U.S. laws requiring it to scale back military support as Israel wages war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Aid groups have accused Israel of falling short on aid distribution, especially in northern Gaza.",

      "In a new report published Monday, OCHA said humanitarian organizations submitted 50 requests to the Israeli authorities to enter North Gaza governorate in October and 33 were rejected while eight were accepted but faced impediments including delays that prevented their completion, he said.",

      "An opponent of vaccines who wrote social media posts urging violence against scientists, politicians and public health officials during the COVID-19 pandemic has been sentenced to five years in prison",
      "LONDON -- An opponent of vaccines who wrote social media posts urging violence against scientists, politicians and public health officials during the COVID-19 pandemic was sentenced Monday to five years in prison after being convicted of encouraging terrorism.",
      "A British judge said 55-year-old Patrick Ruane had a \u201ccompulsive and obsessive\u201d opposition to vaccines and spewed vitriol on the Telegram messaging app. One message described \u201cwhacking\u201d England\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, over the head.",
      "In a series of messages in 2021, Ruane posted that he was \u201call for hunting them down and \u2026 executing\u201d those who made and delivered COVID-19 vaccines. He encouraged others to \u201cfind where they live, put a kill squad together and shoot\u201d them in their beds.",
      "In a discussion about Whitty, the vaccine opponent wrote that hitting someone on the back of the skull with a rounders bat \u2013 similar to a baseball bat \u2013 or a metal mace \u201cwould turn said target into a vegetable for the rest of its life.\u201d",
      "He also called for an \u201cIRA playbook,\u201d a reference to the Irish Republican Army\u2019s bombing and shooting campaign, and advocated blowing up vaccine laboratories and 5G phone towers.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t idle chit-chat online \u2013 he was encouraging people to seriously injure or kill others, suggesting who to target,\" said Acting Commander Gareth Rees of the Metropolitan Police Counterterrorism Command, which began investigating Ruane's posts in 2021.",
      "Prosecutor Julia Faure Walker said the posts reached a \u201cvery large audience\u201d through two Telegram chat groups, one of which had 18,000 users and the other 8,000 users.",
      "Ruane, an audio producer for films, was initially arrested in November 2021 and charged almost two years later. He was convicted at London\u2019s Central Criminal Court in September on two counts of encouraging terrorism.",

    "story": [
      "Four-year-old Hussein Mikdad survived an Israeli airstrike on his home in a Beirut suburb last month",
      "BEIRUT -- Curled up in his father \u2019s lap, clinging to his chest, Hussein Mikdad cried his heart out. The 4-year-old kicked his doctor with his intact foot and pushed him away with the arm that was not in a cast. \u201cMy Dad! My Dad!\" Hussein said. \"Make him leave me alone!\u201d With eyes tearing up in relief and pain, the father reassured his son and pulled him closer.",
      "Hussein and his father, Hassan, are the only survivors of their family after an Israeli airstrike last month on their Beirut neighborhood. The strike killed 18 people, including his mother, three siblings and six relatives.",
      "\u201cCan he now shower?\u201d the father asked the doctor.",
      "Ten days after surgery, doctors examining Hussein's wounds said the boy is healing properly. He has rods in his fractured right thigh and stitches that assembled his torn tendons back in place on the right arm. The pain has subsided, and Hussein should be able to walk again in two months \u2014 albeit with a lingering limp.",
      "A prognosis for Hussein's invisible wounds is much harder to give. He is back in diapers and has begun wetting his bed. He hardly speaks and has not said a word about his mother, two sisters and brother.",
      "\u201cThe trauma is not just on the muscular skeletal aspect. But he is also mentally hurt,\u201d Imad Nahle, one of Hussein\u2019s orthopedic surgeons, said.",
      "Israel said, without elaborating, that the strike on the Mikdad neighborhood struck a Hezbollah target. In the war that has escalated since September, Israeli airstrikes have increasingly hit residential areas around Lebanon. Israel accuses the Lebanese militant group of hiding its capabilities and fighters among civilians. It vows to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "But children have been caught in the midst.",
      "With more strikes on homes and in residential areas, doctors are seeing more children affected by the violence. More than 100 children have been killed in Lebanon in the past six weeks and hundreds injured. And of the 14,000 wounded since last year, around 10% are children. Many have been left with severed limbs, burned bodies, and broken families \u2014 scars that could last for a lifetime.",
      "Ghassan Abu Sittah, a renowned British-Palestinian surgeon who is also treating Hussein, sees that long road ahead. This is his worry: \u201cIt leaves us with a generation of physically wounded children, children who are psychologically and emotionally wounded.\"",
      "At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which is receiving limited cases of war casualties, Nahle said he operated on five children in the past five weeks \u2014 up from no cases before. Most were referred from south and eastern Lebanon.",
      "A few miles away, at the Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui, one of the country\u2019s largest burns centers increased its capacity by nearly 180% since September so it could accommodate more war wounded, its medical director Naji Abirached said. About a fifth of the newly admitted patients are children.",
      "In one of the burn center\u2019s ICU units lies Ivana Skakye. She turned 2 in the hospital ward last week. Ivana has been healing from burns she sustained following an Israeli airstrike outside their home in southern Lebanon on Sept. 23. Israel said it struck ammunition depots and launchers in southern Lebanon that day when its warplanes launched hundreds of airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, making it the deadliest day of the war so far. More than 500 people were killed.",
      "Six weeks later, the tiny Ivana remains wrapped in white gauze from head to toe except her torso. She sustained third-degree burns over 40 percent of her body. Her hair and head, her left side all the way to her legs, both her arms and her chest were burned. Her family home was damaged, its ceiling set afire. The family\u2019s valuables, packed in their car as they prepared to leave, were also torched. Ivana\u2019s older sister, Rahaf, 7, has recovered faster from burns to her face and hands.",
      "Fatima Zayoun, their mother, was in the kitchen when the explosion hit. Zayoun jumped up to grab the girls, who were playing on the terrace.",
      "It was, Zayoun said, \"as if something lifted me up so that I can grab my kids. I have no idea how I managed to pull them in and throw them out of the window. She spoke from the ICU burns unit. \u201cThey were not on fire, but they were burned. Black ash covered them. ... (Ivana) was without any hair. I told myself, `That is not her.'\u201d",
      "Now, Ivana's wound dressings are changed every two days. Her doctor, Ziad Sleiman, said she could be discharged in a few days. She\u2019s back again to saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cBye \u2014 shorthand for wanting to go out.",
      "Like Hussein, though, Ivana has no home to return to. Her parents fear collective shelters could cause an infection to return.",
      "After seeing her kids \u201csizzling on the floor,\u201d Zayoun, 35, said that even if their home is repaired, she wouldn\u2019t want to return. \u201cI saw death with my own eyes,\u201d she said.",
      "Zayoun was 17 last time Israel and Hezbollah were at war, in 2006. Displaced with her family then, she said she almost enjoyed the experience, riding out of their village in a truck full of their belongings, mixing with new people, learning new things. They returned home when the war was over.",
      "\u201cBut this war is hard. They are hitting everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do they want from us? Do they want to hurt our children? We are not what they are looking for.\"",
      "Abu Sittah, the reconstructive surgeon, said most of the children's injuries are from blasts or collapsing rubble. That attack on a space they expect to be inviolable can have lingering effects.",
      "\u201cChildren feel safe at home,\" he said. \"The injury makes them for the first time lose that sense of security \u2014 that their parents are keeping them safe, that their homes are invincible, and suddenly their homes become not so.\u201d",
      "One recent morning, children were playing in the courtyard of a vocational school-turned-shelter in Dekwaneh, north of Beirut, where nearly 3,000 people displaced from the south are now living. The parents were busy with an overflowing bathroom that serves one floor in a building that houses nearly 700 people.",
      "Only playtime brings the children, from different villages in the south, together. They were divided in two teams, ages ranging between 6 and 12, competing to get the handkerchief first. A tiny girl hugged and held hands with strangers visiting the shelter. \u201cI am from Lebanon. Don't tell anyone,\u201d she whispered in their ears.",
      "The game turned rowdy when two girls in their early teens got into a fist fight. Pushing and shoving began. Tears and tantrums followed. The tiny girl walked away in a daze.",
      "Maria Elizabeth Haddad, manager of the psychosocial support programs in Beirut and neighboring areas for the U.S.-based International Medical Corps, said parents in shelters reported signs of increased anxiety, hostility and aggression among kids. They talk back to parents and ignore rules. Some have developed speech impediments and clinginess. One is showing early signs of psychosis.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be residual symptoms when they grow up, especially related to attachment ties, to feeling of security,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cIt is a generational trauma. We have experienced it before with our parents. ... They don\u2019t have stability or search for (extra) stability. This is not going to be easy to overcome.\u201d",
      "Children represent more than a third of over 1 million people displaced by the war in Lebanon and following Israeli evacuation notices, according to U.N. and government estimates (more than 60,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel). That leaves hundreds of thousands in Lebanon without schooling, either because their schools were inaccessible or have been turned into shelters.",
      "Hussein's father says he and his son must start together from scratch. With help from relatives, the two have found a temporary shelter in a home \u2014 and, for the father, a brief sense of relief. \u201cI thank God he is not asking for or about his mother and his siblings,\u201d said Hassan Mikdad, the 40-year-old father.",
      "He has no explanation for his son, who watched their family die in their home. His two sisters \u2014 Celine, 10, and Cila, 14 \u2014 were pulled out of the rubble the following day. His mother, Mona, was pulled out three days later. She was locked in an embrace with her 6-year-old son, Ali.",
      "The strike on Oct. 21 also caused damage across the street, to one of Beirut\u2019s main public hospitals, breaking solar panels and windows in the pharmacy and the dialysis unit. The father survived because he had stepped out for coffee. He watched his building crumble in the late-night airstrike. He also lost his shop, his motorcycles and car \u2014 all the evidence of his 16 years of family life.",
      "His friend, Hussein Hammoud, arrived on the scene to help sift through rubble. Hammoud spotted young Hussein Mikdad\u2019s fingers in the darkness in an alley behind their home. At first, he thought they were severed limbs \u2014 until he heard the boy\u2019s screams. He dug out Hussein with glass lodged in his leg and a metal bar in his shoulder. Hammoud said he didn\u2019t recognize the boy. He held the child's almost-severed wrist in place.",
      "In the hospital now, Hussein Mikdad sipped a juice as he listened to his father and his friend. His father turned to him, asking if he wanted a Spider-Man toy \u2014 an effort to forestall a new outburst of tears. He said he buys Hussein a toy each day.",
      "\u201cWhat I am living through seems like a big lie. ...The mind can\u2019t comprehend,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank God for the blessing that is Hussein.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A suspected attack by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels has seen multiple explosions strike near a vessel traveling through the Red Sea",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A suspected attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels saw multiple explosions strike near a vessel traveling through the Red Sea on Tuesday, though no damage was immediately reported by the ship, authorities said.",
      "The attack comes as the rebels continue their monthslong assault targeting shipping through a waterway that typically sees $1 trillion in goods pass through it a year over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and Israel's ground offensive in Lebanon.",
      "The Houthis have insisted that the attacks will continue as long as the wars go on, and the assaults already have halved shipping through the region. Meanwhile, a U.N. panel of experts now allege that the Houthis may be shaking down some shippers for about $180 million a month for safe passage through the area.",
      "A vessel in the southern reaches of the Red Sea, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) southwest of the rebel-held port city of Hodeida, reported the attack, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said.",
      "No one was wounded on board in the blasts, and the ship was continuing on its journey, the UKMTO added.",
      "The Houthis didn't immediately claim the attack. However, it can take the rebels hours or even days before they acknowledge one of their assaults.",
      "The Houthis have targeted more than 90 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign, which also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.",
      "The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.",
      "The Houthis have shot down multiple American MQ-9 Reaper drones as well.",
      "The last Houthi maritime attack came Oct. 28 and targeted the Liberian-flagged bulk tanker Motaro. Before that, an Oct. 10 attack targeted the Liberian-flagged chemical tanker Olympic Spirit.",
      "It's unclear why the Houthis' attacks have dropped, though they have launched multiple missiles toward Israel as well. On Oct. 17, the U.S. military unleashed B-2 stealth bombers to target underground bunkers used by the rebels. U.S. airstrikes also have been targeting Houthi positions in recent days as well.",
      "Meanwhile, a report by U.N. experts from October says \u201cthe Houthis allegedly collected illegal fees from a few shipping agencies to allow their ships to sail through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden without being attacked.\u201d It put the money generated a month at around $180 million, though it stressed it hadn't been able to corroborate the information provided by sources to the panel.",
      "The Houthis haven't directly responded to the allegation. However, the report did include two threatening emails the Houthis sent to shippers, with one of those vessels later coming under attack by the rebels."

      "He added: \"We need to raise the cost for Putin and his enabling authoritarian friends by providing Ukraine with the support it needs to change the trajectory of the conflict.\u201d",
      "Rutte, who did not provided details about the military equipment and weapons needed for that purpose, said it was \u201cvery concerning\u201d that Russia was getting \u201ccloser to its allies, China, Iran and North Korea.\u201d",
      "The comments come as the U.S., South Korea and Ukraine say North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine.",
      "\u201cRussia, working together with North Korea, Iran and China, is not only threatening Europe... but also the Indo-Pacific and North America. So we must stand together,\u201d Rutte said.",
      "Macron reiterated his call for a \u201cstrong Europe\u201d as being key to NATO but also as a response to \u201cwhat the U.S. administration rightly expects\u201d in an apparent reference to the election of Donald Trump for a second term.",
      "During his first in the White House, Trump pushed the European NATO allies to spend more on defense, up to and beyond 2% of gross domestic product, and to be less reliant on U.S. military cover.",
      "\"For too long, Europe has avoided bearing the burden of its own security, believing that it could, in a way, receive the dividends of peace without any time limit,\" Macron said."

      "Vardis J. Vardinoyannis, a powerful and pivotal figure in Greek shipping and energy who survived a terrorist attack and cultivated close ties with the Kennedy family, died Tuesday in Athens. He was 90.",
      "His death was announced by Motor Oil Hellas, the petroleum company Vardinoyannis transformed into one of Greece\u2019s largest corporations.",
      "Born on the island of Crete, the fifth of eight children, Vardinoyannis embodied the archetype of the Greek shipping magnate who became a powerbroker at the head of one of the country\u2019s most influential families.",
      "After graduating from the naval academy in 1955, he served as an officer until his forced retirement and exile on a then remote Greek island due to his opposition to the military dictatorship that governed the country from 1967 to 1974.",
      "Vardinoyannis joined the family business in the early 1970s, and began building an extensive network of enterprises that eventually included shipping, banking, hotels, sports clubs, newspapers and national television networks.",
      "He was a supporter of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights foundation and led multiple charity initiatives with his wife, Marianna, who died last year aged 86.",
      "Greece\u2019s conservative prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis paid tribute on Tuesday to Vardinoyannis and his philanthropic work.",
      "\u201cWith deep sadness, I bid farewell to Vardis Vardinoyiannis \u2013 the patriarch of a family that has left an indelible mark on the economic and social landscape of our country over the past decades,\u201d Mitsotakis said.",
      "\u201cBehind his always serious gaze, he concealed many facets: from boldness and dynamism in business competition to countless charitable initiatives, many of which he preferred to keep anonymous.\u201d",
      "In 1990, Vardinoyannis survived an assassination attempt by the November 17 far-left militant group, when a car containing explosives, smoke bombs and anti-tank rocket launchers was used to target his moving armored car. The group\u2019s members were eventually rounded up and convicted 13 years later for multiple and deadly attacks against politicians, U.S. officials, and local business leaders.",
      "Vardinoyannis\u2019 financial and political influence grew after he forged a partnership with Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco in the mid-1990s, as Greece gained prosperity as a member of the European Union after decades of hardship and political instability.",
      "He maintained close ties with the Kennedy family, hosting the wedding in Greece of Rory Kennedy \u2013 daughter of Robert F. Kennedy \u2013 to the writer and documentary filmmaker Mark Bailey in 1999.",
      "Later in life, Vardinoyannis became closely involved in charity projects with his wife, who was a UNESCO goodwill ambassador and head of a children's cancer charity.",
      "They are survived by their five children. The funeral arrangements were not immediately known."

      "MANILA, Philippines -- A new typhoon barreled across an agricultural region in the northeastern Philippines on Monday after thousands were evacuated to safety while still struggling to recover from the devastation caused by three successive storms in the last three weeks.",
      "Typhoon Toraji slammed into northeastern Aurora province and was forecast to blow over the mountainous Luzon region, where President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. \u2014 just the day before \u2014 inspected the damage from the last storm and led the distribution of food packs to residents in Cagayan and Ilocos provinces. Marcos skipped this week\u2019s Asia-Pacific Cooperation forum in Peru to oversee recovery efforts from back-to-back storms.",
      "After making landfall in Aurora on Monday morning with sustained winds of up to 130 kilometers (81 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 180 kph (112 mph), the typhoon was expected to barrel northwestward across Luzon, weaken as it crosses a mountain range and then blow into the South China Sea.",
      "Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla on Sunday ordered the forcible evacuation of people in 2,500 villages expected to be lashed by Toraji, locally named Nika, warning that the rain-soaked Luzon mountains, valleys and plains were more susceptible to flash floods and landslides. With the typhoon approaching fast, there was little time to move large numbers of people to safety, he said.",
      "\"We understand if some would want to stay, but we have to get them out,\u201d Remulla told reporters.",
      "The military said its disaster-response forces have been deployed near high-risk areas and were standing by for new contingencies. It added that it suspended combat drills in the north due to the weather.",
      "\u201cOur commitment remains steadfast in safeguarding and assisting our countrymen specially in times of disaster,\u201d Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesperson Col. Francel Margareth Padilla said.",
      "Schools were shut down, inter-island ferry services and domestic flights were suspended in provinces in or near the path of the typhoon, the 14th weather disturbance to batter the Philippine archipelago this year. Forecasters said they were monitoring another brewing storm in the Pacific that could affect the country if it strengthens.",
      "The last two typhoons and a tropical storm caused more than 160 deaths, damaged thousands of houses and farmlands and affected more than 9 million people, including hundreds of thousands who fled to emergency shelters, after dumping from one to two months\u2019 worth of rain in just 24 hours in some cities and towns.",
      "Overwhelmed, the Philippines received help from Southeast Asian countries led by Singapore, along with longtime treaty ally the United States, to transport food, water and other aid to hard-hit northern provinces.",
      "The Philippine archipelago is often battered by typhoons and earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the most natural disaster-prone countries in the world.",
      "In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines."

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon made a \u201cformal and unreserved\u201d apology in Parliament on Tuesday for the widespread abuse, torture and neglect of hundreds of thousands of children and vulnerable adults in care.",
      "\u201cIt was horrific. It was heartbreaking. It was wrong. And it should never have happened,\u201d Luxon said, as he spoke to lawmakers and a public gallery packed with survivors of the abuse.",
      "An estimated 200,000 people in state, foster and faith-based care suffered \u201cunimaginable\u201d abuse over a period of seven decades, a blistering report released in July said at the end of the largest inquiry ever undertaken in New Zealand. They were disproportionately M\u0101ori, New Zealand\u2019s Indigenous people.",
      "\u201cFor many of you it changed the course of your life, and for that, the government must take responsibility,\u201d Luxon said. He said he was apologizing for previous governments too.",
      "In foster and church care \u2014 as well as in state-run institutions, including hospitals and residential schools \u2014 vulnerable people \u201cshould have been safe and treated with respect, dignity and compassion,\" he added. \u201cBut instead, you were subjected to horrific abuse and neglect and in some cases torture.\u201d",
      "The findings of the six-year investigation believed to be the widest-ranging of comparable probes worldwide were a \u201cnational disgrace,\u201d the inquiry's report said. New Zealand's investigation followed two decades of such inquiries around the globe as nations struggle to reckon with authorities\u2019 transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in care.",
      "Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in New Zealand's state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 \u2014 in a country that today has a population of 5 million \u2014 nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected.",
      "\u201cWe will never know that true number,\u201d Chris Hipkins, the leader of the opposition, told Parliament. \u201cMany people entering into state and faith-based institutions were undocumented. Records were incomplete, they've gone missing, and in some cases, yes, they were deliberately destroyed.\u201d",
      "In response to the findings, New Zealand\u2019s government agreed for the first time that historical treatment of some children in a notorious state-run hospital amounted to torture \u2014 a claim successive administrations had rejected.",
      "\u201cI am deeply sorry that New Zealand did not do better by you. I am sorry you were not believed when you came forward to report your abuse,\u201d Luxon said. \u201cI am sorry that many abusers were not made to face justice which meant that other people experienced abuse that could have been prevented.\u201d",
      "His government was working on 28 of the inquiry's 138 recommendations, Luxon said, although he did not yet have concrete details on financial redress, which the inquiry had exhorted since 2021 and said could run to billions of dollars.",
      "Luxon was decried by some survivors and advocates earlier Tuesday for not divulging compensation plans alongside the apology. He told Parliament a single redress system would be established in 2025.",
      "He did not, however, suggest a figure for the amount the government expected to pay.",
      "\u201cThere will be a big bill, but it's nothing compared to the debt we owe those survivors and it must not be the reason for any further delay,\u201d said Hipkins, the opposition leader.",
      "Later Tuesday, the government introduced a suite of law changes to improve the safety of those in care, including a ban on strip searches of children. Luxon also announced a national rememebrance day on Nov. 12 each year. Work would begin on removing the names of perpetrators of abuse from street signs, he said.",
      "Survivors began to arrive at Parliament hours before the apology, having won spots in the public gallery by ballot. Some were reluctant to accept the state's words, because they said the scale of the horror was not yet fully understood by lawmakers and public servants.",
      "Jeering was so loud during an apology from the country's solicitor-general that her speech was inaudible. Others called out or left the room in tears while senior public servants from relevant health and welfare agencies spoke before Luxon's remarks.",
      "Survivors invited to give speeches were required to do so before Luxon's apology \u2014 rather than in response to it, said Tu Chapman, one of those asked to speak.",
      "\u201cRight now I feel alone and in utter despair at the way in which this government has undertaken the task of acknowledging all survivors,\u201d she told a crowd at Parliament.",
      "The abuse \"ripped families and communities apart, trapping many into a life of prison, incarceration, leaving many uneducated,\u201d said Keith Wiffin \u2014 a survivor of abuse in a notorious state-run boys' home. \u201cIt has tarred our international reputation as an upholder of human rights, something this nation likes to dine out on.\u201d",
      "The inquiry's recommendations included seeking apologies from state and church leaders, among them Pope Francis. It also endorsed creating offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.",
      "Its writers were scathing about how widely the abuse \u2014 and the identities of many abusers \u2014 were known about for years, with nothing done to stop it.",
      "\u201cThis has meant you have had to re-live your trauma over and over again,\u201d said Luxon. \u201cAgencies should have done better and must commit to doing so in the future.\u201d",
      "He did not concede that public servants or government ministers who had denied state abuse was widespread when they served in previous administrations should lose their jobs. Luxon has also rejected suggestions by survivors that policies he has enacted which disproportionately target M\u0101ori \u2014 such as crackdowns on gangs and the establishment of military-style boot camps for young offenders \u2014 undermine his government's regret about the abuse.",
      "M\u0101ori are over-represented in prisons and gangs. In 2023, 68% of children in state care were M\u0101ori, although they are less than 20% of New Zealand's population.",
      "\u201cIt's not enough to say sorry,\u201d said Fa\u2019afete Taito, a survivor of violent abuse at another state-run home, and a former gang member. \u201cIt's what you do to heal the wounds of your actions and make sure it never happens again that really counts.\u201d"

      "Earlier, police said that four other men who had been arrested last week would remain in custody while the investigation continues. Two of those are minors, a 16-year old and a 17-year old from Amsterdam. The other two men are from Amsterdam and a nearby city.",
      "Police said they have identified over 170 witnesses and have taken forensics evidence from dozens. Prime Minister Dick Schoof said they were also examining videos posted to social media.",
      "Schoof was meeting with community leaders Tuesday afternoon to discuss antisemitism.",
      "Reports of antisemitic speech, vandalism and violence have been on the rise in Europe since the start of the war in Gaza, and tensions mounted in Amsterdam before Thursday night\u2019s match.",
      "The mayor has banned all demonstrations in the city and declared several parts of Amsterdam risk zones where police can stop and check anyone. Dozens were detained on Sunday for taking part in a pro-Palestinian demonstration in central Amsterdam that had been outlawed.",
      "A small demonstration was ended by police Tuesday outside Amsterdam City Hall during a debate about the unrest, Dutch broadcaster NOS reported."

      "International aid groups say Israel has failed to meet U.S. demands that it allow greater humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip where conditions are worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war",
      "JERUSALEM -- Israel has failed to meet U.S. demands to allow greater humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip, where conditions are worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war, international aid organizations said Tuesday.",
      "The obstacles facing aid distribution were on this display this week. Even after the military gave permission for a delivery to the northernmost part of Gaza \u2014 virtually cut off from food for more than a month by an Israeli siege \u2014 the United Nations said it couldn't deliver most of it because of turmoil and restrictions from Israeli troops on the ground.",
      "Hunger experts have warned the north may already be experiencing famine.",
      "Meanwhile, in the south, hundreds of truckloads of aid are sitting on the Gaza side of the border because the U.N. says it cannot reach them to distribute \u2014 again because of the threat of lawlessness, theft and Israeli military restrictions.",
      "The Biden administration last month set a deadline expiring Tuesday for Israel to \u201csurge\u201d more food and other emergency aid into the Palestinian territory. The administration warned that failure to comply could trigger U.S. laws requiring it to scale back military support as Israel wages offensives against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.",
      "Israel has announced a series of steps \u2014 though their effect was unclear. On Tuesday, it opened a new crossing in central Gaza, outside the city of Deir al-Balah for aid to enter. It also announced a small expansion of its coastal \u201chumanitarian zone,\u201d where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are sheltering in tent camps. It connected electricity for a desalination plant in Deir al Balah.",
      "U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said last week that Israel had made some progress but needs to do more. Still U.S. officials haven\u2019t said whether they will take any action.",
      "Israel\u2019s new foreign minister, Gideon Saar, appeared to downplay the deadline, telling reporters Monday that he was confident \u201cthe issue would be solved.\u201d The Biden administration may have less leverage after the reelection of Donald Trump, who was a staunch supporter of Israel in his first term.",
      "Eight international aid organization said in their report Tuesday that \u201cIsrael not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria\u201d but also took actions \u201cthat dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in Northern Gaza. \u2026 That situation is in an even more dire state today than a month ago.\u201d",
      "The report listed 19 measures of compliance with the U.S. demands. It said that Israel had failed to comply with 15 and only partially complied with four.",
      "The report was co-signed by Anera, Care, MedGlobal, Mercy Corps, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam, Refugees International and Save the Children.",
      "In an Oct. 13 letter, the U.S. gave Israel 30 days to, among other things, allow a minimum of 350 truckloads of goods into Gaza each day; open a fifth crossing; allow people in coastal tent camps to move inland before the winter; and ensure access for aid groups to northern Gaza. It also called on Israel to halt legislation that would hinder operations of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA.",
      "Aid levels remain far below the U.S. benchmarks. Access to northern Gaza remains restricted, and Israel has pressed ahead with its laws against UNRWA.",
      "Israel launched a major offensive last month in the north, where it says Hamas militants had regrouped. The operation has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands.",
      "Through October and the first days of November, Israel allowed no food to enter the area, where tens of thousands of civilians have stayed despite evacuation orders.",
      "Last week, Israel allowed 11 trucks to go to Beit Hanoun, one of the north\u2019s hardest-hit towns. But the World Food Organization said troops at a checkpoint forced its trucks to unload their cargo before reaching shelters in the town.",
      "On Tuesday, COGAT \u2014 the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza \u2014 announced it allowed a new delivery of food and water to Beit Hanoun a day earlier. Again, the WFP said that while it tried to send 14 trucks, only three made it to the town \u201cdue to delays in receiving authorization for movement and crowds along the route.\u201d When it tried to deliver the rest on Tuesday, Israel denied it permission, it said.",
      "Aid into all of Gaza plummeted in October, when just 34,000 tons of food entered, only a third of the previous month, according to Israeli data.",
      "U.N. agencies say even less actually gets through because of Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and lawlessness that makes it difficult to collect and distribute aid on the Gaza side.",
      "In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, and 75 a day so far in November, according to Israel\u2019s official figures. The U.N. says it only received 39 trucks daily since the beginning of October.",
      "COGAT said 900 truckloads of aid are sitting uncollected on the Gaza side of the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south.",
      "\u201cBefore the organizations give out grades, they should focus on distributing the aid that awaits them,\u201d COGAT said in response to the aid groups\u2019 report.",
      "Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, said the miliary was not coordinating movements for aid trucks to reach the stacked-up cargos. \u201cIf we are not provided a safe passage to go and collect it ... it will not reach the people who need it,\u201d she said.",
      "COGAT blamed the drop in October on closures of the crossings for the Jewish high holidays and memorials marking the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that triggered the war. An Israeli official also pointed to theft by Hamas and organized crime families in Gaza. He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations.",
      "The war began last year when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s bombardment and ground invasion have killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who don\u2019t say how many of those killed were militants. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million has been displaced, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps, with little food, water or hygiene facilities.",
      "The United States has rushed billions of dollars in military aid to Israel during the war, while pressing it to allow more aid into Gaza.",
      "Trump has promised to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how. He was a staunch defender of Israel during his previous term, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says they have spoken three times since his reelection last week.",
      "Israeli President Isaac Herzog, whose role is mostly ceremonial, is scheduled to meet with President Joe Biden on Tuesday.",
      "Former U.S. State Department official Charles Blaha, who ran the office in charge of ensuring that U.S. military support complies with U.S. and international law, predicted the Biden administration would find that Israel violated U.S. law by blocking humanitarian aid from reaching Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that Israel has done that,\u201d Blaha said. \u201cThey would really have to torture themselves to find that Israel hasn\u2019t restricted ... assistance.\u201d",
      "But he expected the administration to cite U.S. national security interests and waive restrictions on military support.",
      "\u201cIf the past is prologue \u2014 no restrictions, and then kick the can down the road to the next administration.\u201d",

      "The head of the Church of England, spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, is under pressure to resign after an investigation found he failed to inform police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as...",
      "LONDON -- The head of the Church of England, spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, is under pressure to resign after an investigation found that he failed to inform police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it.",
      "Some members of the General Synod, the church\u2019s national assembly, have started a petition calling on Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby to step down, saying he had \u201clost the confidence of his clergy.\u201d The petition had garnered more than 1,800 signatures on Change.org by late morning London time on Monday.",
      "Compounding the pressure, a senior cleric added her voice to those who believe he should resign. Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Newcastle, told the BBC that Welby\u2019s position is \u201cuntenable.''",
      "Calls for Welby\u2019s resignation have grown since Thursday, when the church released the results of an independent review into John Smyth, who sexually, psychologically and physically abused about 30 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and 85 in Africa over five decades.",
      "The 251-page report concluded that Welby failed to report Smyth to authorities when he was informed of the abuse in August 2013, soon after he became Archbishop of Canterbury.",
      "Welby last week took responsibility for not ensuring that the allegations were pursued as \u201cenergetically\u201d as they should have been after he learned of the abuse, but said he had decided not to resign.",
      "On Monday, his office issued a statement reiterating Welby\u2019s \u201chorror at the scale of John Smyth\u2019s egregious abuse.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs he has said, he had no awareness or suspicion of the allegations before he was told in 2013 \u2014 and therefore, having reflected, he does not intend to resign,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe hopes the Makin Review supports the ongoing work of building a safer church here and around the world.\u201d",
      "Church officials were first made aware of the abuse in 1982, when they received the results of an internal investigation into Smyth. The recipients of that report \u201cparticipated in an active cover-up\u201d to prevent its findings from coming to light, the Makin Review found.",
      "Between 1984 and 2001, Smyth moved to Zimbabwe and subsequently relocated to South Africa. He continued to abuse boys and young men in Zimbabwe and there is evidence that the abuse continued in South Africa until he died in August 2018.",
      "Smyth\u2019s abuse wasn\u2019t made public until a 2017 investigation by Britain\u2019s Channel 4 television, which led Hampshire Police to start an investigation. Police were planning to question Smyth at the time of his death and had been preparing to extradite him.",
      "The Makin Review found that if Smyth had been reported to police in 2013, it could have helped to uncover the truth, prevented further abuse and led to a possible criminal conviction.",
      "\u201cIn effect, three and a half years was lost, a time within which John Smyth could have been brought to justice and any abuse he was committing in South Africa discovered and stopped,\u201d the review found.",
      "The Archbishop of Canterbury is the head of the Church of England and is seen as the spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion, which has more than 85 million members in 165 countries. He is considered first among equals with respect to the communion\u2019s other primates.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. researchers have concluded that China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor to power future aircraft carriers",
      "BANGKOK -- China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing the country\u2019s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California is the first to confirm it is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \u201cblue-water\u201d force capable of operating around the globe in a growing challenge to the United States.",
      "Nuclear carriers take longer to build than conventional carriers, but once in operation they are able to stay at sea for much longer because they do not need to refuel, and there is more room on board for fuel and weapons for aircraft, thus extending their capabilities. They are also able to produce more power to run advanced systems.",
      "Right now, only the United States and France have nuclear-powered carriers. The U.S. has 11 in total, which allows it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "China currently has three carriers, including the new Type 003 Fujian, which was the first both designed and built by China. It has said work is already underway on a fourth, but it has not announced whether that will be nuclear or conventionally powered.",
      "The modernization aligns with China\u2019s \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\u201d for its navy \u201cto operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China\u2019s military.",
      "Middlebury researchers were initially investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan over suspicions that China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons. Instead they said they determined that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship.",
      "The conclusion was based upon a wide variety of sources, including satellite images, project tenders, personnel files, and environmental impact studies.",
      "The reactor is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship.\u201d as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizeable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \u201cfirst-class\u201d navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s great rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \u201cspeeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\u201d",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the new Fujian aircraft carrier in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \u201csoon be announced,\u201d but so far it has not been.",
      "Neither China's Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "Even if the carrier that has been started will likely be another conventionally-powered Type 003 ship, experts say Chinese shipyards have the capability to work on more than one carrier at a time, and that they could produce a new nuclear-powered vessel concurrently.",

      "The expected vote in the Bundestag would come well ahead of original plans, marking a step to reach compromise between Scholz's party, the Social Democrats, and the main opposition party in parliament, the center-right Christian conservatives.",
      "The move comes after the collapse of Scholz\u2019s three-party coalition last week, at a time when the leaders of Europe's biggest economy have been grappling with ways to revive Germany's anemic economic growth.",

      "Love them or hate them, it\u2019s hard to see health savings accounts losing traction any time soon. Used in conjunction with high-deductible healthcare plans, the accounts have been touted as a way to put downward pressure on healthcare costs.",
      "Even though HSAs are the only triple tax-advantaged vehicle in the tax code--allowing for pretax contributions, tax-free compounding, and tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses-- few HSA owners fund the accounts to the maximum.",

      "Yet HSA expenses and/or shortcomings on the investment front can erode the accounts\u2019 prodigious tax benefits. That\u2019s particularly true for smaller HSA investors: Not only do flat dollar-based account-maintenance fees (say, $45/year) hit smaller HSA investors harder than ones with larger balances, but interest rates for smaller investors\u2019 health savings accounts may also be lower. Thus, it\u2019s valuable to conduct due diligence on your HSA.",
      "Setup Fees: A one-time fee imposed at the time of the health savings account setup; this fee may be covered by your employer.",
      "Account-Maintenance Fees: These are fees for maintaining your account at the institution, whether a bank or credit union; they can be levied on a monthly or annual basis. They may be covered by the employer, and HSA investors with larger balances may be able to circumvent them altogether.",
      "Transaction Fees: These dollar-based fees may be levied each time an individual pays for services using the health savings account.",
      "Interest Rate on Savings Accounts: Many HSAs offer lower interest rates on smaller balances than they do for larger ones; that--combined with the fact that account-maintenance fees are apt to hit smaller HSA savers harder than larger ones--argues for building and maintaining critical mass in your HSA, to the extent that you use one at all.",
      "Investment Choices: Assess the investment lineup on offer to make sure it aligns with your investment philosophy. Many HSA investment lineups tilt heavily toward low-cost index funds, but others feature primarily actively managed funds, often with higher expenses.",
      "If you\u2019ve done your homework on your employer-provided HSA and found it lacking, you have three distinct choices.",
      "Option 1: Contribute to an HSA on Your Own",
      "As long as you\u2019re enrolled in a high-deductible healthcare plan, you are technically free to pick another HSA rather than steering your contributions into an employer-selected HSA.",
      "You could then deduct your HSA contributions on your tax return. However, that\u2019s more cumbersome and requires more discipline than steering a portion of your paycheck directly into the \u201ccaptive\u201d HSA.",
      "Additionally, HSA contributions made under a salary reduction arrangement in a section 125 cafeteria plan are not subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes, whereas those taxes will come out of your paycheck even if you ultimately end up diverting those dollars to your own HSA.",
      "For those reasons, foregoing payroll deductions for an HSA is usually not the best option.",
      "Option 2: Transfer the Money from Your Employer-Provided HSA into Another HSA",
      "With this strategy, your HSA contribution is deducted directly from your paycheck and sent to your employer-provided HSA; you can then periodically transfer all or a portion of that balance into an external HSA of your own choosing.",
      "There are no tax consequences on HSA transfers, and you can conduct multiple transfers per year.",
      "The employee can contribute enough to the savings account to cover anticipated out-of-pocket healthcare costs, but steer any excess funds into an HSA with better investment options.",
      "Option 3: Roll Over the Money from Your Employer-Provided HSA into Another HSA",
      "This strategy is similar to option 2.",
      "You contribute to your employer-provided HSA via payroll deduction, then roll over the money to an HSA provider of your choice.",
      "There are two key differences between a rollover and a transfer, however.",
      "The first is that in contrast to a transfer, where the two trustees handle the funds and leave you out of it, a rollover means you get a check for your balance; you must deposit that money into another HSA within 60 days or it counts as an early withdrawal and a 20% penalty will apply if you\u2019re not yet 65 (or if you don\u2019t have receipts to support medical expenses equal to the amount of your withdrawal).",
      "Another key difference is that multiple transfers are permitted between HSAs, but you\u2019re only allowed one HSA rollover per 12-month period.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 10:34:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a rule announced by the Biden administration",
    "story": [
      "Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a rule announced by the Biden administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a final rule announced Tuesday by the Biden administration.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency rule follows through on a directive from Congress included in the 2022 climate law. The new fee is intended to encourage industry to adopt best practices that reduce emissions of methane \u2014 the primary component of natural gas \u2014 and thereby avoid paying.",
      "Methane is a climate \u201csuper pollutant\u201d that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, announced at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes a day after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Joe Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule will not become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden\u2019s methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\u201d he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry\u2019s largest lobbying group, said the fee \u201champers our ability to meet the growing energy needs of American families and businesses and fails to advance meaningful emissions reduction.\"",
      "API senior vice president Dustin Meyer said the group looks forward to working with the Trump administration and the new Congress to repeal the fee and \u201cget this right.\"",
      "Environmental groups hailed the new fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it\u2019s cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "\u201cWhile we expect the next administration to recklessly greenlight fossil fuel extraction, it\u2019s heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,\u201d said Maggie Coulter, a lawyer at the Center for Biological Diversity, an advocacy group.",
      "\u201cUltimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction,\" Coulter said. \u201cThe oil and gas companies doing so much damage to our climate should have to pay for the methane leaks they\u2019ve so outrageously failed to fix.\u201d"

      "The nominee for the European Union's next top diplomat says the bloc must commit to Ukraine for the long-haul even as the war's costs mount",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union must back Ukraine against Russia for as a long as it takes and persuade the United States that its strategic interests in China are tied up in the outcome of the war, the woman nominated as the bloc\u2019s top diplomat for the next five years said Tuesday.",
      "Questions have been raised about whether the 27-nation EU\u2019s commitment to Ukraine would remain firm with Russia appearing to have an edge in the war, which began on Feb. 24, 2022, and following the reelection of Donald Trump, who has vowed to end the conflict as U.S. president.",
      "\u201cUkraine\u2019s victory is a priority for us all. The situation on the battlefield is very difficult,\u201d Estonia ex-Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told EU lawmakers during a hearing she must pass to be appointed as foreign policy chief.",
      "\u201cThat is why we must keep on working every day. Today, tomorrow and for as long as it takes and with as much military, financial and humanitarian aid as needed,\u201d she said, and added that \u201cthis must be underpinned by a clear path for Ukraine to join the European Union.\u201d",
      "Kallas underlined China\u2019s more covert role in the conflict.",
      "\u201cWithout China\u2019s support to Russia, Russia would not be able to continue its war with the same force. China needs to also feel the higher cost,\u201d she said, suggesting that sanctions should be considered.",
      "Many EU leaders and representatives have long insisted that the bloc must wean itself off its security dependence on the United States, regardless of who is in power in Washington. The belief is that the U.S. is increasingly focused on its growing rivalry with China.",
      "But Kallas noted: \u201cIf (the) U.S is worried about China, or other actors, then they should also be worried about how we respond in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, because we see how Iran, North Korea, China, more covertly, and Russia are working together.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Dutch appeals court has overturned a landmark ruling that ordered energy company Shell to cut its carbon emissions by net 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A Dutch appeals court on Tuesday overturned a landmark ruling that ordered energy company Shell to cut its carbon emissions by net 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels, while saying that \"protection against dangerous climate change is a human right.\u201d",
      "The decision was a defeat for the Dutch arm of Friends of the Earth and other environmental groups, which had hailed the original 2021 ruling as a victory for the climate. Tuesday's civil ruling can be appealed to the Dutch Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cThis hurts,\u201d Friends of the Earth director in the Netherlands Donald Pols said. \u201cAt the same time, we see that this case has ensured that major polluters are not immune and has further stimulated the debate about their responsibility in combating dangerous climate change. That is why we continue to tackle major polluters, such as Shell.\u201d",
      "Outside court, Pols said the fight against climate change \u201cis a marathon, not a sprint, and the race has just begun.\u201d",
      "The ruling upholding Shell\u2019s appeal came as a 12-day U.N. climate conference was entering its second day in Azerbaijan where countries are discussing how to fund cutting planet-warming emissions and adapt to ever-increasing weather extremes.",
      "It marked a stinging defeat for climate activists after several courtroom victories. A court in The Hague in 2015 ordered the government to cut emissions by at least 25% by the end of 2020 from benchmark 1990 levels. The Dutch Supreme Court upheld the ruling five years ago.",
      "Earlier this year, a U.N. tribunal on maritime law said that countries are legally required to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea found that carbon emissions qualify as marine pollution and said that countries must take steps to mitigate and adapt to their adverse effects.",
      "And in April, Europe\u2019s highest human rights court ruled that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change.",
      "In December the top U.N. legal body, the International Court of Justice, is holding public hearings on climate change after the world body requested a nonbinding advisory opinion on \u201cthe obligations of States in respect of climate change.\u201d Dozens of countries are set to present arguments at two weeks of hearings.",
      "In a written summary of Tuesday's ruling, the court said that Shell has a duty of care to limit its emissions, but it annulled the lower court's decision because it was \u201cunable to establish that the social standard of care entails an obligation for Shell to reduce its CO2 emissions by 45%, or some other percentage.",
      "\"There is currently insufficient consensus in climate science on a specific reduction percentage to which an individual company like Shell should adhere.\u201d",
      "Shell has emitted 36,528 million tons of carbon dioxide, or CO2, since 1854, which is 2.1% of global emissions, according to an April report by the Carbon Majors Database.",
      "Presiding Judge Carla Joustra said that Shell already has targets for climate-warming carbon emissions that are in line with demands of Friends of the Earth \u2014 both for what it directly produces and for emissions produced by energy the company purchase from others.",
      "The court then ruled that \u201cfor Shell to reduce CO2 emissions caused by buyers of Shell products ... by a particular percentage would be ineffective in this case. Shell could meet that obligation by ceasing to trade in the fuels it purchases from third parties. Other companies would then take over that trade.\u201d",
      "Joustra said that, \u201cThe court\u2019s final judgment is that Friends of the Earth's claims cannot be granted. The court therefore annuls the district court\u2019s judgment.\u201d",
      "Climate activists sitting outside on the courthouse steps hugged, and some appeared close to tears after the decision.",
      "\u201cTo be honest I was just really disappointed,\" Neele Boelens said. I was almost crying. I was in there in the court and it was just like... At first it looked really good for us but then it just went down hill.\"",
      "Shell, meanwhile, welcomed the ruling.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased with the court\u2019s decision, which we believe is the right one for the global energy transition, the Netherlands and our company,\u201d Shell plc Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan said in a written statement. \u201cOur target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of Shell\u2019s strategy and is transforming our business.\"",

      "The Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival looks less attractive this year amid a sluggish economy, forcing e-commerce firms to look abroad for growth",
      "HONG KONG -- Businesses and consumers in China found the annual Singles' Day shopping festival less attractive this year amid a sluggish economy, forcing e-commerce firms to look abroad for growth.",
      "Online service provider and e-commerce platform Alibaba started the now-famous event on Nov. 11, 2009, offering attractive discounts to entice shoppers to spend more. The extravaganza, also known as \u201cDouble 11,\u201d has since expanded to other platforms in China \u2014 like JD.com and Pinduoduo \u2014 and abroad.",
      "It has long been regarded as a barometer of consumer sentiment.",
      "While Singles\u2019 Day was previously a one-day event, shopping platforms in China now kickstart the festival weeks ahead to drum up sales volume. Even some brick-and-mortar stores join the festival by launching sales campaigns and hanging promotional banners and posters in the hopes of luring shoppers.",
      "But amid China\u2019s lagging domestic economy, dragged down by a real estate crisis and deflationary pressures, consumers no longer go all out during the shopping extravaganza.",
      "Meanwhile, e-commerce platforms grappling with a slowing domestic market have turned to overseas markets to seek new growth, offering promotions like global free shipping and allowing merchants to sell worldwide with ease.",
      "Alibaba, for example, said in a blog post on its Alizila site that some 70,000 merchants saw sales double with global free shipping. In markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, new customers also doubled, the e-commerce company said.",
      "Since the festival began in late October, \u201cI have only spent a few hundred yuan on daily necessities,\u201d said Wang Haihua, who owns a fitness center in the capital, Beijing.",
      "Wang said that the prices offered on e-commerce platforms during Singles\u2019 Day are not necessarily cheaper than usual. \u201cThey\u2019re all tricks and we\u2019ve seen through it over the years,\u201d she said.",
      "Zhang Jiewei, a 34-year-old who runs a barber shop in the city of Xi\u2019an, echoed Wang\u2019s sentiments, saying that he no longer trusts Singles\u2019 Day promotions as some merchants tend to raise the usual prices before offering a discount, giving consumers the illusion they are getting a deal.",
      "\u201cI used to buy a lot two or three years ago and I even purchased a mobile phone (during Singles\u2019 Day),\u201d he said. However, following the coronavirus pandemic, he stopped \u201cbecause of lower income.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am not going to buy anything this year,\u201d Zhang said.",
      "Some experts say that Beijing\u2019s recent stimulus measures have had little impact on boosting consumer confidence.",
      "\u201cPeople are not interested in spending and are cutting back on big-ticket items,\u201d said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. \u201cSince October 2022, the weak economy means that everything has been on discount year-round, 11.11 is not going to bring in more discounts than the month before.\u201d",
      "Rein said he expects low growth for the Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival as consumers tighten their spending in anticipation of difficult economic times ahead.",
      "Categories such as sportswear and fitness, however, have been doing well as customers \u201ctrade down a Gucci bag for Lululemon sportswear,\u201d he said.",
      "Jacob Cooke, CEO of e-commerce consultancy WPIC Marketing + Technologies, said that despite the luxury downturn, the shopping festival still showed strong sales for goods in premium price brands across categories like mother-baby, personal care and toys, as well as outdoor and sport.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear shift in consumer priorities towards experiences, hobbies, and health,\u201d Cooke said. \u201cWith record-level platform subsidies and generous membership programs like Alibaba\u2019s 88VIP, consumers actually showed a preference for premium branded goods during this year\u2019s festival.\u201d",
      "Platforms like JD.com and Alibaba previously used to publish the total value of the festival's transactions, but have stopped since 2022. While yearly growth used to be in the double digits, estimates of recent figures have dwindled to low single-digit growth.",
      "Syntun, a data provider, estimated that last year\u2019s gross merchandising volume sales across major e-commerce platforms grew just 2% to 1.14 trillion yuan ($156.40 billion), a far cry from double-digit growth before COVID-19.",
      "Alibaba also owns popular e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall,",
      "Even some merchants who typically participated in the festival say the high cost of advertising no longer pays off as sales dwindle.",
      "Zhao Gao, who owns a garment factory in eastern Zhejiang province, said that after paying to advertise on e-commerce platforms, he would only break even after sales.",
      "\u201cThe platforms have so many rules for promotions and customers have become more skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a merchant, I no longer participate in the Singles\u2019 Day promotions.\u201d",
      "Another merchant, Du Baonian who runs a food company processing mutton in Inner Mongolia, said consumers spend less and his overall sales were down by 15% compared to the past year.",
      "He still takes part in the Singles\u2019 Day promotions but said the higher expenses do not typically generate returns because of slow sales.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing shrinking revenue, but advertisement on the platform can help us maintain our leading sales position,\u201d he said, adding that he was considering advertising on more e-commerce platforms to target more consumers.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico is facing a second Donald Trump presidency, and few countries can match its experience as a target of Trump's rhetoric: There have been threats to close the border, impose tariffs and even send U.S. forces to fight Mexican drug cartels if the country doesn\u2019t do more to stem the flow of migrants and drugs.",
      "That\u2019s not to mention what mass deportations of migrants who are in the U.S. illegally could do to remittances \u2014 the money sent home by migrants \u2014 that have become one of Mexico\u2019s main sources of income.",
      "But as much as this second round looks like the first round \u2014 when Mexico pacified Trump by quietly ceding to his immigration demands \u2014 circumstances have changed, and not necessarily for the better. Today, Mexico has in Claudia Sheinbaum a somewhat stern leftist ideologue as president, and Trump is not known for handling such relations well.",
      "Back in 2019, Mexico\u2019s then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was a charismatic, plain-spoken, folksy leader who seemed to understand Trump, because both had a transactional view of politics: You give me what I want, I\u2019ll give you what you want. The two went on to form a chummy relationship.",
      "But while L\u00f3pez Obrador was forged in the give-and-take politics of the often-corrupt former ruling party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, Sheinbaum grew up in a family of leftist activists and got her political experience in radical university student movements.",
      "\u201cClaudia is more ideological than L\u00f3pez Obrador, and so the problem is that I see her potentially responding to Trumpian policies, whether it\u2019s, you know, organized crime or immigration or tariffs with a much more nationalistic, jingoistic view of the relationship,\u201d said Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S. from 2007 to 2013.",
      "Sheinbaum made a point of being one of the first world leaders to call Trump on Thursday to congratulate him after the election, but during the call Trump did two things that may say a lot about how things will go.",
      "First, Sheinbaum said, Trump quickly brought up the border to remind her there were issues there. Then he asked Sheinbaum to send his greetings to L\u00f3pez Obrador, with whom Trump said he had \u201ca very good relationship.\u201d That might suggest that Trump believes that L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2014 the new president's political mentor \u2014 is still in charge, a view shared by some analysts.",
      "Sarukhan said he believes the fact that Sheinbaum is a woman and is from Mexico will be \"a very important challenge, an issue out there as both of them get going in their relationship.\u201d",
      "There's little likelihood that Trump will get caught up in other issues and just forget about Mexico. Karoline Leavitt, the Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman, said Trump had been given \"a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver.\u201d",
      "Not everything has changed for the worse: Cross-border trade has topped $800 billion per year and U.S. companies are more dependent than ever on Mexican plants.",
      "But the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, or USMCA, is coming up for review, and Mexico has made legal changes that Trump could seize on to demand a re-negotiation of parts of the deal.",
      "Sheinbaum has suggested Mexico won't give in even if backed into a corner, saying \u201cwe obviously are going to address any problems that come up with dialogue, as a collaborative process, and if not, we are going to stand up, we are prepared to do that with great unity.\u201d",
      "Standing up hasn\u2019t worked particularly well before. In 2018, Marcelo Ebrard was Mexico\u2019s top diplomat; former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Ebrard basically bent to U.S. demands to keep asylum seekers in Mexico and accept migrants back even if they weren\u2019t Mexicans.",
      "Ebrard just asked that the deal not be made public to avoid embarrassing L\u00f3pez Obrador, Pompeo wrote. (Ebrard later claimed he had avoided signing a much worse \"safe third country\u2019\" agreement.)",
      "Today, Ebrard is Mexico\u2019s economy secretary, and would lead Mexico\u2019s delegation in the scheduled 2026 review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, something that Trump has greeted with mirth (\"I've never seen anybody fold like that,\" Trump once said of Ebrard.)",
      "Ebrard on Thursday downplayed any risks this time around, saying e conomic ties between the two countries would keep Trump from closing borders or imposing tariffs.",
      "\u201cI am optimistic. Unlike other countries, we are the largest trading partner (of the U.S.), so, if you put up a tariff, that will have repercussions in the United States,\u201d Ebrard said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it is going to be easy, because it is not at all easy, but the relationship with President Trump will be good because, what unites us? These numbers, this gigantic economy.\u201d",
      "But some former diplomats say any argument that Mexico can avoid friction with the Trump administration is overconfident, and that 2025 is not necessarily going to be like 2019.",
      "Martha B\u00e1rcena, Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. from 2018 to 2021, said she doesn't think Trump would back away from campaign promises to deport migrants who are in the country illegally. She said Mexican officials who believe Trump might temper his \u201ccampaign promises because Mexican migrants are necessary for the U.S. economy\u201d are being overly optimistic.",
      "\u201cMexico is looking at it through the lens of economic logic. The logic that the Trump campaign applies on immigration is a logic of national security and cultural identity issues,\" B\u00e1rcena said.",
      "Some of Trump's biggest policy concerns \u2013 restoring U.S. jobs and the increasing rivalry with China \u2014 also run through Mexico.",
      "U.S. and foreign automakers have set up dozens of plants in Mexico, and some in the U.S. worry that Chinese companies could do the same to take advantage of existing trade rules to export Chinese cars or auto parts to the United States.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help that Sheinbaum has pushed through L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policies aimed at eliminating independent regulatory and oversight bodies, and laws the U.S. government says could reduce the independence of the judiciary, both of which are required under the USMCA trade agreement.",
      "\u201cIf they go ahead with the elimination of independent regulators and autonomous bodies, that\u2019s going to be a further violation of the USMCA,\u201d Sarukhan said. \u201cAnd then that\u2019s going to make things even worse. Obviously, the big piece is going to be China and the Chinese footprint in Mexico.\u201d",
      "That could lead Trump to demand the re-negotiation of all auto industry agreements under the trade pact.",
      "As far as efforts to jointly combat the illegal drug trade \u2014 such cooperation fell to historic lows in 2019 and 2020 \u2014 there have been some modestly encouraging signs. Last week, Mexico announced the seizure in Tijuana of over 300,000 fentanyl pills after months when t he country\u2019s entire seizures had amounted to as little as 50 grams \u2014 a couple of ounces \u2014 per week.",
      "Sheinbaum, who took office on Oct. 1, also appears to be tacitly abandoning L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s strategy of not confronting drug cartels. But neither she nor her predecessor and political mentor could ever accept any Trump plan to send U.S. forces to operate independently on Mexican soil.",
      "It remains to see how far Trump might go; he often makes only token gestures to carry through on threats. But Sarukhan noted, \u201cI do think that he will talk loudly and carry a big stick.\u201d",

      "After years as an also-ran, the pastel-colored ponies were enshrined in the National Toy Hall of Fame on Tuesday, along with Transformers action figures and the Phase 10 card game.",
      "The honorees rose to the top in voting by a panel of experts and the public from among 12 finalists. This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\u201cThese are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\u201d Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \u201cBut for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\u201d",

      "\u201cThe My Little Pony line has endured for decades because it combines several traditional forms of doll play with children\u2019s fascination with horses,\" said Michelle Parnett-Dwyer, curator of dolls and toys. \u201cThe variety of figures promotes collecting as a pastime, too.\u201d",
      "Phase 10 was introduced by inventor and entrepreneur Ken Johnson in 1982. Today, Mattel sells 2 million decks of the card game annually in 30 countries and more than 20 languages. That makes it one of the bestselling card games in the world, according to the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, where the Toy Hall of Fame is housed.",
      "In the style of rummy, the game challenges players to collect groups of cards to complete 10 phases in sequential order before their opponents.",
      "\"Whether played in its original form or in one of its variations, Phase 10 has become an iconic game title that continues to encourage multigenerational social and competitive play,\u201d said Mirek Stolee, the museum's curator of board games and puzzles.",
      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots. They were first marketed with a cartoon and have since graduated to a series of live-action films. Social media sites allow for debates over which figures are must-haves, as well as demonstrations of the sometimes complex process of manipulating them from robot to vehicle or other alternate form.",
      "Regular new Transformers characters keep collectors coming back, Bensch said, \"but the toys are also popular because they are so suited to the ways kids play. The toy line feeds kids\u2019 imaginations and fantasy play.\u201d",
      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise."

      "Facebook and Instagram users in Europe will get the option to see less personalized ads if they don\u2019t want to pay for an ad-free subscription",
      "LONDON -- Facebook and Instagram users in Europe will get the option to see less personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription, social media company Meta said Tuesday, bowing to pressure from Brussels over privacy and digital competition concerns.",
      "Meta Platforms has been offering European Union an ad-free subscription option for about a year to comply with the continent's strict data privacy rules, but regulators had accused the company of giving people a false choice.",
      "The company said in a blog post that while people will still be able to choose between the subscription and existing free versions, it would also start giving free users an extra option over the coming weeks to see digital ads that are less personalized.",
      "This means ads will be targeted at users based only on what they see during their current session on Facebook or Instagram going back no more than two hours, plus minimal personal information such as age, location, gender as well as how they engage with ads.",
      "Data from all of a user's previous time spent on Facebook or Instagram, which is typically combined to precisely target an individual with tailored ads, won't be used.",
      "\u201cWhile this new choice is designed to give people an additional control over their data and ad experience, it may result in ads that are less relevant to a person\u2019s interests,\u201d Meta said in a blog post. \u201cThat means people will see ads that they don\u2019t find as interesting. This drop in relevance is inevitable given that drastically reduced data is being used to show these less personalized ads to people.\u201d",
      "People who choose the new option will see ad breaks that can't be skipped for a few seconds, Meta said.",
      "European Union regulators had accused Meta of breaching the 27-nation bloc's digital rules when it gave user the option to pay a monthly fee to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data.",
      "The U.S. tech giant had rolled out the option after the European Union\u2019s top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users\u2019 online interests and digital activity.",
      "The company also said Tuesday it's slashing monthly subscription prices for the ad-free option. Web users will pay 5.99 euros ($6.36), down from 9.99 euros previously, while iPhone and Android users will be charged 7.99 euros instead of 12.99 euros, which includes commissions charged by the Apple and Google mobile app stores.",
      "Meta's new subscription model could hit the company's lucrative digital ad business in one of its biggest markets. The company said it has already factored the new offering into its most recent business outlook and financial guidance.",
      "The options are available to users 18 and older in the EU\u2019s 27 member countries, plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein."

      "During the first day of the U.N. climate talks, COP29, Climate Adviser John Podesta struck a defiant but realistic tone in a press conference. He said Trump will likely pull the United States out of the landmark Paris Agreement and try to roll back many of the Biden Administration's signature climate moves, including the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that included $375 billion in climate spending.",
      "\u201cAre we facing new headwinds? Absolutely. But we won\u2019t revert back to the energy system of the 1950s. No way,\u201d Podesta said.",
      "\u201cSetbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,\u201d Podesta said paraphrasing a Biden speech last week. \u201cThis is not the end of our fight for a cleaner, safer planet. Facts are still facts. Science is still science. The fight is bigger than one election, one political cycle in one country. This fight is bigger, still, because we are all living through a year defined by the climate crisis in every country of the world.\u201d",
      "During the campaign, Trump said would pull America from the Paris Agreement, rollback parts of the IRA and increase drilling and oil production. He has called emissions regulations part of a \u201cgreen new scam\u201d and claimed, without evidence, that offshore wind turbines harm whales.",
      "During Trump's first administration, between 2017 and 2021, many environmental regulations were rolled back, later to be reversed by the Biden administration. The incoming Trump administration has signaled it plans to now undo Biden's changes.",
      "During his press conference, Podesta ran through a shopping list of climate disasters, starting with the hottest day recorded, July 22, continuing with floods, hurricanes and droughts.",
      "\u201cNone of this is a hoax. It is real. It\u2019s a matter of life and death,\u201d Podesta said. \u201cFortunately, many in our country and around the world are working to prepare the world for this new reality and to mitigate the most catastrophic effects of climate change.\u201d",
      "Podesta said the Biden administration is still negotiating even as it prepares to leave.",
      "\u201cWe are here to work, and we are committed to a successful outcome at COP29,\" Podesta said. \u201cWe can and will make real progress on the backs of our climate committed states and cities, our innovators, our companies and our citizens, especially young people who understand more than most that climate change poses an existential threat that we cannot afford to ignore.\u201d",
      "Another senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said other countries are still working with American diplomats because they care what the U.S. thinks and any agreement struck here must be by consensus. Outside analysts had speculated the U.S. would be ignored.",
      "\u201cIn January, we\u2019re going to inaugurate a president whose relationship to climate change is captured by the words \u2018hoax\u2019 and \u2018fossil fuels\u2019,\u201d Podesta said. \u201cHe\u2019s vowed to dismantle our environmental safeguards and once again withdraw United States from the Paris Agreement. That is what he said. And we should believe him.\u201d",

      "Despite extensive forensic investigations, review of surveillance and the questioning of a large number of witnesses, \u201cit is not possible to determine the cause of the fire in the historic stock exchange building,\" said Brian Belling, the Copenhagen police officer in charge of the investigation.",

      "As the fire raged, many, including ordinary people, ventured in to rescue artworks and around 90% of the cultural objects were rescued from the building.",
      "One of the hypotheses was that the fire started in connection with the renovation, Belling said.",
      "He said that the fire is believed to have started under the roof, which had been wrapped in scaffolding because of ongoing renovation work to be completed for its anniversary in 2024.",
      "\u201cThere is guidance regarding listed buildings when renovating them. It is our opinion that they have been followed to the letter,\u201d Tim Ole Simonsen, a senior member of the Greater Copenhagen Fire Department, told the same news conference. \u201cThen you can discuss whether they are good enough.\u201d",

      "Treasury yields have climbed sharply since September, in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it\u2019s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target.",
      "Some of the rise in yields has also been because of Trump. He talks up tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation and the U.S. government\u2019s debt higher, along with the economy\u2019s growth.",
      "Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many cuts to rates the Fed will deliver next year because of that. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel.",
      "The next update on inflation will arrive on Wednesday, when the U.S. government gives the latest reading on prices that U.S. consumers are paying. Economists expect it to show inflation accelerated a bit to 2.6% in October from 2.4% the month before. But they're looking for underlying inflation trends, which ignore prices for groceries and fuel that can jump sharply from month to month, to stay steady at 3.3%.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Europe and Asia. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dropped 2.8% for one of the worst falls. The Hang Seng closed below the 20,000 level for the first time since China announced a stimulus package in September.",

      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be that hard, I\u2019m a pro and I know what it takes to win in this league so it won't be very hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI know how to turn the page and focus. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been able to do what I\u2019ve done for 12 healthy seasons, going on 13. Very blessed.\"",
      "The questions from Day 1 of Warriors training camp were largely around Thompson's departure and how the Warriors would push forward without Curry's Splash Brother.",
      "They all miss him.",
      "The Warriors have a special \u201cSalute Captain Klay\u201d ceremony planned for before tipoff to pay tribute to Thompson's contributions to the franchise over 11 years. The team said: \u201cFans are encouraged to arrive early, by land or by sea, for a special pregame salute to the franchise legend.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith Klay, it\u2019s not the records or championships or clutch shots that stand out the most from the last 13 years \u2014 it\u2019s the truly unique relationship he developed with the Bay Area and our fans,\u201d Warriors President and COO Brandon Schneider said in a statement. \u201cHe embraced Dub Nation and Dub Nation embraced him back. Warriors fans have laughed, cried, cheered and celebrated alongside him, and it\u2019s only fitting that they get a chance to show their love and salute him in his return to the Bay.\u201d",
      "Thompson plans to enjoy the moment, and, of course, try to win.",
      "\u201cIt's all good, though,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI'm embracing it. You only get to do one thing so many times in your life.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Dallas Cowboys receiver CeeDee Lamb is throwing shade at his home field after losing a ball in the sun on a potential touchdown catch",
      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- CeeDee Lamb was unhappy about losing a ball in the sun on an incompletion that helped keep Dallas from scoring a go-ahead touchdown in the first half of a 34-6 loss to Philadelphia on Sunday.",
      "Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones was perturbed that the sun was brought up again as an issue in his $1.2 billion retractable roof stadium, which has glass doors on either end.",
      "AT&T Stadium has an unusual east-west alignment from end zone to end zone, as opposed to most venues being north-south. On clear days, the sun shines in the windows on the west side during the first half of games that kick off in the afternoon.",
      "Lamb, Dallas' All-Pro receiver, was looking into the sun in the second quarter while open on a crossing route in the end zone when a throw from Cooper Rush went behind him and he never adjusted to the ball.",
      "Lamb then pointed to his eyes and was making similar gestures on the sideline during another frustrating home loss for the Cowboys (3-6), who are on a four-game losing streak overall and 0-4 at AT&T Stadium.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t see the ball. Couldn\u2019t see the ball, at all. The sun,\u201d said Lamb, who ended a preseason-long holdout by signing a $136 million, four-year contract extension in late August.",
      "Asked whether the Cowboys should put up curtains, Lamb said: \u201cYes. One thousand percent.\u201d",
      "And on the question of making the suggestion to Jones, Lamb said, \u201cI mean, y\u2019all are doing my job for me right now.\u201d",
      "It has been suggested plenty of times, and Jones always has flatly rejected it. The 82-year-old billionaire angrilyrebuffed it after bringing up the issue unprompted in his postgame session with reporters.",
      "\u201cBy the way, we know where the sun is going to be when we flip the coin, so we do know where the damn sun is going to be in our own stadium,\u201d Jones said. \u201cLet\u2019s just tear the damn stadium down and build another one. Are you kidding me?\u201d",
      "While Jones' response could be taken as a criticism of embattled coach Mike McCarthy, Jones said it wasn't.",
      "\u201cEvery team that comes in here has the same issues,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey know where the sun is going to be. Every team has the same thing. I'm not saying (it\u2019s on McCarthy). I\u2019m saying the world knows where the sun is. We get to know that almost a year in advance. So someone asked me about the sun. What about the sun? Where\u2019s the moon? We\u2019re fine. But everybody plays in the sun out here.\u201d",
      "The Cowboys are bracing for official word that quarterback Dak Prescott needs season-ending surgery for a torn hamstring. They have lost five in a row at AT&T Stadium, with five turnovers in each of the past two losses.",
      "The curtains, or lack thereof, just add to the angst. The next time they will be an issue is Thanksgiving Day against the New York Giants.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t win games turning the ball over five times,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI don\u2019t give a (expletive) who lines up. So that\u2019s the part we got to get right.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "There is no such a thing as a perfect season, according to Roger Penske, even after winning his third consecutive NASCAR Cup Series championship",
      "AVONDALE, Ariz. -- There is no such a thing as a perfect season. At least that is what Roger Penske told The Associated Press hours after winning his third consecutive NASCAR championship.",
      "Maybe not.",
      "But Team Penske sure came close.",
      "It started in January with a rare show of emotion from \u201cThe Captain\u201d \u2014 Josef Newgarden said his 87-year-old boss was in tears \u2014 after Team Penske won its first Rolex 24 at Daytona endurance race since 1969.",
      "Weeks later, Joey Logano put a Penske car on the pole for the Daytona 500 for the first time in team history. It turned out Logano was wearing an illegal glove for that historic qualifying run \u2014 a trick Penske lit into his veteran leader for even trying \u2014 but the organization moved on to win nearly everything else in major motorsports this season.",
      "Will Power came up short in the IndyCar championship to three-time champion Alex Palou, and Team Penske didn't win the 24 Hours of Le Mans, but shy of that? Most major trophies say Penske this year.",
      "The IndyCar team \u2014 rocked by its own cheating scandal in the season-opening race \u2014 won six races and Newgarden claimed a second consecutive Indianapolis 500 victory. Scott McLaughlin finished third in the final standings.",
      "The sports car program that Penske has built from scratch with partner Porsche last month won the IMSA championship and two weekends ago in Bahrain won the World Endurance Championship. At the same time in Martinsville, Virginia, reigning NASCAR champion Ryan Blaney won the race to put two Penske cars in Sunday's winner-take-all Cup Series championship at Phoenix Raceway.",
      "A 50% chance is pretty decent odds for any team owner, but Penske was armed with 2022 champion Logano, defending champion Blaney and a shot at winning three straight Cup titles. The organization delivered, with Logano earning his third championship in a closing laps battle with Blaney that gave Penske its first 1-2 NASCAR points finish in team history.",
      "Team Penske is also the only team to win the Cup championship since NASCAR introduced its new car in 2022, and the organization is the first since Hendrick Motorsports in 1998 to win three-straight titles with multiple drivers.",
      "Longtime sponsor Shell-Pennzoil was on the car for both Newgarden's Indy 500 win and Logano's championship Sunday, and, as far as Penske is concerned, this season ranks among the best for an organization that began in 1968.",
      "\u201cWell, I guess you\u2019d have to say it\u2019s probably, if not the best, one of the best,\u201d Penske said. \u201cI think that obviously not to win the IndyCar championship, which of course it\u2019s where we all started and built our first racing team, was disappointing.\u201d",
      "And there it is, the part about nothing ever being perfect. Penske can still find a shortfall in this otherwise impeccable season that saw the organization win its 100th Cup Series race with Ford; a 20th Indianapolis 500 win; a second career sweep of front row qualifying at Indy; the 100th sports car win and 100th sports car pole for the organization; Logano becoming just the 10th driver in NASCAR history to win three or more titles, and crew chief Paul Wolfe, with 41 victories, now the winningest active team leader in the Cup Series.",
      "It is all the people who have made this a banner season, Penske insisted. His name is on the cars, but it is the long-term employees who make the organization so successful.",
      "\u201cRacing is a common thread through our company. It\u2019s our brand, and of course we want to win,\u201d Penske said. \u201cWhat I try to do is provide them with what they need to be champions. We\u2019re not always up like this. Sure, we want to win more. We want to win properly.\u201d",
      "He listed the key personnel of his race teams, all Penske-grown and not plucked away from another team \u2014 a key factor in both loyalty and commitment to the \u201cPenske Perfect\u201d cause.",
      "\u201cThey have that domain knowledge, which makes it so important, and they work as one team,\u201d Penske said. \"So what I need to do is continue to push them because we\u2019re not interested in sitting here and not having the success. We talk about the 24 Hours of Daytona, that rubbed off on these guys.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re always asking me how are we doing?\" Penske continued. \"And I think when you think about it, the number of people that we have that we touch every race in our company, and we have 74,000 people that (Monday) are going to be just climbing the walls with happiness because of the success \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019m in it for.\u201d",
      "Logano, in the glow of his latest championship, quoted his father to explain what it is like to work for Penske: \u201cYou can\u2019t soar like an eagle if you\u2019re working with a bunch of turkeys,\u201d he said of Tom Logano's mantra.",
      "\u201cYou think about what Team Penske is today, racing in all the different forms of motorsports and winning in all of them, like where else do you want to go? This is where you go to win. You surround yourself with a winner, that\u2019s what happens,\u201d Logano said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of eagles there. There\u2019s a lot of really smart people, a lot of driven individuals, and that goes through so many different forms throughout Penske.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- John Robinson, the veteran football coach who enjoyed many years of success at the University of Southern California and with the Los Angeles Rams, has died. He was 89.",
      "The Rams confirmed Robinson's death on Monday. He died in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, of complications from pneumonia, USC said in a release.",
      "Robinson is high on the short list of football coaches who enjoyed significant success in both the college and pro ranks. He went 104-35-4 at USC and 75-68 with the Rams, winning postseason games and contending for championships regularly with both teams. Robinson was particularly successful in bowl games, going 8-1 in the postseason with USC and UNLV.",
      "\u201cCoach Robinson was one of the greatest college coaches ever, and his love for USC and his love for the game of football was second to none,\u201d said Ronnie Lott, an All-American safety under Robinson at USC. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that while playing for him, he gave us the ability to feel like we were larger than life. And his commitment to making sure that we had more than just football in our lives was so superior.\"",
      "Robinson was a member of the College Football Hall of Fame for his two successful tenures at USC. He also became the winningest coach in Rams history during his nine-year tenure with the NFL club. Sean McVay passed Robinson's career victories total only last month.",
      "Robinson coached at USC from 1976 to 1982 and again from 1993 to 1997. He never had a losing record at the school, and his Trojans won five conference titles and four Rose Bowls. Running backs Charles White (1979) and Marcus Allen (1981) won the Heisman Trophy while playing in Robinson's relentless rushing offenses.",
      "\u201cCoach Robinson was very demanding, but in a human way,\u201d said Paul McDonald, the quarterback of Robinson's superbly talented 1979 team at USC. \u201cHe had great interpersonal skills, and he knew how to connect with people. He made you want to play hard for him and to run through walls. You cared for him because he cared so much for you.\u201d",
      "Robinson moved to the Rams in 1983 and reached the playoffs in six of his first seven seasons, winning four playoff games and advancing to two NFC championship games.",
      "The Rams observed a moment of silence for Robinson at SoFi Stadium on Monday night before they faced the Miami Dolphins.",
      "Robinson spent six seasons coaching UNLV after his second USC tenure, also serving a stint as the Rebels' athletic director. He was most recently a senior consultant at LSU from 2019 to 2021 during the tenure of head coach Ed Orgeron.",
      "Robinson was born July 25, 1935, in Chicago, and he grew up in the Bay Area, attending prep school with close friend John Madden and graduating from high school in 1954. He played tight end on Oregon's 1958 Rose Bowl championship team before beginning his coaching career with the Ducks.",
      "Robinson became John McKay's offensive coordinator at USC in 1972, coaching the unbeaten 1972 consensus national championship team and the 1974 team that went 10-1-1. Robinson left the Trojans for one year to join Madden with the Oakland Raiders, but returned to USC in 1976 when McKay took over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",
      "Robinson coached USC to seven outstanding seasons, winning the Pac-8 or Pac-10 titles and the Rose Bowl in three of his first four years in charge. His 1978 team was named national champions by the UPI coaches' poll, while Bear Bryant's Alabama won the AP title. He coached a long list of stars during his tenure, from White and Allen to Pro Football Hall of Famers Lott, Anthony Mu\u00f1oz and Bruce Matthews.",
      "Robinson kept winning in 1983 when he moved to the Rams, who played their home games in Anaheim, California. With an offense led by Eric Dickerson, Robinson's teams racked up six playoff appearances and lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions in two conference title games.",
      "Robinson's second tenure at USC included a fourth Rose Bowl victory, but the school dismissed him following the 1997 season.",
      "Robinson then coached UNLV from 1999-2004, taking over a program that had lost 16 games in a row. He got the Rebels to only the third bowl appearance in school history in just his second season, but Robinson stepped away after the 2004 season with a 28-42 record at the school. One of his more notable victories was a 23-5 win at No. 14 Wisconsin in 2003.",
      "\u201cFootball lost a legend today,\u201d UNLV director of athletics Erick Harper said. \u201cCoach Robinson was revered by his players, peers, fans and co-workers. He led a wonderful life on and off the football field at so many places, including here at UNLV as both a coach and administrator. Our thoughts and prayers go out to John\u2019s family as we remember all that he did for the sport nationally and right here in Las Vegas.\u201d",
      "Robinson spent many years between his coaching jobs in broadcasting on television and radio. He returned to football five years ago at LSU as a consultant to Orgeron, the former USC coach.",
      "Robinson is survived by his wife, Beverly, his four children, two stepchildren and 10 grandchildren.",
      "A celebration of Robinson\u2019s life will be held following the college football season, in accordance with his wishes.",

Aaron Nesmith has a sprained left ankle and isn\u2019t slated to return until December. Andrew Nembhard will miss at least two weeks because of soreness in his left knee.",

But Indiana scored on its next four possessions, to take a 114-107 lead with 4:52 remaining.",
      "Perhaps just as critical as Indiana\u2019s 3-point attack was the Knicks\u2019 inability to force turnovers. Despite playing at a fast pace, the Pacers took care of the ball and had 10 turnovers for the game.",
      "The Pacers visit Orlando on Wednesday. The Knicks play at Philadelphia on Tuesday.",

      "\u201cWhat\u2019s personally getting me through this right now?\" Golden said. \"Respecting the situation, my family, my team, my coaching staff. We\u2019re just continuing to attack it like we normally would every day.\u201d",

Alleged stalking incidents also included Golden, a married father of two young boys, showing up to locations where he knew the women would be.",
      "\u201cAgain, I know what\u2019s going on. I know the situation,\" Golden said. \"Our staff\u2019s done a great job. Our guys have done a good job. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time together over the last couple days and continue to prepare for what we have in front of us, which was this game tonight and what will be Florida State on Friday.\u201d",
      "The Gators (3-0) responded with their best first half of the season against Grambling State (1-2). Five players scored in double figures, led by Rueben Chinyelu's career-tying 14 points. Golden said their performance was expected.",
      "\u201cI think they know who I am and, again, they\u2019re mature,\" Golden said. \u201cThey\u2019re all really good guys and all super focused. We had really good practices. We had a great shoot-around and I thought they were all really locked in. I felt like we were going to play really well.\"",

      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \"blue-water\u201d force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States.",
      "\u201cNuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\u201d said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \u201cFor China\u2019s leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country\u2019s global image as a leading power.\u201d",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",
      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",
      "Neither China\u2019s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\u201cThe reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\u201d",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen\u2019s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles (112 kilometers) southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship\u201d under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \u201cnational defense-related construction project\u201d that is classified \u201csecret.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\u201d researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \u201cconvincing argument.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\u201d she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \u201ccarefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\u201d",
      "\u201cGiven the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\u201d said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \u201cski-jump\u201d type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \u201csoon be announced,\u201d but so far it has not been.",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \u201cincremental improvements.\u201d",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \u201chave taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\u201d",
      "Eventually, however, \u201clarger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\u201d Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\u201cAs well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\u201d Childs said.",
      "\u201cMuch will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\u201d",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \u201cwith greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\u201d said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\u201cThese carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\u201d Zhao said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \u201cfirst-class\u201d navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \u201cspeeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\u201d",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",
      "And China's \u201cgrowing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China\u2019s shore,\u201d the report said.",

      "LONDON -- Facebook and Instagram users in Europe will get the option to see less personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription, social media company Meta said Tuesday, bowing to pressure from Brussels over privacy and digital competition concerns.",
      "Meta Platforms has been offering European Union an ad-free subscription option for about a year to comply with the continent's strict data privacy rules, but regulators had accused the company of giving people a false choice.",
      "The company said in a blog post that while people will still be able to choose between the subscription and existing free versions, it would also start giving free users an extra option over the coming weeks to see digital ads that are less personalized.",
      "This means ads will be targeted at users based only on what they see during their current session on Facebook or Instagram going back no more than two hours, plus minimal personal information such as age, location, gender as well as how they engage with ads.",
      "Data from all of a user's previous time spent on Facebook or Instagram, which is typically combined to precisely target an individual with tailored ads, won't be used.",
      "\u201cWhile this new choice is designed to give people an additional control over their data and ad experience, it may result in ads that are less relevant to a person\u2019s interests,\u201d Meta said in a blog post. \u201cThat means people will see ads that they don\u2019t find as interesting. This drop in relevance is inevitable given that drastically reduced data is being used to show these less personalized ads to people.\u201d",
      "People who choose the new option will see ad breaks that can't be skipped for a few seconds, Meta said.",
      "European Union regulators had accused Meta of breaching the 27-nation bloc's digital rules when it gave user the option to pay a monthly fee to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data.",
      "The U.S. tech giant had rolled out the option after the European Union\u2019s top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users\u2019 online interests and digital activity.",
      "The company also said Tuesday it's slashing monthly subscription prices for the ad-free option. Web users will pay 5.99 euros ($6.36), down from 9.99 euros previously, while iPhone and Android users will be charged 7.99 euros instead of 12.99 euros, which includes commissions charged by the Apple and Google mobile app stores.",
      "Meta's new subscription model could hit the company's lucrative digital ad business in one of its biggest markets. The company said it has already factored the new offering into its most recent business outlook and financial guidance.",
      "The options are available to users 18 and older in the EU\u2019s 27 member countries, plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein."

      "As money continues to pour into crypto following Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, bitcoin has climbed to yet another record high",
      "NEW YORK -- As money continues to pour into crypto following Donald Trump's victory last week, bitcoin has climbed to yet another record high.",
      "The world's largest cryptocurrency topped $87,000 for the first time on Monday. As of around 3:45 p.m. ET, bitcoin's price stood at $87,083, per CoinDesk, up over 28% in the last week alone.",
      "That's part of a rally across cryptocurrencies and crypto-related investments since Trump won the U.S. presidential election last week. Analysts credit much of the recent gains to an anticipated \u201ccrypto-friendly\u201d nature of the incoming administration, which could translate into more regulatory clarity but also leeway.",
      "Still, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is hard to predict. And while some are bullish, others continue to warn of investment risks.",
      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now, but has come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, and reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "A lot of it has to do with the outcome of last week's election.",
      "Trump was previously a crypto skeptic, but changed his mind and embraced cryptocurrencies during this year's presidential race. He has pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for. And Trump had previously promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "\u201cCrypto rallied as Election Day progressed into the night and as it became increasingly clear that Trump would emerge victorious,\u201d Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a Friday research note, pointing to larger industry sentiment around Trump being \u201ccrypto-friendly\" and a potential shift in regulatory backing.",
      "Even before the post-election rally, assets like bitcoin posted notable gains over the past year or so. Much of the credit goes to early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\u201d Glass and Saunders noted. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Crypto assets like bitcoin have a history of drastic swings in value \u2014 which can come suddenly and happen over the weekend or overnight in trading that continues at all hours, every day.",
      "In short, history shows you can lose money as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. Then came the 2022 collapse of FTX, which significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall.",
      "At the start of last year, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000. Investors, however, began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. While some crypto supporters see the potential for more record-breaking days, experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "\u201cInvestors should only dabble in crypto with money that they can be prepared to lose,\u201d Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said last week. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve seen these wild swings in the past.\u201d",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \u201cmining,\" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth\u2019s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin\u2019s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",
      "In the U.S., the Energy Information Administration notes that crypto mining across the country has \u201cgrown very rapidly over the last several years,\" adding that grid planners have begun to express concern over increases in related electricity demand. Preliminary estimates released by the EIA in February suggest that annual electricity use from crypto mining probably represents between 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.",
      "Environmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections from regulators around the world.",

Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia.

      "There were several surprises in \u201cthe house of the golden bracelet,\u201d the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \u201cthe story that was long spun around these individuals\u201d was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",

      "\u201cSocial media is doing harm to our kids and I\u2019m calling time on it,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced in Parliament during its final two weeks in session this year, which begin on Nov. 18. The age limit would take effect 12 months after the law is passed, Albanese told reporters.",
      "The platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would need to use that year to work out how to exclude Australian children younger than 16.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble,\u201d Hallan said.",

      "As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan\u2019s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour.",
      "As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan.",
      "Perhaps the biggest consequence for China \u2014 if Trump stays true to his campaign promises \u2014 is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "Tariffs like that would be a blow to China\u2019s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China\u2019s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS.",
      "During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised.",
      "President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles.",
      "Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade.",
      "\u201cGiven the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.\u201d",
      "Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump\u2019s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he\u2019ll be able to do quickly, without saying how.",
      "Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.",
      "\u201cChina is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,\" Wang wrote in a recent commentary. \"These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.\u201d",
      "There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs \u2014 150% to 200% \u2014 on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.",
      "Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\u2019s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979.",
      "Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing.",
      "China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.",
      "\u201cWill (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,\u201d he said.",
      "As for China\u2019s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi \u201crespects me and he knows I\u2019m (expletive) crazy.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. weapons this year.",
      "In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said.",
      "Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe are clear about the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence.",
      "But Trump has criticized Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world\u2019s supply of the most advanced chips.",
      "The island\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center.",
      "Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago.",
      "\u201cRather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan\u2019s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan\u2019s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,\u201d Goto said."

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s states and territories on Friday unanimously backed a national plan to require most forms of social media to bar children younger than 16.",
      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",
      "The minor Greens party was critical, saying the ban would prevent the emergence in Australia of future child environmental activists like Sweden's Greta Thunberg.",
      "More than 140 academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Critics say most teenagers are tech savvy enough to get around such laws. Some fear the ban will create conflicts within families and drive social media problems underground.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, argues that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "The government likens the proposed social media age limit to the laws that restrict the sale of alcohol to adults aged 18 and older across Australia. Children still find ways to drink, but the prohibition remains.",
      "\u201cWe think these laws will make a real positive difference,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "But Lisa Given, professor of information sciences at RMIT University, described the legislation as \u201creally problematic.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of our social networks are actually about the provision of extremely critical information to kids,\u201d Given told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re also facing bullying and other challenges online, but they actually need the social supports to know how to navigate the platforms safely and so they need more support from parents, from care-givers, not less access to a single or multiple platforms,\u201d Given added.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, described the government\u2019s plan to remove 14 and 15-year-olds from their already established social media accounts was \u201cstrange.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve already developed that space in that world, to have it taken away really could do as much harm as the harms that are purportedly being fixed,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThere are so many questions about this that have yet to be answered, but even if we had solid answers about how this might work technically and how this might get implemented socially, it's still hard to believe that this would actually keep kids safe online,\" he added.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said children would retain access to online education and health services.",
      "The legislation would also include strong privacy protections surrounding age verification.",
      "\u201cPrivacy must be paramount, including that of children,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cWe should also be very clear about the realities. These platforms know about their users in a way that no one else does.\u201d",
      "Rowland said YouTube would likely be included among the mainstream platforms defined under the legislation as age restricted services.",
      "But YouTube Kids could be exempted. Gaming and messaging services would not face age restrictions, she said,",
      "\u201cThis legislation would strike a balance between minimizing the harms experienced by young people during a critical period of their development while also supporting their access to benefits as well,\u201d Rowland said.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Joe Biden's administration on Friday proposed tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles (17,000 square kilometers) of federal land in the U.S. West to protect a declining bird species.",
      "However, it is doubtful the changes would survive under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Greater sage grouse \u2014 chicken-sized birds known for an elaborate mating ritual\u2014 were once found across much of the U.S. West. Their numbers plummeted in recent decades because of energy exploration, wildfires, disease and other pressures.",
      "A 2015 agreement shepherded by the Obama administration kept the birds off the endangered species list, by imposing limits on where and when development could occur across 226,000 square miles (590,000 square kilometers) of remaining grouse habitat spanning 11 states.",
      "Now, in the closing weeks of the Biden administration, officials with the Interior Department want to make the protections even stronger. Their plan would eliminate loopholes that allowed development in areas considered crucial to the bird's long-term survival. New solar and wind projects would be excluded, and oil and gas exploration could only occur from drilling sites located outside the protected areas.",
      "Trump has pushed to open more public lands to energy development in line with his mantra to \u201cdrill baby drill.\u201d During his first administration, officials attempted to scale back the Obama-era sage grouse protections, but were blocked in court.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday's science-based proposal would boost sage grouse while allowing development on government lands to continue.",
      "\u201cFor too long, a false choice has been presented for land management that aims to pit development against conservation,\u201d Haaland said in a statement.",
      "Yet the agency's attempt to find a middle ground fell flat with the oil and renewable energy industries, Republicans and even some environmentalists.",
      "A spokesperson for American Clean Power, a renewables industry lobbying group companies, said it had supported an earlier version of the proposal but not the final details released Friday. Spokesperson Phil Sgro said the proposal \u201cunnecessarily restricts the development of wind, solar, battery storage and transmission, undermining the ability to deploy much needed clean energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Most of the land at issue is in Nevada and California, according to government documents. Affected parcels also are in Wyoming, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Montana and the Dakotas.",
      "In Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon said the proposal would add new layers of federal regulation and hinder practical solutions for the grouse. U.S. Sen. John Barrasso accused the Biden administration of trying to ram though the changes on its way out the door.",
      "\u201cI look forward to working with the Trump-Vance administration to reverse this reckless decision,\u201d said Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee.",
      "Several major conservation organizations, including the Nature Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation and Natural Resources Defense Council, issued a joint statement in support of the changes.",
      "Other environmentalists said officials had squandered a chance to put in place more meaningful protections that could halt the grouse's slow spiral towards extinction. They noted that loopholes allowing development would remain in place across nearly 50,000 square miles (122,000 square kilometers) of sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cIt's death by a thousands cuts,\u201d said Greta Anderson with Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group involved in previous sage grouse lawsuits. \u201cThe Biden administration could have stopped the cutting, and it didn't.\u201d",
      "Federal officials predicted minimal economic impacts. They said energy companies already steer clear of sage grouse habitat, where there are limits on when and where work can be done near breeding areas. Those companies can still find opportunities on other public lands, the officials said.",
      "That was disputed by Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance. She said the Biden administration already had limited leasing in sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cSo they\u2019ve denied access and then say companies are avoiding them anyway,\u201d Sgamma said. \u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management will accept protests against Friday's proposal until Dec. 9. Final decisions on changes to the agency's land management plans will be made after the protests are resolved.",
      "A related proposal to help sage grouse would block for 20 years new mining projects on more than 15,625 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. That proposal was part of the 2015 Obama-era protections. It was canceled under Trump then restored by a court.",
      "An analysis of the mining ban will be published by the end of the year, according to the Interior Department.",
      "Greater sage grouse once numbered in the millions across all or portions of 11 Western states. Populations have dropped 65% since 1986, according to government scientists."

      "Authorities say 43 monkeys bred for medical research that escaped a compound in South Carolina have been spotted in the woods near a fence surrounding the site and that workers are using food to try to recapture them",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Forty-three monkeys bred for medical research that escaped a compound in South Carolina have been spotted in the woods near the site and workers are using food to try to recapture them, authorities said Friday.",
      "The Rhesus macaques made a break for it Wednesday after an employee at the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee didn't fully lock a door as she fed and checked on them, officials said.",
      "\u201cThey are very social monkeys and they travel in groups, so when the first couple go out the door the others tend to just follow right along,\u201d Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard told CBS News.",
      "Westergaard said his main goal is to have the monkeys returned safely with no other problems. \u201cI think they are having an adventure,\u201d he said.",
      "The monkeys on Friday were exploring the outer fence of the Alpha Genesis compound and are cooing at the monkeys inside, police said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe primates are exhibiting calm and playful behavior, which is a positive indication,\u201d the police statement said, adding company workers are closely watching the monkeys while keeping their distance as they work to safely recapture them.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police all said the monkeys pose no risk to public health. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical and other researchers.",
      "\u201cThey are not infected with any disease whatsoever. They are harmless and a little skittish,\u201d Yemassee Police Chief Gregory Alexander said Thursday.",
      "Authorities still recommend that people who live near the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee shut their windows and doors and call 911 if they see the monkeys. Approaching them could make them more skittish and harder to capture, officials said.",
      "Eve Cooper, a biology professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who has studied rhesus macaques, said the animals have the potential to be dangerous and urged people to keep their distance.",
      "Rhesus macaques monkeys can be aggressive. And some carry the herpes B virus, which can be fatal to humans, Cooper said.",
      "However, Alpha Genesis states on its website that it specializes in pathogen-free primates. Cooper noted that there are pathogen-free populations of rhesus macaques that have been quarantined and tested.",
      "\u201cI would give them a wide berth,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThey\u2019re unpredictable animals. And they can behave quite aggressively when they\u2019re afraid.\u201d",
      "Alpha Genesis provides primates for research worldwide at its compound about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia, according to its website.",
      "Locally, it is known as \u201cthe monkey farm.\u201d And there is more amusement than panic around Yemassee and its population of about 1,100 just off Interstate 95 about 2 miles from Auldbrass Plantation, a Frank Lloyd Wright house designed in the 1930s.",
      "There have been escapes before, but the monkeys haven't caused problems, said William McCoy, who owns Lowcountry Horology, a clock and watch repair shop.",
      "\u201cThey normally come home because that\u2019s where the food is,\" he said.",
      "McCoy has lived in Yemassee for about two years and while he plans to stay away from the monkeys, he has his own light-hearted plan to get them back.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m stocking up bananas, maybe they\u2019ll show up,\" McCoy said.",
      "The Alpha Genesis compound is regularly inspected by federal officials.",
      "In 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined Alpha Genesis $12,600 in part after officials said 26 primates escaped from the Yemassee facility in 2014 and an additional 19 got out in 2016.",
      "The company's fine was also issued because of individual monkey escapes as well as the killing of one monkey by others when it was placed in the wrong social group, according to a report from the USDA.",
      "The group Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent a letter Thursday to the USDA asking the agency to immediately send an inspector to the Alpha Genesis facility, conduct a thorough investigation and treat them as a repeated violator. The group was involved in the 2018 fine against the company.",
      "\u201cThe clear carelessness which allowed these 40 monkeys to escape endangered not only the safety of the animals, but also put the residents of South Carolina at risk,\u201d wrote Michael Budkie, executive director of the group.",
      "The USDA, which has inspected the compound 10 times since 2020, didn't immediately respond to the letter.",
      "The facility's most recent federal inspection in May showed there were about 6,700 primates on site and no issues.",
      "In a 2022 review, federal veterinarians reported two animals died when their fingers were trapped in structures and they were exposed to harsh weather. They also found cages weren't adequately secure. Inspectors said criminal charges, civil penalties or other sanctions could follow if the problems weren't fixed.",
      "Since then, Alpha Genesis has undergone six inspections with minor problems reported only once.",

      "These monkeys have been launched into space on V2 rockets, used for AIDS research, had their genome mapped and made stars of their own reality television show. They were in such high demand in the early 2000s that a shortage led to scientists paying up to $10,000 per animal.",
      "Outside of rats and mice, rhesus macaques are one of the most studied animals on the planet, said Dario Maestripieri, a behavioral scientist at the University of Chicago who wrote the 2007 book \u201cMacachiavellian Intelligence: How Rhesus Macaques and Humans Have Conquered the World.\u201d",
      "The animals are very family oriented, siding with relatives when fights break out. And they\u2019re adept at building political alliances in the face of threats from other monkeys. But they can be painful to watch. Monkeys with lower status in the hierarchy live in a constant state of fear and intimidation, Maestripieri said.",

      "TORONTO -- Canada announced Wednesday it won\u2019t block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it.",
      "Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc.",
      "\u201cThe government is not blocking Canadians\u2019 access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" Champagne said.",
      "Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information.",
      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement that the shutdown of its Canadian offices will mean the loss of hundreds of local jobs.",
      "\u201cWe will challenge this order in court,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.\u201d",
      "TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",
      "TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips.",
      "Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver.",
      "Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that \"banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.\u201d",
      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",
      "Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China\u2019s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked.",
      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell.",

      "TOKYO -- A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",
      "Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed.",
      "The first sample alone is not enough and additional small-scale sampling missions will be necessary in order to obtain more data, TEPCO spokesperson Kenichi Takahara told reporters Thursday. \u201cIt may take time, but we will steadily tackle decommissioning,\u201d Takahara said.",
      "Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the. plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery.",
      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit.",
      "That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",
      "On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said.",
      "Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out.",
      "On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment.",
      "The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel.",
      "Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive melted fuel remains in them.",
      "The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target to finish the cleanup by 2051, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. Some say it would take for a century or longer.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said there have been some delays but \u201cthere will be no impact on the entire decommissioning process.\u201d",
      "No specific plans for the full removal of the fuel debris or its final disposal have been decided."

    "summary": "The judge in Donald Trump's criminal hush money case in New York has agreed to delay any decision on whether to throw out Trump's conviction.",
    "story": [
      "Trump is currently set to be sentenced on Nov. 26, but that could now change.",
      "The judge in Donald Trump's criminal hush money case in New York agreed Tuesday to delay any decision on whether to throw out Trump's conviction based on the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision on presidential immunity.",
      "Judge Juan Merchan was scheduled on Tuesday to decide the fate of the case, but both sides requested more time to consider how to proceed now that Trump is president-elect.",
      "\"The People agree that these are unprecedented circumstances,\" prosecutors wrote in an email to the judge.",
      "Judge Merchan gave prosecutors until Nov. 19 to recommend next steps.",
      "\"As per the People's request, the People are to file with the Court, off calendar, your view of appropriate steps going forward,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "A jury convicted Trump in May of all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniel to silence allegations about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election.",
      "Sentencing in the case is currently scheduled for Nov. 26, less than two months ahead of Trump's inauguration, but Tuesday's decision could change that.",
      "While the $130,000 payment preceded Trump's ascension to the presidency, Trump has claimed that prosecutors filled \"glaring holes in their case\" with evidence that related to official acts he subsequently performed in office -- which the Supreme Court ruled are off limits in its July ruling on presidential immunity.",
      "Prosecutors have argued that the case centers on \"entirely personal\" conduct with \"no relationship whatsoever to any official duty of the presidency.\"",
      "\"[T]he evidence that he claims is affected by the Supreme Court's ruling constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty of all 34 felony charges beyond a reasonable doubt,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Defense attorneys have argued certain evidence -- including Trump's conversations with then-White House communications director Hope Hicks and Trump's social media posts as president -- tainted the jury's understanding of the case.",
      "In one example cited by prosecutors, Hicks testified that Trump said he preferred the story about his hush money payment come out after the election, suggesting he was aware the allegations by Daniels could have impacted the race. In his closing statement, a prosecutor described the testimony as the final \"nail in Mr. Trump's coffin.\"",
      "In response, prosecutors have argued that the testimony from Hicks \"related solely to unofficial conduct\" and would not be considered immune.",
      "Trump has asked that the verdict be overturned or the case be thrown out entirely. If Judge Merchan tosses the conviction, he could order a new trial -- which would be delayed for at least four years until Trump leaves office -- or dismiss the indictment altogether.",
      "Merchan has already delayed the sentencing twice -- first following the immunity decision in July, and again in September to \"to avoid any appearance -- however unwarranted -- that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching Presidential election,\" the judge said.",
      "Following Trump's election victory, he is set to be inaugurated less than two months from his sentencing date, which limits Merchan's options for punishing the president-elect, according to experts.",
      "Trump's conviction carries a penalty of up to four years in prison, though first-time offenders normally receive lesser sentences.",
      "In the meantime, special counsel Jack Smith is expected to drop both of Trump's federal criminal cases -- related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and retain classified documents after leaving the White House -- based on a longstanding Department of Justice policy prohibiting the prosecution of sitting presidents. Trump's criminal election interference case in Georgia has also been mired in delays, leaving his New York conviction as the last of his criminal hurdles before he regains the presidency.",
      "In his September order delaying the sentencing until this month, Judge Merchan described the case as \"one that stands alone, in a unique place in this Nation's history\"",

      "The Florida congressman emerged as a vocal Biden critic during Trump's campaign.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has asked Florida Republican Rep. Mike Waltz to be his national security adviser, multiple sources told ABC News.",
      "Waltz is a China hawk and is the first Green Beret elected to Congress. He emerged as a key surrogate for Trump, criticizing the Biden-Harris foreign policy record during the presidential campaign.",
      "Waltz, who was elected to the House in 2018, sits on the Intelligence, Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees. He also serves on the House China Task Force with 13 other Republicans.",
      "He has supported aid to Ukraine in the past, but has demanded \"conditions,\" including increased spending from European allies, additional oversight of funds, and pairing the aid with border security measures.",
      "Waltz, a vocal critic of the Biden administration's policy towards Ukraine who has visited the country, criticized the White House and allies for not providing Ukraine with more lethal aid -- such as MiG fighter planes from Poland -- earlier in the conflict.",
      "Before running for elected office, Waltz served in various national security policy roles in the George W. Bush administration in the Pentagon and White House. He retired as a colonel after serving 27 years in the Army and the National Guard.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 11:33:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Senate Republicans are poised to make a historic decision on Wednesday when they'll gather behind closed doors to select their new party leader.",
    "story": [
      "Trump won't vote in the secret-ballot race, but his influence on it is palpable.",
      "Senate Republicans are poised to make a historic decision on Wednesday when they'll gather behind closed doors to select their new party leader -- and President-elect Donald Trump's influence in undeniable as he insists that whoever be selected support his ability to install recess appointments to his Cabinet.",
      "With Trump's victory and Senate Republican's majority secured, the lead up to the race has intensified the jockeying between the three major contenders for the position: Sen. John Thune, Sen. John Cornyn and Sen. Rick Scott.",
      "The leadership election, slated to occur just one day after the Senate returns from its monthlong election recess, will see Senate Republicans selecting their first new leader since 2007, when current Republican Leader Mitch McConnell first won the job. McConnell is the longest-serving party leader in United States history, but announced earlier this year he'd be stepping aside after the election.",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican who currently serves as the No. 2 Republican, is somewhat of a front-runner in the race. He has served as the party whip for the last six years and in that time has notched a number of policy wins for the party, and has been working behind closed doors to whip support for the role for months. Thune said he keeps in regular contact with Trump and his team, but the two have at times had an icy relationship.",
      "Running against Thune is Cornyn, a Texas Republican and another established GOP leader who served as the party's whip for the six years prior to Thune before being term-limited out of the role. Though Cornyn has a slightly more conservative track record than Thune, he also faced ire from Trump for his support of the bipartisan gun safety bill that passed in the wake of the shooting in Uvalde, Texas.",
      "Also vying for the role is Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican who just won reelection. Scott has attempted to brand himself as the most Trump-aligned of the contenders, but is less popular among some of his Senate colleagues after a stint atop the Senate GOP's campaign arm in 2022 led to a less-than-successful night for Senate Republicans.",
      "Trump won't get a vote in this secret-ballot race, but his influence over it is palpable.",
      "Many Republicans see Trump's comfortable victory in Tuesday's elections coupled with Senate Republicans' new majority as a sweeping mandate to implement Trump's policies, and as such, potential party leaders seem to be cozying up to Trump ahead of the vote.",
      "Trump has not yet endorsed a specific candidate for the race, and it's unclear whether he ultimately will. Instead, Trump has attempted to exert influence over the race by arguing that whoever is slated to fill the role supports a modification to what has become the Senate's normal operating procedure to allow him to temporarily install appointments to federal vacancies without Senate approval during the Senate recesses.",
      "\"Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner. Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more. This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again. We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\" Trump wrote on his social media platform on Sunday.",
      "Recess appointments are permitted by the constitution, and allow presidents to fill federal vacancies during Senate recesses. Though once a regular occurrence, the Senate has operated in such a way as to block all recess appointments since former President Barack Obama's first term. Allowing recess appointments for Trump's second term could allow controversial nominees who may otherwise fail to get the support they need from the GOP-controlled Senate to serve for nearly two years without Senate approval.",
      "None of the top contenders have ruled out supporting the use of these recess appointments, and their responses to Trump's post show how far each is willing to go to show that they're on Trump's side.",
      "Though Thune said in an interview on Thursday that his \"preference\" would be for Trump to stay out of the Senate leadership race, he issued a statement Sunday night following Trump's post affirming his commitment to installing Trump's Cabinet, and not ruling out the appointments Trump is seeking.",
      "\"One thing is clear: We must act quickly and decisively to get the president's cabinet and other nominees in place as soon as possible to start delivering on the mandate we've been sent to execute, and all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments,\" Thune said in a statement. \"We cannot let Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats block the will of the American people.\"",
      "Cornyn meanwhile discussed the use of recess appointments with Trump prior to his post, per a source familiar. In a post on X Sunday afternoon, Cornyn affirmed his support, noting that if he is elected leader, he will keep the Senate in session continuously until nominees are confirmed.",
      "\"It is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump's cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent. Additionally, the Constitution expressly confers the power on the President to make recess appointments,\" Cornyn wrote.",
      "Almost immediately after Trump posted on Sunday, Scott posted on X that he was in lockstep with Trump on this policy.",
      "\"100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible,\" Scott wrote, reposting Trump's post.",
      "A small handful of senators have come out publicly to endorse their chosen candidate.",
      "Scott, for his part, has picked up endorsements from some of Trump's most out-and-proud supporters in the Senate as well as a number of Trump-aligned outside voices, including Robert F. Kennedy and Elon Musk.",
      "But this critical race has a very small constituency: only Republican senators serving in the incoming Senate get a vote. ABC News has not yet reported a projection in the Pennsylvania Senate race, but that means only about 52 people will get to cast ballots.",
      "Senators are also shielded behind closed doors and by secret ballot in this race. In order to win the election, a candidate must amass a simple majority of the vote. If all candidates fail to get a simple majority, the lowest vote earner is eliminated from the process, and senators vote again.",
      "Because of the secret nature of the vote, it's unclear how much of an influence any outside factor, including Trump, will ultimately wield.",
      "Newly elected incoming senators including Bernie Moreno of Ohio, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana and John Curtis of Utah and Tim Sheehy of Montana will all be in attendance to cast votes.",
      "Sen. JD Vance, who is now the vice president-elect, is also eligible to cast a vote in the election if he so chooses, but his team has not yet said whether he ultimately will attend Wednesday's vote.",
      "In addition to the closely-watched race for party leader, a number of other positions will also be selected during Wednesday's vote. Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, is running unopposed to becoming the No. 2 Senate Republican. Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, and Sen. Tom Cotton, the Republican from Arkansas, are in a race to become the conference chair. Additional down-ballot races will also be voted on Wednesday.",

    "title": "Recess appointments could short-circuit Senate opposition to Trump nominees: ANALYSIS",
    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:23:07 -0500",
    "summary": "The use of recess appointments to install members of Donald Trump's Cabinet would circumvent a key Senate process, consolidating presidential power.",
    "story": [
      "Installing Cabinet picks without Senate vote can be constitutional, experts say",
      "By urging the incoming GOP Senate majority to embrace recess appointments to install members of his Cabinet, Republican President-elect Donald Trump is in effect asking his party to unilaterally surrender a major constitutional responsibility and key check on presidential power.",
      "Article II of the Constitution gives a president authority to make appointments \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,\" which typically must hold hearings on a candidate and take a vote to confirm. Installing members of the Cabinet or executive branch when the Senate is out of session bypasses those steps.",
      "The fact that recess appointments have emerged as an early litmus test in the race for Senate GOP leader could be an indication that at least some of Trump's expected nominees will be highly controversial and potentially unconfirmable.",
      "During Trump's first term, members of his own party openly opposed some of his appointments, forcing the nominations to be withdrawn and reissued.",
      "While many Republicans in the past have protested recess appointments as a brazenly political end run around the Senate, the practice is neither unprecedented nor unconstitutional.",
      "Bill Clinton made 139 recess appointments while in the White House; George W. Bush made 171; and Barack Obama made 32, according to the Congressional Research Service. In most of those cases, the Senate was controlled by the opposite party.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in a 2014 decision, NLRB v. Noel Canning, gave the executive branch broad leeway to fill executive branch vacancies when the Senate is not in session, even for political purposes such as difficulty securing Senate confirmation.",
      "The court laid out guidelines for the process in Canning, noting that the Senate is in recess \"when it says it is\" and that the Constitution requires the recess to last 10 days or more for a president to be able to fill an open seat.",
      "One significant wrinkle is that a vote of the House is also necessary to approve an adjournment of 10 days or more. The Constitution's Adjournment's Clause says neither chamber should be out of session \"for more than three days\" without consent of the other.",
      "Any of Trump's appointees successfully installed during a recess would have the same legal authority and pay as a Senate-confirmed appointee. That said, a recess appointment is temporary -- expiring at the end of the Senate's \"next session\" (effectively almost two years).",
      "There's no bar on successive recess appointments of the same or a different person to a particular position, though it remains a contested legal question whether an individual installed twice during recess could continue to be paid, according to CRS.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 06:34:18 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Trump plans to nominate GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida for secretary of state, according to sources.",
    "story": [
      "The one-time Trump rival is positioned to become the top U.S. diplomat",
      "President-elect Donald Trump is expected to announce his intention to nominate Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., for secretary of state, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.",
      "Rubio, 53, has served in the Senate since 2011. He is currently the vice-chair of the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Intelligence and also sits on the chamber's Committee on Foreign Relations.",
      "Several long-serving State Department officials tell ABC News they respect Rubio's extensive foreign policy experience and view him as unlikely to overly politicize the secretary of state role.",
      "Rubio was also said to be favored for the role by Trump's chief of staff and veteran Florida political operative Susie Wiles, potentially helping the lawmaker edge out loyalists from the first Trump administration like former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and former National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien.",
      "In an interview following Trump's election victory, Rubio told CNN that the U.S. was entering \"an era of pragmatic foreign policy.\"",
      "\"The world is rapidly changing. You know, adversaries are uniting -- in North Korea, Iran, China, Russia -- increasing coordinating,\" Rubio said. \"It is going to require us to be very pragmatic and wise in how we invest overseas and what we do.\"",
      "Rubio has consistently held many hawkish and traditionally Republican positions on international concerns, including Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but has bent to align with Trump\u2019s agenda -- including his skeptical view of sustained support for Kyiv\u2019s war effort.",
      "While Rubio was initially a leading advocate for Ukraine, he voted against a supplemental funding bill passed in April that allocated about $61 billion dollars for the country, explaining at the time that he rejected the legislation because he did not believe it adequately addressed immigration concerns.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on Russia\u2019s side -- but unfortunately the reality of it is that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated settlement,\u201d Rubio said during an interview in late September.",
      "\u201cAnd I want, and we want, and, I believe Donald Trump wants, for Ukraine to have more leverage in that negotiation,\u201d he added.",
      "Because of Rubio's stature in the Senate and long tenure in Washington, his Senate confirmation process is broadly expected to run smoothly.",
      "Rubio's appointment is not anticipated to create problems for Republicans in the Senate. Florida law authorizes the state's governor, Republican Ron DeSantis, to fill the empty seat by appointment until the next scheduled general election, when Floridians would vote for candidates to serve out the remainder of Rubio's term.",
      "Republicans see Trump's double-digit win over Vice President Kamala Harris in Florida, the highest margin of victory for a presidential candidate in the state for 36 years, as a sign that the former battleground is now a firmly cemented as a GOP stronghold.",
      "Rubio has also dramatically shifted toward the president-elect in recent years, transforming from a rival Trump once dubbed \"Lil Marco\" to a contender for a top Cabinet post in his second administration",
      "During the 2016 presidential election, Rubio ran against Trump for the Republican nomination -- slamming him as a \"con artist\" on the campaign trail before dropping out after losing to Trump in the Florida primary.",
      "Rubio eventually endorsed Trump's bid for the White House and was widely supportive of his policies during his first term, during which Rubio served as an unofficial adviser on strategy for Latin America and was described by the New York Times as a \"virtual secretary of state\" for the administration.",
      "In 2024, Rubio again endorsed Trump for president and was on the shortlist of potential running mates before Trump ultimately selected Ohio Senator JD Vance.",

      "But his presence stretches far beyond that, with sources telling ABC News that Musk is now weighing in on Trump's staffing choices.",
      "Musk was present for at least two phone calls the president-elect had with foreign leaders, sources told ABC News. During a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week, Trump even handed the phone to Musk so he could speak to Zelenskyy as well, sources told ABC News. Musk was also present a call with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, sources said.",

The topic is a personal one for Biden, whose son Beau died from cancer in 2015. Biden said he believes exposure to burn pits overseas during Beau\u2019s deployment to Iraq contributed to his death.",

      "Miller worked in the first Trump administration and played a key role in crafting immigration policies -- including those that resulted in thousands of families being separated at the border.",
      "ABC News reported earlier this week that Miller is expected to drive immigration policy and has already been laying the groundwork on this for months.",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance posted on X saying, \"This is another fantastic pick by the president.\"",
      "News of Miller's selection comes as Trump's new administration begins to take shape. Last week, he announced his campaign manager, Susie Wiles, would be his White House chief of staff; on Sunday evening, Trump shared that former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Tom Homan is going to be the \"border czar\" in his administration.",
      "Trump also selected Rep. Elise Stefanik to be his U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, sources told ABC News.",
      "After leaving the Trump administration in 2021, Miller became the head of America First Legal, which described itself as the conservative answer to the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "America First Legal took the Biden administration to court several times over immigration policy, notching a win recently when a federal judge struck down a program known as \"Keeping Families Together\" that would have provided temporary relief from deportation for undocumented spouses and stepchildren of U.S. citizens by allowing them to apply for legal status without having to leave the country.",
      "America First Legal was also among many groups listed as part of Project 2025, a blue-print for a Republican presidency that generated controversy on the campaign trail and became a target of Democratic criticism. Trump distanced himself from Project 2025 and America First Legal sought to be removed from the website's list of advisory board members.",
      "Miller told ABC News at the time, \"I have zero involvement with Project 2025. Zero. None. I made an advice video a long while back for students. I have no involvement with the project whatsoever.\"",
      "Miller spoke at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally in the final stretch of the race, where he doubled down on Trump's immigration agenda.",
      "\"Who is going to stand up and say the cartels are gone, the criminal migrants are gone, the gangs are gone,\" Miller said. \"America is for Americans and Americans only.\"",
      "The position Miller is set to take on is not a Cabinet position, so it does not need Senate confirmation.",
      "ABC News' Alexandra Hutzler contributed to this report.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump has tapped former Rep. Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "In a statement on Monday, Trump praised Zeldin's background as a lawyer and said he's known the former New York congressman for a long time.",
      "\"He will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet,\" Trump said. \"He will set new standards on environmental review and maintenance, that will allow the United States to grow in a healthy and well-structured way.\"",
      "Zeldin confirmed he had been offered the job in a social media post.",
      "\"It is an honor to join President Trump's Cabinet as EPA Administrator,\" Zeldin wrote on X. \"We will restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI. We will do so while protecting access to clean air and water.\"",
      "Zeldin represented Long Island's Suffolk County in the House of Representatives for eight years. He ran for governor against Democrat Kathy Hochul in 2022, earning Trump's endorsement but falling short of Hochul by 6 points.",
      "Zeldin previously criticized the Biden-Harris administration for canceling a key permit needed for the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline and rejoining the Paris climate agreement after Trump withdrew. During his gubernatorial bid, he wanted to reverse New York state's ban on hydraulic fracking.",
      "Zeldin will need to be confirmed by the Senate to lead the EPA.",
      "Shortly after Trump's announcement, Zeldin appeared on Fox News' \"The Story\" and stressed his role within the agency would be to carry out Trump's plan to \"unleash economic prosperity through the EPA.\"",
      "He pledged to quickly eliminate regulations upon his arrival at the EPA, claiming existing rules are hampering businesses across the country.",
      "\"So day one and the first 100 days, we have the opportunity to roll back regulations that are forcing businesses to be able to struggle,\" Zeldin said. \"They're forced to cut costs internally, they are moving overseas altogether to be able to bolster liquidity in the American economy, where businesses strive to grow, expand here and have the ability to export what they produce, as opposed to exporting their jobs in the company -- the companies themselves.\"",
      "While vowing to cut regulations, Zeldin still insisted that Trump cares about \"conserving the environment\" and providing access to clean air and water.",
      "Trump's pick of Zeldin comes less than a week after Election Day and as Trump's new administration begins to take shape.",

      "The move comes after what authorities called a record summer that saw over 4 million people visiting the world-famous remains of the ancient Roman city, buried under ash and rock following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D.",
      "The park's director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said visitors to the main archaeological site now exceed an average of 15,000 to 20,000 every day, and the new daily cap will prevent the numbers from surging further.",

      "Authorities in South Carolina have captured a Tennessee fugitive accused of killing a man and trying to pass off the body as someone else's",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A fugitive accused of killing a man in Tennessee and trying to pass off the body as someone else's by calling 911, identifying himself as that person and saying he had fallen off a cliff while being chased by a bear has been captured in South Carolina, authorities said.",
      "In a social media post Sunday, the Columbia Police Department said Nicholas Wayne Hamlett, 45, was recognized by an employee at a hospital in the South Carolina city. Authorities confirmed his identity with a fingerprint scanner and he's in the temporary custody of the U.S. Marshals Service while awaiting extradition to Tennessee.",
      "Authorities in Monroe County, Tennessee, and elsewhere had been looking for Hamlett since last month.",
      "\u201cAfter observing Hamlett at a local hospital, a good citizen alerted the authorities and brought this manhunt to a peaceful end,\u201d Monroe County Sheriff Tommy Jones said in a social media post.",
      "The sheriff's office said last month that Hamlett called 911 on Oct. 18 claiming to have fallen off a cliff while running from a bear. Using the name Brandon Andrade, Hamlett claimed he was injured and partially in the water, authorities added.",
      "When emergency responders searched the area near a highway bridge in Tellico Plains, where the call had come from, they found the body of a man with Andrade's ID on it.",
      "However, authorities determined that the man was not Andrade, whose ID had been stolen and used multiple times. The person using Andrade's stolen identification was Hamlett, who was wanted in Alabama for a parole violation, the sheriff's office said. Andrade was alive and well, authorities confirmed.",
      "Forensics officials also determined that the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head, which isn't consistent with a high fall or a bear attack, Jones said.",
      "Hamlett likely fled his Tennessee home before police could verify his real identity, authorities said. That set off a manhunt for Hamlett, who was considered armed and dangerous. The U.S. Marshals Service had been offering a reward of up to $5,000 for help finding him.",
      "On Oct. 31, law enforcement officers searched Chapin, South Carolina, with helicopters and police dogs after getting information that Hamlett was in the area, telling residents to lock their doors on Halloween night. He was spotted near a high school in the city the next day.",
      "On Nov. 4, the Tennessee sheriff's office identified the dead man as 34-year-old Steven Douglas Lloyd, of Knoxville. It said Hamlett had befriended Lloyd, then lured him into the woods to kill him and take his identity.",
      "According to the sheriff, Lloyd's family said he was diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder and would leave home and live on the streets, but remained in touch with his family.",
      "\u201cSteven loved the outdoors and was so helpful when it came to others,\u201d Jones wrote in a Nov. 4 social media post. \u201cThe family was shocked to learn that their beloved son's life had been taken by someone that Steven trusted.\""

      "That may make for an awkward encounter, especially given that, after Biden ousted Trump in 2020, Trump offered no such White House invitation to Biden. Trump even left Washington before the Jan. 20, 2021, inauguration, becoming the first president to do so since Andrew Johnson skipped the 1869 swearing-in of Ulysses S. Grant.",
      "Biden also has the unusual distinction of having beaten Trump in one cycle and run against him for about 15 months during this year\u2019s campaign. As he sought reelection, Biden constantly decried Trump as a threat to democracy and the nation\u2019s core values before leaving the race in July and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, who took on her own campaign and lost on Election Day.",
      "When the two meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday, it\u2019ll technically be the first time since 1992 that an outgoing president sits down with an incoming one he competed against in a campaign. Back then, Republican President George H.W. Bush met with Democrat and President-elect Bill Clinton about two weeks after they squared off on Election Day.",
      "Bush and Clinton talked policy before going together to the Roosevelt Room to meet with their transition staff. Clinton later called the meeting \u201cterrific\u201d and said Bush was \u201cvery helpful.\u201d",

      "This time, Biden has vowed to ensure a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working with Trump, who is both his presidential predecessor and successor, to bring the country together. Biden\u2019s White House invitation to Trump includes his wife, the former and now incoming first lady, Melania Trump.",
      "\u201cI assured him that I\u2019d direct my entire administration to work with his team,\u201d Biden said of the call with Trump when he made the invitation. The president-elect \u201clooks forward to the meeting,\" spokesman Steven Cheung said.",

      "\u201cI very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel,\u201d Trump said. Obama White House press secretary Josh Earnest described the meeting as \u201cat least a little less awkward than some might have expected,\u201d and he noted that the two \u201cdid not relitigate their differences in the Oval Office.\u201d",
      "In fact, that encounter went smoothly enough to reassure a few Trump critics that he might grow into the job and become more presidential in temperament and action \u2014 an assessment quickly subsumed by Trump\u2019s unique relish of bombast and political conflict once his administration began, particularly when it came to his predecessor.",
      "Only about four months later, Trump accused Obama \u2013 without evidence \u2013 of having his \u201cwires tapped\u201d in Trump Tower before the 2016 election. On social media, he blasted the former president for engaging in \u201cMcCarthyism\u201d and decrying it as \u201cNixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\u201d",
      "Obama aides now say that while the 2016 Trump-Obama meeting went well publicly, the incoming president's team ignored most of the transition process and did not have the same reverence for the White House and federal institutions that they or Republican President George W. Bush\u2019s team had.",
      "One recalled that the only question Trump counterparts asked at the time was not about the coming workload or responsibilities, but how best to find an apartment in Washington.",
      "The official transition process does not mandate that presidents invite their successors to face-to-face meetings, though it can feel that way.",
      "\u201cThe psychological transfer occurs then,\" former Vice President Walter Mondale once said.",
      "There's no record of George Washington scheduling a formal meeting with the nation's second president, John Adams, before leaving the then-capital city of New York. And Adams, after moving into the White House during his term, never invited his political rival and successor, Thomas Jefferson, over before leaving without attending Jefferson's inauguration in 1801.",
      "Still, by 1841, President Martin Van Buren hosted President-elect William Henry Harrison \u2014 who had soundly beaten him on Election Day \u2014 for dinner at the White House. He even later offered to leave the official residence early to make room for his successor after Washington's National Hotel, where Harrison had been staying, became overcrowded. Harrison instead made a brief, preinaugural trip to Virginia.",
      "More recently, Republican George W. Bush welcomed Obama to the White House in 2008 after calling the election of the nation's first Black president a \u201ctriumph of the American story.\u201d",
      "And eight years prior, Bush himself was the newcomer when he met with the outgoing Clinton, who had denied his father a second term. Their chat came just eight days after the Supreme Court resolved the disputed 2000 election, and Bush also later headed to the vice presidential residence to briefly talk with the man he defeated, Al Gore.",
      "Bush and Gore didn't say what they discussed, though vice presidential press aide Jim Kennedy described the conversation as meant to \u2033demonstrate that this is a country where we put aside our differences after a long and difficult campaign.\u2033",

      "Days before Senate Republicans pick their new leader, President-elect Donald Trump is pressuring the candidates to change Senate rules and give him more power to appoint unconfirmed nominees",
      "WASHINGTON -- Days before Senate Republicans pick their new leader, President-elect Donald Trump is pressuring the candidates to change the rules and empower him to appoint some nominees without a Senate vote.",
      "Republican Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida are running in a secret ballot election Wednesday to lead the GOP conference and replace longtime GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who is stepping aside from the job after almost two decades. All three have courted Trump's support in the race, vying to show who is the closest to the president-elect as they campaign to become majority leader.",
      "Trump has not endorsed in the race, but on Sunday he made clear that he expects the new leader to go around regular Senate order, if necessary, to allow him to fill his Cabinet quickly. In a statement on X and Truth Social, Trump said that the next leader \u201cmust agree\u201d to allow him to make appointments when the chamber is on recess, bypassing a confirmation vote.",
      "\u201cAny Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,\u201d Trump posted, adding that positions should be filled \u201cIMMEDIATELY!\u201d",
      "The Senate has not allowed presidents to make so-called recess appointments since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling limited the president\u2019s power to do so. Since then, the Senate has held brief \u201cpro-forma\u201d sessions when it is out of town for more than 10 days so that a president cannot take advantage of the absence and start filling posts that have not been confirmed.",
      "But with Trump\u2019s approval paramount in the race, all three candidates quickly suggested that they might be willing to reconsider the practice. Scott replied to Trump, \u201c100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible.\u201d And Thune said in a statement that they must \u201cquickly and decisively\u201d act to get nominees in place and that \u201call options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments.\u201d",
      "Cornyn said that \u201cIt is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump \u2019s cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent.\u201d He noted that recess appointments are allowed under the Constitution.",
      "The social media exchange on Sunday became a first test for the three candidates since Trump was decisively elected last week to a second term.",
      "Trump\u2019s relationship with Congress \u2014 especially the advice and consent role afforded to the Senate when it comes to nominations \u2014 was tumultuous in his first term as he chafed at resistance to his selections and sought ways to work around lawmakers. With Trump now entering a second term emboldened by his sweeping election victory, he is already signaling that he expects Senate Republicans, and by extension, their new leader, to fall in line behind his Cabinet selections.",
      "Trump also posted on Sunday that the Senate should not approve any judges in the weeks before Republicans take power next year \u2014 a more difficult demand to fulfill as Democrats will control the floor, and hold the majority of votes, until the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3. Trump posted that \u201cDemocrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.\u201d",
      "With days to go, the race for Senate Republican leader is deeply in flux.",
      "Thune and Cornyn are both well-liked, longtime senators who have served as deputies to McConnell and have been seen as the front-runners, despite past statements criticizing Trump. Scott \u2014 a longtime friend of Trump\u2019s and fierce ally \u2014 has been seen as more of a longshot, but he has mounted an aggressive campaign in recent days on social media and elsewhere with the aim of getting Trump\u2019s endorsement.",
      "Senators who are close to Trump, such as Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida, have endorsed Scott, as have tech mogul Elon Musk and other people who have Trump\u2019s ear.",
      "\u201cWe have to be the change,\u201d Scott said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\" \u201cThat\u2019s what Donald Trump got elected to do, to be the change.\u201d",
      "All three candidates are promising that they will be more open and transparent than McConnell was and that they would give senators more power to get their priorities to the floor. They have also tried to make clear that they would have a much different relationship with Trump than McConnell, who once called the former president a \u201cdespicable human being\u201d behind closed doors.",
      "As the Senate haggles over how to fill Trump\u2019s Cabinet, many of his allies are campaigning for the nominations. Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that there are \u201ca couple of great options on the table.\u201d Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Republican from Tennessee who served as U.S. ambassador to Japan between 2017 and 2019, said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that one of his greatest honors was to represent the Trump administration overseas. He said he would advance \u201cthe positions that President Trump has articulated.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll do that in whatever role necessary,\u201d said Hagerty, who has endorsed Scott in the leadership race.",
      "While Trump has made only one personnel move public so far, naming Susie Wiles his chief of staff, he has already ruled out two names for top positions.",
      "Trump said Saturday that he would not be inviting Mike Pompeo, his former U.S. Secretary of State and CIA chief, and Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as his U.N. ambassador and challenged him for the GOP nomination. Pompeo rallied with Trump on the night before Election Day.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina's Supreme Court has not set a date for the state's next execution after lawyers for four inmates out of appeals asked them to postpone deaths until after Christmas and New Year's.",
      "The justices typically issue notices on Fridays because it gives the maximum amount of time of 28 days to prepare for the execution which by law is to be carried out on the \u201cfourth Friday after the receipt of such notice.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court also promised in August to space out the executions in five week intervals to give prison staff and defense lawyers, who are often representing several condemned inmates, time to handle all the legal matters necessary. That includes making sure the lethal injection drugs as well as the electric chair and firing squad are ready and researching and filing last minute appeals.",
      "South Carolina\u2019s death chamber has a backlog because of a 13-year pause in executions in part because the state couldn\u2019t obtain the drugs needed to carry out lethal injections until the General Assembly passed a law keeping the name of the provider secret.",
      "Six inmates ran out of appeals during that time. Two have been executed and four are awaiting their fate.",
      "The justices could have issued a death warrant this past Friday for Marion Bowman Jr. that would have been carried out on Dec. 6.",
      "But the day passed with no word from the Supreme Court, including what the justices thought of the request from the inmates last Tuesday to take a break from executions until early January.",
      "\u201cSix consecutive executions with virtually no respite will take a substantial toll on all involved, particularly during a time of year that is so important to families,\u201d the lawyers for the inmates wrote in court papers.",
      "Attorneys for the state responded that prison officials were ready to keep to the original schedule and the state has conducted executions around the Christmas and New Year\u2019s holidays before, including five between Dec. 4, 1998, and Jan. 8, 1999.",
      "Bowman, 44, was convicted of murder in the shooting of friend 21-year-old Kandee Martin whose burned body was found in the trunk of her car in Dorchester County in 2001. Bowman has spent more than half his life on death row.",
      "Bowman would be the third inmate executed since September after the state obtained the drug it needed to carry out the death sentence. Freddie Owens was put to death by lethal injection Sept. 20 and Richard Moore was executed on Nov. 1,",
      "South Carolina was among the busiest states for executions back then, but that stopped once the state had trouble obtaining lethal injection drugs because of pharmaceutical companies\u2019 concerns they would have to disclose they had sold the drugs to officials.",
      "The state Legislature has since passed a law allowing officials to keep lethal injection drug suppliers secret, and in July, the state Supreme Court cleared the way to restart executions."

      "\u201cElise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,\u201d Trump said in a statement Monday announcing his pick for the role \u2014 his first selection that will require Senate confirmation.",
      "Stefanik, 40, who serves as House Republican Conference Chair, has long been one of Trump's most loyal allies in the House, and was among those discussed as a potential vice presidential choice.",
      "She will be thrown into the world body\u2019s deep divisions from the wars in the Mideast and Ukraine to reining in nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran.",
      "She will also come face-to-face almost daily in the U.N. Security Council with the ambassadors of Russia and China whose countries are now strongly allied and looking warily at a second Trump presidency \u2013 and sometimes with their counterparts from North Korea and Iran.",
      "Stefanik will succeed U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat and former assistant secretary of state for Africa who has held the job through the entire Biden administration and has been a member of his Cabinet. Stefanik also will be a member of Trump's Cabinet, he said in the statement.",
      "In Trump\u2019s first administration, he chose former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who had little foreign experience except for some trade missions, for the U.N. post. She resigned after two years and then challenged Trump for the GOP nomination. Haley was succeeded by then U.S. ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft, wife of a Kentucky coal magnate, who in 2023 was unsuccessful in her bid for the GOP nomination for governor of the state.",

      "Born and raised in upstate New York, Stefanik graduated from Harvard and worked in former President George W. Bush\u2019s White House on the domestic policy council and in the chief of staff\u2019s office.",
      "In 2014, at 30, she became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, representing upstate New York. She later became the youngest woman to serve in House leadership.",
      "Stefanik was known early in her tenure as a more moderate conservative voice. But she soon attached herself to the former president, quietly remaking her image into that of a staunch MAGA ally \u2014 and seeing her power ascend.",
      "She became the House Republican Conference Chair in 2021.",
      "Stefanik spent years positioning herself as one of Trump\u2019s most trusted allies and confidants on the Hill. She endorsed him in the 2024 race before he had even launched his bid, and aggressively campaigned on his behalf during the GOP primary.",
      "She saw her profile rise after her aggressive questioning of a trio of university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses led to two of their resignations \u2014 a performance Trump repeatedly praised.",
      "She also defended him vigorously in both of his impeachment trials and railed against his four criminal indictments, including filing an ethics complaint in New York against the judge who heard his civil fraud case.",
      "While she is a member of the House Armed Services Committee and serves on the coveted House committee that oversees national intelligence, her pick further solidifies Trump\u2019s preference for unconditional loyalty in his second administration over career experience.",
      "One area of foreign policy that Stefanik has been vocal about is Israel.",
      "Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, Stefanik has focused much of her attention on the United Nations, accusing the world body and international organizations of antisemitism for their criticism of Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza, which has resulted in the death of more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to their Health Ministry.",
      "She has gone as far as calling last month for a \u201ccomplete reassessment\u201d of U.S. funding for the United Nations, while helping push for the blocking of American support for the U.N. agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the region.",
      "Her departure for the United Nations would also mean that Republicans, who are on track to have a razor-thin majority in the House, would be down one crucial vote. But Stefanik\u2019s district is located in a deeply red part of upstate New York, where Republicans are likely guaranteed to win the special election that would take place after she leaves office.",

      "Tesla was the strongest force pushing upward on the S&P 500 after rising 9.1%. Its leader, Elon Musk, has become a close ally of Trump\u2019s, and its stock jumped nearly 15% the day after the election and has kept rising.",
      "Several pieces of what\u2019s known as the \u201cTrump trade\u201d also helped drive the market, as investors try to identify which companies will be winners under a second Trump term. JPMorgan Chase rose 1%, and financial stocks again helped lead the market on expectations for stronger economic growth, less regulation from Washington and an increase in mergers and acquisitions.",
      "A White House more friendly to big tie-ups has helped Wall Street speculate about a merger between insurers Cigna Group and Humana, for example. It\u2019s been so feverish that Cigna said Monday it isn\u2019t pursuing a deal with Humana. Cigna\u2019s stock rose 7.3%, and Humana\u2019s sank 2%.",
      "Stocks of companies more focused on the U.S. economy were also rising more than the rest of the market, including a 1.5% rally for the smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index, because they\u2019re seen as benefiting more from Trump\u2019s America First policies than big multinational companies.",

      "Treasury yields been generally climbing since September, in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it\u2019s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target.",
      "But Trump\u2019s win has scrambled expectations for coming cuts to rates. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many the Fed will deliver next year. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel.",
      "Still, many professional investors warn not to get carried away by all the big swings following Trump\u2019s victory. It takes time to see what campaign promises turn into actual policy, and that can lead to snaps back for the market\u2019s initial knee-jerk reactions.",

      "CHURCH CREEK, Md. -- Revered abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who was the first woman to oversee an American military action during a time of war, was posthumously awarded the rank of general on Monday.",
      "Dozens gathered on Veterans Day at the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park in Maryland's Dorcester County for a formal ceremony making Tubman a one-star brigadier general in the state's National Guard.",
      "Gov. Wes Moore called the occasion not just a great day for Tubman's home state but for all of the U.S.",
      "\u201cToday, we celebrate a soldier and a person who earned the title of veteran,\" Moore said. \"Today we celebrate one of the greatest authors of the American story.\u201d",
      "Tubman escaped slavery herself in 1849 and settled in Philadelphia. Intent on helping others achieve freedom, she established the Underground Railroad network and led other enslaved Black women and men to freedom. She then channeled those experiences as a scout, spy and nurse for the Union Army during the Civil War, helping guide 150 Black soldiers on a gunboat raid in South Carolina.",
      "Nobody would have judged Tubman had she chosen to remain in Philadelphia and coordinate abolitionist efforts from there, Moore said.",
      "\u201cShe knew that in order to do the work, that meant that she had to go into the lion\u2019s den,\u201d Moore siad. \u201cShe knew that leadership means you have to be willing to do what you are asking others to do.\u201d",
      "The reading of the official order was followed by a symbolic pinning ceremony with Tubman's great-great-great-grandniece, Tina Wyatt.",
      "Wyatt hailed her aunt's legacy of tenacity, generosity and faith and agreed Veterans Day applied to her as much as any other servicemember.",
      "\u201cAunt Harriet was one of those veterans informally, she gave up any rights that she had obtained for herself to be able to fight for others,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cShe is a selfless person.\u201d",
      "Tubman's status as an icon of history has only been further elevated within the last few years. The city of Philadelphia chose a Black artist to make a 14-foot (4.3-meter) bronze statue to go on display next year. In 2022, a Chicago elementary school was renamed for Tubman, replacing the previous namesake, who had racist views. However, plans to put Tubman on the $20 bill have continued to stall."

      "DELPHI, Ind. -- A former drugstore worker in the small Indiana community of Delphi was found guilty of murder on Monday in the killings of two teenage girls who vanished during an afternoon hike.",
      "Jurors convicted Richard Allen of two counts of murder and two additional counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping in the 2017 killings of Abigail Williams, 13, and Liberty German, 14.",
      "Allen wasn't arrested for five more years, while the case drew outsized attention from true-crime enthusiasts. His trial followed repeated delays, a leak of evidence, the withdrawal of Allen\u2019s public defenders and their reinstatement by the Indiana Supreme Court.",
      "Reporters inside the courtroom said Allen, 52, showed no reaction as the verdict was delivered, but he looked back at his family at one point. Allen is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 20. He could face up to 130 years in prison.",
      "Outside the courthouse, people on the sidewalk began to cheer as word of the verdict spread.",
      "Indiana State Police spokesman Capt. Ron Galaviz told The Associated Press that the judge\u2019s gag order remains in place and he believes it will until Allen is sentenced. Allen\u2019s lawyers left the courthouse Monday without making statements.",
      "A special judge oversaw the case \u2014 Superior Court Judge Fran Gull who along with the jurors, came from northeastern Indiana\u2019s Allen County. The seven women and five men were sequestered throughout the trial, which began Oct. 18 in the Carroll County seat of Delphi, the girls\u2019 hometown of about 3,000 residents in northwest Indiana where Allen also lived and worked.",
      "Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas McLeland noted in his closing argument that Allen had repeatedly confessed to the killings \u2014 in person, on the phone and in writing. In one of the recordings he replayed for the jury, Allen could be heard telling his wife, \u201cI did it. I killed Abby and Libby.\u201d",
      "McLeland also said Allen is the man seen following the teens in a grainy cell phone video recorded by one of the girls as they crossed an abandoned railroad trestle called the Monon High Bridge.",
      "\u201cRichard Allen is Bridge Guy,\u201d McLeland told jurors. \u201cHe kidnapped them and later murdered them.\u201d",
      "McLeland said it was Allen\u2019s voice that could be heard on the video telling the teens, \u201c Down the hill \u2033 after they crossed the bridge on Feb. 13, 2017. Their bodies were found the next day, their throats cut, in a nearby wooded area.",
      "An investigator testified that Allen told him and another officer that on the day the teens vanished, he was wearing a blue or black Carhartt jacket, jeans and a beanie \u2014 clothing similar to what the man recorded on the bridge wore.",
      "McLeland said an unspent bullet found between the teens\u2019 bodies \u201chad been cycled through\u201d Allen\u2019s .40-caliber Sig Sauer handgun. An Indiana State Police firearms expert told the jury her analysis tied the round to Allen\u2019s handgun.",
      "But a firearms expert called by the defense questioned the analysis, and attorney Bradley Rozzi dismissed it as a \u201cmagic bullet,\u201d saying investigators had made an \u201capples to oranges\u201d comparison of the unspent round to one fired from Allen\u2019s gun.",
      "Allen was arrested in October 2022. He had become a suspect after a retired state government worker who volunteered to help police in the case found paperwork in September 2022 showing that Allen had contacted authorities two days after the girls' bodies were found. That paperwork indicated that Allen had told an officer he had been on the hiking trail the afternoon the girls went missing, according to testimony.",
      "Allen\u2019s defense argued that his confessions are unreliable because he was facing a severe mental health crisis while under the pressure and stress of being locked up in isolation, watched 24 hours a day and taunted by people incarcerated with him. A psychiatrist called by the defense testified that months in solitary confinement could make a person delirious and psychotic.",
      "But Dr. Monica Wala, Allen\u2019s psychologist at the Westville Correctional Facility, said Allen shared details of the crime in some of the confessions, including telling her he slashed the girls\u2019 throats and put tree branches over their bodies. She wrote in a report that Allen told her he abandoned his plans to rape the teens when a van passed nearby. A man whose driveway passes under the Monon High Bridge testified that he was driving home from work in his van around that time.",
      "That van, McLeland told jurors in his closing, was a detail \u201conly the killer would know.\u201d",
      "During cross-examination, Wala acknowledged that she had followed Allen\u2019s case with interest during her personal time even while treating him and that she was a fan of the true-crime genre.",
      "Rozzi said in his closing arguments that Allen is innocent. He said no witness explicitly identified Allen as the man seen on the hiking trail or the bridge the afternoon the girls went missing. And he said no fingerprint, DNA or forensic evidence links Allen to the murder scene.",
      "\u201cHe had every chance to run, but he did not because he didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Rozzi told the jurors.",
      "Allen\u2019s lawyers had sought to argue before the trial that the girls were killed in a ritual sacrifice by members of a white nationalist group known as the Odinists who follow a pagan Norse religion, but the judge ruled against that, saying the defense \u201cfailed to produce admissible evidence\u201d of such a connection."

      "Wiles, 67, was a senior adviser to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and its de facto manager.",
      "Wiles has a background in Florida politics. She helped Ron DeSantis win his first race for Florida governor. Six years later, she was key to Trump's defeat of him in the 2024 Republican primary.",
      "Wiles\u2019 hire was Trump\u2019s first major decision as president-elect and one that could be a defining test of his incoming administration considering her close relationship with the president-elect. Wiles is said to have earned Trump's trust in part by guiding what was the most disciplined of Trump's three presidential campaigns.",
      "Wiles was able to help keep Trump on track as few others have, not by criticizing his impulses, but by winning his respect by demonstrating his success after taking her advice.",
      "Trump asked Waltz, a retired Army National Guard officer and war veteran, to be his national security adviser, a person familiar with the matter said Monday.",
      "The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter before Trump made a formal announcement.",
      "The move would put Waltz at the forefront of a litany of national security crises, ranging from the ongoing effort to provide weapons to Ukraine and escalating worries about the growing alliance between Russia and North Korea to the persistent attacks in the Middle East by Iran proxies and the push for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah.",
      "Waltz is a three-term GOP congressman from east-central Florida. He served multiple tours in Afghanistan and also worked in the Pentagon as a policy adviser when Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates were defense chiefs.",
      "He is considered hawkish on China, and called for a U.S. boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing due to its involvement in the origin of COVID-19 and its ongoing mistreatment of the minority Muslim Uighur population.",
      "Homan, 62, has been tasked with Trump\u2019s top priority of carrying out the largest deportation operation in the nation\u2019s history.",
      "Homan, who served under Trump in his first administration leading U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was widely expected to be offered a position related to the border, an issue Trump made central to his campaign.",
      "Though Homan has insisted such a massive undertaking would be humane, he has long been a loyal supporter of Trump's policy proposals, suggesting at a July conference in Washington that he would be willing to \"run the biggest deportation operation this country\u2019s ever seen.\u201d",
      "Democrats have criticized Homan for his defending Trump's \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy on border crossings during his first administration, which led to the separation of thousands of parents and children seeking asylum at the border.",
      "Stefanik is a representative from New York and one of Trump's staunchest defenders going back to his first impeachment.",
      "Elected to the House in 2014, Stefanik was selected by her GOP House colleagues as House Republican Conference chair in 2021, when former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was removed from the post after publicly criticizing Trump for falsely claiming he won the 2020 election. Stefanik, 40, has served in that role ever since as the third-ranking member of House leadership.",
      "Stefanik\u2019s questioning of university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses helped lead to two of those presidents resigning, further raising her national profile.",
      "If confirmed, she would represent American interests at the U.N. as Trump vows to end the war waged by Russia against Ukraine begun in 2022. He has also called for peace as Israel continues its offensive against Hamas in Gaza and its invasion of Lebanon to target Hezbollah.",
      "Miller, an immigration hardliner, was a vocal spokesperson during the presidential campaign for Trump's priority of mass deportations. The 39-year-old was a senior adviser during Trump's first administration.",
      "Miller has been a central figure in some of Trump's policy decisions, notably his move to separate thousands of immigrant families.",
      "Trump argued throughout the campaign that the nation's economic, national security and social priorities could be met by deporting people who are in the United States illegally. Since Trump left office in 2021, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal, an organization made up of former Trump advisers aimed at challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as free speech and national security.",

      "A new Louisiana requirement that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public classroom by Jan_ 1 was temporarily blocked Tuesday by a federal judge who said the law is \u201cunconstitutional on its face.\u201d",
      "BATON ROUGE, LA. -- A new Louisiana requirement that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public classroom by Jan. 1 was temporarily blocked Tuesday by a federal judge who said the law is \u201cunconstitutional on its face.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles in Baton Rouge said the law had an \u201covertly religious\u201d purpose, and rejected state officials' claims that the government can mandate the posting of the Ten Commandments because they hold historical significance to the foundation of U.S. law. His opinion noted that no other foundational documents \u2014 including the Constitution or the Bill of Rights \u2014 must be posted.",
      "In granting a preliminary injunction, DeGravelles said opponents of the law are likely to win their ongoing lawsuit against the law. The lawsuit argues that the law violates the First Amendment's provisions forbidding the government from establishing a religion or blocking the free exercise of religion. They had argued that the poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments would isolate students, especially those who are not Christian.",
      "DeGravelles said the law amounts to unconstitutional religious government coercion of students: \u201cAs Plaintiffs highlight, by law, parents must send their minor children to school and ensure attendance during regular school hours at least 177 days per year.\u201d",
      "Proponents say that the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance to the foundation of U.S. law.",
      "Plaintiffs in the case were a group of parents of Louisiana public school children.",
      "The new law in Louisiana, a reliably Republican state that is ensconced in the Bible Belt, was passed by the state's GOP-dominated Legislature earlier this year. The Associated Press sought comment Tuesday morning from Gov. Jeff Landry and Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill, both Republicans and supporters of the law.",
      "The legislation, which has been touted by Republicans including President-elect Donald Trump, is one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms \u2014 from Florida legislation allowing school districts to have volunteer chaplains to counsel students to Oklahoma\u2019s top education official ordering public schools to incorporate the Bible into lessons.",
      "In recent years, similar bills requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, none have gone into effect.",
      "In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the First Amendment establishment, which says Congress can \u201cmake no law respecting an establishment of religion.\u201d The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s legislation, which applies to all public K-12 schools and state-funded university classrooms, requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed on a poster or framed document at least 11 inches by 14 inches (28 by 36 centimeters) where the text is the central focus and \u201cprinted in a large, easily readable font.\u201d",
      "Each poster must be paired with the four-paragraph \u201ccontext statement\u201d describing how the Ten Commandments \u201cwere a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\u201d",
      "Tens of thousands of posters would likely be needed to satisfy the new law. Proponents say schools are not required to spend public money on the posters, and instead that they can be bought using donations or that groups and organizations will donate the actual posters.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice for defense secretary is still up in the air, but it\u2019s a sure bet he will look to reshape the Pentagon and pick a loyalist",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's choice for defense secretary is still up in the air, but it is a sure bet he will look to reshape the Pentagon and pick a loyalist. During his tumultuous first term, five men held the job as Pentagon chief only to resign, be fired or serve briefly as a stopgap.",
      "While he has yet to announce a decision, the names of potential Pentagon chiefs stretch from the well known \u2014 such as Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee \u2014 to an array of former administration loyalists, including retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, who held national security posts during Trump's first term.",
      "Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been floated, but Trump said on social media Saturday that Pompeo would not be joining the new administration. Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida had also been mentioned, but he's now been tapped to be Trump's national security adviser.",
      "Some decisions may linger for days as candidates jostle for attention and officials wait for the final results from House races, weighing whether Republican lawmakers can be tapped or if others are a safer pick to avoid a new election for an empty congressional seat.",
      "\u201cThe choice is going to tell us a lot about how he will deal with the Pentagon,\u201d said Mark Cancian, senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a retired Marine colonel.",
      "He said someone with a deep military background may not be as dramatic of a change as others who may be viewed as stronger Trump loyalists.",
      "With a number of top jobs at the State Department, National Security Council and Defense Department up for grabs, Trump is expected to lean toward those who back his desire to end U.S. involvement in any wars, use the military to control the U.S.-Mexico border and take a hard line on Iran.",
      "The key test, however, will be loyalty and a willingness to do whatever Trump wants, as he seeks to avoid the pushback he got from the Pentagon the first time around.",
      "Trump's relationship with his civilian and military leaders during those years was fraught with tension, confusion and frustration, as they struggled to temper or even simply interpret presidential tweets and pronouncements that blindsided them with abrupt policy decisions they weren't prepared to explain or defend.",
      "Time after time, senior Pentagon officials \u2014 both in and out of uniform \u2014 worked to dissuade, delay or derail Trump, on issues ranging from his early demand to prohibit transgender troops from serving in the military and his announcements that he was pulling troops out of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan to his push to use troops to police the border and stem civil unrest on the streets of Washington.",
      "In his first administration, Trump hewed toward what he considered strong military men and defense industry executives. Initially enamored with generals, Trump over time found them to be not loyal enough.",
      "\u201cHe soured on them,\u201d Cancian said. \u201cThey were not as pliable as he had thought. ... I\u2019ve heard people speculate that maybe the chairman would be fired. So that\u2019s something to watch.\u201d",
      "Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, took over as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 2023 for a four-year term, but military leaders serve at the pleasure of the president. Brown, a combat pilot and just the second Black officer to serve as chairman, spoke out after the police killing of George Floyd, describing the bias he faced in his life and career.",
      "Trump also is expected to choose someone as defense secretary with disdain for equity and diversity programs and less likely to counter his plans based on limits laid out in the Constitution and rule of law. But he also may well push for increased defense spending, at least initially, including on U.S. missile defense.",
      "A key overriding concern is that Trump will select someone who won't push back against potentially unlawful or dangerous orders or protect the military's longstanding apolitical status.",
      "On Thursday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin raised that red flag. In a message to the force, he said the U.S. military stands ready to \u201cobey all lawful orders from its civilian chain of command,\u201d adding that troops swear an oath to \u201csupport and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d",
      "He echoed retired Army Gen. Mark Milley's pronouncement during a speech as he closed out four years as chairman of the Joint Chiefs.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t take an oath to a king or a queen or to a tyrant or a dictator. And we don\u2019t take an oath to a wannabe dictator,\u201d Milley said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take an oath to an individual. We take an oath to the Constitution, and we take an oath to the idea that is America, and we\u2019re willing to die to protect it.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s first defense chief, retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, learned quickly to stay off his boss\u2019 radar by largely eliminating press conferences that Trump could see.",
      "Mattis and Milley, along with Trump's chief of staff John Kelly, a retired Marine general, and retired Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, who also served as Joint Chiefs chairman, all worked quietly behind the scenes to temper some of Trump's decisions.",
      "They stalled his demands that troops be quickly and completely withdrawn from Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan and managed to prevent the use of active-duty troops to quell civil unrest in Washington.",
      "Two years in, Mattis abruptly resigned in December 2018 in frustration over Trump\u2019s national security policies, including a perceived disdain for allies and his demands to pull all troops out of Syria. Patrick Shanahan, the deputy defense secretary, took over as acting Pentagon chief but withdrew as the nominee six months later due to personal family problems that were made public.",
      "Then-Army Secretary Mark Esper took over in an acting role, but he had to step aside briefly when nominated, so Navy Secretary Richard Spencer served as the acting chief until Esper was confirmed.",
      "Esper was fired days after Trump lost the 2020 election, largely because the president did not believe him to be loyal enough. Trump was especially angry over Esper\u2019s public opposition to invoking the two-centuries-old Insurrection Act to deploy active-duty troops in the District of Columbia during unrest following the police killing of George Floyd.",
      "Trump named Christopher Miller, a retired Army officer who has been director of the National Counterterrorism Center, to serve as acting secretary and surrounded him with staunch loyalists.",
      "That is the Pentagon that officials quietly say they expect to see in Trump's new administration."

      "The UK government said in August that it would not fight any cases over Rosebank and Jackdaw.",

      "This came after the Supreme Court ruled in June that regulators must consider the total environmental impact of new projects - including the way fossil fuels are used by end consumers.",
      "It is understood that the oil companies will accept that the decisions to give the go-ahead for Rosebank and Jackdaw were unlawful because the emissions they would create were not properly assessed.",
      "They are expected to focus instead on how to move forward with the projects, given that work is already under way.",

      "She said the UK government had admitted that it was an \u201cerror of law\u201d to have failed to have taken into account greenhouse gas emissions from the eventual burning of oil and gas extracted from Rosebank and Jackdaw (known as Scope 3 emissions).",
      "Ms Crawford said granting a licence was ultimately a political decision but it must be done only after a lawful consenting process which included an environmental impact assessment taking into account Scope 3 emissions.",

      "The Hague court of appeal said it could not establish that Shell had a \"social standard of care\" to reduce its emissions by 45% or any other amount, even though it agreed the company had an obligation to citizens to limit emissions.",
      "Three years ago, a court in The Hague backed a case by Friends of the Earth and 17,000 Dutch citizens requiring Shell to reduce its CO2 emissions significantly, in line with the Paris climate accords.",
      "The ruling came as climate talks involving some 200 countries got under way in Azerbaijan.",

      "Under the terms of the Paris Agreement on climate change, nearly 200 nations agreed to keep global temperatures \"well below\" 2C above pre-industrial levels.",
      "The appeals court judge said that companies such as Shell were obliged to contribute to combating climate change based on the human right to protection against dangerous climate change.",
      "However, the court said Shell was already working to reduce its emissions and the court could not establish whether it should make a 45% cut or another percentage, as there was no current accepted agreement in climate science on the required amount.",
      "Shell has argued that it is already taking \"serious steps to reduce emissions\". It complained the original ruling was unfair as it singled out one company for a global issue, and said it was unrealistic to try to hold Shell accountable for its customers' choices.",
      "Shell said if people considered progress was too slow towards cutting emissions then they should lobby governments rather than Shell to change policies and bring about a green transition.",
      "The oil firm says its aim is to reduce the carbon intensity of products it sells by 15-20% by 2030 from a 2016 baseline. Shell also aims to become a \"net zero\" emissions company by 2050.",
      "Part of the historic legal case hinged on the interpretation of an \"unwritten duty of care\" that exists under Dutch law, which requires companies to prevent hazardous negligence.",
      "Friends of the Earth Netherlands argued that there was an international consensus that human rights offered protection against dangerous climate change and that companies had to respect human rights.",
      "Shell's successful appeal could have far-reaching implications for corporate climate responsibility.",

      "In October, 13% of working adults in Great Britain said they did their job solely from home, according to the ONS.",
      "But hybrid working - a mix of working from home and in the office or on a site - has become more popular, though only 28% of people said they had such a working arrangement.",
      "The ONS said working parents were more likely to have hybrid working arrangements (35%), compared with workers that do not have children (24%).",
      "Of working parents, men were more likely to hybrid work than women, at 41% and 30% respectively, although it is not clear what factors are driving the difference.",

    "summary": "It can be hard to find good advice on how to make homes more energy efficient.",
    "story": [
      "When Simon Duffy gets another energy bill, his heart sinks. \u201cIt\u2019s madly expensive,\u201d he says.",
      "Mr Duffy lives in a traditional stone-walled detached house in Sheffield. He estimates that he spends \u00a33,100 every year on heating and electricity.",
      "Despite being someone who cares about climate change, and keen to retrofit his property to make it more efficient, there\u2019s a problem.",
      "\u201cThe whole question of how to better insulate the house is a real mystery to me,\u201d says Mr Duffy, a director of sustainability think-tank Citizen Network. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the expertise for that is.\u201d He also adds that he\u2019s also not sure whether he could install solar panels, given that he lives in a conservation area.",
      "Millions of homeowners across the country could be facing the same dilemma.",
      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",
      "\u201cEven though we\u2019ve got this background, and we\u2019re engineers as well, what we weren\u2019t entirely clear on was where was best to spend the money,\u201d says Mrs Peace.",
      "The couple spoke to multiple consultants, but Mrs Peace found the advice they received was often geared towards meeting Passivhaus standards \u2013 an ultra-energy efficient type of building.",
      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t many in that pragmatic middle space where you are literally saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this much money, where would we be best putting it?\u2019,\u201d Mrs Peace adds.",
      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",
      "\u201cWe can model all the different options that are available, suitable for your home and your budget, and identify a package of measures,\u201d says Liz Lain\u00e9, of Parity Projects, a housing data analysis company, which runs Ecofurb.",
      "The firm offers this initial consultation for free, but full plans, with personalised input from a retrofit coordinator, start at \u00a3470. Ecofurb can also oversee any works as they are carried out by contractors to avoid \u201chorror stories\u201d, says Ms Lain\u00e9.",
      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",
      "RICS, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has also just launched a new retrofit standard for its members \u2013 essentially, it encourages surveyors with the appropriate training to offer their services to homeowners planning or undergoing a retrofit.",
      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",
      "\u201cThe industry as a whole don\u2019t appreciate the importance of good retrofit advice,\u201d he says.",
      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",
      "He suggests that neighbourhood-scale schemes, for example to provide solar power to a whole street, might make more sense and could include more people in one go.",

    "summary": "Its record price is making headlines - but that's just one part of the cryptocurrency's tumultuous story.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has helped push the price of Bitcoin to a series of record highs.",
      "Backers of the digital currency are celebrating, and wondering how much more valuable it could become - with some suggesting it could reach $100,000 per coin.",
      "Its price is rocketing because the president-elect has vowed to make the US \"the crypto capital of the planet\" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a \"scam.\"",
      "He even started accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as donations to his election campaign and raised millions from the industry.",
      "But that is just one of the many twists and turns in the jaw-dropping story of Bitcoin, which continues to captivate people worldwide and has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes.",
      "Here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.",
      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

      "Badenoch said Mr Bates vs The Post Office, which was broadcast in January, raised awareness of the issue, turning compensation from \"a value for money perception to a public perception question\".",
      "She insisted work was being done on the issue by the previous government, but admitted it was \"too slow\" and criticised the whole \"government machine\" for slowing down compensation.",
      "The inquiry heard how Badenoch told the Treasury she wanted to give \u00a3100,000 \"flat offers\" to all sub-postmasters with a claim, with the inquiry to the counsel Jason Beer KC describing her mention of \"ministerial direction\" as a threat.",

      "In a landmark case with two other claimants, the Court of Appeal ruled in October that the finance company should pay the hidden commission plus interest back to Mr Johnson, and he is now due to receive just over \u00a33,200.",

      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car.\"",

      "\"And for companies to be able to be allowed to charge these ridiculous amounts of commission without disclosing it, without me being made aware of it at all, myself and thousands of other people.\"",
      "Mr Johnson bought the car from dealership Trade Centre Wales for \u00a34,600, and the company arranged finance with Cardiff-based MotoNovo Finance.",
      "He was not informed that the dealership was receiving commission of \u00a31,650, which amounted to about 25% of the total he borrowed.",
      "The car finance industry is now setting aside huge amounts of money to settle similar possible claims in the future.",
      "How can you claim?",
      "It is important to log your claim as soon as possible, according to Martin Lewis of Money Saving Expert.",
      "He said claimants did not necessarily need to go via a claims management firm, which would take a cut of any payout.",
      "Mr Lewis advised people first determine whether their finance agreements included a discretionary commission arrangement and, if it did, lodge a time-stamped complaint to the company.",
      "This was echoed by Rip-Off Britain's legal expert Gary Rycroft, who told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast the legal precedent set by the Court of Appeal ruling meant \"secret commission\" was deemed unlawful.",
      "He said it was important to check your contracts and ask your car finance company whether it had been disclosed if unsure.",
      "He said non-disclosure made for a clearer case but arrangements \"buried in the small print\" could still be worth making a claim against.",

      "\u201cWith paying off the agreement for three years, I had only scratched the surface,\" he said.",
      "Dealerships were not acting outside of the rules and regulations of the industry by taking this sort of commission at that time, but they had a duty to inform their clients.",
      "The court of appeal said \u201cburying such a statement in the small print which the lender knows the borrower is highly unlikely to read will not suffice\u201d.",
      "There have been changes in the rules governing commission since 2021, when the Financial Conduct Authority banned discretionary commission arrangements.",

      "\"There was only a vague reference to this arrangement in the paperwork which the court of appeal found was buried.",
      "\"As such it meant that Marcus paid more than he necessarily needed to.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 06:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Technology differences mean meters in northern England and Scotland may not work properly, energy firm body admits.",
    "story": [
      "The way smart energy meters work in northern England and Scotland is causing issues for customers, BBC Panorama has been told.",
      "The body that represents energy companies, Energy UK, has confirmed for the first time there is a regional divide - because of the way meters send usage data back to suppliers.",
      "The technology used in the north of Great Britain can affect whether smart meters work properly - and could leave customers having to submit manual readings and receiving estimated bills.",
      "The issues have also been confirmed by meter engineers who have spoken to the BBC.",
      "In the Midlands, Wales and southern England, all meters use cellular technology - similar to mobile phones - to send data to energy providers.",
      "But in northern England and Scotland, meters instead rely on longer-range radio frequencies.",
      "It is a legal requirement, the government says, for suppliers to make sure smart meters are working and it expects suppliers to \u201cresolve all issues at a much faster pace\u201d.",
      "The mass roll-out of smart meters began 12 years ago, with the goal of helping people save money on their bills, while lowering carbon emissions as part of the government\u2019s net zero plan.",
      "By showing how much energy households are using, and how much it is costing, meters are intended to encourage people to use more energy at times of day when it is cheaper - because there is a surplus while most are in bed and factories are closed.",
      "As more energy comes from renewable sources, smart meters will form a vital part of a \u201csmart grid\u201d, allowing consumers\u2019 demand for energy to match the available supply, minute-by-minute.",
      "The cost of installing smart meters across Great Britain is estimated to be \u00a313.5bn, according to the government. There are 36 million such devices in England, Wales and Scotland - but recent government figures show 3.5 million of them are not working properly.",
      "As a rule of thumb, smart meters in the northern region designed to connect to the radio signal have two small indicator lights on the communications hub, fitted to the top of the smart meter. The hubs fitted to smart meters in central and southern regions, receiving the cellular signal, usually have five of these indicator lights.",
      "Northern Ireland\u2019s energy market is separate with its own rules and regulator - and a consultation on a proposed smart meter roll-out is taking place.",
      "Hartesh Battu, a doctor from Glasgow, has had six different smart meters, fitted by two energy suppliers, none of which have worked. \u201cI just think it\u2019s astonishingly bad in terms of the technology,\u201d he told us. \u201cI do feel like, \u2018how could billions of pounds be spent on something so bad?\u2019\u201d",
      "He told the BBC he had wanted a smart meter so he could save energy on his bills and take advantage of a night-time rate that would make it cheaper to charge his electric car.",
      "His current energy supplier, Octopus Energy, told him the problem was down to signal issues in the area and may be because he lived \u201cfar up north\u201d - reasoning that left him feeling deeply unimpressed. \u201cI just thought that was a bit bonkers because I live in Glasgow, I\u2019m hardly up in Shetland, I\u2019m not rural at all.\u201d",
      "When the mass roll-out started, the decision to use radio signals across northern England and Scotland - rather than the mobile technology further south - was because it was thought the signals would be able to travel far across the hills and mountains, reaching more rural communities more easily.",
      "But Energy UK admits there are problems regarding how the radio signals transmit. \u201cThere are issues in the north,\u201d chief executive Dhara Vyas told us.",
      "She said there were \u201clive conversations\u201d within the industry about increasing the network range in the north of England and Scotland.",
      "This technological divide has been experienced by smart meter engineers who have spoken anonymously to Panorama.",
      "One engineer, \u201cAhmed\u201d told us there were more problems in northern England and Scotland on average, adding that the technology further south was more up to date.",
      "\u201cYou can end up going to someone\u2019s house at the bottom of a mountain in the north and the radio frequency can\u2019t get through. But there could be a good 3G signal nearby and that could get through - the customer doesn\u2019t know that,\u201d he said.",
      "Another engineer, \u201cSteve\u201d working for a major energy supplier in Merseyside, who has experience of installing meters in homes on both sides of the regional divide, told us it was \u201cfar easier to complete a successful installation\u201d in the south and Midlands where he could use the cellular network.",
      "The truth about smart meters",
      "Smart meters are supposed to make paying our energy bills easier and cheaper. But is that the whole story?",
      "Watch now on BBC iPlayer - or on BBC One on Monday 11 November at 20:00 (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland).",
      "Energy suppliers do not have direct control over the communication network - in both the north and south. Instead it is run by an organisation known as the Data Communications Company (DCC) and is operated by outsourcing company, Capita.",
      "Panorama contacted Dr Battu\u2019s energy supplier, Octopus Energy, about the problems he was having with his meter. The company said the situation was \u201cfrustrating\u201d because government regulations dictated it must use the radio-wave technology to provide a signal to Dr Battu\u2019s meter - and that it was not permitted to access the local 3G signal instead.",
      "However, in what they described as \u201ca highly unusual move\u201d, Octopus told us that it had in fact decided to break the rules and fix his meter by connecting it to the mobile network. It added that \u201cregulation has not moved with technology\u201d.",
      "Capita told the BBC it advised energy suppliers against using alternative technological solutions, because that would mean there was no contractual or consumer protection for the meter user to ensure service was maintained or problems addressed.",
      "It said the network it runs provides 99.3% coverage across Great Britain, adding that it was \u201cfully committed to resolving connection issues\u201d.",
      "In a statement it added: \u201cThe DCC is actively working with government to provide a future-proof 4G technology solution for the whole of Britain.\u201d",
      "Most energy users pay a little bit extra on their bills towards the cost of installing and fixing smart meters. That is supposed to be offset by the savings they could make and the environmental benefits.",
      "Energy suppliers are primarily responsible for funding the communications infrastructure - and, according to the National Audit Office, some or all of these costs are passed on to consumers in bills.",
      "The latest figures show that nine in 10 smart meters are working fine. But a recent survey by Citizens\u2019 Advice suggests one in five households have had to regularly send manual meter readings because their smart meters haven\u2019t worked properly.",
      "The government told Panorama that \u201cwhile over 90% of smart meters are operating normally\u2019\u2019 the number not working properly was \u201cstill too high\u201d and, as a result, \u201cmany households are missing out on cheaper, flexible tariffs\u201d.",
      "It also said that a recent customer experience survey by Ofgem \u201cfound no statistically significant differences\u201d in the proportion of customers reporting that their meter was not sending readings to their suppliers for areas in, or predominantly\u202fin, the north.",
      "Most experts agree smart meters can help to deliver lower bills and lower carbon emissions. But if the tech problems continue, that could put people off having them and undermine the government\u2019s goal of getting them into every home."

      "It is easy to check whether a refund is owed by logging on to the government's Student Loan Company portal, where individual refunds could range from tens of pounds to more than \u00a31,000.",
      "Tom Allingham from Save the Student said for many getting a refund could make a world of difference.",
      "Charlotte Gill is one such former student who was eligible for a refund on her loan payments, to the tune of \u00a368.",

      "There are four reasons people may be eligible for refunds.",
      "The main reason, behind \u00a3146m of the total, is that repayments were taken from people despite them not earning above the annual threshold at which point repayments automatically kick in.",
      "This can happen when someone earns above the monthly threshold which triggers the beginning of loan repayments, due to things like to taking extra shifts, getting a new job or receiving a bonus, but their annual earnings might still fall below the yearly threshold.",
      "Since May, those who fall into this category have been able to use a new service offered by the SLC to request refunds online. In the first six months of the service, 418,000 people have done so.",
      "Other reasons may be that former students are charged repayments before they are required to pay, which is generally in the April after they finish studying.",
      "Some people may have been put on the wrong payment plans by their employer, while others may have continued making payments after their loan had been paid off in full.",
      "Any money overpaid does count towards the full repayment of the loan, and may save graduates money in the long run on interest.",
      "However, as Mr Allingham said, many university graduates may need the cash for their day-to-day expenses.",
      "\"It is definitely worth doing, particularly even with the cost of living crisis still lingering on a little bit, having that extra boost of cash right now could make a world of difference,\" Mr Allingham said.",

    "story": [
      "They\u2019re all over your TikTok and Instagram \u2013 people unboxing the latest extravagant beauty advent calendar.",
      "Influencers excitedly wonder what eyeliner, serum or hand cream will be behind door one, and gush over the beautiful box it has come in.",
      "But are these products, which can cost hundreds of pounds, actually worth the money?",
      "Yes, says TikToker Cissy Jones from Manchester.",
      "We\u2019re just over a week into November and the 27-year-old, who is a social media manager at fashion brand PrettyLittleThing but also makes TikToks on her personal account, has already posted a dozen advent calendar videos. Everything from chocolate, to beauty products and wine, and even a Pets At Home calendar for her dog.",
      "\"There\u2019s one - the Harrods 12-day one \u2013 where every product in it is something that I would buy,\" she says. \"So I\u2019m saving money.\"",
      "That idea of saving money is something that brands latch on to with their marketing. A calendar may cost \u00a3250 but it\u2019s actually \"worth \u00a31,000\", they say, if you add up all the individual items.",
      "\"But you do have to want the actual products,\" says Cissy. \"Otherwise, it\u2019s a bit of a waste of money.\"",
      "Retailers can afford to make such seemingly good offers because there\u2019s a lot of margin built into beauty products, analysts say.",
      "And rather than aiming to make a big profit on them, they view advent calendars as a marketing tool to get you to buy more products afterwards.",
      "\"A lot of retailers recognise advent calendars are a great way of getting new products to the consumer and a way to get them to convert,\" says Natalie Berg from NBK Retail.",
      "However, Sarah Johnson from Flourish Retail says that while there are many lovely bespoke calendars out there, \"a lot [of companies] just use advent calendars to shift stock that may not be popular, rather than having to discount it\".",
      "Shoppers warned over luxury advent calendar scams",
      "The size of the items in advent calendars can vary \u2013 with some offering full-sized bottles, some smaller versions, and some a mix of the two.",
      "But smaller sizes may be what people want, says Ms Berg, as it's common to want to try something out before fully committing.",
      "Holly May Arnott agrees. \"They\u2019re a fantastic way to try new and trending products that I might have seen previously on social media,\" she says.",
      "The 26-year-old has been buying beauty calendars for several years now. It's something she and her mum do together.",
      "\"It\u2019s like prolonging that Christmas morning thrill,\" she says, adding a sense of excitement throughout December.",
      "The most expensive one she's bought was from Selfridges, which was \"such a luxury\".",
      "But she says while beauty calendars \"can feel like a bit of an investment, they\u2019re worth it for us\".",
      "With so many products out there, Cissy Jones\u2019s advice is to look for a brand you like and to look for value for money, in terms of the total cost of all the items individually versus the price of the calendar.",
      "However, even if a product may seem like good value for money, for some, spending more than \u00a3200 on an advent calendar is simply a luxury they cannot afford.",
      "As a result, many scam websites have sprung up, trying to take advantage of people looking for a good deal on an expensive item.",
      "Emma Jones and Nihal, who did not want us to use her last name, got in touch with the BBC after falling for fake adverts claiming to sell the Space NK \u00a3250 advent calendar for \u00a328.99. Both women were attracted by the apparent discount, and say they would not pay full price.",
      "\"I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable spending that amount of money, mainly because I wouldn\u2019t have that amount of spare cash,\" says Emma.",
      "\"They can be very expensive \u2013 I\u2019m not the type that would pay full price,\" Nihal says.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. If you\u2019re going to use every single product then maybe yes. But sometimes in these prepacked stuff, you\u2019ll probably only use two or three of these products.\"",
      "But part of the reason beauty advent calendars are so popular is because shoppers still want to treat themselves, says Natalie Berg.",
      "And many are willing to pay full price \u2013 and beyond.",
      "The likes of Space NK, Harrods and Sephora have all sold out of their main calendars already.",
      "The Harrods beauty calendar was priced at \u00a3250 but claimed to include items worth \u00a31,600, while Sephora\u2019s \u00a3199 calendar said it included items worth \u00a31,000.",
      "But you can find people selling them on eBay, asking for as much as \u00a3550 for the Harrods one and \u00a3399 for the Sephora one.",
      "\"It goes back to supply and demand - dynamic pricing,\" says Sarah Johnson.",
      "It might make sense to buy it even at an overinflated price, she says, if the retailer is sold out and you can\u2019t get it anywhere else, especially if you perceive it as still making a saving on the total value of all the items.",
      "This begs the question though of why firms don't just make more.",
      "Ms Johnson points out that it's a seasonal product and they don't want to over-order and be left with surplus stock that they would then have to discount.",
      "Space NK told the BBC that it produced 30% more stock this year than last year but due to \"unprecedented\" demand still sold out within two and a half weeks. It plans to increase production next year.",
      "Despite the expensive nature of beauty calendars, Ms Johnson says there is a \"value perception\" there.",
      "\"People could buy it to break it out and give [individual items] as gifts. There\u2019s an element of people treating themselves and also being quite savvy and saving themselves money in the long run.\"",
      "With more and more of these calendars on sale now, there was a thought a few years ago that we might have reached \"peak\" advent calendar.",
      "But Cissy Jones disagrees \u2013 and thinks the opposite is the case.",
      "\"They always sell out every year, so I feel like there\u2019s room for more.\""

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:03:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Big mining firms are switching to driverless trucks and other autonomous equipment.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

    "summary": "Deputy PM admits former Soviet state was until recently a 'highly corrupt country' - but insists things are changing fast.",
    "story": [
      "The Eastern European country of Moldova is continuing efforts to attract overseas firms, as it tries to move past political uncertainty.",
      "\"I went with a backpack, and set up a business,\" says Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, recalling how he moved to Moldova in 2007.",
      "Mr Vocks had first visited the former Soviet republic three years earlier, and recalls experiencing \"the clich\u00e9 that one would have of Eastern Europe at that time\".",
      "\"Everything was dirt cheap, and if you were a foreigner you'd get attention,\" he says.",
      "Today, Mr Vocks is the owner of a Moldovan company called DevelopmentAid. Based in the capital Chisinau, it employs 180 people in the country, and runs a website that lists job vacancies in the international development community.",
      "Mr Vocks is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs in Moldova. The government wants to attract more like him and hopes that low business tax rates will help.",
      "The country's standard corporation tax rate - the amount that firms have to pay on their profits - is just 12%. This compares with 25% in the UK, and 25.8% in the Netherlands where Mr Vocks had initially launched his company before relocating it to Moldova.",
      "There's an even better deal for tech firms. In 2018 the Moldovan government launched an initiative to grow the country's IT sector - the Moldova IT Park (MITP).",
      "This isn't a physical business park. Instead it is virtual scheme open to all IT firms in the country - and those that wish to move there from overseas. Firms that sign up only have to pay a corporation tax rate of 7%.",
      "The MITP is part of a wider effort by the Moldovan government to modernise and expand its economy ahead of a bid to join the European Union in 2030.",
      "This drive is being led by Moldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu, who this week was re-elected for a second term. And last month Moldovans voted \"yes\" on pro-EU constitutional changes.",
      "However, the vote was extremely close, with Yes getting 50.46% and No receiving 49.54%. Although Russia denied interfering in the vote, Moldova\u2019s authorities said attempts had been made to buy up to 300,000 votes in what Maia Sandu described as an \"unprecedented assault on freedom and democracy\".",
      "Moscow is opposed to Moldova joining the EU, and supports Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria economically, politically and militarily.",
      "Dumitru Alaiba, Moldova's deputy prime minister and minister for economic development and digitalisation, is positive about where Moldova is heading.",
      "\"Moldova in the past 10 to 15 years has really proven that it's a country that can change very fast,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This used to be a highly corrupt country, a country where, exactly 10 years ago, a billion dollars from our central banks just disappeared.\"",
      "\"We are moving very fast towards joining the EU, and we are reforming our economy at top speed. Of course, we have a long way to go.\"",
      "He pointed to Moldova's rise on the global Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International.",
      "Out of 180 countries - with a lower placing meaning that a country is less corrupt - Moldova is now in 76th place, up from 91st a year earlier.",
      "\"Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.\"",
      "Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.",
      "\"Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.",
      "\"It was painful intersecting with the tax agency. The banks were rough to work with.\"",
      "Member companies of the MITP don't just benefit from the 7% corporation tax rate. They also don't need to make employer social security contributions, and staff don't have to pay income tax. Mr Volks signed up DevelopmentAid almost immediately.",
      "The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.",
      "More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.",
      "In the first half of 2024, MITP firms generated a combined \u20ac365m ($397m; \u00a3308m) in revenues, according to official figures. And now employing 22,000 people in general, they are said to contribute around 6% of the country's GDP.",
      "While the MITP scheme has worked to boost Moldova's IT sector, the influx of foreign tech companies has driven up salaries in the industry considerably.",
      "Sven Wiese, a German expat who has set up a small IT services business in the country called Trabia, says he is now finding himself priced out when it comes to employee pay.",
      "He says that the biggest firms signed up to the MITP can offer IT specialists more than \u20ac100,000 a year, \"because that is still cheaper than hiring people within a bigger country like the US or Germany\".",
      "At the same time he says that many Moldovan IT sector workers still want to leave the country. \"Fewer people are now leaving Moldova, but emigration is still high.\"",
      "Another negative issue is the continuing war in neighbouring Ukraine, which is likely making some Western IT firms think twice about investing in Moldova. Mr Alaiba says is confident that Moldova is safe \"as long as the free world is supporting Ukraine\".",
      "Marina Bzovii, MITP's administrator and an assistant professor at the Technical University of Moldova, already sees Moldova as a regional business hub. \"Moldova is connecting even Central Asia, countries like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who are culturally much further from Europe.",

      "This pedigree helped him become a mainstay pundit on the BBC and Match of the Day. He also formed a strong trio with Lineker and Richards, first on the BBC's Match of the Day podcast and latterly The Rest is Football - produced independently on Lineker's hugely successful Goalhanger podcast company. These have allowed him to show off more of his personality.",
      "Now almost 20 years into his media career, Shearer is however yet to host a show - could that step up to becoming Match of the day anchor finally be on the horizon?",
      "Micah Richards",
      "The ex-Manchester City and England defender burst onto the footballing scene as a teenager, but, after an on-pitch career curtailed by a knee injury, Richards has blossomed as the ever-animated pundit with a mega-watt personality to boot.",
      "He embodies the modern take on the role, engaging viewers not only with analysis but also fun-loving camaraderie shared between analysts and presenter.",
      "His media career blossomed as a jovial foil to the tough-talking, former Manchester United captain Roy Keane on Sky Sports' Super Sunday.",
      "Similar roles have followed on Match of the Day and for CBS' Champions League coverage - where humorous off-script moments between presenter Abdo, Richards himself and Premier League legends Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry regularly trend on social media.",
      "Asking Richards to make the step up to presenting duties on a show as prestigious as Match of the Day would represent a risk from bosses, but certainly mark a fresh start and shift in tone.",
      "He also has the backing of Lineker, who, when discussing the speculation over his future on The Rest is Football, told Richards: \"I'd love to see you take over. I think you'd be brilliant in the chair.\"",
      "Colin Murray",
      "Beginning his career in music as a fun-loving, noughties upstart on BBC Radio 1, Colin Murray soon moved into sport broadcasting.",
      "The Northern Irishman balanced hosting BBC Radio 5 Live's raucous sport comedy panel show Fighting Talk with anchoring European football on Channel 5, before moving to precede Mark Chapman in the hot seat on Match of the Day 2.",
      "But Murray chose to leave that role in 2013, as he had an offer to join TalkSport radio. He has continued to work at the BBC however, presenting  various shows on 5 Live, along with becoming host of Channel 4's long-running word show, Countdown.",
      "Murray is certainly a tried, tested and trusted football anchor with appeal spanning all age groups.",
      "Dan Walker",
      "Prior to quitting the BBC for Channel 5 in 2022, Dan Walker shared his high-profile  BBC Breakfast presenting role with 12 years as the host of Football Focus.",
      "Walker would offer bosses a clean cut image and a safe pair of hands were he to take the role, having previously also covered Olympics and football World Cups for the BBC. He has also recently covered games for Amazon Prime.",
      "But questions remain over Walker's own interest - he is on a bumper contract at Channel 5 and has persistently batted away suggestions of a return to the BBC.",
      "Laura Woods",
      "Laura Woods made her name on TalkSport, receiving plaudits for her relatable style as a host and interviewer.",
      "She has since stepped up to become lead presenter for TNT Sports' Champions League coverage, replacing Jake Humphrey when the channel rebranded from BT Sport last year.",
      "Woods also presents football on Amazon Prime and ITV - joining the latter for coverage of this summer's Euros.",
      "Earlier this summer she spoke of receiving \"numerous death threats\" online after commenting on an article questioning the eligibility of Olympic champion boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting.",
      "Woods fits the mould of Scott and Richards in bringing a more personality-led style to her broadcasting.",
      "Jake Humphrey",
      "Humphrey is a vastly experienced sports broadcaster, with a catalogue of BBC experience to draw upon prior to his later career exploits.",
      "After an early career on BBC children's TV, by 2006 he had started working with BBC Sport, presenting Formula 1, Football Focus, Final Score and becoming the youngest ever host in Match of the Day's history.",
      "Since stepping back from BT Sport, Humphrey has focused on his successful High-Performance podcast, exploring the lives of high-achieving individuals. However, Humphrey remains a fan of Match of the Day, previously telling The Express he would \"never say never\" to hosting the \"legendary show\".",
      "Kelly Cates",
      "An experienced anchor across radio and TV, football is Cates' life-blood, quite literally - she is the daughter of Liverpool and Scotland legend Kenny Dalglish.",
      "The broadcaster has hosted BBC Radio 5 Live's 606 football phone-in and, more recently, the station's Football Daily podcast, in amongst numerous other roles at major tournaments.",
      "But she is best-known in front of the camera as part of the presenting roster for Sky Sports' Premier League coverage - including its flagship Super Sunday programme.",
      "Cates, like Logan, brings both pedigree and gender diversity - but it remains to be seen if she could be tempted away from Sky.",
      "Correction 12 November 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly suggested that Colin Murray left the BBC over a controversy on Fighting Talk. It has been amended to make clear he left to take a presenting job at Talk Sport Radio."

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:22:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Echoes of Wisdom was the first adventure for the princess at the heart of one of Nintendo's biggest series.",
    "story": [
      "Princess Zelda is one of Nintendo's best-known characters, but she'd never starred in one of its games until this year.",
      "Despite lending her name to the Legend of Zelda series, she'd always played a supporting role behind regular hero Link.",
      "That all changed with Echoes of Wisdom, released a few weeks ago.",
      "BBC Newsbeat caught up with series producer Eiji Aonuma and the game's directors, Tomomi Sano and Satoshi Terada, to find out about making the game and their reaction to its launch.",
      "A nervous reveal",
      "Echoes of Wisdom was a complete surprise when it was announced at the Nintendo Direct showcase in June.",
      "Fans were quick to realise the significance of a game starring the princess as the main character.",
      "But it also introduced a new play style for the series.",
      "Rather than being equipped with a sword and shield, as in previous Legend of Zelda games, the main character has the ability to copy items and enemies found during their quest.",
      "Known as echoes, these items can then be spawned or \"pasted\" into the world, allowing players to come up with solutions to obstacles and puzzles.",
      "You might stack beds and boxes to scale a wall, or unleash several enemies to attack one of the game's bosses.",
      "Series producer Aonuma acknowledges \"a lot of the focus of the topic of conversation was going to be on Zelda being the main protagonist\".",
      "But, he says, a bigger concern for him was \"whether or not the unique gameplay of the echoes was going to be conveyed properly and understood properly by the viewers\".",
      "It's a feeling shared by directors Terada and Sano.",
      "\"Whether or not the Zelda fans would accept these new elements was something I was watching over nervously,\" says Terada, chief of third-party co-developer Grezzo.",
      "Sano says she was \"relieved to see that it was being accepted positively, and was really watching closely over my smartphone to see people's reactions the following day as well\".",
      "Getting used to a new Zelda",
      "Since getting their hands on the new game, some players have reported taking a while to get to grips with the new system.",
      "Aonuma, who says he completed Echoes of Wisdom eight times during its development, admits that he had similar feelings on his first playthrough.",
      "\"From the second time through I sort of realised that there's various ways and methods of overcoming these puzzles and overcoming the challenges,\" he says.",
      "Aonuma says experimenting with different methods helped him to change his experience.",
      "\"And so I think that realisation that you can do various things and there are various ways to overcome and solve these puzzles is sort of a turning point of whether you become used to using the echoes in the new game system.\"",
      "They do watch your videos",
      "Recent Zelda games have given players much more room to be creative and test the limits of what they can do, with some sharing the results online.",
      "Last year's Tears of the Kingdom, for example, allowed players to build strange contraptions and led to memorable creations such as a giant robotic Godzilla.",
      "Terada says that the team spent a lot of time testing Echoes of Wisdom's various combinations, but even they were surprised once people got their hands on it.",
      "\"Seeing how players are using it, I was really amazed at people's imaginations,\" he says.",
      "The developers admit they were impressed by one trick that's been widely shared, of players combining a bed with a tornado to propel Zelda into the air.",
      "\"That was one that we hadn't thought of,\" Terada admits.",
      "Sano adds: \"Players were using the tornado and the bed to actually climb and go over mountains.",
      "\"And this was something that I was amazed by, something that I probably wouldn't be able to do.\"",
      "Responding to criticisms",
      "Echoes of Wisdoms received positive reviews upon its release, with the majority of critics praising the game for the sense of freedom it gave players.",
      "But there were a few common criticisms.",
      "One of the main ones was about the game's performance on the Switch console, which was released back in 2017.",
      "Many players said the game's frame rate - which governs the smoothness of on-screen animations - was unstable.\ufeff",
      "Sano confirmed that Echoes of Wisdom uses a variable frame rate, and that the developers felt this was the \"best option\" available.",
      "Players and reviewers also had complaints about the menu system used to select echoes during the game.",
      "Nintendo at 135: Key moments in gaming history",
      "By the end it's possible to have gathered a total of 127, and the main method of selecting them involves scrolling sideways through a very long row of icons.",
      "It can be filtered using options including most used and newest, but many still felt that it could have been more streamlined.",
      "Terada tells Newsbeat the developers wanted to encourage players to experiment.",
      "\"One of the essences of this game is being able to figure out different ways of using each of these echoes,\" he says.",
      "\"And so in that sense we wanted players to fall upon and see the echoes that they may not have noticed or have been using while they're sorting through all the echoes that they have.\"",
      "He also pointed out that there's an alternative notebook method which enables players to access the echoes they've gathered more quickly.",
      "Keeping it old school",
      "Zelda celebrates its 40th anniversary in 2026, and Aonuma says Echoes of Wisdom shares some DNA with the original game in the series.",
      "Aonuma says that he thought it \"might be close to impossible\" to make a new entry adding new elements to the top-down style of earlier Zelda titles.",
      "But, he says: \"I think through this game we were able to satisfy a lot of players.",
      "\"And so this game made me realise that there's still a lot of possibility for these top-down Zelda games as well.\"",
      "The future of Nintendo is currently a topic of speculation among fans, with fans waiting for news on its successor to the Switch.",
      "Aonuma didn't give anything away there, but did share something about his vision for the next instalments of Zelda.",
      "\"And so we will also have those dynamic 3D Zeldas as well,\" he says.",
      "\"But in addition to that, we're also hoping that we can continue with these 2D top-down Zeldas.\"",

      "Gary Lineker, who will leave Match of the Day at the end of this season, BBC News understands, has been the steady hand who guided millions of fans through football's agonies and ecstasies.",
      "As host of the flagship show for 25 years, he is also one of the corporation's highest-profile presenters, earning \u00a31.3 million last year.",
      "His one-line pay-offs at the end of each show, summing up both the fans' mood and the match, may have looked seamless.",
      "But they were the result of years of honing his craft and presenting skills.",
      "As a former footballer of considerable pedigree - including England captain and striker, with 48 goals in 80 appearances - he famously never received a red or yellow card during his career.",
      "His ability to keep his cool on the pitch stood him in good stead for a career in live broadcasting when he retired as a player in 1994.",
      "Even while he was still at school, he had his sights set on sports journalism, deciding it would be his fall-back if football didn't work out.",

      "Gary Lineker to leave BBC's Match of the Day",

      "But while his sports career was at its peak at the 1986 and 1990 World Cup finals, Lineker spent time with journalists staying in the same hotel as the England team.",
      "\"As early as my mid-20s, I knew which direction I wanted to go in when I retired from playing,\" he told the BBC in 2014.",
      "\"I would watch the newspaper guys write their opening paragraphs and sit with the radio journalists and talk to them about how they did their job.\"",
      "His ultimate aim was to end up as the presenter rather than a pundit.",
      "But he admitted his transition into radio and TV \"took a lot of work\".",
      "",
      "His early broadcasting attempts were \"fairly appalling\", he told the BBC's Media Show's Ros Atkins in 2021.",
      "Starting out on Radio 5 Live \"was all part of the learning process\", he said.",
      "\"I managed to stumble my way through it, and I learned from really good people alongside me who were incredibly helpful in the early days.\"",
      "Lineker built on that experience, writing all his own scripts and carving out a role for himself.",
      "Having watched ex-sports stars David Gower presenting the cricket and Sue Barker presenting the tennis, he questioned why it wasn't the same in football.",
      "\u201cI just thought, as a player who\u2019s played right at the top, if I could crack presenting it would give me a niche,\" he told BBC Radio 4 podcast Don't Tell Me the Score in 2019.",
      "\"It would give me an advantage over all the others.\"",
      "Meanwhile, his popularity as a footballer endured. In 1991, Arthur Smith and Chris England wrote a stage play called An Evening With Gary Lineker, about a couple trying to rekindle their marriage during the 1990 World Cup semi-final.",
      "Starring Caroline Quentin, Clive Owen, Paul Merton and Martin Clunes, it was filmed for TV in 1994 - with Lineker making a cameo appearance.",

      "As a presenter, he got himself noticed when he stood in for Des Lynam on the Saturday afternoon sports show Grandstand, in 1997.",
      "By the mid-90s, Lineker was also appearing on Match of the Day as a pundit.",

      "\"Des was very helpful - I used to ask a lot of questions about the little things that he did, and picked up some of his nuances,\" the former footballer said.",
      "\"He told me to be brave occasionally with closing lines, and not to be afraid to try to be amusing.",
      "\"Again, the little pay-offs I sometimes make at the end of the show are something that came from him.\"",

      "Lineker's questions kept the analysis flowing, while he was always willing to share a joke and opinion of his own.",
      "He also memorably introduced the show in his pants in 2016, having pledged to \"do the first MOTD of next season in just my undies\" if his former club Leicester won the Premier League, which they did.",
      "Shearer and Wright couldn't keep straight faces.",
      "Their friendships often shone through. In June this year, Lineker and Shearer sent an emotional message of support to Hansen, after hearing the news that he was seriously ill in hospital.",
      "But despite his rapport with his colleagues, off-screen matters were not as straightforward.",
      "As one of the BBC's highest-paid presenters, regularly topping the list of the staff whose salaries are declared, he faced constant scrutiny.",

      "BBC director general Tim Davie subsequently apologised to licence fee payers for the disruption, calling it a \"difficult day\" for the corporation.",
      "Lineker was reinstated nine days later.",

      "\"I love the BBC. I've been there for nearly 30 years but people make mistakes, they recognise that and they addressed it and in the end, thankfully, we're all back to work,\" he said.",
      "The headlines and dramas generated by his online views reinforced not only his high celebrity status - but also how keen the BBC was to hang on to him.",
      "The incident prompted a review of BBC social media guidelines. Last September, new rules were published for BBC flagship presenters, saying they should be allowed to express views on issues and policies, but stop short of political campaigning.",
      "Lineker said the recommendations were \"all very sensible\".",
      "By February this year, he said he was using X less often, saying the platform had become \"increasingly toxic\" under its new owner, Elon Musk.",
      "Despite this, he and the BBC are still parting company, and its flagship football show no longer has a host.",
      "Lineker has plenty of outside business interests, including the successful podcast production company he co-founded, called Goalhanger.",
      "It produces shows including The Rest Is History, The Rest Is Entertainment and The Rest Is Politics, which won the Champion prize at this year's Podcast Awards.",
      "But for the BBC, Lineker's departure comes hot on the heels of several scandals.",

      "Edwards was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, after he admitted charges of making indecent images of children.",

    "summary": "The South Korean hit drama returns for a second season in December.",
    "story": [
      "When I ask the creator of the hit Korean drama Squid Game about reports that he was so stressed while shooting the first series he lost six teeth, he quickly corrects me. \u201cIt was eight or nine,\u201d he laughs.",
      "Hwang Dong-hyuk is speaking to me on set as he films the second series of his dystopian Netflix thriller, which sees hundreds of debt-laden contestants fight it out for a whopping cash prize, by playing a string of life-or-death children\u2019s games.",
      "But another series was not always on the cards. At one point, he swore against making one.",
      "Given the stress it has caused him, I ask what changed his mind.",
      "\u201cMoney,\u201d he answers, without hesitation.",
      "\u201cEven though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn\u2019t make much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t fully finish the story,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first series was Netflix\u2019s most successful show to date, thrusting South Korea and its home-grown television dramas into the spotlight. Its dark commentary on wealth inequality touched a nerve with audiences around the globe.",
      "But having killed off almost every character, Hwang has had to start from scratch, with a new cast and set of games, and this time audience expectations are sky high.",
      "\u201cThe stress I feel now is much greater,\u201d he says.",
      "Three years after the first series aired, Hwang is even more pessimistic about the state of the world.",
      "He points to current wars, climate change and a widening global wealth gap. Conflicts are no longer confined between the rich and poor, they are playing out intensely between different generations, genders and political camps, he says.",
      "\u201cNew lines are being drawn. We\u2019re in an era of us vs them. Who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong?\u201d",
      "As I toured the show\u2019s playful set, with its distinctive brightly-coloured staircase, I picked up a few clues as to how the director\u2019s despair will be reflected this time around.",
      "In this series, the previous winner, Gi-hun, re-enters the game on a quest to bring it down and save the latest round of contestants.",
      "According to Lee Jung-jae, who plays the leading character, he is \"more desperate and determined\u201d than before.",
      "The floor of the dormitory, where the contestants sleep at night, has been divided in two.",
      "One half is branded with a giant red neon X symbol, the other with a blue circle.",
      "Now, after every game, the players must pick a side, depending on whether they want to end the contest early and survive, or keep playing, in the knowledge all but one of them will die. The majority decision rules.",
      "This, I am told, will lead to more factionalism and fights.",
      "It is part of director Hwang\u2019s plan to expose the dangers of living in an increasingly tribal world. Forcing people to pick sides, he believes, is fuelling conflict.",
      "For all those who were captivated by the shocking storytelling of Squid Game, there were others who found it gratuitously violent and difficult to watch.",
      "But it is clear from talking to Hwang, that the violence is fully thought out. He is a man who thinks and cares deeply about the world and is motivated by a mounting unease.",
      "\u201cWhen making this series, I constantly asked myself \u2018do we humans have what it takes to steer the world off this downhill path?\u2019. Honestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says.",
      "While viewers of the second series might not get the answers to these big life questions, they can at least be comforted that some plot holes will be filled in \u2013 like why the game exists, and what is motivating the masked Front Man running it.",
      "\u201cPeople will see more of the Front Man\u2019s past, his story and his emotions,\u201d reveals the actor Lee Byung-hun, who plays the mysterious role.",
      "\u201cI don't think this will make viewers warm to him, but it may help them better understand his choices.\u201d",
      "As one of South Korea\u2019s most famous actors, Lee admits that having his face and eyes covered and his voice distorted throughout the first series, was \u201ca little bit dissatisfying\u201d.",
      "This series he has relished having scenes without a mask, in which he can fully express himself \u2013 a chance he nearly did not get.",
      "Hwang tried for 10 years to get Squid Game made, taking out large loans to support his family, before Netflix swooped in.",
      "They paid him a modest upfront amount, leaving him unable to cash in on the whopping \u00a3650m it is estimated to have made the platform.",
      "This explains the love-hate relationship South Korea\u2019s film and television creators currently have with international streaming platforms.",
      "Over the past few years, Netflix has stormed the Korean market with billions of dollars of investment, bringing the industry global recognition and love, but leaving creators feeling short-changed.",
      "They accuse the platform of forcing them to relinquish their copyright when they sign contracts \u2013 and with it, their claim to profit.",
      "This is a worldwide problem.",
      "In the past, creators could rely on getting a cut of box office sales or TV re-runs, but this model has not been adopted by streaming giants.",
      "The issue is compounded in South Korea, creators say, due to its outdated copyright law, which does not protect them.",
      "This summer, actors, writers, directors and producers teamed up to form a collective, to fight the system together.",
      "\u201cIn Korea, being a movie director is just a job title, it\u2019s not a way to earn a living,\u201d the vice-president of the Korean Film Directors Guild, Oh Ki-hwan, tells the audience at an event in Seoul.",
      "Some of his director friends, he says, work part-time in warehouses and as taxi drivers.",
      "Park Hae-young is a writer at the event. When Netflix bought her show, 'My Liberation Notes', it became a global hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been writing my whole life. So, to get global recognition when competing with creators from across the world, has been a joyful experience,\u201d she tells me.",
      "But Park says the current streaming model has left her reluctant to \u201cpour her all\u201d into her next series.",
      "\u201cUsually, I\u2019ll spend four or five years making a drama in the belief that, if it's successful, it could somewhat secure my future, that I'll get my fair share of compensation. Without that, what's the point of working so hard?\u201d",
      "She and other creators are pushing the South Korean government to change its copyright law to force production companies to share their profits.",
      "In a statement, the South Korean government told the BBC that while it recognised the compensation system needed to change, it was up to the industry to resolve the issue. A spokesperson for Netflix told us it offers \u201ccompetitive\u201d compensation, and guarantees creators \u201csolid compensation, regardless of the success or failure of their shows\u201d.",
      "Squid Game\u2019s Hwang hopes his candor over his own pay struggles will initiate that change.",
      "He has certainly sparked the fair pay conversation, and this second series will surely give the industry another bump.",
      "But when we catch up after filming has wrapped, he tells me his teeth are aching again.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:39 GMT",
    "summary": "Everything we learned on the red carpet and behind the scenes of the MTV Europe Music Awards.",
    "story": [
      "The MTV Awards came to Manchester for the first time in their 30-year history on Sunday night, but somehow didn't feel very Mancunian.",
      "There was no sign of Take That or Aitch, or Liam Gallagher - even though he won best rock star.",
      "Organisers made a few subtle nods to the city: The stage was framed in the black and yellow stripes of Factory Records, and New Order's Blue Monday pumped through the speakers every time nominees were announced.",
      "But the show took a more global perspective, highlighting acts from Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and America - including a predictable victory for Taylor Swift in the night's two biggest categories, best artist and video of the year.",
      "She only appeared by video, choosing instead to spend the night watching her boyfriend, American Football player Travis Kelce, lead the Kansas City Chiefs to victory against the Denver Broncos.",
      "But there were plenty of other stars at the show and on the red carpet. Here's some of the gossip we picked up along the way.",
      "1) Raye gave an update on her missing song books",
      "Two weeks ago, Raye told fans her second album had been delayed by thieves who stole her car and, with it, several notebooks full of lyrics and song ideas.",
      "On the red carpet, she confirmed the police hadn't been able to track them down, saying: \"I've just had to let it go.\"",
      "The singer said she couldn't recreate a lot of the ideas, because the act of writing them down freed her mind to work on other things.",
      "\"You let it go, because you think you can come back to it - and now there are so many ideas that are just gone. It's so sad.\"",
      "But the singer, who won best UK artist, maintained a positive outlook.",
      "\"Everything happens for a reason. I'll have to start again and maybe it's a blessing in disguise.\"",
      "2) Busta Rhymes revealed his unlikely comedy hero",
      "The decision to bring rap legend Busta Rhymes to Manchester to receive a global icon award wasn't as random as it sounded.",
      "Before he developed his rapid-fire rap delivery, an 11-year-old Rhymes spent two summers living with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe.",
      "\"I went to karate school, and we illegally went into nightclubs, to make a little money break-dancing,\" he told us.",
      "\"I remember Boy George was cool, Wham was cool,\" he continued.",
      "\"But our favourite was Benny Hill. Benny Hill is still our favourite to this day. I don't think anybody has as ever been as funny or as charismatic as Benny Hill.\"",
      "So, during those halcyon days of watching smutty comedy in Morecambe, did he ever think he'd be back, winning a lifetime achievement prize?",
      "\"You can never foresee something like that,\" he said. \"When we first got involved with hip-hop, we didn't do it for none of the accolades. We just did it because we loved it.",
      "\"But with that being said, tonight is a dream come true.\"",
      "To honour that moment, he gave a nine-minute acceptance speech thanking everyone from his mother to an art teacher he'd met backstage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty four years of professionally recording [and] this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels incredible.\"",
      "3) Olly Alexander had advice for next year's Eurovision contestant",
      "Olly Alexander played a pre-show party on Saturday night, and couldn't quite believe the reception for Dizzy - the song which earned him 18th place at this year's Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "\"That went down a lot better than it did in Eurovision,\" he laughed, shortly before Jedward invaded the stage and caused utter chaos.",
      "At the main ceremony, Alexander was there to award song of the year to Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso. But he also had a few words for anyone considering representing the UK at next year's contest.",
      "\"I would say to them, whoever it is, 'Call me, and we will have a serious conversation about it',\" he said with the haunted look of a man who has seen some things.",
      "4) Benson Boone has a new fan: Bez",
      "In addition to winning best new artist, US singer Benson Boone opened the ceremony with a spectacular performance that saw him suspended mid-air on a grand piano, before pulling off a spectacular front flip from a platform at the side of the stage.",
      "\"The insurance is always crazy,\" he laughed, \"but I love to perform.\"",
      "One person who couldn't believe his eyes was Happy Mondays star Bez, who accosted Boone during an interview with Rita Ora.",
      "\"I was so blown away by that performance, mate,\" he told the singer.",
      "\"When you came down on that shiny piano, I thought, 'Elton John is going to be so gutted.'\"",
      "5) Le Sserafim escaped to Manchester's Christmas market",
      "Manchester is home to the UK's biggest K-Pop shop and, on Sunday morning, the staff couldn't quite believe one of the genre's biggest girl bands had landed in their city.",
      "\"Le Sserafim were posting pictures from the Christmas market,\" one of them told me. \"That's only five minutes from here!\"",
      "The five-piece, who've been setting chart records over in the US, jetted in for their first-ever UK performance, a mash-up of Chasing Lightning and the 90s house banger Crazy.",
      "But they were more excited to be out on the town without being mobbed.",
      "\"It was so good, we had baklava!\" enthused singer Huh Yun-Jin; while her bandmate Sakura tucked into a portion of fish and chips.",
      "\"It was my first time,\" she said. \"I loved it.\"",
      "On stage at the EMAs, the band got one of the biggest screams of the night, despite being relatively unknown in the UK... for now.",
      "\"Coming to Europe is something that we've always dreamt of, so this is absolutely surreal,\" said Yun-Jin. \"We just want to make a good impression.\"",
      "Mission accomplished.",
      "6) Jedward spent two hours on the red carpet",
      "For absolutely no reason at all, Jedward went on a massive charm offensive for the international press.",
      "\"Oasis are back and Jedward are back!\" they declared, before racing over to baffled German and French journalists, while singing Stop Crying Your Heart Out.",
      "This went on for two deliriously brilliant hours, as the twins, who found fame on The X Factor 15 years ago, insisted that \"a lot of artists have been inspired by Jedward\".",
      "And, to be fair, they have proof. Mercury Prize nominee CMAT recently said the brothers had encouraged her to finish her second album, with a motivational voice message.",
      "\"You have to think about it, in life,\" explained John.",
      "\"Don't always think you're the main character. Reach out to other people. Serve that tennis ball and see what they do.\"",
      "\"It's always about keeping that spark alive,\" added Edward. \"We're like a support animal for all the artists.\"",
      "They were, to be honest, an absolute blast.",
      "7) The Liam Payne tribute was perfectly judged",
      "Liam Payne won 12 MTV EMAs during his time in One Direction, and later used the ceremony to launch his solo career, performing his global smash hit Strip That Down at the 2017 ceremony.",
      "It was only fitting that the event marked his death - but striking the right tone in the middle of a huge showbiz event is never easy.",
      "In the end, his friend and collaborator Rita Ora just spoke from the heart.",
      "\"There were so many ways that we were talking about honouring him,\" she said. \"But sometimes simply speaking is enough.\"",
      "Addressing the camera directly, she shared her memories of the 31-year-old, as her voice cracked.",
      "\"Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew,\" she said. \"He brought so much joy to every room he walked into. And he left such a mark on this world.\"",
      "It was sombre and restrained, yet powerfully emotional. Ora wasn't the only one crying.",
      "8) Tyla paid tribute to Aaliyah",
      "South African star Tyla, best known for her viral hit Water, clinched both the best R&B and best Afrobeats awards.",
      "The awards marked her continued ascent, after being named one of the BBC's Sounds of 2024 - but she made sure to honour her inspirations.",
      "On the red carpet, she rocked a vintage Roberto Cavalli dress with a turquoise blue zebra print.",
      "The exact same dress had previously been worn by US rapper Eve at the 2000 Soul Train Awards.",
      "And R&B legend Aaliyah wore a canary yellow version at the 2000 MTV Awards, where she won best female video for Try Again.",
      "The ceremony took place in September 2000, less than a year before Aaliyah's tragic death in an plane accident.",
      "The singer was just 22 at the time - the same age that Tyla is now."

    "story": [
      "I can feel the anger rising. How am I facing this abuse again after 20 years?",
      "My name is Alex. But increasingly young people shout \u201cTimmy\u201d at me in the street. This isn\u2019t mistaken identity - it\u2018s mockery because I use a wheelchair.",
      "I should ignore it, but this time, I react. I turn to see a group of young teenage boys smirking in front of me. \u201cI heard you,\u201d I tell them. \u201cI know exactly who Timmy is.\u201d",
      "I know this because although we do not share a name, I have felt the shadow of Timmy since childhood - never through choice.",
      "A disabled character from dark-humoured satire cartoon series South Park, he uses a wheelchair and can only shout his name, mainly loudly and uncontrollably.",
      "Growing up at the show\u2019s initial peak during the turn of the millennium, Timmy followed me through school corridors, classrooms and playgrounds - no matter my friends, sociability or relatively good grades.",
      "Now, in my 30s, he\u2019s back. For the third time in a year, this time heading to my local train station in my wheelchair, I hear the familiar, brutish drawl: \u201cTimmaaah.\u201d",
      "A laugh. A snigger. An assumption I either won\u2019t hear or be unable to understand.",
      "When I confront the group of boys, one feigns innocence, claiming he\u2019d been speaking to his friend.",
      "\u201cYou weren\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cI was watching the show before you were born.\u201d",
      "Initially I was baffled as to how this phenomenon had returned to a new young generation, 24 years after the character first appeared.",
      "The answer lies in social media, particularly TikTok, where hundreds of short user-edited clips of Timmy and audio of him saying his name are sparking the revival.",
      "TikTok users often take part in trends by using the audio of popular videos and overlaying it with their own clips.",
      "That\u2019s what many have done with Timmy, where the name is used as a punchline, or played on top of unrelated clips of wheelchair users, reinforcing harmful and dehumanising stereotypes.",
      "The irony is that the character Timmy is presented with warmth in South Park and given character depth by co-creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.",
      "An equal in the show\u2019s unflinching satire, his disability isn\u2019t necessarily the butt of the joke.",
      "Timmy is an accepted member of the class: he fails to complete homework, faces adversity and causes trouble with his disabled best friend Jimmy. His personality is conveyed through the different intonations in which he delivers his name.",
      "One episode, Timmy 2000, sees him win a battle of the bands as frontman for a metal group. The adult characters are shown to respond in an over-protective and condescending way - a striking criticism of the way society often treats disabled people.",
      "Nearly 20 years ago, a poll by Ouch! - the former name of the BBC\u2019s disability section - crowned Timmy as the most popular disabled TV character.",
      "Seattle Times\u2019 late disabled critic Jeff Shannon described Timmy as the most \u201cprogressive, provocative and socially relevant disability humour ever presented on American television\u201d.",
      "\u201cWithout telling viewers what to think, South Park challenges [the audience\u2019s] own fears and foibles regarding disability, and Timmy emerges triumphant,\u201d he wrote in 2005.",
      "In interviews Stone and Parker have spoken of how carefully and purposefully they integrated him into the show.",
      "But two decades later, the fact remains that on meeting Timmy, certainly at first glance, many find him outrageously offensive.",
      "Disability slurs: 'We can't keep being poked like a bear'",
      "Soap star condemns 'daily abuse and prejudice'",
      "Heartstopper: 'How Netflix show's eating disorder story helps me'",
      "South Park has always worked on multiple levels - offering outrageous forbidden shock value for schoolchildren while delivering crunching adult satire.",
      "None of this nuance is reflected in the TikTok trend, which reduces Timmy, and by extension wheelchair users and disability, to one-dimensional ridicule.",
      "This warped revival parallels the case of Joey Deacon, a man with cerebral palsy whose appearance on Blue Peter in the 1980s backfired to spark playground mockery, with kids shouting \u201cyou're a Joey!\u201d, and \u201cdo the Joey face\u201d.",
      "TikTok says its community guidelines strictly prohibit hate speech and content promoting discrimination, violence or harm based on disability.",
      "It removed the videos flagged by the BBC for violating this policy. But it didn\u2019t remove the Timmy sound used on several other videos - meaning it can be used again.",
      "TikTok didn\u2019t respond to a specific question about removing offensive audio.",
      "Ciaran O\u2019Connor, from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a think tank focusing on online hate, says that sounds are a \u201cblind spot in TikTok\u2019s content moderation practices\u201d.",
      "Even if a video with an \u201coriginal sound\u201d is removed by the platform, the audio usually isn\u2019t, he says.",
      "This makes it a common way of bypassing TikTok\u2019s content moderation guidelines - including for harassment and abuse.",
      "Bullying and trolling of disabled people is still common online. Three in 10 said they\u2019d experienced it in a survey of 4,000 disabled people carried out by charity Scope.",
      "My last experience of having the name hurled at me on the street shocked me not so much in the name-calling, but the absolute lack of contrition shown even when challenged.",
      "It mirrored an experience last year when teenagers, again taunting me, rode off shouting \u201cTimmy is going to run us over.\u201d",
      "Ross Hovey, a wheelchair user and Liverpool fan, recently posted on LinkedIn about a near-identical experience.",
      "He was heading to a Liverpool match with his 79-year-old father and care assistant when a group of young men shouted \"Timmy\" at him. When Ross challenged them with \u201cI heard you,\u201d they too tried to claim innocence.",
      "The abuse raises questions about what role platforms should take in providing context to young users.",
      "\u201cBrief, contextless clips and participatory trends are at the heart of TikTok\u2019s popularity,\u201d  says O\u2019Connor.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s normally good and positive and funny \u2026 but when these dynamics are being used to demean, mock or stigmatise others, it does raise the question of whether TikTok should be doing more to inform or educate users.\u201d",
      "Alison Kerry, head of communications at Scope, told the BBC \"these kinds of ableist trends are deeply harmful. They don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, so a social media trend can quickly turn into someone facing abuse in their everyday life.\u201d",
      "The real-world impact is certainly becoming more noticeable.",
      "Disabled TikTokers have been posting about their experiences, and a teacher recently wrote a Reddit thread titled \u201cGetting real sick of this Timmy trend\u201d, expressing frustration at students' lack of awareness.",
      "This is why I challenged the teens at the station - I felt a duty not only to my 12-year-old self, who once burst into tears feeling helpless at similar taunts, but also to disabled students today.",
      "I returned a second time when the boys called out \u201cTimmy\u201d again after I turned to leave.",
      "\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked forcefully. Silence. One of the group eventually apologised, admitting the behaviour was wrong.",
      "\u201cSpeak to your friends,\u201d I pleaded, sensing a glimmer of hope. \u201cMaybe then they\u2019ll listen.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 13:58:27 GMT",
    "summary": "The actress was the last surviving original cast member of BBC Radio 4 serial The Archers.",
    "story": [
      "June Spencer, who has died aged 105, was the last surviving original cast member of The Archers.",
      "For nearly 70 years, she played Peggy Woolley in the long-running radio drama: one of the best-loved matriarchs in British broadcasting.",
      "Spencer helped launch BBC Radio's \"everyday story of country folk\" on 1 January 1951. Clement Attlee was Prime Minister, and meat, cheese, sugar, and petrol were still being rationed after World War Two.",
      "As Peggy, she weathered the ups and downs of life in Ambridge, with plot lines including alcoholism, gambling, and dementia, until Spencer\u2019s retirement in 2022 at the age of 103.",
      "At the time, her colleagues paid tribute to an actor who never fluffed a line.",
      "\u201cI have rarely worked with such an inventive, focused and technically brilliant actor,\u201d said Jeremy Howe \u2013 the editor of the programme, \"or with such a lovely person\".",
      "The Archers radio star June Spencer dies aged 105",
      "June Rosalind Spencer was born on 14 June 1919, just six months after the end of World War One.",
      "Her acting career began at the age of three, when she was cast as King of the Land of Nod in a school play. When she heard the audience laugh, June knew it was the life for her.",
      "She went to Nottingham High School for Girls, which she found \u201cvery stark, grey and cold\u201d.",
      "She was forced to give up sport \u2013 her favourite lesson \u2013 when a doctor somehow misdiagnosed a heart condition.",
      "An only child, her father was a \u201csensible and supportive\u201d biscuit salesman, but her mother was another story.",
      "A \u201ccomplex woman\u201d, Mrs Spencer had once aspired to the stage herself, but \u2013 according to her daughter - \u201cjust gave up on life... and decided she was an invalid at the age of 40\u201d.",
      "June Spencer had little choice but to leave school to look after her mother \u2013 who eventually lived until she was 94.",
      "Miserably, mother and daughter sat together in a darkened room in case Mrs Spencer had \"an attack\".",
      "Her headmistress was angry, complaining that her former pupil was throwing her life away. \u201cI was frightened of her,\u201d June later recalled.",
      "\u201cShe told me, \u2018Of course, you can't expect to get anywhere without your School Certificate\u2019.",
      "\"I have thought of those words many times since, particularly when I received my OBE.\u201d",
      "In her teens, the aspiring actress enjoyed writing comic monologues - performing them as part of the after-dinner entertainment at local Masonic lodges.",
      "But with her heart set on the stage, her mother was obstructive: refusing to let her daughter sit the exams for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.",
      "\u201cI think my mother thought I would fall in with a bad lot,\u201d Spencer said. \"When I did finally get in [to the theatre] she said: 'Oh well, I suppose it was inevitable'.\"",
      "She joined a drama club, studied for a London Guildhall drama school certificate, and finally joined a local theatre company in 1942.",
      "The same year she married a \u201cfair-haired, blue-eyed boy with the cheekiest grin I\u2019d ever seen\u201d.",
      "She had first met Roger Brocksom when she was 17 years old, on holiday near Skegness \u2013 but he didn\u2019t have the money to buy her a ring.",
      "The wedding took place while he was on leave from the army; wartime shortages meant they had rice paper rather than icing on the cake.",
      "A series of small parts on BBC radio programmes followed, and \u2013 by the time her husband returned from the war \u2013 Spencer was finding regular work.",
      "Then came the moment that changed her life.",
      "The founder of The Archers, Godfrey Baseley, is said to have talked openly in meetings about who was going to be in his new programme \u2013 and news travelled fast.",
      "It reached a mystified June Spencer while she was getting lunch in the BBC canteen.",
      "\u201cA girl said to me, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to be in The Archers, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\" she recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Am I? What\u2019s The Archers?\u2019\u201d",
      "In 1950, there were a few pilot episodes and then the big launch on New Year\u2019s Day, 1951 \u2013 with June Spencer playing a heavily pregnant Peggy Archer.",
      "The series hoped to be a public service for farmers, with gentle storylines that brought urban listeners into rural surroundings \u2013 almost as if they were eavesdropping on farmers and their wives.",
      "To start with, Spencer had a 13-week contract and little idea that she was helping to create a unique slice of British life.",
      "The shows were then broadcast live, with producers creeping in and scribbling alterations on scripts, moments before she read them.",
      "But The Archers was an instant hit with the actors \u2013 despite never having their credits read out on air \u2013 in demand for local appearances.",
      "\"I remember going down to a gathering of all the Women's Institutes in Cornwall,\u201d June recalled, \u201cand I was mobbed. It was quite frightening.\"",
      "There was a brief break from the show when June and Roger adopted two children in the late 1950s. Thelma Rogers took over the part for a while, but soon returned to the theatre.",
      "On taking back the role, Spencer insisted she had little in common with Peggy, who rather lacked a sense of humour, but her on-air journey from young barmaid to grieving widow saw them both involved in some of the show's strongest storylines.",
      "Peggy\u2019s first husband, Jack Archer, succumbed to alcoholism, while her second husband Jack Woolley \u2013 with whom she hoped to enjoy a happy retirement - was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.",
      "The show\u2019s slow-moving plot lines meant each disease unfolded over years - as they do in real life. And both issues were close to June\u2019s heart.",
      "Around the time of her Golden Wedding anniversary, Spencer had noticed that Roger\u2019s memory \u201cwas playing him false\u201d and \u201cthen the repetitive questions started,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Just over a year ago, Milena Sanchez suddenly left one of the UK's most successful podcasts in a split that seemed to shock everyone - even her co-hosts.",
      "For seven years, she'd built The Receipts alongside Audrey Indome and Tolani Shoneye, collecting more than 100,000 weekly listeners on the way.",
      "Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, Milena says quitting was a difficult decision but her mental health had deteriorated to a point where she couldn't carry on.",
      "\"It wasn't one I took lightly - even though it might have seemed like that,\" says Milena, 33.",
      "Audrey and Tolani said in January they were blindsided by Milena's decision to leave but Milena claimed it came after a rift that had lasted for years.",
      "There were also rumours - denied by the podcasters - that Milena was bullied and squeezed out of the group.",
      "\"Ultimately, I had to be true to who I was and remove myself from that space,\" Milena tells Newsbeat.",
      "The Receipts, which started in 2016 and signed a lucrative exclusive deal with Spotify in 2019, has about 100,000 weekly listeners on Spotify.",
      "\"Financially, I could've shut my mouth and stayed and collected the bag,\" says Milena.",
      "\"But for me, it's not about that. It meant more to me - my mental health, my integrity and who I am as a person, and to not sell something that wasn't true.",
      "\"It's not easy, and especially when I do have a daughter that depends on me.\"",
      "Milena says her daughter, who was just one year old when The Receipts started and is now almost 10, helped her find the courage to quit.",
      "\"I really had to sit down with myself and ask, if my daughter came to me with the same predicament, what would be my response to her?\" Milena says.",
      "\"My response wouldn't be to stay somewhere just because of money. It would just be, 'choose yourself'.",
      "\"You only live once and I know it sounds so clich\u00e9d, but you can't be stuck in a space where you just don't feel happy.\"",
      "Milena says her year since quitting The Receipts has been a \"whirlwind\".",
      "She says she left London to live in the countryside and pursue music and writing, but realised she was missing podcasting.",
      "\"There's been a lot of reflecting, a lot of self-analysing,\" says Milena.",
      "\"Ultimately I had to say to myself: I love speaking, my voice is very needed.\"",
      "'A one-man band'",
      "Milena says she had to overcome a lot of self-doubt before launching her own solo podcast.",
      "\"I was scared to put this podcast out.",
      "\"I felt like I'm just going to be in my home talking. It doesn't feel big enough, it doesn't feel glitzy enough.",
      "\"But it doesn't matter where it's coming from,\" Milena says she told herself.",
      "\"You started from from the ground before, so let's go again.\"",
      "Since she launched solo project Milena's Diary at the end of September, she says she's been \"overwhelmed\" by the response.",
      "\"It reminded me, 'this is why you are here. This is your purpose'.\"",
      "But \"it was very difficult to start again from the ground up,\" she says - and definitely a change of pace from The Receipts.",
      "There, \"I had a team,\" she says.",
      "\"We had production, we had social media people, somebody that edited the podcasts.",
      "\"All I had to do was turn up and talk and that's it.",
      "\"Now doing this solo, I'm doing everything myself. I'm a one-man band.\"",
      "Previously, she was one of three presenters bouncing off each other and not having that has been a \"hard\" transition.",
      "\"I really do enjoy being on episodes with other people because you do bounce back, there's other stories that are triggered in your mind and it's nice,\" she says.",
      "\"But I feel like having that time alone to self-reflect and to just talk is also very important.\"",
      "Milena says she uses her podcast \"as therapy\" and she feels more authentically herself than ever.",
      "She's also spent the past year releasing music leaning into her Colombian heritage and queer identity.",
      "\"My culture is so ingrained in me, even though I was born in London,\" she says.",
      "\"And I'm a queer woman so I'm going to talk on that openly and very proudly.\"",
      "Looking back on the past year, \"I feel so much happier,\" Milena says.",
      "\"I am in a space where I have done so much work on myself, so much self-reflection and taking accountability for things I don't think that I would've a couple of years back.",

      "Here's what we know so far about the police investigation and the circumstances surrounding Payne's death.",
      "Why was Liam in Argentina?",
      "Payne was visiting his former bandmate Niall Horan, who was in the country on tour.",
      "He posted on Snapchat earlier in October that he was visiting Horan for a catch-up, saying: \"It's been a while since me and Niall have spoken, we've got a lot to talk about.\" He added: \"No bad vibes or anything like that, but we need to talk.\"",

      "We also know the pop star visited a friend's house in Argentina in the days before he died, again with Cassidy.",
      "But when Payne fell to his death, Cassidy had already left the country.",
      "What happened on the day he died?",
      "Payne had been staying in the upmarket Casa Sur hotel for three days before his death.",
      "A call was made to emergency services around 17:00 local time (21:00 BST) on 16 October by staff, with requests to respond to a hotel guest \"who is overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol\" and \"destroying his room\".",

      "Payne's room was on the third floor and had a balcony about 14m (45ft) above an interior courtyard.",
      "It is thought he fell from the balcony at about 17:07 local time.",
      "Police arrived minutes later. Hotel staff told them a loud sound had been heard in the courtyard, where Payne's body was discovered.",
      "He was pronounced dead at the scene, with the emergency services saying there had been \"no possibility of resuscitation\".",
      "What have official tests revealed?",
      "An autopsy, which was carried out that evening, established that Payne suffered \"multiple traumas\" and \"internal and external haemorrhaging\", with 25 injuries that were \"consistent with a fall from a great height\".",
      "On 7 November, the prosecutor's office said toxicology tests revealed traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his body.",
      "They also ruled out self-harm or physical intervention by a third party.",
      "They said Payne didn't adopt a posture to protect himself from the fall. That, along with other information, led them to conclude he was unconscious or semi-conscious when he fell.",
      "They ruled out \"a conscious or voluntary act\", saying he didn't know what he was doing or didn't understand it.",
      "Prosecutors also said they had examined more than 800 hours of video footage from security cameras in the hotel and public roads; and had examined calls, messages and social media activity on Payne's phone.",
      "They also received dozens of testimonies from hotel staff, family members, friends and medical professionals. Among those interviewed were two women who had been with the singer at his hotel but left before his death.",

      "The drug, which fights cravings, was available a few years ago on the NHS under the brand name Champix but was withdrawn due to some impurities. The new version has been approved as safe.",
      "E-cigarettes, meanwhile, will \"sometimes\" be offered, often as a starter kit of about two weeks' worth of vapes by local NHS stop smoking services, officials said.",

      "Varenicline is a prescription only medicine, which means people cannot buy it over the counter at a pharmacy or supermarket and will instead need to see their GP or an NHS stop smoking service to get it.",
      "It works by reducing cravings for nicotine and blocking its effect on the brain, while also helping with withdrawal symptoms, such as feeling irritable or having difficulty sleeping.",
      "When used alongside behavioural support, such as counselling, it has been shown to help around one in four people to stop smoking for at least six months, said NHS England.",
      "That could help more than 85,000 people stop smoking each year, it said, and  might prevent around 9,500 smoking-related deaths over the next five years, according to research by University College London.",
      "Around one in eight adults\u00a0 - six million people in the UK\u00a0- are smokers.",
      "There were more than 400,000 hospital admissions in England linked to smoking last year.",
      "Each year the NHS spends around \u00a32.5bn on treating health issues caused by smoking \u2013 it is the leading cause of preventable illness and deaths.",
      "Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"The rollout of this pill can save the NHS millions of pounds, save appointments to help other patients be seen faster and save lives.\"",
      "Announcing the launch at the NHS Providers annual conference, NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the drug could be a \"game-changer\" for people who want to quit smoking.",
      "What about vapes?",
      "Since e-cigarettes are not licensed as medicines, GPs are unable to prescribe vapes to people trying to quit smoking unless there is a locally agreed NHS scheme to do so.",
      "Some local authorities do offer vapes to smokers who are looking to quit.",
      "Guidelines recommend people try a licensed stop smoking medicine first, though vapes are a recognised smoking cessation aid.",
      "Vaping is nowhere near as harmful as smoking cigarettes.",
      "However, it is not entirely risk free and health experts agree people should not start vaping other than to give up smoking.",
      "Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said access to services was variable.",
      "She said: \"Wherever a smoker lives, they should be able to access the most effective forms of treatment to help them stop.",
      "\u201cImproving access to varenicline will be a positive step forward to help prevent the tens of thousands of deaths caused by smoking. However, a drug alone will not transform smoking rates. Services are needed to support smokers and prescribe these products.",
      "\"The NHS has done a good job in setting up in-hospital support to help people quit smoking, which complements the services provided in the community.",
      "\"But gaps remain around the country, with services often in peril as local NHS organisations try to balance the books.\"",
      "Prof Nick Hopkinson, professor of respiratory medicine at Imperial College London, said varenicline was the \"most effective smoking cessation medication\".",
      "The fact it has not been available for the last few years has been a \"real problem\", he said, adding: \"We know that quitting smoking is the best thing anyone who smokes can do to improve their health and the health of people around them, especially children and young people.",
      "\u201cPeople are most likely to quit successfully if they have a combination of counselling support and medication to relieve cravings and help break their tobacco dependence.\"",

      "That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",
      "Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m.",
      "The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave.",
      "In total, \u00a350.4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic.",
      "The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city.",
      "Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been \u201cuseful\u201d, as the sites had been envisaged as \u201cmilitary field hospitals\u201d at the time.",
      "\u201cWe thought we were doing it to avoid a northern Italy situation,\u201d she said, referring to scenes in Lombardy, where intensive-care units had been overwhelmed.",

      "The snapshot survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found people working from home gained almost an hour on average from not needing to commute.",
      "The data, which includes people who worked for at least seven hours, suggested those working from home spent 10 minutes less working on average, although the ONS said its estimates were not precise enough to be sure it was the case.",
      "The data shows where people said they were working on the day they completed the survey, rather than their wider working pattern.",
      "The figures come as separate data showed staff wellbeing was one of the most common reasons businesses give for allowing staff to work from home, despite some firms scaling back hybrid work offers.",
      "Working solely from home has gradually become less common since the end of the Covid pandemic.",
      "In October, 13% of working adults in Great Britain said they did their job solely from home, according to the ONS.",
      "But hybrid working - a mix of working from home and in the office or on a site - has become more popular, though only 28% of people said they had such a working arrangement.",
      "The ONS said working parents were more likely to have hybrid working arrangements (35%), compared with workers that do not have children (24%).",
      "Of working parents, men were more likely to hybrid work than women, at 41% and 30% respectively, although it is not clear what factors are driving the difference.",
      "Managers, those aged 30 or over, and people with higher qualifications were also more likely to have hybrid working arrangements, the ONS said.",
      "Jayne Clark, who lives in Cornwall with her husband and two children, started working from home three years ago and says it has been hugely beneficial to her.",
      "\"Since I\u2019ve been working from home I find I am so much more productive,\" says Ms Clark, who works in credit management.",
      "She says her 45-minute commute used to leave her \"stressed and exhausted\" upon returning home.",
      "\"I find it easier to get to sleep [now] because I haven't got as much on my mind.\u201d",
      "She now sets her alarm a little later, and with no commute has an extra half an hour in the morning which she uses to go for a run or walk the dog.",
      "Working from home has also made it easier for childcare and for school runs, she adds.",
      "Despite the pandemic-driven trend of working from home, several high-profile companies have scrapped the practice.",
      "Supermarket chain Asda recently said it intended to cut hybrid working as part of a business restructure and Amazon announced it would order staff back to the office five days a week from January next year.",
      "The shift has not been confined to the private sector. Civil servants were recently informed that they would have to spend at least three days a week in the office.",
      "Some of these moves have seemed at odds with the new Labour government\u2019s Employment Rights Bill, which aims to strengthen access to flexible working.",
      "Workers are already able to request flexible working arrangements from when they start a new job, but the new laws could strengthen such rights.",

      "The 'Covid-19 decision tool' assigned points based on a patient's age, frailty and underlying conditions. A high score meant they might not be admitted to intensive care if services were overwhelmed.",
      "The tool was never issued publicly, after it became clear infections might have already reached a peak in March 2020.",
      "Sir Stephen, who still serves as national medical director at NHS England, said the senior clinicians who were asked to draw up the plans at short notice \"did a magnificent job\" that \"nobody ever wants to do\".",
      "\"But it became absolutely clear to me that this was going to be controversial, [and] that it hadn't had the opportunity to be discussed more widely with patient groups, [or] with the public,\" he added.",
      "The draft document advised doctors to score Covid patients based on three criteria, using a frailty scale.",
      "It detailed how those with a total score of more than eight points should not be admitted to intensive care if services became overwhelmed.",
      "Patients aged 70 to 75 were to be automatically assigned four points, while those aged over 80 would receive six.",
      "Extra points would be added for chronic conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes.",
      "People who were terminally ill, with a life expectancy of less than six months, would automatically be given nine points.",
      "Sir Stephen said work on the guidance document had started early in the pandemic, at a time when the number of patients in intensive care in England was doubling every 5-7 days.",
      "\"It was not clear that the public would respond to lockdown - they did wonderfully -  but that wasn't clear [at that point],\" he said.",
      "\"Frankly, I was personally terrified that the NHS was going to be overwhelmed.\"",
      "The project was halted on 28 March 2020, after it became clear the peak of the first Covid wave was approaching and the health service would not \"breach capacity\".",
      "Sir Stephen said there was also a danger the point-scoring system could have been \"used inappropriately\", replacing the individual clinical judgement of doctors.",
      "\"My recommendation to the inquiry is that we should absolutely, in the future, not try and develop one of these tools in the midst of a pandemic,\" he added.",
      "He said it was a piece of work that needed to be carried out in consultation with the public \"in normal times\".",

      "Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021.",

      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",

      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",

      "He added he would not comment on \"hypothetical scenarios\" of a future US administration.",
      "Speaking to the same programme, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said the UK had to find a \"shared way of working with the US\" on Ukraine.",
      "During the election campaign, Trump characterised the Russia-Ukraine conflict as a drain on US resources and said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine \"in a day\".",
      "The president-elect has not offered details of how he would resolve the conflict,",

      "To entice Russia, the West would promise to delay Ukraine\u2019s entry into Nato, the military alliance of European and North American nations.",
      "The former advisers argued Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting its territory back from Russian occupation, but that it should negotiate based on current front lines.",

    "summary": "Hospitality bosses are calling for changes to what they describe as \"unsustainable\" tax rises.",
    "story": [
      "Top pub and restaurant bosses have warned the chancellor that tax rises in last month's Budget will \"unquestionably\" cause closures and job losses.",
      "In a letter, more than 200 signatories have said the hospitality industry is disproportionately impacted by an \"unsustainable\" hike in the amount employers pay in National Insurance contributions (NICs).",
      "It adds that businesses have \"no capacity to pass the costs onto customers\", which would instead lead to job cuts and closures of smaller firms.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said that her National Insurance changes for businesses will generate \u00a325bn, which would aid funding of public services, such as the NHS.",
      "From April, the rate employers pay in National Insurance will rise from 13.8% to 15%, and the threshold at which they start paying the tax on each employee's salary will be reduced from \u00a39,100 per year to \u00a35,000.",
      "Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the changes had been designed in a way \"that tried to limit the extra cost on small business\".",
      "Signatories of the letter include Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, the bosses of pub firms Fuller's and Stonegate Group, and Premier Inn's owner, Whitbread.",
      "They are supported by a further 209 businesses, together employing tens of thousands of people across the UK.",
      "According to the letter, the cost increases will cause jobs to be \"drastically\" cut and hours to be reduced for workers.",
      "Ms Nicholls told the BBC that firms in the industry facing these \"tough decisions\" may also reconsider investing.",
      "\"We understand that the government has a tough job to do,\" she said, but urged politicians to \"have a rethink\".",
      "Jones said that the government would not reassess the plan, and that many employers would pay the same in NI contributions as they do now, or less.",
      "\"I think the public would recognise that bigger businesses are able to burden some of the contributions that we need to make to the state.",
      "\"Getting the NHS back on its feet so workers who are off sick can get back to work is probably something that we'd say we'd all benefit from,\" he added.",
      "Impact on lower earners",
      "The letter from industry bosses suggests that changes in the NICs threshold are \"regressive in their impact on lower earners and will impact flexible working practices which many older workers and parents rely upon\".",
      "The signatories are calling for the government to consider one of two measures to \"protect businesses who employ low earners\"  to mitigate the impact.",
      "Suggested measures are a new employer NICs band which would apply between \u00a35,000 and \u00a39,100 at a lower rate of 5%, or implementing an exemption for taxpayers working fewer than 20 hours per week.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has calculated that three quarters of the impact of the NI changes will be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "During a select committee hearing on Tuesday, the OBR's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "The changes set out in the Budget are, however, predicted to raise some \u00a325bn a year, making it one of the biggest single tax-raising measures in history.",
      "The chancellor has previously said that she was not immune to \"criticism\" over the move, but has argued that it will put public finances on a \"firm footing\".",
      "The hospitality industry's letter follows on from big British supermarkets such as M&S and Sainsbury's hinting that they may put up prices in a bid to offset higher wage bills.",
      "Sainsbury's chief executive Simon Roberts said on Thursday that the NI changes would cost the business around \u00a3140m - a sum which does not include the increases to minimum wage.",
      "The boss of Wetherspoons also said earlier this week that following the Budget, taxes and business costs were \"expected to increase by approximately \u00a360m\".",
      "Its chairman said that he believed many food and drink businesses planned to pass costs on to customers.",

      "While housing associations may have built homes, and there may have been schemes funded by cash from other government pots, the fact that the money raised from selling off homes is nowhere near enough to rebuild or buy like-for-like has been a long-standing concern.",
      "And it would seem Labour deputy prime minister and minister for housing Angela Rayner \u2013 who famously bought her own council house in Stockport under RTB \u2013 has taken on board the views of RTB critics.",
      "Rayner has said recently she may impose restrictions so that people who move into newly built council houses will not be able to buy them in the future.",
      "It is a decision that is likely to be welcomed by Labour politicians in regions where the need for social housing is arguably as great as ever, but the amount of it available is very low.",
      "The Labour metro-mayors of both Liverpool and Manchester regions have both said they want to see more social housing built in their regions.",
      "In May, Andy Burnham, leader of Greater Manchester, called on the-then Conservative government to pause RTB on new builds after losing 500 social homes to the scheme in 2022.",
      "He argued that if planned homes could be bought by their tenants, it would be \"like trying to fill a bath without the plug in\".",
      "On Merseyside, virtually all former council housing stock was transferred to housing associations over the last two decades.",
      "But metro mayor Steve Rotheram says registered social landlords (RSLs) have inherited some of the problems that came with RTB.",
      "He says one Merseyside RSL had lost about a third of its homes through sales to tenants in the decade since the housing stock was transferred.",
      "People who are tenants of RSLs can buy their homes under \u201cpreserved\u201d RTB if they lived in their homes when the council owned them.",
      "And once someone has lived in an RSL property for three years, they can apply for the Right To Acquire.",
      "Rotheram says cheaper borrowing rates for RSLs and a moratorium on sales would help boost growth in social housing.",
      "\"You are not going to build a lot of houses for someone to come along in three or four years and buy it below market value,\" he says.",
      "\"How we deal with this is part of our growth plan going to the government, and we are now trying to see if we can work with [Rayner] to come up with proposals.\"",
      "Blackpool Council\u2019s cabinet member for economy and the built environment, Mark Smith, is clear that while the money generated from RTB sales is used to support various investments in housing, the RTB receipts his council receives are \"not sufficient to replace lost social rent housing\".",
      "And he says even with changes such as the government giving councils more flexibility to allow RTB receipts to be used alongside cash from other streams such as funds given by developers who get planning permission for private schemes, there is still some red tape in the way of using different types of funding together to build council housing.",
      "\"We do the best we can within the parameters of the policy as it exists currently but there is always room for improvement,\" he says.",
      "Under the new Labour government policies, councils and housing associations are being given \u201cmore freedom\u201d to decide how to use their RTB money.",
      "Previously, only 50% of the money a council received from a sale could go towards building or buying a new house.",
      "But in future councils will be able to use all that money, and put money received from private developers handed over as part of planning agreements into projects as well.",
      "These deals, known as Section 106 agreements, see developers give money to councils to mitigate any negative impacts their private schemes might have on local communities or housing markets.",
      "Sources within the social housing sector say that in the past the \"policy has never achieved anything like a one-for-one replacement ratio\".",
      "\"If it had then there would be a lot less concern about the policy,\" one says.",
      "\"Yes, a Right To Buy home continues to be a home after it\u2019s sold, but it contributes to a huge loss of social housing stock and contributes to housing waiting lists, or people having to live in unsuitable accommodation.\"",
      "'Serious shortage'",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, says there is a \"serious housing shortage in this country\" and \"record numbers of people living in temporary accommodation\".",
      "Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, says: \u201cWhile the Right To Buy can and has delivered home ownership for many the scheme in its current form does not work.",
      "\"Rising discounts, alongside other measures that restrict councils\u2019 use of Right To Buy receipts, mean that the money raised from the sale of property is usually not sufficient to cover the building costs of replacing the property.",
      "\"We have long called for the removal of rules and restrictions which disincentivise local authorities from building social homes, at risk of losing them.",
      "\"Councils must be given the control, power and flexibility to use receipt monies in a way that works best for their local areas, which includes retaining 100 per cent of the receipts permanently.\"",
      "'Scandal'",
      "In 2012, the Conservative-led government increased the discount a tenant could receive when buying their home.",
      "Since coming to power, Labour has said the discount will be reduced to between \u00a316,000 and \u00a338,000, depending on the location \u2013 a significant reduction from the \u00a3136,000 discount currently available in London and the discount of just over \u00a3100,000 elsewhere.",
      "Rayner, who bought her Stockport council house under a RTB discount in 2007 and sold it several years later for \u00a348,000 more than she paid for it, said she wanted to see a \u201cfairer\u201d system.",
      "Her department says it is a \"scandal\" that only about one third of homes lost to RTB have been replaced since 2012, and that it was \"working at pace to reverse the continued decline of social rented homes\".",
      "But while the government stresses there are \"no plans to abolish the RTB\", the \"social revolution\" Lord Heseltine heralded nearly 45 years ago is clearly facing a radical change to everything but its name.",

      "A former minister said: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to order for the years ahead - how long can we be talking, when the need is now?\u201d",
      "The government will not say when they expect to hit the 2.5% target - and won\u2019t commit to hitting it before the end of the Parliament in 2029 - causing frustration in some quarters.",

      "And earlier on the Today programme, former Defence Secretary Ben Wallace accused Labour of making an effective \u201ccut in our defence budget\u201d by including \u00a33bn of Ukraine funding in it.",
      "If Labour reach the 2.5% target, he said he\u2019d welcome it, \u201cbut it\u2019s got to be real money with a timetable\u201d.",
      "There is little disagreement that more resources are needed.",
      "John Healey himself has acknowledged the military \u201chave not been ready to fight\u201d. A squeeze on funding over many years had made money tight \u2013 the forces \u201chollowed out\u201d, according to Wallace.",

      "Another former minister told me that funding \u201cis absolutely urgent \u2013 it is urgent to help Ukraine but the most urgent is where our forces are in danger \u2013 it\u2019s not hypothetical, in the Red Sea the Houthis are firing at our ships.\u201d",
      "And shortly before the election, the government\u2019s new national security adviser Jonathan Powell wrote that a new administration would need to reinforce the UK\u2019s defence and security \u201cwithin the bounds allowed by a struggling economy\u201d.",
      "Some insiders argue rising threats around the world mean the UK should spend way more than 2.5% in any case.",
      "Another former minister told me, \u201cby any measure we are underspending \u2013 if you don\u2019t buy the insurance policy you end up having to pay yourself and the cost of real conflicts would be immense in comparison\u201d.",
      "A defence source told me, \u201cwe are going to have to make a move on spending or we can put our fingers in our ears and hope we get through it \u2013 the Treasury has to do the maths on this \u2013 the way to stop spending 5 percent of GDP in the future is to spend now.\u201d",

      "But it\u2019s not just about how much money goes to defence - it\u2019s also about how it\u2019s spent.",

      "Power era",
      "While as a political party, Labour is instinctively uncomfortable with Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, when it comes to defence there is some sympathy with his attitude towards European defence funding.",

      "Twenty-three now meet the 2% target, up from just six countries in 2021.",
      "Rather than worrying about what Trump might do in office, they said, \u201ca precondition for Trump to take European defence seriously is for Europe to take its own defence seriously.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to see how that does not mean more countries on the continent spending more of their own cash.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves, Nato does deter Russia, and we have to make sure that happens,\u201d said a defence source.",
      "America\u2019s role in our security is vital. But sources in government acknowledge that Europe, with conflict on its fringes, must play a vigorous financial part.",

      "Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House sets nerves jangling across the Atlantic about what it will mean for Nato, what it will mean for the US committment to support for Ukraine in terms of diplomacy and cold hard cash.",
      "There is instinctive political unease here with his behaviour, his attitude to the law, convention, and the truth. But perhaps in the words of one source \u201cit\u2019s not a rule of law era, it\u2019s a power era\u201d.",

      "\"Our new approach will deliver respectful partnerships that listen rather than tell, deliver long-term growth rather than short-term solutions and build a freer, safer, more prosperous continent,\" he said as he set out the agenda for his trip to the continent's two biggest powers - Nigeria and South Africa.",
      "Lammy's visit follows his appointment as foreign secretary in the Labour government that took office earlier this year.",
      "Since Labour was last in office in 2010, relations between African states and other world powers have changed massively.",
      "Today, China is the largest trade partner for many African countries, while Russia has increasingly made inroads, including by offering military support to West African states battling jihadists.",
      "Oil-rich Gulf nations, along with Turkey,  have also been increasing their influence on the continent by striking business and military deals.",
      "In contrast, UK-Africa relations have been \"a lot more lacklustre\", says Alex Vines, the head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "This is particularly the case between the UK and its  biggest trading partner on the continent, South Africa, and the trip is an \"attempt to reboot that\", he adds.",
      "\"I want to hear what our African partners need and foster relationships so that the UK and our friends and partners in Africa can grow together,\" Lammy said.",
      "Britain is no newcomer to the continent. A long \u2013 and at times chequered \u2013 history underpins many of its relationships with African countries.",
      "Almost all its former colonies on the continent are part of the Commonwealth, although countries that did not have this historical link to the UK have joined the group, including Rwanda, Togo and Gabon. Angola has also applied to join.",
      "\"The Commonwealth will likely continue to be a key platform,\" says Nicole Beardsworth, an academic at South Africa's Wits University.",
      "As its former colonies gained independence in the middle of the last century, Britain continued to play a sort of \"big brother\" role.",
      "But this is now changing.",
      "Dr Vines says Africa did not feature significantly in a major document released last year to outline the UK's priorities on the global stage.",
      "\"There were name checks to countries like Nigeria and South Africa and Kenya in it, but there wasn't much written,\" he says.",
      "Dr Vines adds that he expects South Africa-UK relations to improve under Labour because of its historic ties with the anti-apartheid movement that fought white-minority rule.",
      "\"That comes from the anti-apartheid struggle and the solidarity that Labour and people that were the Labour movement provided for combating apartheid,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth, however, notes that former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May tried to bolster ties with Africa, but her efforts were \"scuppered\" after she resigned in 2019 following turmoil in the then governing party.",
      "The UK then had an unprecedented turnover of prime ministers who had to deal with domestic crises, the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, and the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"Africa fell off the radar,\" Dr Beardsworth says, adding that the exception was the controversial, and now-scrapped, deal to send some asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda.",
      "Being the world\u2019s youngest continent \u2013 with a median age of 19 \u2013 Africa presents opportunities for the future, the UK Foreign Office said.",
      "\"Africa has huge growth potential, with the continent on track to make up 25% of the world\u2019s population by 2050,\" read a statement from the office.",
      "With an ageing population in the UK - as with much of the developed world - Dr Vines says that the sharing of skills will increase.",
      "He adds that migration is an \"emotive and complicated issue\", but the UK and other Western nations should avoid \"cherry-picking the best and corroding African states from being successful themselves\".",
      "The UK Foreign Office said that \"growth is the core mission of this government and will underpin our relationships in Nigeria, South Africa and beyond\".",
      "That will mean \"more jobs and more opportunities for Brits and Africans alike,\" it added.",
      "The UK's Africa policy has long focused on development aid, but this has been slashed in recent years as the country faces its own economic crisis.",
      "Dr Vines says aid can be important to deal with humanitarian crises, climate shocks and to finance projects aimed at expanding the private sector in Africa, but he does not see the Labour government increasing funding.",
      "\"When you had a previous Labour government under Tony Blair, Britain saw itself as a global superpower for international development - that\u2019s no longer the case,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth says relations are expected to move towards being more economically focused, and \"much more mutually beneficial\".",
      "She says this could also see the normalisation of the UK's relations with Zimbabwe and Harare being welcomed back to the Commonwealth after relations broke down during the rule of the late Robert Mugabe.",
      "Differences over international affairs such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could also play out less in the public.",
      "South Africa\u2019s position on both conflicts has been at odds with much of the West.",
      "But South African analyst Yanga Molotana does not see this as a major problem.",
      "\"Two things can exist at the same time - I can still hold my position, I can still hold my views, and we can still have a mutually beneficial relationship without the moral pressure of you saying that I have to agree with everything that you say,\" she adds.",
      "Dr Vines agrees, saying he expects the UK to continue promoting multi-party democracy in Africa, but there will be \"less finger-wagging, and more quiet diplomacy\".",
      "\"The concern is probably going to be more regularly raised in private,\" he says.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:00:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the sterile worlds scientists have long thought.",
    "story": [
      "The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the dead sterile worlds that scientists have long thought.",
      "Instead, they may have oceans, and the moons may even be capable of supporting life, scientists say.",
      "Much of what we know about them was gathered by Nasa\u2019s Voyager 2 spacecraft which visited nearly 40 years ago.",
      "But a new analysis shows that Voyager's visit coincided with a powerful solar storm, which led to a misleading idea of what the Uranian system is really like.",
      "Uranus is a beautiful, icy ringed world in the outer reaches of our solar system. It is among the coldest of all the planets. It is also tilted on its side compared to all the other worlds \u2013 as if it had been knocked over \u2013 making it arguably the weirdest.",
      "We got our first close-up look at it in 1986, when Voyager 2 flew past and sent back sensational pictures of the planet and its five major moons.",
      "But what amazed scientists even more was the data Voyager 2 sent back indicating that the Uranian system was even weirder than they thought.",
      "The measurements from the spacecraft\u2019s instruments indicated that the planets and moons were inactive, unlike the other moons in the outer solar system. They also showed that Uranus\u2019s protective magnetic field was strangely distorted. It was squashed and pushed away from the Sun.",
      "A planet\u2019s magnetic field traps any gases and other material coming off the planet and its moons. These might be from oceans or geological activity. Voyager 2 found none, suggesting that Uranus and its five largest moons were sterile and inactive.",
      "This came as an enormous surprise because it was unlike the solar system\u2019s other planets and their moons.",
      "But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day.",
      "The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field.",
      "So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London.",
      "\u201cThese results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans below the surface that could be teeming with fish!\u201d.",
      "Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions. She said that she was delighted to hear about the new results, which have been published in the Journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\u201cThe results are fascinating, and I am really excited to see that there is potential for life in the Uranian system,\u201d she told BBC News.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m also so pleased that so much is being done with the Voyager data. It\u2019s amazing that scientists are looking back at the data we collected in 1986 and finding new results and new discoveries\u201d.",
      "Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as \u201cvery exciting\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt shows how important it is to look back at old data, because sometimes, hiding behind them is something new to be discovered, which can help us design the next generation of space exploration missions\u201d.",
      "Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research.",
      "It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years\u2019 time.",
      "According to Nasa\u2019s Dr Jamie Jasinski, whose idea it was to re-examine the Voyager 2 data, the mission will need to take his results into account when designing its instruments and planning the scientific survey.",
      "\u201cSome of the instruments for the future spacecraft are very much being designed with ideas from what we learned from Voyager 2 when it flew past the system when it was experiencing an abnormal event. So we need to rethink how exactly we are going to design the instruments on the new mission so that we can best capture the science we need to make discoveries\u201d.",
      "Nasa\u2019s Uranus probe is expected to arrive by 2045, which is when scientists hope to find out whether these far-flung icy moons, once thought of as being dead worlds, might have the possibility of being home to life."

    "summary": "Britain's oldest satellite is in the wrong part of the sky, but no-one's really sure who moved it.",
    "story": [
      "Someone moved the UK's oldest satellite and there appears to be no record of exactly who, when or why.",
      "Launched in 1969, just a few months after humans first set foot on the Moon, Skynet-1A was put high above Africa's east coast to relay communications for British forces.",
      "When the spacecraft ceased working a few years later, gravity might have been expected to pull it even further to the east, out over the Indian Ocean.",
      "But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles (36,000km) above the Americas.",
      "Orbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location.",
      "Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards. The question is who that was and with what authority and purpose?",
      "It's intriguing that key information about a once vital national security asset can just evaporate. But, fascination aside, you might also reasonably ask why it still matters. After all, we're talking about some discarded space junk from 50 years ago.",
      "\"It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,\" says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves.",
      "\"It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis.",
      "\"Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it,\" he explains.",
      "Dr Eves has looked through old satellite catalogues, the National Archives and spoken to satellite experts worldwide, but he can find no clues to the end-of-life behaviour of Britain's oldest spacecraft.",
      "It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name \"Skynet\" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise.",
      "But there's no connection other than the name and, in any case, real life is always more prosaic.",

      "MoD contracts Airbus for Skynet telecoms satellite",
      "How do we solve the problem of space debris?",
      "What we do know is that Skynet-1A was manufactured in the US by the now defunct Philco Ford aerospace company and put in space by a US Air Force Delta rocket.",
      "\"The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore. However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,\" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation.",
      "This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire.",
      "\"The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,\" the long-retired engineer told me.",
      "\"In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I'm afraid I can't remember,\" says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.",
      "Rachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has also been scouring the National Archives.",
      "Her readings have led her to one very reasonable possibility.",
      "\"A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?\u201d Ms Hill speculated.",
      "The official, though incomplete, logs of Skynet-1A\u2019s status suggest final commanding was left in the hands of the Americans when Oakhanger lost sight of the satellite in June 1977.",
      "But however Skynet-1A then got shifted to its present position, it was ultimately allowed to die in an awkward place when really it should have been put in an \"orbital graveyard\".",
      "This refers to a region even higher in the sky where old space junk runs zero risk of running into active telecommunications satellites.",
      "Graveyarding is now standard practice, but back in the 1970s no-one gave much thought to space sustainability.",
      "Attitudes have since changed because the space domain is getting congested.",
      "At 105 degrees West longitude, an active satellite might see a piece of junk come within 50km of its position up to four times a day.",
      "That might sound like they\u2019re nowhere near each other, but at the velocities these defunct objects move it\u2019s starting to get a little too close for comfort.",
      "The Ministry of Defence said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK's National Space Operations Centre. Other satellite operators are informed if there's likely to be a particularly close conjunction, in case they need to take evasive action.",
      "Ultimately, though, the British government may have to think about removing the old satellite to a safer location.",
      "Technologies are being developed to grab junk left in space.",
      "Already, the UK Space Agency is funding efforts to do this at lower altitudes, and the Americans and the Chinese have shown it's possible to snare ageing hardware even in the kind of high orbit occupied by Skynet-1A.",
      "\"Pieces of space junk are like ticking time bombs,\" observed Moriba Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.",
      "\"We need to avoid what I call super-spreader events. When these things explode or something collides with them, it generates thousands of pieces of debris that then become a hazard to something else that we care about.\"",

      "Initially, Soltanov suggested the potential sponsor might be interested in investing in some of the \"green transitioning projects\" Socar was involved in - but then spoke of opportunities related to Azerbaijan's plans to increase gas production, including new pipeline infrastructure.",
      "\"There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established,\" Soltanov says on the recording. \"Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.\"",
      "Soltanov then described natural gas as a \"transitional fuel\", adding: \"We will have a certain amount of oil and natural gas being produced, perhaps forever.\"",
      "The UN climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges there will be a role for some oil and gas up to 2050 and beyond. However, it has been very clear that \"developing\u2026 new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C\".",

      "It is now \"virtually certain\" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record, according to projections by the European climate service.",
      "Global average temperatures across the year are on track to end up more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which would make 2024 the first calendar year to breach this symbolic mark.",
      "These high temperatures are mainly down to human-caused climate change, with smaller contributions from natural factors such as the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",
      "Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.",
      "Many scientists expect the opposite, cooler phase, La Ni\u00f1a, to develop soon. This should, in theory, lead to a temporary drop in global temperatures next year, although exactly how this will play out is uncertain.",

      "But, with levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still rising quickly, scientists warn it is likely only a matter of time before new records are set.",
      "\"The warmer temperatures [are making] storms more intense, heatwaves hotter and heavy rainfall more extreme, with clearly seen consequences for people all around the world,\" says Prof Hawkins.",

      "While climate change did not play much of a role in this year's campaign, Trump's likely actions in office this time could be far more significant than in 2017.",
      "Back then, he announced the US would pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the most important UN process to tackle climate change.  The agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.",
      "But the shock of Trump's decision was limited. The treaty's rules meant the US was not able to withdraw until November 2020, a few months before he left office.",
      "If Trump withdraws again, he will only have to wait a year before the US is completely out. That would give him three years to chart his own course without any need to report to the UN or be bound by its rules.",
      "While President Joe Biden's negotiators will be at next week's COP talks in Azerbaijan, nothing they agree to will be binding for the Trump administration.",
      "\"The US at this COP is not just a lame duck, it's a dead duck,\" said Prof Richard Klein, an expert on climate change policy for the Stockholm Environment Institute.",
      "\"They can't commit to anything and that means that countries like China will not want to commit to anything.\"",
      "In recent years, richer countries such as the US, UK and EU states have tried to increase the funds available for developing countries to cope with climate change. But they also insist that big developing economies also contribute.",
      "\"The US basically wanted to have China cough up some money for that fund as well. Now they won't be able to do that. That leaves China off the hook,\" Prof Klein said.",
      "Climate scientists say developing countries need billions of dollars of extra investment to become net zero, where they are not contributing to climate change, and stave off the effects of rising temperatures.",
      "While the US might leave the Paris Agreement quite quickly, Trump would still be bound by other global efforts to fight climate change.",
      "There have been reports that some of his supporters also want to turn their backs on these as well. Some have argued for a complete break from UN efforts on climate change, urging the president-elect to leave something called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that underpins global collective action to tackle climate change.",

      "As well as these headline-grabbing international actions, the new Trump administration is likely to push for a major ramp up of oil and gas exploration within the US, roll back environmental protections as well as impose heavy tariffs on electric vehicles and solar panels coming from China.",
      "\"You are looking at, overall, a 'drill baby drill' philosophy,\" Dan Eberhart, chief executive officer of oilfield services company Canary LLC told Bloomberg News.",
      "\"You are going to see offshore lease sales, you are going to see pipelines move much quicker, you are going to see fracking on federal lands and a mindset that is focused on lowering energy costs for consumers.\"",
      "There was a big drop in the share price of turbine manufacturers on Wednesday, as fears grew that US offshore wind farms would be cancelled by a Trump presidency.",
      "But in the longer term, it is not clear if the new president will turn back the clock for  coal, oil and gas, or curtail the growth of sustainable energy sources.",
      "For a start he faces opposition - and notably from within his own party.",
      "Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which may ultimately channel $1 trillion of spending into green energy, has been hugely beneficial to Republican districts.",
      "According to one analysis, some 85% of the money has been in areas that elected Republicans.",
      "With energy watchdog the International Energy Agency reporting that global investment in clean technology is running at double the size of coal, oil and gas in 2024, the new US administration might not want to drive this type of green investment into other, more eager countries.",
      "Climate leaders are putting a lot of faith in the fact that the transition to green energy will not be derailed by the new Trump administration.",
      "\"The result from this election will be seen as a major blow to global climate action,\" said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 12:05:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The Northern Taurids are at their peak on 11-12 November - but will the clouds part to let us see them?",
    "story": [
      "Shooting stars may be spotted tonight as the Northern Taurid meteor shower peaks",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Sky watchers will be looking out for the Northern Taurids meteor shower which will peak overnight on Monday (11-12 November).",
      "The meteors can be seen from virtually anywhere on Earth but sightings will be affected by the phase of the Moon and the weather conditions.",
      "These showers, known for their slow-moving, long-lasting meteors, are linked to Comet Encke.",
      "There are two streams to the Taurids with the Southern Taurids having peaked earlier in the month.",
      "What is the Taurid meteor shower?",
      "The Taurid meteor shower is caused by the debris - ice and dust - from Comet Encke as it passes through our solar system.",
      "Each time Encke returns to the inner solar system, its nucleus sheds ice and rock into space into a vast debris stream. When Earth passes through this debris the \"comet crumbs\" heat up as they enter our atmosphere and burn up in bright bursts of light.",
      "Taurid meteors tend to be larger than other meteors and can survive for longer periods as they pass through Earth's atmosphere. They also travel relatively slowly, crossing the sky at about 17 miles (27km) per second. This is about half the speed of the Perseids.",
      "A recent theory as to why Encke has such a large debris stream is that it was once part of a larger comet that broke up about 20,000 years ago. It has the shortest orbital period of any known comet within our solar system, taking just 3.3 years to orbit the Sun.",
      "When is the peak?",
      "Encke's debris stream is so large and spread out that it takes Earth a rather long time to pass through it. This is why we experience two separate parts to the shower - the Southern Taurids and the Northern Taurids.",
      "The Southern Taurids run from about 23 September to 12 November and peaked earlier this month. Northern Taurids stem from a nearby but slightly different stream and are active from about 13 October to 2 December, peaking around 11-12 November.",
      "The Taurids are not very prolific, tending to produce only five meteors per hour but they can be very bright. The showers sometimes produce fireballs \u2013 a perfect target for astrophotography.",
      "There seems to be a seven-year cycle with these fireballs. There were lots of sightings of them in 2022 and the next best opportunity may be in 2029.",
      "How do I watch?",
      "You do not need any equipment such as telescopes or binoculars as the secret is to take in as much sky as possible and allow about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark.",
      "The best time to view is around midnight when the shower's radiant (the spot in the sky from which the meteors appear to emanate), the Taurus constellation, is high in the sky.",
      "To find Taurus, look for the constellation Orion and then peer to the north-east to find the red star Aldebaran, the star in the bull's eye. Shooting stars will be visible all over the night sky so move your gaze around the nearby constellations.",
      "Skies have been clearing over the past 24 hours, leading to improved viewing conditions.",
      "Will I be able to see them?",
      "Viewing the Taurids may be affected by the illumination of the Moon, which could obscure some of the fainter meteors. The Moon will be in a waxing gibbous phase \u2013 going from half moon to full moon.",
      "However, the weather is looking much more favourable for stargazing now. The recent blanket of cloud we have had for several weeks has moved off, leaving a clearer air mass and a much better view of the night sky.",
      "Fog patches may obscure the sky for some - especially across southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, north-west England and north Wales. Any fog will tend to sit in the valleys though, so head for higher ground in these regions to have a better chance of spotting some spectacular shooting stars.",
      "If you do miss this meteor shower you won't have long to wait until the next one, as the Leonid meteor shower is expected to peak next week on the morning of 18 November.",

      "But that is just one of the many twists and turns in the jaw-dropping story of Bitcoin, which continues to captivate people worldwide and has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes.",
      "Here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.",
      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

    "summary": "It can be hard to find good advice on how to make homes more energy efficient.",
    "story": [
      "When Simon Duffy gets another energy bill, his heart sinks. \u201cIt\u2019s madly expensive,\u201d he says.",
      "Mr Duffy lives in a traditional stone-walled detached house in Sheffield. He estimates that he spends \u00a33,100 every year on heating and electricity.",
      "Despite being someone who cares about climate change, and keen to retrofit his property to make it more efficient, there\u2019s a problem.",
      "\u201cThe whole question of how to better insulate the house is a real mystery to me,\u201d says Mr Duffy, a director of sustainability think-tank Citizen Network. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the expertise for that is.\u201d He also adds that he\u2019s also not sure whether he could install solar panels, given that he lives in a conservation area.",
      "Millions of homeowners across the country could be facing the same dilemma.",
      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",
      "\u201cEven though we\u2019ve got this background, and we\u2019re engineers as well, what we weren\u2019t entirely clear on was where was best to spend the money,\u201d says Mrs Peace.",
      "The couple spoke to multiple consultants, but Mrs Peace found the advice they received was often geared towards meeting Passivhaus standards \u2013 an ultra-energy efficient type of building.",
      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t many in that pragmatic middle space where you are literally saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this much money, where would we be best putting it?\u2019,\u201d Mrs Peace adds.",
      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",
      "\u201cWe can model all the different options that are available, suitable for your home and your budget, and identify a package of measures,\u201d says Liz Lain\u00e9, of Parity Projects, a housing data analysis company, which runs Ecofurb.",
      "The firm offers this initial consultation for free, but full plans, with personalised input from a retrofit coordinator, start at \u00a3470. Ecofurb can also oversee any works as they are carried out by contractors to avoid \u201chorror stories\u201d, says Ms Lain\u00e9.",
      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",
      "RICS, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has also just launched a new retrofit standard for its members \u2013 essentially, it encourages surveyors with the appropriate training to offer their services to homeowners planning or undergoing a retrofit.",
      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",
      "\u201cThe industry as a whole don\u2019t appreciate the importance of good retrofit advice,\u201d he says.",
      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",
      "He suggests that neighbourhood-scale schemes, for example to provide solar power to a whole street, might make more sense and could include more people in one go.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:03:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Big mining firms are switching to driverless trucks and other autonomous equipment.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

      "The \"serious and vicious attack\" also injured 45 people - among them elderly and children, local media report.",
      "Police say the 62-year-old driver, identified as a Mr Fan, appeared to have acted out of unhappiness over a divorce settlement.",
      "He was arrested as he tried to flee the scene and is in a coma due to self-inflicted wounds, police said in a statement.",
      "The incident has sparked a national outcry in China, where President Xi Jinping vowed \"severe punishment\" for the perpetrator, and called for \"all-out efforts\" to treat the injured.",
      "Details of those who were killed have not been disclosed by authorities yet, but mourners and members of the public had begun laying flowers and other tributes outside the stadium on Tuesday.",
      "The venue - featuring a running track loop - had been a popular exercise ground for locals. Witnesses told Chinese media it appeared Mr Fan had deliberately run people down.",
      "One man named Mr Chen told Caixin news magazine he and his walking group had just completed a lap of the stadium when a car charged towards them at high speed, \"knocking down many people\".",
      "Another person at the scene told Caixin: \"It drove in a loop and people were hurt in all areas of the running track.\"",
      "According to local police, who released a statement on Tuesday, they said their initial investigations suggested Mr Fan's actions were triggered by a property dispute following his divorce. He is still in a coma and so has not been questioned, police said.",
      "The attack may be the deadliest act of random public violence in China in recent decades. A number have been reported this year including a mass stabbing and firearms attack in Shandong in February which killed at least 21 people. That incident was heavily censored by Chinese authorities.",
      "Reports of Monday's attack were already being restricted online on Tuesday - with several videos taken by witnesses at the scene removed from Chinese social media platforms.",

      "The Hague court of appeal said it could not establish that Shell had a \"social standard of care\" to reduce its emissions by 45% or any other amount, even though it agreed the company had an obligation to citizens to limit emissions.",
      "Three years ago, a court in The Hague backed a case by Friends of the Earth and 17,000 Dutch citizens requiring Shell to reduce its CO2 emissions significantly, in line with the Paris climate accords.",

      "Shell has argued that it is already taking \"serious steps to reduce emissions\". It complained the original ruling was unfair as it singled out one company for a global issue, and said it was unrealistic to try to hold Shell accountable for its customers' choices.",
      "Shell said if people considered progress was too slow towards cutting emissions then they should lobby governments rather than Shell to change policies and bring about a green transition.",

      "All up, 14 of the 16 people stabbed that day were female - including five of the six  who were killed, and a nine-month-old baby. The NSW police commissioner said at the time that it was \"obvious\" Cauchi had targeted women.",
      "Tuesday's hearing laid out the areas of focus for an extensive inquiry which is due to begin in full in April 2025. The investigation will look into possible security lapses and failings in the mental health systems in NSW and Queensland, Cauchi's home state.",
      "Speaking in court, Dr Peggy Dwyer SC, the counsel assisting the coroner, said Cauchi had been off his psychotropic medication since 2019, despite authorities being repeatedly warned of his deteriorating state. Cauchi had come \"to the attention\" of Queensland police several times, she said.",
      "In her statement, Dwyer also provided the first detailed timeline of how the violence actually unfolded in Bondi that day.",
      "She said that Cauchi - who had been sleeping rough in the suburb of Maroubra on the morning of the attack - entered Westfield shopping centre around 15.30 (local), and began stabbing people roughly three minutes later, after removing his knife in line at a bakery.",
      "His first victim was Dawn Singleton, 25, followed by 47-year-old Jade Young and 25-year-old Yixuan Cheng. He then attacked Ashlee Good, 38, from behind.",
      "Good - who has been described by her family as an \"all-round outstanding human\" - then saw Cauchi stabbing her nine-month-old baby girl in her pram, and was further wounded trying to save the child's life, the court heard.",
      "Faraz Tahir, a 30-year-old security guard, was stabbed next, alongside a colleague. Onlookers at the time said he died \"trying to save others\".",
      "Cauchi fatally stabbed Pikria Darchia, 55, before being shot dead by NSW Police Insp Amy Scott, who had been on duty close by. Between the moment Insp Scott arrived and the moment she killed Cauchi just over a minute had passed, the court heard.",
      "In total, the attack lasted for five minutes and 43 seconds - yet no alarm sounded during that time.",
      "\"It\u2019s presently unclear why it took so long for the alarm to sound,\" Dwyer said.",
      "Before opening the hearing, state coroner Teresa O\u2019Sullivan acknowledged the pain and loss the broader community was still feeling as a result of the violence.",
      "\"I offer my sincere condolences to the family and loved ones who are here in court today as well as those who can\u2019t be here in person,\" she told the court, according to the Guardian Australia.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 04:59:18 GMT",
    "summary": "The apology comes after a report found 200,000 children and vulnerable adults were abused for decades.",
    "story": [
      "New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has formally apologised to victims of abuse in care homes, following an inquiry into one of the country's biggest abuse scandals.",
      "The historic apology, delivered in parliament, comes after a report found that 200,000 children and vulnerable adults had suffered abuse while in state and faith-based care between 1950 and 2019.",
      "Many of them included people from the M\u0101ori and Pacific communities and those with mental or physical disabilities.",
      "The government has since promised to reform the care system.",
      "\u201cI make this apology to all survivors on behalf of my own and previous governments,\" said Luxon on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt was horrific. It was heartbreaking. It was wrong. And it should never have happened,\u201d he added. \u201cFor many of you it changed the course of your life, and for that, the government must take responsibility.\u201d",
      "The inquiry, which Luxon described as the largest and most complex public inquiry ever held in New Zealand, took six years to complete and included interviews with more than 2,300 survivors of abuse in state and faith-based care institutions.",
      "The ensuing report documented a wide range of abuses including rape, sterilisation, and forced labour.",
      "It found that faith-based institutions often had higher rates of sexual abuse than state care; and civil and faith leaders fought to cover up abuse by moving abusers to other locations and denying culpability, with many victims dying before seeing justice.",
      "The findings were seen as vindication for those who found themselves facing down powerful officialdom, the state, and religious institutions - and often struggling to be believed.",
      "Almost one in three people in NZ care was abused",
      "Some survivors and advocates arrived in parliament Tuesday to hear the prime minister's apology, while hundreds of others tuned in through livestreams across the country. Luxon had earlier faced criticism for delivering the apology in parliament, as that meant many survivors could not hear from the prime minister directly.",
      "Survivors have argued that Luxon's apology rings hollow unless it is accompanied with proper plans for restitution.",
      "\"The effects of that trauma came through later on in life,\" Tupua Urlich, a M\u0101ori survivor who had given his testimony of abuse to the inquiry, told the BBC's Newsday programme. \"It's not just the physical abuse, it was the disconnection from my family, from my culture.\"",
      "\"Justice? No, not yet... These words are nothing unless they're followed by action, and the right kind of action that is informed by survivors.",
      "\"The government have proven that alone they're not trusted, nor capable, of providing the sort of change and service that we need.\"",
      "Details on a restitution scheme are not expected until early next year.",
      "Luxon said Tuesday that while the government works on a new financial redress mechanism for survivors, it would pump an additional NZ$32m ($19m, \u00a315m) into its current system.",
      "The inquiry had made over 100 recommendations, including public apologies from New Zealand authorities and religious leaders, as well as legislation mandating suspected abuse to be reported.",
      "Luxon said the government has either completed or is in the process of working on 28 of these recommendations, but did not give specific detail.",
      "A bill aimed at better protecting children in care had its first reading in parliament on Tuesday, after Luxon delivered the apology. The bill proposes, among other things, a ban on strip searches and greater restrictions on people working with young children.",
      "Luxon also announced a National Remembrance Day to be held on 12 November next year to mark the anniversary of Tuesday\u2019s apology.",
      "\u201cIt is on all of us to do all we can to ensure that abuse that should never have been accepted, no longer occurs,\" he said."

      "Out of all of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters, Derrick Evans has a particular reason to be happy with November\u2019s election results \u2013 he hopes the president-elect will give him a pardon for participating in the 6 January riot at the US Capitol.",
      "\u201cA pardon will be life changing,\u201d said Evans, who was a member of the West Virginia legislature when he and at least 2,000 others stormed the Capitol in 2021. It was part of an effort to overturn the results of the US election, inspired by the false belief that it was Trump, not President Joe Biden, who had won.",
      "He reached an agreement with prosecutors which saw him plead guilty to civil disorder and spent three months in federal prison in 2022. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he would pardon the rioters, whom he has called \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d. But who exactly will be pardoned - and when - is still an open question.",

      "Some of those who have been given the longest sentences, such as Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, did not participate in the violence inside the building. Instead, they were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other felonies for organising the melee.",

      "But with Trump - who still maintains, without evidence, that he was the winner of the 2020 election - coming back to the White House, the future of the investigation remains uncertain.",
      "Citing Justice Department sources, NBC News reported that officials are focusing on trying the \u201cmost egregious\u201d cases before Trump\u2019s inauguration on 20 January.",

      "Jonathanpeter Klein, who along with his brother Matthew pleaded guilty to several charges in July, asked for his sentencing hearing, scheduled for 15 November, to be delayed. That request too was turned down.",
      "Wendy Via, co-founder of the not-for-profit Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), said that there is already a sense of excitement amongst rioters and their supporters.",

      "Rather, he has said families could be \"deported together\", when asked whether deportations could be carried out without separating families.",

    "summary": "Justice DY Chandrachud retired as India\u2019s chief justice on Sunday. Many are debating his legacy.",
    "story": [
      "How will history judge my tenure?",
      "That\u2019s a question Dhananjay Yashwant Chandrachud, who retired as India\u2019s 50th chief justice on Sunday, asked just weeks before he finished his term.",
      "Justice Chandrachud said his mind was \u201cheavily preoccupied with fears and anxieties about the future and the past\u201d.",
      "\u201cI find myself pondering: Did I achieve everything I set out to do? How will history judge my tenure? Could I have done things differently? What legacy will I leave for future generations of judges and legal professionals?\u201d he said.",
      "The soul searching came at a time when many in India are also debating what legacy he leaves behind.",
      "Justice Chandrachud served more than eight years as a top court judge and as chief justice for the past two years. He presided over one of the most powerful Supreme Courts in the world with jurisdiction over India\u2019s 1.4 billion citizens.",
      "The top court is the final court of appeal, the final interpreter of the constitution and its judgements, which are binding on all other courts in India, routinely make news - although judges seldom do.",
      "But Justice Chandrachud, sometimes described as India\u2019s \u201cfirst celebrity judge\u201d and a \"rockstar judge\", has routinely hit the headlines.",
      "According to Arghya Sengupta of the Vidhi Centre For Legal Policy, the jurist was India's most prolific chief justice who wrote 93 judgements - more than his last four predecessors put together \u2013 including some on matters of seminal importance. He also made huge strides in terms of digitisation and livestreaming of court hearings \u2013 making them more accessible to citizens.",
      "But some of the recent coverage has also been unflattering, with critics saying he wasn't assertive enough and his tenure has been disappointing.",
      "The Harvard-educated judge has many firsts to his name \u2013 he was the youngest to head a high court and his two-year-term was the longest for a chief justice in more than a decade. He\u2019s also the only chief justice whose father also served in the role.",
      "During his years in the Supreme Court, he developed a reputation for being a progressive, liberal judge known for his nuanced and thoughtful judgements related to matters of liberty, freedom of speech and gender and LGBT rights.",
      "He was part of landmark rulings that decriminalised homosexuality and allowed menstruating women into Kerala\u2019s Sabarimala shrine. His utterances on the right to privacy and right to dissent were extensively praised.",
      "So, his elevation to be India\u2019s top judge in November 2022 was welcomed by senior lawyers, activists and citizens with many expressing a \u201cstrong hope that under his leadership the court will rise to greater heights\u201d.",
      "It was a time when India\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government was getting ready to secure a third term in the 2024 general election.",
      "Opposition parties, activists and sections of the press were accusing the government of targeting them, with global rights organisations saying Indian democracy was under threat.",
      "Although the government denied any wrongdoing, many of India\u2019s top academics, rights activists and popular opposition leaders found themselves in jail and the country kept sliding on the global press freedom index. (The government has always rejected such ratings, saying they are biased against India.)",
      "Senior lawyer Kamini Jaiswal says Justice Chandrachud\u2019s appointment had come at \u201ca crucial juncture as some of the last chief justices had left under a cloud of dark spots and the position had been denigrated with serious allegations\u201d.",
      "\u201cSo, we thought Justice Chandrachud would use his erudition and brilliant mind to do a lot of good for the citizens. But he has been disappointing,\u201d she said.",
      "Senior Supreme Court lawyer Chander Uday Singh says his record is \u201ca mixed bag\u201d.",
      "\u201cIn his judgments, he would lay down the law brilliantly which could be used as a precedent for future cases. But whenever the state was heavily invested in any issue, he failed to hold power to account, so the state got away with what they had set out of achieve.\u201d",
      "For instance, he points out that the court struck down a government scheme that allowed people to make anonymous donations to political parties, calling it unconstitutional and illegal. \u201cBut then he did not hold anyone accountable for the illegality.\u201d",
      "Similarly, when it came to a political crisis in the western state of Maharashtra or Delhi\u2019s power struggle with the federal government, his judgments tended to favour the government, he adds.",
      "\u201cThere was hope that through his judgments, he would set things right in a country that is under a strong majoritarian government. But he fell short.\u201d",
      "Several top lawyers have also criticised Justice Chandrachud for what he did as the \u201cmaster of the roster\u201d by failing to effectively prevent the prolonged incarceration of political prisoners - leading to the death of some of them without ever getting bail. This happened despite Justice Chandrachud saying that bail should be the norm and not the exception.",
      "And as he neared his retirement, Justice Chandrachud also made headlines for what he did not in the court, but outside.",
      "In September, there was uproar over a viral video that showed him praying at home with PM Modi during a Hindu religious festival.",
      "Ms Jaiswal said by publicising the photo, \u201ca message was being sent that the chief justice is close to the PM\u201d. Lawyers, former judges, opposition politicians and many citizens also criticised him saying \u201cthe presence of a politician at a private event erodes the perception of impartiality of the judiciary\u201d.",
      "Another burst of criticism greeted Justice Chandrachud\u2019s comment last month when he said he had asked God for a solution to the vexed Babri Mosque-Ram temple dispute. \u201cI sat before the deity and told him he needed to find a solution and he gave it to me,\u201d he said.",
      "The comment led to a firestorm of criticism, not entirely unexpected as the mosque-temple dispute has been one of the most contentious and religiously polarising issues in modern India.",
      "The mosque was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992. A five-judge bench, which included Justice Chandrachud, ruled in 2019 that the demolition was illegal, but still gave the disputed land to Hindus and a separate site for the mosque to be built. Earlier this year, PM Modi inaugurated a grand new temple at the site, fulfilling a longstanding promise by his party.",
      "So, no surprise then that Justice Chandrachud\u2019s comment, seen by many as religious, was extensively criticised.",
      "Retired high court judge Anjana Prakash told HW news that his comment was \u201cdramatic, filmy and laughable and it had brought down the level of judiciary\u201d.",
      "\u201cA judge has to decide cases on principles of law. Where does God come into a judgement? Besides, people have different gods. And if a justice from another faith had said this, would the reaction be the same?\u201d she asked.",
      "Justice Prakash and other critics wondered if he was cosying up to the government for a post-retirement assignment.",
      "In the days preceding his retirement, Justice Chandrachud addressed some of the criticism in interactions with the media.",
      "\u201cThe separation of powers doesn\u2019t mean antagonistic relations between the executive and the judiciary, it doesn\u2019t mean that they cannot meet,\u201d he said at an event by the Indian Express newspaper, adding that such meetings were not used \u201cto cut deals\u201d.",
      "\u201cThe ultimate proof of our good behaviour lies in the written word \u2013 in our judgements. Is it consistent with the constitution or not?\u201d",
      "Justice Chandrachud said his comment on seeking divine guidance was because \u201cI am a person of faith\u201d and \u201cto impute motives to judges is not right\u201d.",
      "He added that courts were facing pressure \u201cfrom lobbies and pressure groups\u201d and they would praise a decision critical of the government, but if he ruled in favour of the government, they questioned his independence.",
      "At his farewell on Friday, the outgoing chief justice said he was perhaps India\u2019s most trolled judge, but his \u201cshoulders are broad enough to accept all criticism\u201d.",
      "And at the weekend, he told Times of India that he believed he had \u201cleft the system better than I found it\u201d.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m retiring with a sense of satisfaction,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "As heads of Arab and Islamic states meet in Riyadh, Trump's victory raises questions for the region.",
    "story": [
      "As leaders of dozens of Arab and Islamic nations gather in the Saudi capital for a summit, there is widespread speculation about what a second Trump presidency will mean for the region.",
      "In sharp contrast to the fears voiced in Europe about Donald Trump\u2019s famous unpredictability, Gulf Arab countries tend to view him as a force for stability.",
      "Writing in the officially approved Arab News opinion column, the prominent UAE business leader Khalaf al-Habtoor says: \u201cIn a Middle East where security is paramount, Trump\u2019s focus on strengthening alliances and curbing extremist forces offers a way forward.\u201d",
      "Here in Saudi Arabia, Trump is viewed much more favourably than Joe Biden.",
      "Trump chose Riyadh for his first overseas trip as President in 2017, an idea reportedly brokered by Rupert Murdoch.",
      "Through his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Trump enjoys warm relations with the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known by his initials, MBS. The crown prince has never forgiven or forgotten Biden saying that Saudi Arabia needed to be made a pariah for its attitude to human rights.",
      "Trump\u2019s record in office is a mixed one when it comes to the Middle East.",
      "On the one hand he pleased Israel and upset the Arab world by recognising Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital as well as Israel\u2019s annexation of the occupied Golan Heights. But he also secured the Abraham Accords in 2020 which saw the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco establish full diplomatic relations with Israel and Sudan agree to do so.",
      "Trump was, and is, hawkish on Iran.",
      "In 2018, he pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Calling it \u201cthe worst deal in history\u201d, he shared the views of many governments in the region that the deal, aimed at curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, failed to tackle Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme while enriching the Revolutionary Guards with money then used to fund proxy militias around the region.",
      "In 2020, to Iran\u2019s fury but to the satisfaction of many in the Gulf Arab states, Trump ordered the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Quds Force.",
      "But today\u2019s Middle East is not the same as the one when Trump left the White House.",
      "Israel is at war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and exchanged blows with both the Houthis in Yemen and their backers in Iran.",
      "Under the Biden administration US influence in the region is seen to have waned with a White House largely ineffective at restraining its close ally, Israel, as it wages war in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House is thought likely to give Israel a freer hand to strike targets in Iran - like oil and nuclear facilities - that the Biden administration said were off limits.",
      "\u201cHis staunch support for Israel and aggressive stance towards Iran\u2019s destabilising efforts made him a key ally in the region, and his return to power is expected to intensify efforts to limit Iran\u2019s influence,\u201d former Israeli intelligence officer Joshua Steinrich says.",
      "But something else has changed in the region.",
      "Brokered by China, Saudi Arabia and Iran have agreed to put aside their differences, ending seven years of hostility, characterised most visibly by the war in Yemen where the Saudi air force bombed Iran-backed Houthi rebels.",
      "On Sunday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s military chief flew to Tehran to meet his Iranian counterpart, with both countries now talking about deepening their co-operation on defence and security.",
      "Ever since Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolution in 1979, Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab neighbours in the region have viewed Iran as a major threat to their security. But the surprise 2019 drone strike on Saudi oil facilities, attributed to Iran-backed militants in Iraq, was an uncomfortable reminder to the Gulf Arab states as to just how vulnerable they were to attack by Iran.",
      "So today, with an Arab and Islamic summit calling for an end to the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, there is both optimism and a degree of uncertainty about what a second Trump presidency will mean for the Middle East.",

      "Beheadings, mass killings, child abuse, hate speech \u2013 all of it ends up in the inboxes of a global army of content moderators.",
      "You don\u2019t often see or hear from them \u2013 but these are the people whose job it is to review and then, when necessary, delete content that either gets reported by other users, or is automatically flagged by tech tools.",
      "The issue of online safety has become increasingly prominent, with tech firms under more pressure to swiftly remove harmful material.",
      "And despite a lot of research and investment pouring into tech solutions to help, ultimately for now, it\u2019s still largely human moderators who have the final say.",
      "Moderators are often employed by third-party companies, but they work on content posted directly on to the big social networks including Instagram, TikTok and Facebook.",
      "The Moderators: Listen to the full story on BBC Sounds",
      "They are based around the world. The people I spoke to while making our series The Moderators for Radio 4 and BBC Sounds, were largely living in East Africa, and all had since left the industry.",
      "Their stories were harrowing. Some of what we recorded was too brutal to broadcast. Sometimes my producer Tom Woolfenden and I would finish a recording and just sit in silence.",
      "\u201cIf you take your phone and then go to TikTok, you will see a lot of activities, dancing, you know, happy things,\u201d says Mojez, a former Nairobi-based moderator who worked on TikTok content. \u201cBut in the background, I personally was moderating, in the hundreds, horrific and traumatising videos.",
      "\u201cI took it upon myself. Let my mental health take the punch so that general users can continue going about their activities on the platform.\u201d",
      "There are currently multiple ongoing legal claims that the work has destroyed the mental health of such moderators. Some of the former workers in East Africa have come together to form a union.",
      "\u201cReally, the only thing that\u2019s between me logging onto a social media platform and watching a beheading, is somebody sitting in an office somewhere, and watching that content for me, and reviewing it so I don\u2019t have to,\u201d says Martha Dark who runs Foxglove, a campaign group supporting the legal action.",
      "In 2020, Meta then known as Facebook, agreed to pay a settlement of $52m (\u00a340m) to moderators who had developed mental health issues because of their jobs.",
      "The legal action was initiated by a former moderator in the US called Selena Scola. She described moderators as the \u201ckeepers of souls\u201d, because of the amount of footage they see containing the final moments of people\u2019s lives.",
      "The ex-moderators I spoke to all used the word \u201ctrauma\u201d in describing the impact the work had on them. Some had difficulty sleeping and eating.",
      "One described how hearing a baby cry had made a colleague panic. Another said he found it difficult to interact with his wife and children because of the child abuse he had witnessed.",

      "Information and support can be found via BBC Action Line",
      "I was expecting them to say that this work was so emotionally and mentally gruelling, that no human should have to do it \u2013 I thought they would fully support the entire industry becoming automated, with AI tools evolving to scale up to the job.",
      "But they didn\u2019t.",
      "What came across, very powerfully, was the immense pride the moderators had in the roles they had played in protecting the world from online harm.",
      "They saw themselves as a vital emergency service. One says he wanted a uniform and a badge, comparing himself to a paramedic or firefighter.",
      "\u201cNot even one second was wasted,\u201d says someone who we called David. He asked to remain anonymous, but he had worked on material that was used to train the viral AI chatbot ChatGPT, so that it was programmed not to regurgitate horrific material.",
      "\u201cI am proud of the individuals who trained this model to be what it is today.\u201d",
      "But the very tool David had helped to train, might one day compete with him.",
      "Dave Willner is former head of trust and safety at OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. He says his team built a rudimentary moderation tool, based on the chatbot\u2019s tech, which managed to identify harmful content with an accuracy rate of around 90%.",
      "\u201cWhen I sort of fully realised, \u2018oh, this is gonna work\u2019, I honestly choked up a little bit,\u201d he says. \u201c[AI tools] don't get bored. And they don't get tired and they don't get shocked\u2026. they are indefatigable.\u201d",
      "Not everyone, however, is confident that AI is a silver bullet for the troubled moderation sector.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s problematic,\u201d says Dr Paul Reilly, senior lecturer in media and democracy at the University of Glasgow. \u201cClearly AI can be a quite blunt, binary way of moderating content.",
      "\u201cIt can lead to over-blocking freedom of speech issues, and of course it may miss nuance human moderators would be able to identify. Human moderation is essential to platforms,\u201d he adds.",
      "\u201cThe problem is there\u2019s not enough of them, and the job is incredibly harmful to those who do it.\u201d",
      "We also approached the tech companies mentioned in the series.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson says the firm knows content moderation is not an easy task, and it strives to promote a caring working environment for employees. This includes offering clinical support, and creating programs that support moderators' wellbeing.",
      "They add that videos are initially reviewed by automated tech, which they say removes a large volume of harmful content.",
      "Meanwhile, Open AI - the company behind Chat GPT - says it's grateful for the important and sometimes challenging work that human workers do to train the AI to spot such photos and videos. A spokesperson adds that, with its partners, Open AI enforces policies to protect the wellbeing of these teams.",
      "And Meta - which owns Instagram and Facebook - says it requires all companies it works with to provide 24-hour on-site support with trained professionals. It adds that moderators are able to customise their reviewing tools to blur graphic content.",

    "story": [
      "Herders scooping murky water from a small pond in grasslands in South Sudan are well aware of the dangers they face if they drink it.",
      "\"The water is dirty because this place has oil - it has chemicals in it,\" says their chief, Chilhok Puot.",
      "Nyatabah, a woman from this community raising cows in the heart of oil fields in Unity State, adds: \"If you drink it, it makes you pant and cough.",
      "\"We know it's bad water, but we don't have anywhere else, we're dying of thirst.\"",
      "A former oil engineer, David Bojo Leju, has told the BBC World service that flooding in the area is washing pollution into water sources.",
      "Large swathes of the state have been under water for several years after unprecedented flooding, which scientists say has been worsened by climate change.",
      "Mr Bojo Leju says the floods are a \"disaster\" and that pollution from mismanaged oil facilities is a \"silent killer\" spreading across the state.",
      "South Sudan is the world\u2019s youngest country and one of its poorest, with a government hugely dependent on oil revenue.",
      "Unity State, a major oil-producing state, has always experienced seasonal flooding. But in 2019, extreme rains brought a deluge that engulfed villages, grasslands and forests. Year after year of intense rainfall followed. The water built up, trapped on the clay soil.",
      "At the worst point in 2022, two-thirds of Unity State were submerged, according to the UN World Food Programme (WFP) - even now, it says about 40% is still under water.",
      "Mr Bojo Leju worked for eight years for the oil consortium Greater Pioneer Operating Company (GPOC), a joint venture between Malaysian, Indian and Chinese oil companies - with South Sudan\u2019s government owning 5%.",
      "After a major pipeline rupture five years ago, he started photographing and filming pools of oily water and heaps of blackened soil in locations in Unity State, including sites near Roriak, where the herders live.",
      "He says spills from oil wells and pipelines were \"a recurring situation\", and that he was involved in transporting contaminated soil away from roads, so it would not be seen.",
      "He tried to raise his concerns with company managers, but he says little was done and \"there was no treatment plan for soil\".",
      "Mr Bojo Leju also says \"produced water\" - water released from the ground when oil is extracted and often containing hydrocarbons and other pollutants - was not properly treated.",
      "There were reports of high oil content, above international standards, in the produced water \"every day in our morning meeting\", he says, \"and this water is injected back into the environment\".",
      "\"The question is where does water flow?\" he says.",
      "\"Up to the river, up to the water source where people drink, up to ponds where people catch fish.\"",
      "Mr Bojo Leju explains that \"some of the oil chemicals seeped down\" into the groundwater, where they will flow into boreholes.",
      "\"The water table is contaminated,\" he says.",
      "When intense rains began in 2019, earth dykes were put around some spilled oil \"but it was not enough to withstand the volume of water\", he adds.",
      "In Roriak, there is no data available about the quality of the water the herders drink, but they fear pollution is making their cattle sick.",
      "They say calves have been born without heads or without limbs.",
      "Unity State\u2019s agriculture minister blames the deaths of more than 100,000 cattle in the last two years on the floods combined with oil pollution.",
      "In a forest close to Roriak, a group of men and women chop down trees to make charcoal.",
      "They have walked for eight hours along dirt roads flanked by flood water to reach the forest.",
      "They say the only water they can find here is polluted.",
      "Even boiled \"it causes diarrhoea and abdominal pain\", says one woman, Nyakal.",
      "Another, Nyeda, wipes away tears, saying she needs the charcoal to sell, but is worried about her seven children, left with her mother for a week.",
      "\"She has nothing either,\" she says.",
      "Nyeda lives near the state capital, Bentiu, in a reed hut squeezed into a camp housing 140,000 people who have fled conflict or the floods. It is completely surrounded by flood water and protected only by earth dykes.",
      "There is some food aid, but many in the area survive by foraging for water lily roots and fish to supplement their rations.",
      "Safe water is scarce. Nyeda uses water from a borehole for washing and cooking, but needs money to buy drinking water.",
      "Health professionals and politicians in the area have told the BBC they fear pollution and the lack of clean water are taking a toll on human health.",
      "In a hospital in Bentiu, a mother has just given birth. Her new-born baby\u2019s nose and mouth are joined.",
      "\"They have no access to clean water,\" says Dr Samuel Puot, one of the doctors caring for the baby.",
      "\"They just drink from the river where water and oil are mixed. That might be the problem.\"",
      "He says there are \"many\" cases of children born with abnormalities, such as no limbs or a small head, in Bentiu and also Ruweng, an oil-producing area north of Unity State.",
      "They often die within days or months, he adds.",
      "Genetic testing can give clues about the causes of congenital abnormalities, but the hospital does not have the facilities, and results are often not conclusive.",
      "Dr Puot wants the government to keep a register of cases.",
      "As the data is not recorded systematically, it is not clear whether these anecdotal reports indicate an unusually high prevalence of congenital abnormalities.",
      "\"It is plausible that oil-related pollution could contribute to an increased risk of birth defects,\" says Dr Nicole Deziel, an environmental health specialist at Yale University.",
      "Environmental pollution is a risk factor for congenital abnormalities, alongside genetics, maternal age, infection and nutrition, she says.",
      "Some compounds released during the production of oil can affect foetal development, Dr Deziel adds.",
      "\"Anecdotal reports can serve as important indicators of environmental health problems,\" she says, but stresses that without systematic data collection, establishing evidence of a causal relationship is difficult.",
      "In 2014 and 2017, the German-based non-governmental organisation Sign of Hope carried out peer-reviewed studies close to other oil fields in Unity State.",
      "They found increased salinity and high concentrations of heavy metals in water nearer oil wells, as well as high concentrations of lead and barium in human hair samples.",

      "The government has commissioned an environmental audit of the impact of the oil industry, but the results are yet to be made public more than a year later than expected.",
      "Mary Ayen Majok, a senior politician from the ruling party, has been raising concerns about oil pollution for more than a decade.",
      "She is a member of the government and deputy speaker in the upper house of the South Sudanese parliament, and is from Ruweng.",
      "She says one of her own relatives has had a child \"born with deformities\" and believes many such cases are not reported because of fear of stigma or lack of access to medical facilities.",
      "Ms Majok says South Sudan \"inherited an industry that was based on bad practices\" when the country was formed in 2011 after it gained independence from Sudan.",
      "A five-year civil war broke out in 2013. For a nation facing conflict and heavily dependent on oil revenues, improving environmental responsibility has been \"at the tail of our priorities\", she says.",
      "Laws and institutions have been established but \"accountability is not that strong\", she says.",
      "\"Talking about oil is like touching the heart of the government,\" says Mr Bojo Leju.",
      "He spoke to the BBC in Sweden, where he has been granted asylum.",
      "In 2020 he was approached by South Sudanese lawyers who wanted to sue the government over oil pollution.",
      "He agreed to testify as a witness. But he says security personnel detained him, hit him on the head with a pistol and forced him to sign a document recanting his evidence.",
      "He fled the country soon afterwards. The lawyers did not pursue their case.",
      "The BBC asked the oil consortium GPOC and the South Sudanese president\u2019s office to comment on the allegations in this report, but they did not respond.",
      "Scientists are not sure whether the floods in Unity State will ever recede.",
      "Dr Chris Funk, director of the Climate Hazards Center at University of Carolina, Santa Barbara, says 2019 saw record sea surface temperatures in the west Indian Ocean, which \"would have been impossible in a world without climate change\".",
      "Warmer air can hold more moisture, and he says there was a \"strong link\" between these sea temperatures and the 2019 extreme rains over East Africa.",
      "Dr Funk says higher rainfall has continued since then over the Lake Victoria basin that feeds into South Sudan, but it is not clear whether this is a permanent new pattern.",
      "Temperatures in South Sudan have risen and are expected to rise further, he adds.",
      "This means extreme precipitation \"will be more extreme\" and, under some global warming scenarios, heat and humidity could mean some parts of the country \"would not be liveable\", he says.",
      "However, despite the floods and pollution fears, many here hope to return to a life of raising animals and living off the land.",
      "In Roriak, children fashion a miniature village out of the clay on the ground, complete with model huts and cows.",

      "Hwang Dong-hyuk is speaking to me on set as he films the second series of his dystopian Netflix thriller, which sees hundreds of debt-laden contestants fight it out for a whopping cash prize, by playing a string of life-or-death children\u2019s games.",
      "But another series was not always on the cards. At one point, he swore against making one.",
      "Given the stress it has caused him, I ask what changed his mind.",
      "\u201cMoney,\u201d he answers, without hesitation.",
      "\u201cEven though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn\u2019t make much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t fully finish the story,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first series was Netflix\u2019s most successful show to date, thrusting South Korea and its home-grown television dramas into the spotlight. Its dark commentary on wealth inequality touched a nerve with audiences around the globe.",
      "But having killed off almost every character, Hwang has had to start from scratch, with a new cast and set of games, and this time audience expectations are sky high.",
      "\u201cThe stress I feel now is much greater,\u201d he says.",
      "Three years after the first series aired, Hwang is even more pessimistic about the state of the world.",
      "He points to current wars, climate change and a widening global wealth gap. Conflicts are no longer confined between the rich and poor, they are playing out intensely between different generations, genders and political camps, he says.",
      "\u201cNew lines are being drawn. We\u2019re in an era of us vs them. Who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong?\u201d",
      "As I toured the show\u2019s playful set, with its distinctive brightly-coloured staircase, I picked up a few clues as to how the director\u2019s despair will be reflected this time around.",
      "In this series, the previous winner, Gi-hun, re-enters the game on a quest to bring it down and save the latest round of contestants.",
      "According to Lee Jung-jae, who plays the leading character, he is \"more desperate and determined\u201d than before.",
      "The floor of the dormitory, where the contestants sleep at night, has been divided in two.",
      "One half is branded with a giant red neon X symbol, the other with a blue circle.",
      "Now, after every game, the players must pick a side, depending on whether they want to end the contest early and survive, or keep playing, in the knowledge all but one of them will die. The majority decision rules.",
      "This, I am told, will lead to more factionalism and fights.",
      "It is part of director Hwang\u2019s plan to expose the dangers of living in an increasingly tribal world. Forcing people to pick sides, he believes, is fuelling conflict.",
      "For all those who were captivated by the shocking storytelling of Squid Game, there were others who found it gratuitously violent and difficult to watch.",
      "But it is clear from talking to Hwang, that the violence is fully thought out. He is a man who thinks and cares deeply about the world and is motivated by a mounting unease.",
      "\u201cWhen making this series, I constantly asked myself \u2018do we humans have what it takes to steer the world off this downhill path?\u2019. Honestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says.",
      "While viewers of the second series might not get the answers to these big life questions, they can at least be comforted that some plot holes will be filled in \u2013 like why the game exists, and what is motivating the masked Front Man running it.",
      "\u201cPeople will see more of the Front Man\u2019s past, his story and his emotions,\u201d reveals the actor Lee Byung-hun, who plays the mysterious role.",
      "\u201cI don't think this will make viewers warm to him, but it may help them better understand his choices.\u201d",
      "As one of South Korea\u2019s most famous actors, Lee admits that having his face and eyes covered and his voice distorted throughout the first series, was \u201ca little bit dissatisfying\u201d.",
      "This series he has relished having scenes without a mask, in which he can fully express himself \u2013 a chance he nearly did not get.",
      "Hwang tried for 10 years to get Squid Game made, taking out large loans to support his family, before Netflix swooped in.",
      "They paid him a modest upfront amount, leaving him unable to cash in on the whopping \u00a3650m it is estimated to have made the platform.",
      "This explains the love-hate relationship South Korea\u2019s film and television creators currently have with international streaming platforms.",
      "Over the past few years, Netflix has stormed the Korean market with billions of dollars of investment, bringing the industry global recognition and love, but leaving creators feeling short-changed.",
      "They accuse the platform of forcing them to relinquish their copyright when they sign contracts \u2013 and with it, their claim to profit.",
      "This is a worldwide problem.",
      "In the past, creators could rely on getting a cut of box office sales or TV re-runs, but this model has not been adopted by streaming giants.",
      "The issue is compounded in South Korea, creators say, due to its outdated copyright law, which does not protect them.",
      "This summer, actors, writers, directors and producers teamed up to form a collective, to fight the system together.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 03:59:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Vistara is operating its last flight on Monday as it completes its merger with Air India.",
    "story": [
      "Indian full-service carrier Vistara will operate its last flight on Monday, after nine years in existence.",
      "A joint venture between Singapore Airlines and the Tata Sons, Vistara will merge with Tata-owned Air India to form a single entity with an expanded network and broader fleet.",
      "This means that all Vistara operations will be transferred to and managed by Air India, including helpdesk kiosks and ticketing offices. The process of migrating passengers with existing Vistara bookings and loyalty programmes to Air India has been under way over the past few months.",
      "\u201cAs part of the merger process, meals, service ware and other soft elements have been upgraded and incorporates aspects of both Vistara and Air India,\u201d an Air India spokesperson said in an email response.",
      "Amid concerns that the merger could impact service standards, the Tatas have assured that Vistara's in-flight experience will remain unchanged.",
      "Known for its high ratings in food, service, and cabin quality, Vistara has built a loyal customer base and the decision to retire the Vistara brand has been criticised by fans, branding experts, and aviation analysts.",
      "The consolidation was effectively done to clean up Vistara\u2019s books and wipe out its losses, said Mark Martin, an aviation analyst.",
      "Air India has essentially been \u201csuckered into taking a loss-making airline\u201d in a desperate move, he added.",
      "\"Mergers are meant to make airlines powerful. Never to wipe out losses or cover them.\"",
      "To be sure, both Air India and Vistara\u2019s annual losses have reduced by more than half over the past year, and other operating metrics have improved too. But the merger process so far has been turbulent.",
      "The exercise has been riddled with problems \u2013 from pilot shortages that have led to massive flight cancellations, to Vistara crew going on mass sick leave over plans to align their salary structures with Air India.",
      "There have also been repeated complaints about poor service standards on Air India, including viral videos of broken seats and non-functioning inflight entertainment systems.",
      "The Tatas have announced a $400m (\u00a3308m) programme to upgrade and retrofit the interiors of its older aircraft and also a brand-new livery. They\u2019ve also placed orders for hundreds of new Airbus and Boeing planes worth billions of dollars to augment their offering.",
      "But this \u201cturnaround\u201d is still incomplete and riddled with problems, according to Mr Martin. A merger only complicates matters.",
      "Experts say that the merger strikes a dissonant chord from a branding perspective too.",
      "Harish Bijoor, a brand strategy specialist, told the BBC he was feeling \u201cemotional\u201d that a superior product offering like Vistara which had developed a \u201cgold standard for Indian aviation\u201d was ceasing operations.",
      "\u201cIt is a big loss for the industry,\u201d said Mr Bijoor, adding it will be a monumental task for the mother brand Air India to simply \u201ccopy, paste and exceed\u201d the high standards set by Vistara, given that it\u2019s a much smaller airline that\u2019s being gobbled up by a much larger one.",
      "Mr Bijoor suggests a better strategy would have been to operate Air India separately for five years, focusing on improving service standards, while maintaining Vistara as a distinct brand with Air India prefixed to it.",
      "\u201cThis would have given Air India the time and chance to rectify the mother brand and bring it up to the Vistara level, while maintaining its uniqueness,\u201d he adds.",
      "Beyond branding, the merged entity will face a slew of operational challenges.",
      "\"Communication will be a major challenge in the early days, with customers arriving at the airport expecting Vistara flights, only to find Air India branding,\" says Ajay Awtaney, editor of Live From A Lounge, an aviation portal. \"Air India will need to maintain clear communication for weeks.\"",
      "Another key challenge, he notes, is cultural: Vistara's agile employees may struggle to adjust to Air India's complex bureaucracy and systems.",
      "But the biggest task for the merged carrier would be offering customers a uniform flying experience.",
      "These are \u201ctwo airlines with very different service formats are being integrated into one airline. It is going to be a hotchpotch of service formats, cabin formats, branding, and customer experience. It will involve learning and unlearning, and such a process has rarely worked with airlines and is seldom effective,\u201d said Mr Martin.",
      "Still, many believe Vistara had to go \u2013 now or some years later.",
      "A legacy brand like Air India, with strong global recognition and 'India' imprinted in its identity, wouldn\u2019t have allowed a smaller, more premium subsidiary to overshadow its revival process.",
      "Financially too, it makes little sense for the Tatas to have two loss-making entities compete with one another.",
      "The combined strength of Vistara and Air India could also place the Tatas in a much better position to compete with market leader Indigo.",
      "The unified Air India group (including Air India Express, which completed its merger with the former Air Asia India in October) \u201cwill be bigger and better with a fleet size of nearly 300 aircraft, an expanded network and a stronger workforce\u201d, an Air India spokesperson said.",
      "\u201cGetting done with the merger means that Air India grows overnight, and the two teams start cooperating instead of competing. There will never be one right day to merge. Somewhere, a line had to be drawn,\u201d said Mr Awtaney.",
      "But for many Vistara loyalists, its demise leaves a void in India\u2019s skies for a premium, full-service carrier - marking the third such gap after the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways.",
      "It\u2019s still too early to say if Air India, which often ranks at the bottom of airline surveys, can successfully fill that void."

      "1) Raye gave an update on her missing song books",
      "Two weeks ago, Raye told fans her second album had been delayed by thieves who stole her car and, with it, several notebooks full of lyrics and song ideas.",
      "On the red carpet, she confirmed the police hadn't been able to track them down, saying: \"I've just had to let it go.\"",
      "The singer said she couldn't recreate a lot of the ideas, because the act of writing them down freed her mind to work on other things.",

      "2) Busta Rhymes revealed his unlikely comedy hero",
      "The decision to bring rap legend Busta Rhymes to Manchester to receive a global icon award wasn't as random as it sounded.",
      "Before he developed his rapid-fire rap delivery, an 11-year-old Rhymes spent two summers living with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe.",

      "To honour that moment, he gave a nine-minute acceptance speech thanking everyone from his mother to an art teacher he'd met backstage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty four years of professionally recording [and] this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels incredible.\"",
      "3) Olly Alexander had advice for next year's Eurovision contestant",
      "Olly Alexander played a pre-show party on Saturday night, and couldn't quite believe the reception for Dizzy - the song which earned him 18th place at this year's Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "\"That went down a lot better than it did in Eurovision,\" he laughed, shortly before Jedward invaded the stage and caused utter chaos.",
      "At the main ceremony, Alexander was there to award song of the year to Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso. But he also had a few words for anyone considering representing the UK at next year's contest.",
      "\"I would say to them, whoever it is, 'Call me, and we will have a serious conversation about it',\" he said with the haunted look of a man who has seen some things.",
      "4) Benson Boone has a new fan: Bez",
      "In addition to winning best new artist, US singer Benson Boone opened the ceremony with a spectacular performance that saw him suspended mid-air on a grand piano, before pulling off a spectacular front flip from a platform at the side of the stage.",
      "\"The insurance is always crazy,\" he laughed, \"but I love to perform.\"",
      "One person who couldn't believe his eyes was Happy Mondays star Bez, who accosted Boone during an interview with Rita Ora.",

      "\"Oasis are back and Jedward are back!\" they declared, before racing over to baffled German and French journalists, while singing Stop Crying Your Heart Out.",

      "Liam Payne won 12 MTV EMAs during his time in One Direction, and later used the ceremony to launch his solo career, performing his global smash hit Strip That Down at the 2017 ceremony.",
      "It was only fitting that the event marked his death - but striking the right tone in the middle of a huge showbiz event is never easy.",
      "In the end, his friend and collaborator Rita Ora just spoke from the heart.",
      "\"There were so many ways that we were talking about honouring him,\" she said. \"But sometimes simply speaking is enough.\"",

      "\"Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew,\" she said. \"He brought so much joy to every room he walked into. And he left such a mark on this world.\"",

      "8) Tyla paid tribute to Aaliyah",
      "South African star Tyla, best known for her viral hit Water, clinched both the best R&B and best Afrobeats awards.",
      "The awards marked her continued ascent, after being named one of the BBC's Sounds of 2024 - but she made sure to honour her inspirations.",

      "The exact same dress had previously been worn by US rapper Eve at the 2000 Soul Train Awards.",
      "And R&B legend Aaliyah wore a canary yellow version at the 2000 MTV Awards, where she won best female video for Try Again.",
      "The ceremony took place in September 2000, less than a year before Aaliyah's tragic death in an plane accident.",

      "Rail Baltica began as a grand project, but it has now become a strategic imperative: since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Baltics increasingly view their neighbour as an existential threat.",
      "Currently, there is no direct link that crosses the Baltics and connects with Poland.",
      "Rail Baltica will do that, cutting travel time and bringing economic and environmental benefits, but the costs of this ambitious scheme are mounting.",
      "Meanwhile, Baltic states and their Nato allies need the railway in place fast.",
      "Estonia's Infrastructure Minister Vladimir Svet said the rail link is vital amid the Russian war in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cHistory is repeating itself,\u201d he said. \u201cPutin's aggressive regime is trying to recreate an imperial project on the territory of the former Soviet bloc.\"",
      "The memory of decades of Soviet occupation is still fresh in the Baltics. Moscow deported hundreds of thousands of people from the region to Siberia.",
      "Estonia and Latvia share land borders with Russia, while Lithuania is adjacent to the Russian enclave Kaliningrad, which also shares a border with Poland, and Moscow's close ally, Belarus.",
      "About 10,000 Nato soldiers are currently stationed in the Baltics, alongside local troops. Their total number could reach 200,000 in a worst-case scenario.",
      "\u201cRail Baltica will increase military mobility and allow trains to go directly from the Netherlands to Tallinn,\u201d Cmdr Peter Nielsen, from Nato's Force Integration Unit, said.",
      "For Estonia's infrastructure minister, the railway is \u201can unbreakable link with the networks of Europe\u201d.",
      "Not far from the Estonian capital, Tallinn, at the tip of the railway, dozens of workers are welding and hammering away at the new \u00dclemiste passenger terminal.",
      "\u201cThis will be the network's most northern point, the starting point of 215km of railway in Estonia and 870km across the three Baltic States,\u201d said Anvar Salomets, CEO of Rail Baltica Estonia, stepping carefully across the embryonic platforms.",
      "Until now, the Baltics have used a Russian track width because their rail system dates back to the Soviet era.",
      "Passengers have to change trains to the European system when they get to the Polish border.",
      "The new network will use the European railway track width and connect seamlessly with railways across the EU.",

      "\u201cIt'll be a game-changer, decreasing the environmental impact across our whole transport sector,\u201d says Salomets, who foresees big economic benefits.",

      "\u201cThe vast majority of studies of existing high speed rail systems show a positive economic impact,\u201d said Adam Cohen of the University of California at Berkeley.",
      "But those benefits will not appear overnight and there is growing concern at the spiralling cost. Developers' estimates have increased fourfold since 2017 and now stand at \u20ac24bn.",
      "So far, the EU has subsidised 85% of the project and has just announced another \u20ac1.1bn.",
      "Estonia and Latvia have also come under criticism for focusing on putting up the rail terminals first before they build the mainline.",
      "French engineer Emilien Dang, whose RB Rail oversees the project, blamed recent global crises for the big spike in costs: \u201cOur initial estimate hadn't taken into account the Covid pandemic and high inflation - and the situation in Ukraine has dramatically increased the cost of material.\u201d",
      "As he walked across a big new terminal in the Latvian capital Riga, he also cited cultural issues.",
      "\u201cThe view from France, wrongly, is that the Baltics are one unit.  But they are three countries, with different regulations.\u201d",
      "The Baltic states have decided to split the project into two phases. The first, costing \u20ac15bn, will have a single instead of double track laid by 2030 and focus on the most important train stops.",
      "The second track and additional train stations are to be completed as part of a second phase with no specific completion date yet.",

She has her foot on the gas pedal! She's, like, doing a 12-hour day, shooting her show, jumping on a bus to go, you know, support the service industry in Sacramento with a handful of women.",

      "Seems like Danson's elders set a good example: his parents wouldn't allow a TV in their home. \"My mother didn't like them,\" he said. \"She'd rather you read, or go out and play, or be creative.\"",
      "But then, Danson got famous, on TV. \u00a0His parents finally got one. \"But they put kind of this beautiful tapestry over the front of it, so when you walked in their house, you didn't see a TV, you saw this beautiful tapestry with a candle on top, and they would take it off and watch 'Cheers,'\" he said.",
      "Danson still credits his success today to that one show about a Boston bar. But since he hung up his bartender apron in 1993, he's been in hit after hit. He was the title character in \"Becker.\" In \"Damages,\" he held his own with Glenn Close. He went to heaven and hell in \"The Good Place.\" And he's even played himself in \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"",
      "Along the way Danson has used his fame to draw attention to his passion project, Oceana, an organization dedicated to preserving the world's oceans. Asked if he feels they have made progress, he replied, \"Yes. I mean, our focus is fishing, over-fishing, making sure that the fisheries of the world are healthy. Because if done right, you could feed a billion people a fish meal every day.\"",
      "That sounds a little like a miracle \u2013 something he touches on in his new show, and something he says he lives with every day.",
      "Asked what are the miracles in his life, Danson replied, \"Mary Steenburgen is, you know, literally heaven-sent. I did some work on myself for about a year before I met her, after 'Cheers,' becoming emotionally mature and real. And I worked hard at it. And then along came Mary Steenburgen. \u2026 We are so blessed. To love somebody and to be loved, is just one of those heaven-on-earth miracles, you know? And that came with Mary.\"",
      "And the idea Ted Danson is hoping to share with his latest project is that miracles can be found in any life, right up until the very end. \"This is your life,\" he said, \"not just up to, you know, 65 and then you retire and are going down. No, you get to live right up until you don't live. And it's your life. It's such a gift. Explore it, and be excited about it. Yes, it hurts. Yes, it's sad. Yes, there's grief. Yes, there's all of that. But embrace it. Embrace it, is kind of what I think the message of the show is. It's what I hope I live with.\"",
      "He got emotional sharing that. \"I'm just emotional 'cause I finally said something I wanted to say!\" he laughed.",

      "\"We decided to just make one disc; there are no copies,\" he said. \"The germ of it was, I wanted to do something that couldn't be put online. It couldn't be commoditized. I'm not doing this to keep it away from anybody. I'm just doing it to work at the highest possible level.\"\u00a0The disc sold at auction in 2022 for nearly $1.8 million.",

      "Payne, 31, died on October 16 when he fell from a balcony of the Casa Sur Palermo hotel in Buenos Aires.",
      "One person, who authorities say spent time with Payne every day while he was in Buenos Aires, is charged with abandonment of a person followed by death, a charge that carries a sentence of five to 15 years in prison, according to a\u00a0news release\u00a0from Argentina's National Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor's Office released Thursday.",
      "The other two charged are accused of supplying Payne with drugs, including cocaine, and have been charged with two acts each of supplying narcotics. Officials did not say what the sentence for those charges could be.",
      "One of the people charged with supplying narcotics is a hotel employee, the prosecutor's office said. The three people charged have been notified of the charges, the prosecutor's office said, and have been prohibited from leaving the country.",
      "None of the suspects were identified by name.",
      "The release also stated that Payne died from a fall, and had not jumped from the balcony. Officials had not previously confirmed which version of events had happened, but the prosecutor's office said that Payne was likely \"not fully conscious or was experiencing a state of noticeable decrease or loss of consciousness\" at the time of the fall.",
      "\"For the prosecution, this situation would also rule out the possibility of a conscious or voluntary act on the part of the victim,\" the prosecutor's office said.",
      "The investigation included nine raids on homes in the region and dozens of interviews with hotel staff, Payne's family and friends and experts in the fields of medicine, biochemistry and psychiatry, the prosecutor's office said. Investigators also reviewed more than 800 hours of video footage from the hotel and public roads and conducted a forensic analysis of Payne's cell phone to review his digital footprint in the period leading up to his death.",
      "An autopsy was also conducted. After that, Payne's body was returned to his father, Geoff Payne, who had been in Argentina since the day after his son's death.",
      "Toxicology tests conducted as part of the autopsy showed that Payne \"only had traces\" of drug use in his system. There were \"traces\" of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant, the prosecutor's office said. Medical experts found that Payne only had injuries from his fall.",
      "All of the information gathered by investigators was summarized into a 180-page report presented to Judge Laura Bruniard, who oversees criminal cases. Bruniard approved the charges against the three people, but the investigation will continue, the prosecutor's office said, as investigators continue to try to access Payne's other personal devices.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:30:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",
      "Making the enhanced subsidies permanent would cost $335 billion over 10 years,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CBO.",

    "story": [
      "Idit Negrin would try anything to beat the trauma haunting her since attending the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, when Hamas massacred hundreds of civilians. \"We saw the terrorists, and they started shooting at us,\" she said. She ran for her life.",
      "Afterwards, \"I woke up every night, every night around 3 o'clock screaming and sweating and shaking. I think after a day, or two days after, I felt that I'm falling down, crying.\"",
      "We met her this summer as she was two-thirds of the way through her 60-session course of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). It's a treatment long used to combat compression sickness in divers, and wounds that will not heal. But at the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research, in Be'er Ya'akov, Israel, they're now also treating a very different malady: post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.",
      "Negrin described her experiences with PTSD: \"You feel like you're going crazy. I call people and scream, 'There is a terror attack again!' And then you understand that you have no control of your brain.\"",
      "Negrin is trying to regain that control, along with about 650 other October 7th survivors suffering from PTSD who are being treated, for free, alongside military veterans at the Sagol Center \u2013 currently the largest hyperbaric center worldwide.",
      "Dr. Shai Efrati runs this clinic, where they're treating up to 350 patients a day, and are on the forefront of this sort of medicine. \"What we are doing is actually tricking the body,\" Efrati said. \"Hypoxia, lack of oxygen, is the most powerful trigger to induce all the repair mechanism cascade.\"",
      "Efrati says they're inducing repair mechanisms in the body and brain inside these pressurized chambers, where it feels like you're scuba diving down to 30 feet. Patients breathe in pure oxygen, which under such high-pressure conditions the body can absorb at up to 16 times the normal level. Then, masks are removed for five-minute intervals.",
      "Efrati said, \"The decline from very high back to the normal is being interpreted at the similar level as hypoxia, as lack of oxygen. That causes the body to trigger the stem cells, and for the first time even in humans, we can see generation of new neurons, generation of new blood vessels in the brain. And this is mind-blowing.\"",
      "The treatment has been described as \"unapproved\" and \"not proven.\" \"When we speak about hyperbaric oxygen therapy, this is how it should look like,\" Efrati said.",
      "\"You're saying there are a lot of frauds out there?\" asked Doane.",
      "\"Indeed. And this is not only not good, it can be even dangerous.\"",
      "Dr. Efrati is constantly experimenting with new ways to use this treatment. At his clinic near Tel Aviv, we got to see how they're catering hyperbaric medicine to athletes (\"If we can shorten the recovery period, you can push harder doing the exercises\"), and helping patients with brain injuries regain movement through the growth of new neurons and blood vessels in the brain.",
      "\"It's not that we are fixing his running,\" Efrati said about one athlete's performance. \"We are fixing the brain.\"",
      "They've published several studies, looking at PTSD in veterans. One, out today, found that 68% of patients showed significant improvement. Another reported that PTSD remission lasted at least two years, which is higher than other established treatments. \"We want to evaluate everything objectively,\" said Efrati.",
      "It's conclusive enough for the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, to ask Efrati's team to stop testing and start treating. The doctor says that while you can always ask for more data, \"You see the evidence in front of you.\"",
      "Shachar Mizrhai was one of those IDF veterans referred in 2018 for the initial clinical trial. He was a soldier during a 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza and was in an armored vehicle when it was ambushed. In the short term, he was thinking about survival; the suffering came later. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"In the moment I put [on] the uniform, I feel like I want to die. I smell blood. I smell war.\"",
      "He'd tried drugs, therapy and sleeping pills. He contemplated suicide. \"Nothing really helped to get back to life,\" he said. \"And I heard that this might be help, and maybe this is my last chance before I finish my life.\"",
      "Dr. Keren Doenyas-Barak, who heads the PTSD program at the Sagol Center, followed Mizrhai through his 60 sessions, and showed us his brain scans from June 2018, and March 2019, highlighting activation of areas used to effectively regulate emotion, or process information. The later brain scan images were lighting up; that wasn't happening before the treatment.",
      "\"Many people tend to look at PTSD as a psychological phenomenon, not as a biological phenomenon,\" Doenyas-Barak said. \"So, we treat PTSD very similar to other brain conditions.\"",
      "For Mizrhai, the treatment changed everything:\" \"It's the first time that I was feeling again. I begin to sleep at night, I was less afraid. It's make me feel alive again. \u2026 I was a dying man, and after this, I'm a living man.\"",
      "North Carolina Republican Congressman and medical doctor Greg Murphy said, \"If it's being offered in Israel and they're getting such good results, why the hell are we not offering it in the United States?\"",
      "That's a question Murphy \u2013 a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs \u2013 is raising in the halls of Congress. One in 10 of his constituents is a veteran. \"I love our VA,\" he said. \"But we're not reaching a certain segment of our veterans if we're having 22 commit suicide every day. And if we're doing something and there is a treatment that has shown definitive results, I believe it's medical malpractice not to offer that to our veterans.\"",
      "In 2023 he introduced the Veterans' National Traumatic Injury Treatment Act. \"We just basically want the VA to do a pilot study within their own confines to see whether they show that hyperbaric oxygen works or not,\" he said.",
      "And what is he hearing from the VA? \"They just don't want to do anything; it's just hands up,\" he said. \"The reasons that we've heard is, 'Well, the results are mixed.' Fine. Look at the results in the last 15 years. Look at the studies in Israel. We are seeing an absolute effect in this, and other disorders, for Parkinson's, migraines, some even MS, neurological disorders.\"",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" requested an interview with the Department of Veterans Affairs, but they declined to comment.",
      "In Salt Lake City, Utah, we met Dr. Lin Weaver, who runs Hyperbaric Medicine at Intermountain Health. They treat about 20 patients a day, which puts into perspective the huge numbers - 350 daily \u2013 being treated in Israel. \u00a0He says they use their hyperbaric chambers for PTSD patients rarely, because it is expensive, but he has seen positive results: \"I've had patients that I've treated. Every one has got surprisingly better,\" Weaver said.",
      "But insurance companies say there is not enough proof it works for PTSD. And in the U.S., out-of-pocket costs soar above $50,000.",
      "\"What's necessary is like a drug trial,\" Weaver said. \"But these trials take years to accomplish. It all rests with, 'Is there an initiative? And is there a funding source?'\"",
      "Doane asked, \"But if doctors like you feel so strongly that this works, why isn't there enough push coming from folks like you to say, 'Prove this'?\"",
      "\"Well, believe me, we've tried,\" Weaver replied. \"I have submitted proposals to extramural funding agencies. So far, they haven't accepted them.\"",
      "Doane asked Dr. Efrati, \"You are out on the frontier here of medicine. Is there a danger in that?\"",
      "\"As a scientist, I will always tell you I need more study, I need more data,\" he replied. \"But as a physician, when I'm sitting in front of you looking at your eyes, you have a problem now. This is our job as a physician.\"",
      "Idit Negrin says this treatment is giving her hope she can move past that nightmare at the Nova Music Festival. She hopes, with the therapy, she can move on with her life.",
      "But she wears a reminder \u2013 a Nova necklace \u2013 while she gets treatment. \"I don't get her off my neck,\" she said.",
      "Her progress is motivation for Dr. Efrati to keep innovating, thinking about the future so his patients can process the past.",
      "Doane said, \"Some people are gonna listen to this and say it sounds too good to be true.\"",

      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign say.",
      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",
      "Kennedy's supporters argue that the election offers a mandate not just for Trump's platform overall but for Kennedy and his \"Make America Healthy Again\" proposals to combat chronic disease, citing the votes Kennedy may have delivered in Trump's favor.",
      "As one example, podcast host Joe Rogan initially voiced support for Kennedy and his ideas before later endorsing Trump.",
      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",
      "Other potential HHS secretary picks",
      "However, Kennedy is not the only name that has been floated by Republicans for the top job at HHS.",
      "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suggested Wednesday his top health official, state surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo, could be a candidate. Under Ladapo, the state's health department has warned some against getting COVID-19 booster shots, citing claims that federal health authorities and outside experts criticized as unproven or misleading.",
      "Other names floated by Trump allies in Washington include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former deputy HHS secretary Eric Hargan, who supporters think could be effective because he knows how to navigate the department's bureaucracy.",
      "But people close to the campaign say few Trump surrogates and supporters have spent as much time with the president-elect as Kennedy or plotted as ambitious an agenda.",
      "The two spent hours flying together in the final stretch of the campaign. Kennedy was also in Florida after the election, huddling with the president-elect's top ranks to weigh potential candidates to fill the administration.",
      "\"He's going to help make America healthy again. And he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it,\" Trump said on Wednesday morning after the election.",
      "Trump has previously said he's been friends with Kennedy \"for a long time\" and would let him \"go wild\" on many of his policy priorities, except for curbing fossil fuels.",
      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet,\" Trump said in New York on Oct. 27.",
      "Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform",
      "Kennedy's nomination would come at a key time for many of the issues he campaigned on, which he says underpin \"the chronic-disease crisis.\"",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of \"aggressive suppression\" of a range of products, including psychedelics \u2014 after MDMA failed to earn the agency's approval earlier this year \u2014 and raw milk, which officials have discouraged amid the ongoing bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "In the days ahead of the election, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to \"root out the corruption and the conflicts of interests\" in agencies that oversee drugs and vaccines, pledging to \"restore transparency\" and stop \"hiding science.\"",
      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",
      "His call for stopping water fluoridation comes as the Environmental Protection Agency is now facing a court order to take action against the practice.",
      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",
      "But were he to end up HHS secretary, some of Kennedy's aims would fall outside of his jurisdiction, like the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Other responsibilities under the broad HHS umbrella could consume much of Kennedy's time, some allies worry, distracting from his priorities.",

He is not, his skillset is not, as a bureaucrat administrator,\" said Dr. Robert Malone, a longtime Kennedy ally who was with him and Trump on election night.",
      "Malone said he had spoken with many of the aides from some of the \"at least four different HHS transition teams\" under Trump, but not personally with Kennedy, in recent weeks about the future of the department.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it would seek to pull a widely used ingredient in cough and cold medicines from the market, after the agency's scientists concluded that the oral version of the drug is ineffective as a nasal decongestant.",
      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",
      "\"Based on our review of available data, and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant,\" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release.",
      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",

      "The FDA's proposal caps a push by pharmacy professors at the University of Florida who have urged the agency for years to pull the product, pointing to new data showing phenylephrine did no better than a placebo when swallowed.",
      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",
      "The researchers also have questioned the initial studies that were run to prove the drug's effectiveness, though they acknowledge that it is safe at currently approved levels.",

    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 10:46:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Could the tariffs Trump's threatened to slap on Chinese imports backfire and help Beijing? Some experts say they will.",
    "story": [
      "Hong Kong \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap up a tariff of up to 60% on all goods imported to the U.S. from China. While that may sound like a potent economic threat to a country where economic growth is already faltering, could it actually be just what China needs?",
      "\"I do expect U.S.-China economic relations to be more volatile under Trump, but I think overall, this may turn out to be better for China,\" Chen Zhiwu, the top finance professor at the University of Hong Kong and a former professor at Yale University, told CBS News.",
      "Chen said if Trump does follow through with his threat of such steep tariffs on China, it \"might force the leadership in Beijing to have no other choice but to focus on the economy \u2014 especially given that the Chinese economy right now is in very big trouble.\"",
      "Since the start of Trump's first term in the White House, and through President Biden's term, China's economic growth has slowed from roughly 7% to 4.5%. The country's property market has crashed because of massive overbuilding, leading to the rise of empty ghost cities. Youth unemployment rocketed to a new high of nearly 19% in September, dimming prospects for China's future workforce.",
      "Beijing's intense focus over the past decade on bolstering its military to meet its geopolitical ambition of rivaling the U.S. and its European and Asia-Pacific allies has further sacrificed opportunities for domestic economic growth, said Chen.",
      "\"If you count the number of warships, China has by far the highest number of warships than any country, higher than even the U.S.' naval ships. What industries have grown the most so far this year? Definitely those warfare-related industries have gone up the most, but those consumer-oriented industries have had no growth or negative growth,\" he said.",
      "Most of China's top 20 aerospace and defense stocks have recorded double-digit growth over the past year alone.",
      "Tariffs \"a good thing for China for the long term\"?",
      "\"The pressure the U.S. is putting on China will become a good thing for China for the long term,\" agreed Wang Xiangwei, a former editor-in-chief of the Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post.",
      "China has relied on two primary engines to support rapid economic growth over the past 40 years, since former leader Deng Xiaoping initiated reforms and started opening the country up, Wang told CBS News. Those have been manufacturing cheap exports for the world by leveraging China's long-cheap labor force, and later, spending billions on domestic infrastructure including roads, rail and airports.",
      "But labor has become more expensive with the rise of China's booming middle class, and the government is running out of new things to build across the country.",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "Beijing has found it difficult, meanwhile, to fire up a potential third engine of economic growth: The capacity of the country's 1.3 billion people to consume domestically made products.",
      "Trump's threatened tariffs could give a needed external push for that to change, said Wang.",
      "\"I believe China's going to suffer in the short term. In the long term, he's [Trump] going to help China to make that painful transition,\" Wang said, noting that in the U.S., domestic consumption accounts for 70% to 80% of the national GDP, while in China, it's \"only about 60%.\"",
      "In effect, pushing China's own people to buy more of their country's own goods and services could, in the view of the two analysts, prove to be Beijing's best protection against Trump's threatened tariffs.",
      "\"The best tool would be to stimulate consumption growth inside China,\" said Chen. \"At the moment, the leadership has not really tried to help the Chinese consumers by sending them government checks and even tax costs to corporations. I think if the Chinese government really moves in that direction more aggressively, then it would help the Chinese economy generate more internal domestic consumption demand to make up for some of their possible lost exports to the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing needs Washington, but tariffs could have a complex impact",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 25% on Chinese agricultural products imported to the U.S., including seafood, pork and dairy. Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs, kicking off a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "Nearly eight years later, however, Beijing appears less able to wage such a war, due to its close economic links with the U.S.",
      "\"In terms of retaliation choices for China, it's very limited,\" said Chen. \"China imports a lot of agricultural products like soybeans, corn. They may try to import more such agricultural products from Brazil, and also from Russia as one of their ways to retaliate against the U.S. But at the end of the day, China imports so much [computer] chips from Nvidia, Intel, especially Qualcomm,\" Wang said. \"Those products are what China needs. So, China cannot produce internally.\"",
      "In effect, if Beijing does impose retaliatory tariffs, it could be shooting itself in the proverbial foot. Tariffs would make all those products, vital to China's continued economic and technological development, more expensive for its own people.",
      "But another possible impact of Trump's expected protectionist policies could actually be to push some of America's oldest allies and trade partners closer to China, reversing the so-called decoupling of the U.S. and Western European economies from Beijing that Washington has pushed under Mr. Biden.",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "\"The Biden administration did such a good job to more or less unite that,\" said Chen. \"If Trump makes the EU and NATO member countries upset, that makes it more possible for Germany, for France or Italy or even the U.K. to warm up more with China on the trade front. So, that may help neutralize, to some extent, the negative impact of the expected Trump tariffs on Chinese goods.\"",
      "Trump has claimed repeatedly that foreign companies would foot the bill, effectively absorbing the additional costs of exporting to the U.S. market imposed by his tariffs, but many economists disagree, and say it would effectively be a tax on American consumers.",
      "According to findings released by the National Retail Federation last week, U.S. consumers could lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power per year on everything from clothes and toys to household appliances and travel goods if there is a 60% blanket tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",
      "All of that said, and despite Trump's history of anti-China rhetoric, it remains unclear how quickly his administration might actually move to roll out sweeping tariffs, with some economists speculating that the president-elect plans, initially at least, to use the threat of additional levies as a cudgel to negotiate more favorable trade terms with Beijing. Trump could also choose to gradually phase in tariffs, delaying their full impact on China's economy.",
      "Will China attack Taiwan, and would Trump come to the rescue?",
      "Trump's return to the White House may also help Beijing further its interests with Taiwan, the democratically governed island of 23 million people just off China's east coast that the country considers a renegade province. President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under Beijing's control, by force if necessary.",
      "Since the U.S. government enacted the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, the U.S. is strategically committed to aid in Taiwan's defense in the event of any aggression, including by selling weapons to the island's government.",
      "Open to interpretation, however, and left deliberately vague in the U.S. law, is whether Washington is obligated to directly defend Taiwan, using the power of the American military, if it does come under attack.",
      "President Biden, during his first term, said Washington would, breaking with the long-time policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the Biden White House later returned to.",
      "\"The sovereignty over Taiwan is the red line of all the red lines,\" Wang told CBS News. \"Trump, in his presidential campaign speeches, he made it very clear\u2026 [that he's] unlikely to send troops to defend Taiwan.\"",
      "\"I believe that China's not going to invade Taiwan anytime soon,\" Wang added, noting that Beijing has \"so many problems it'll have to fix at home.\"",
      "If Beijing did invade Taiwan, the fallout would be felt worldwide.",
      "\"That would be a devastating hit to the global economy,\" said Chen. \"I hope that it would not happen. So, maybe now, given the challenges with the Chinese economy, the leadership is realizing that without a stable economy, then all its global geopolitical ambitions would not have any economic foundation.\"",

Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",
      "Making the enhanced subsidies permanent would cost $335 billion over 10 years,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CBO.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Measure that would repeal so-called \"government pensions offset\" has been gaining support in House.",
    "story": [
      "The House is expected to try to pass a Social Security-related bill this week to ensure benefits for workers who are also eligible for other pensions, despite a surprise move by hard-right Freedom Caucus leaders to derail the effort.",
      "It's a quick turnaround to salvage what had been a bipartisan effort to pass the bill, called the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, during what's now the lame-duck post-election period of the Congress.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal the so-called \"government pensions offset,\" or GPO, which reduces Social Security spousal or widow(er) benefits for those who receive noncovered pensions, according to the Social Security Administration's\u00a0website.",
      "The summary also says the bill also eliminates the so-called \"windfall elimination provision\" that \"in some instances reduces Social Security benefits for individuals who also receive a pension or disability benefit from an employer that did not withhold Social Security taxes.\"",
      "Such pensions are paid by employers \u2014 typically, state and local governments or non-U.S. employers \u2014 that do not withhold Social Security taxes from employee salaries.",
      "\"The GPO reduces the spousal or widow(er) benefit by two-thirds of the monthly non-covered pension and can partially, or fully, offset an individual's spousal/widow(er) benefit, depending on the amount of the non-covered pension,\" according to SSA.gov.",
      "The bill would repeal the GPO provision and reinstate full Social Security benefits.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, an individual with a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security, who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension, would see their Social Security benefit reduced by $667, or two-thirds the non-covered pension amount. That leaves them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit.",
      "If the GPO measure is repealed, the same individual would be entitled to the entire $900 spousal benefit amount without an offset reduction.",
      "Does the bill have bipartisan support?",
      "Yes, the bill was introduced by a Republican, Rep. Garrett Graves of Louisiana, and a Democrat, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and it has gained support in the House. A robust 300 lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have signed on to it.",
      "Other groups have also supported the bill, such as the National Association of Counties, which represents county governments. That group says that eliminating the GPO would help county governments recruit workers at a time when many are facing labor shortages.",
      "What happened next to the bill?",
      "To force the legislation forward, the sponsors of the bill, Rep. Graves and Rep. Spanberger, this fall used a rarely successful process called a discharge petition.",
      "They collected the minimum 218 signatures needed from House lawmakers to dislodge the bill from committee and send it to the floor for a vote.",
      "The move is often seen as an affront to House leaders, particularly the House speaker and the majority leader who determine the floor schedule.",
      "But Spanberger and Graves \u2014 who both did not seek reelection \u2014 had little to lose. Besides, Johnson backed the bill before becoming speaker.",
      "Did the House Freedom Caucus block the Social Security bill?",
      "Two leaders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus intervened when the rest of Congress was away from Capitol Hill, mostly in home states for Election Day.",
      "The Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., and former chair Rep. Bob Goode, R-Va., used a routine pro forma session of the House on Nov.\u00a05 to swiftly table part of the measure.",
      "The Freedom Caucus tends to block new spending. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add some $196 billion to the federal deficit over a decade.",
      "Graves said that's the amount people are missing out on without reinstating full Social Security benefits.",
      "But in tabling the legislation the conservatives actually set back its procedural rule, but not the bill itself.",
      "The legislation is expected to move forward with a House vote anyway, possibly in the week ahead.",
      "Could the Social Security Fairness Act still pass?",
      "Yes, but that said, passage will now be tougher, requiring a supermajority threshold rather than a simple majority as had been planned under the rule that the Freedom Caucus leaders turned back.",
      "If it passes the House, it's unclear if the bill has enough support to clear the Senate. But the wide margin in the House indicates potentially broad support.",
      "It would then go to President Joe Biden's desk. If signed into law, the summary says the changes are effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",

    "summary": "Medicare's Part B monthly premium is outpacing both inflation and Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment.",
    "story": [
      "America's seniors will pay more for their health care in the new year, as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has announced that premiums for its Part B plan will increase by about 6% in 2025.",
      "Part B covers visits to doctors, outpatient care, preventative services such as vaccines, medical equipment like wheelchairs as well as home health care. (Part A, which covers inpatient care in hospitals and other facilities, is premium-free for all but about 1% of beneficiaries due to taxes paid by most retirees while they worked.)",
      "What is the Medicare Part B premium for 2025?",
      "The standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B enrollees will climb by $10.30, or about 6%, to $185.00 from $174.70 in 2024, CMS said\u00a0Friday.",
      "Meanwhile, the annual deductible for all Medicare Part B beneficiaries will rise to $257 in 2025 from $240.",
      "The reason for the 2025 premium and deductible increases is due to \"projected price changes and assumed utilization increases that are consistent with historical experience,\" according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "The premium stood at $164.90 in 2023, when the cost fell just over $5 from the year before, a rare decline.",
      "How does that compare with the Social Security COLA?",
      "Medicare's Part B premiums have generally outrun inflation as well as Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA).",
      "Yearly inflation climbed 2.4% in September, while the Social Security COLA for next year will be 2.5%, or an average of $50 more per household.",
      "What do higher-income Medicare enrollees pay?",
      "Given that a beneficiary's Part B monthly premium is based on one's income, wealthier Americans also pay an Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount, or IRMAA, which impacts about 8% of those with Medicare Part B, CMS stated.",
      "Those who are married and lived with their spouses at any time during the year, but who file separate tax returns with modified adjusted gross income of $106,000 or less, will pay just the Medicare Part B premium of $185.00 a month.\u00a0Beneficiaries with incomes above $106,000 but below $394,000 are looking at paying IRMAA of $406.90 plus the standard $185.00, or $591.90 a month.\u00a0Seniors with incomes in excess of $394,000 will pay $443.90 in IRMAA and the standard $185.00, or a total of $628.90 a month.",

      "Medicare enrollees who are already getting Social Security benefits can expect the new 2025 Part B premium to be automatically deducted from their Social Security checks in January.",

      "\"We have been planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly,\" CEO Edward Rosenfeld told analysts on the call. \"We've worked hard over a multiyear period to develop our factory base and our sourcing capability in alternative countries, like Cambodia, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil, etc.\"",
      "The company started implementing the plan Wednesday, Rosenfeld said. Currently, more than 70% of Steve Madden U.S.'s imports are from China. Rosenfeld aims to cut that figure by 40%-45%, up from a target of 10%.",

      "Trump, who is the biggest shareholder of Trump Media with a 57% stake, said the business has been the target of \"probably illegal rumors and/or statements\" that he said allege he plans to sell shares of the company, which owns the Truth Social platform. In September, Trump had vowed not to sell his stake after a lock-up period expired for Trump Media insiders, allowing them to sell for the first time since the stock went public in March.",

A blind trust is managed by an independent trustee, and the president or other official who created the trust isn't allowed to advise or consult with the trustee on business decisions.",

(Weisselberg was\u00a0released from jail\u00a0in July after pleading guilty to giving false testimony about the size of Trump's triplex apartment as part of a civil fraud trial.)",

      "CoreCivic, which closed at $13.50 a share on November 5, is trading at $22 a share, while Geo Group, which closed at $15 a share Tuesday, is currently trading at $23.75.",
      "\"Obviously, investors believe there is going to be a significant increase in opportunity for both of these firms under the Trump administration,\" Noble Capital Markets analyst Joe Gomes told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Geo Group executives acknowledged on the company's third-quarter earnings call Thursday that it expects the incoming administration to enact stricter border security policies and that the company stands \"ready to provide additional resources to help ICE meet future needs.\"",
      "CoreCivic executives also said they believe the election result will drive demand for its services.",
      "ICE is biggest customer",
      "During Trump's first term in office, from 2017-2021, immigration detention expanded at record levels, according to an ACLU report. In 2019, ICE detained an average of over 50,000 people each day. At times, that number exceeded 56,000 \u2014 about 50% more than peak levels during the Obama administration, according to the report. During his first term in office, Trump expanded the federal government's use of private prison companies to detain immigrants.",
      "As of January 2020, 81% of people detained in ICE custody across the U.S. were held in facilities owned or managed by private prison corporations, according to the ACLU report.",
      "In his second term, President-elect Trump promises a radical shift in policy at the U.S.-Mexico border from his predecessor. That includes a pledge to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history, which could bring significantly more business to CoreCivic and Geo Group.",
      "For the first nine months of 2024, ICE accounted for 30% of each company's revenue.",
      "Both Geo Group and CoreCivic said they currently have excess capacity to accommodate a larger population of detainees. CoreCivic executives noted that they're taking steps to prepare to activate additional capacity to meet ICE's needs. That could include reconfiguring facilities to accommodate a bigger intake area, they noted.",
      "\"There is room for an uptick in occupancy from a capacity standpoint and both companies expect an ask from the Trump administration for more beds. The question is how much, and we just don't know right now,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Brian Violino told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Monitoring",
      "Geo Group also provides monitoring services for ICE under its Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), a monitoring program using wearable technology that serves as an alternative to detention.",
      "\"If there is a finite number of beds and a significant number of people are detained, which Trump is discussing in his plans, there could be an increased usage in this alternative to detention,\" Violino said.",
      "Geo Group executives said they have the necessary technology and staffing resources to scale up the contract to more than several million participants, if necessary.",
      "Funding from Congress",
      "The degree to which ICE expands its contracts with the two largest private prison companies depends on how big of an increase in funding Congress authorizes. While Republicans won the Senate majority in Tuesday's election, it remains to be seen which party will obtain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "\"That's a big part of the story, and if it's a Republican sweep, it will be easier for Trump to get funding from Congress to support this operation he's looking to do,\" Violino said.",

    "story": [
      "Between finding openings, sending out your resume and interviewing, looking for a job is tough. Now a growing trend of\u00a0scammers\u00a0impersonating recruiters is making it even harder.",
      "In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised.",
      "Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information.",
      "\"We've really seen tremendous growth in job scams,\" Velasquez said. \"I think that's just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.\"",
      "It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.",
      "After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment she'd need for the job.",
      "A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That's when she learned the job was a scam.",
      "\"I'm a little traumatized,\" said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.",
      "If you're a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers:",
      "Job scams are a type of\u00a0impersonation scam.",
      "Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.",
      "\"They're going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,\" she said. \"And they're often saying it's a 100% remote position because that's so appealing to people.\"",
      "Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver's license details.",
      "The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.",
      "Other details don't generally need to be shared with an employer until after you've gotten an offer.",
      "Whether you're replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn't initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.",
      "Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.",
      "Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:",
      "\u2014 Don't respond to the message right away.",
      "\u2014 Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.",
      "\u2014 Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.",
      "\u2014 If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.",
      "If you receive a message from a recruiter, it's best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.",
      "In Islam's case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.",
      "A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "\"If you deposit a check and it's fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,\" Puig said.",
      "So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.",
      "When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.",
      "\"Don't let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,\" Velasquez said.",
      "After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter's email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.",
      "\"This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can't just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,\" Islam said.",
      "If you or a family member is a victim of a scam, it's good practice to report it on the\u00a0FTC's website.",

    "summary": "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" says Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanse.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",
      "Most social media companies have policies that bar children under the age of 13 from setting up accounts, but a 2022 study conducted by the U.K.'s media regulator Ofcom found that nearly 80% of children in the country had social media accounts by the age of 12.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",

      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",

      "Americans stand to lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods due to the new tariffs, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released Monday.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said\u00a0in a statement. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",

      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy - and your money",
      "For example, a $40 toaster oven would retail for $48 to $52 after the tariffs, while a $50 pair of running shoes would jump to to $59 to $64, according to the industry trade group. A $2,000 mattress and box spring set would cost $2,128 to $2,190, the NRF said.",
      "During President-elect Trump's first term in office, his administration imposed tariffs of up to 25% on more than $360 billion in products from China. President Joe Biden's White House kept most of those tariffs and added more onto goods including Chinese electric cars and microchips.",
      "Now, Trump has said he plans to impose a 60% tax on goods from China and a 10% to 20% levy on all of the $3 trillion in foreign goods the U.S. imports annually. Such sweeping tariffs would reignite inflation, as they would mostly be paid by U.S. consumers, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, offering a general view widely\u00a0shared by\u00a0other economists on both sides of the political aisle.",
      "\"A consistent theoretical and empirical finding in economics is that domestic consumers and domestic firms bear the burden of a tariff, not the foreign country,\" the nonpartisan Budget Lab at Yale University stated in an\u00a0analysis published in mid-October.",
      "Trump has repeatedly contended that foreign companies would foot the bill, telling a gathering last month at the Economic Club of Chicago that \"the countries will pay\" the tariffs. In reality, American importers pay the tariffs to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency when their goods cross the border.",
      "\"These policy steps would amount to regressive tax cuts, only partially paid for by regressive tax increases,\" and cost a typical middle-income household about $1,700 in increased taxes a year,\" according to economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The proposed tariffs would shift tax burdens from the well-off to lower-income Americans, the nonprofit also stated in a policy\u00a0brief\u00a0published in August.",
      "For now, it is unclear when the new Trump regime could seek to stiffen tariffs. The process to complete legislation required to raise the levies could take nearly a year, so any adverse impact might not be felt until 2026, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Harvard University professor and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers questioned the wisdom of taxing imports, noting the potential impact on prices. \"For parents, we're coming up on the holiday season and most of our toys are imported from China,\" Summers tweeted on Thanksgiving Day.",
      "Trump has argued that tariffs compel American companies to make goods on U.S. soil rather than purchasing from foreign suppliers.",
      "But some companies have other plans.",
      "\"If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer,\" Philip Daniele, CEO of vehicle parts supplier AutoZone,\u00a0told\u00a0Wall Street analysts in an earnings call in late September. \"We'll generally raise prices ahead of \u2014 we know what the tariffs will be \u2014 we generally raise prices ahead of that,\" Daniele said.",
      "Major suppliers to AutoZone include companies based in China, India and Germany, according to the company.",
      "Stanley Black & Decker CEO Donald Allan Jr.\u00a0said\u00a0last week his tool-producing company has been planning for the possibility of additional tariffs on imports since the spring. \"Obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we [would] put into the market.\"",
      "Allan downplayed the idea of moving manufacturing back to the U.S., saying it would not be cost-effective. The company's options could include \"moving production and aspects of the supply chain to different parts of the world,\" including from China to other parts of Asia and possibly Mexico, the executive said.",
      "Such a shift has already been made by Shelton, Connecticut-based Acme United, which now has its Westcott brand products like rulers made in Thailand and the Philippines, avoiding the tariffs targeting China, CEO Walter Johnsen said in an October earnings call.",
      "Acme has switched production of certain medical products to India, Egypt and U.S. plants in Florida, North Carolina and Washington state, the executive said.",
      "Businesses have also stocked up, placing bigger-than-usual import orders ahead of new tariffs taking hold, as the U.S. imported 11% more Chinese products in July and August than they did during the same two-month period a year ago, according to the Census Bureau.",

    "summary": "Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was charged with two counts in the case brought by Fulton County prosecutors over alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned away former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows' bid to move his state prosecution to federal court in the case stemming from an alleged effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia.",
      "The court's denial of Meadows' appeal leaves in place a lower court decision that returned the prosecution to state court. Meadows and President-elect Donald Trump, for whom he worked, were charged alongside 17 others by Fulton County prosecutors for their alleged efforts to reverse Trump's electoral loss in Georgia in 2020.",
      "They pleaded not guilty to all charges. Proceedings have been on hold for months as a Georgia appeals court is set to consider in December whether to allow Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to continue prosecuting Trump and his allies.",
      "Meadows served as Trump's chief of staff from March 2020 to January 2021 and was a prominent figure in the president-elect's attempts to stay in office for a consecutive term after the November 2020 presidential election.",
      "Two counts were brought against him by Fulton County prosecutors: the first alleges that he engaged in a wide-ranging racketeering conspiracy with Trump, and the second alleges he participated in an effort to solicit a public officer, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, to violate his oath of office.",
      "Meadows is portrayed in the indictment returned in August 2023 as a go-between for Trump and others involved in coordinating the strategy for contesting the 2020 election and disrupting the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021. He participated in a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call between Trump and Raffensperger, during which the then-president asked Raffensperger to \"find\" 11,780 votes, enough to make him the winner of Georgia's election.",
      "After Meadows was charged, he sought to transfer the case to federal court under a federal officer removal statute and argued that the actions alleged in the indictment related to his role as chief of staff.",
      "The district court, however, sent the case back to the Fulton County Superior Court. While U.S. District Judge Steve Jones conceded that some of the charged conduct involved Meadows' official duties, there was not enough evidence to establish that a \"heavy majority\" of the acts alleged against him related to his role as chief of staff.",
      "\"Meadows's alleged association with post-election activities was not related to his role as White House Chief of Staff or his executive branch authority,\" Jones wrote in his September 2023 decision.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld the district court's decision, finding that the federal officer removal statute does not apply to former federal officers and \"his participation in an alleged conspiracy to overturn a presidential election was not related to his official duties.\"",
      "\"At bottom, whatever the chief of staff's role with respect to state election administration, that role does not include altering valid election results in favor of a particular candidate,\" Chief Judge William Pryor wrote for the three-judge panel.",
      "Meadows appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that whether a chief of staff prosecuted based on actions related to his work for the president can remove his case to federal court is not a close call.",
      "Calling the 11th Circuit's decision \"miserly and counterintuitive,\" Meadow's lawyers warned in a filing that allowing it to stand would open former federal officers up to politicized state prosecutions for unpopular federal policies.",
      "\"The chief of staff is a unique federal officer, the top aide to a coequal branch of government personified by the president,\" they wrote. \"If former officers cannot remove at all, and if even a current chief of staff cannot remove a case arising out of acts taken in the White House in service of the president, then the floodgates are open, and 'nightmare scenarios' will not take long to materialize.\"",
      "Fulton County prosecutors urged the Supreme Court to reject Meadows' appeal and leave the 11th Circuit's decision in place. They noted that Trump did not even move his case to federal court, and said Meadows failed to \"articulate any coherent source of authority for the president or his staff to supervise or affect a state's administration of elections.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 07:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Oil and natural gas companies will have to pay a federal fee if they emit methane above certain levels under a rule being finalized by the Biden administration that incoming Trump officials are likely to reverse.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a rule being made final by the Biden administration.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency rule follows through on a directive from Congress included in the 2022 climate law. The new fee is intended to encourage industry to adopt best practices that reduce emissions of methane - the primary component of natural gas - and thereby avoid paying.",
      "Methane is a climate \"super pollutant\" that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, set to be announced Tuesday at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes hours after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \"energy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule wouldn't become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Mr. Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden's methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\" he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that the EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, the EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (the equivalent of 34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain legal challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, called a fee proposed earlier this year a \"punitive tax increase\" that \"undermines America's energy advantage.''",
      "The API said it looks forward to working with Congress to repeal the \"misguided new tax on American energy.\"",
      "Environmental groups, for their part, have hailed the impending methane fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it's cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "The EPA said it expects that over time, fewer oil and gas companies will be charged for excess methane as they reduce emissions in compliance with the rule.",

      "Justice Juan Merchan said he will rule next week on whether a July Supreme Court ruling granting Trump presidential immunity for official acts precludes a jury from finding him guilty after a criminal trial this spring.",
      "Merchan did not directly address sentencing, which had been scheduled for Nov. 26.",
      "A prosecutor for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg emailed Merchan Sunday night, saying Trump asked for a pause \"based on the impact on this proceeding from the results of the Presidential election.\"",
      "\"The People agree that these are unprecedented circumstances,\" wrote the prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, who added there's a need to balance the interests of \"a jury verdict of guilt following trial that has the presumption of regularity; and the Office of the President.\"",

      "Trump's lawyers vowed the day a unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May to fight his conviction. They were given an extraordinary opportunity not long after when the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts. The decision said evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",
      "Trump's legal team, which is led by Todd Blanche, seized on the landmark ruling, demanding Trump's conviction be set aside, and his sentencing canceled. They argued jurors should never have heard testimony related to Trump's communications with former White House communications director Hope Hicks, or his former executive assistant and director of White House Operations Madeleine Westerhout.",
      "Prosecutors argued in response that the Supreme Court ruling didn't apply to evidence shown at trial. They also said the material protested by Trump's lawyers were \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence the jury considered.",
      "The jury ultimately concluded that Trump committed 34 felonies in signing off on a scheme to cover-up reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer.

    "story": [
      "Former Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, who admitted he illegally posted sensitive military information to online chat rooms in what prosecutors called one of the \"most prolific\" and \"rare\" government leak operations, is set to be sentenced in a Boston courtroom on Tuesday.",
      "Teixeira, a 22-year-old Massachusetts native, pleaded guilty in March to six counts of violating the Espionage Act, acknowledging he was behind the yearlong distribution of dozens of classified government documents \u2014 including some marked \"top secret\" \u2014 on Discord, a social media platform. The classified documents involved in the leak touched on a number of sensitive issues, but the most notable were about Russia's war in Ukraine, detailed troop movements and timelines for Western weapons deliveries to the war-torn country, investigators said.",
      "Federal law enforcement arrested Teixeira at his family's Massachusetts home after a weekslong probe into how sensitive Pentagon records were ending up online.",
      "Prosecutors have asked a federal judge to sentence the defendant to 200 months in prison \u2014 almost 17 years \u2014 for his central role in \"one of the most significant and consequential violations of the Espionage Act in American history,\" one that has prompted reforms in the handling of classified information.",
      "\"The harm the defendant caused to the national security from his disclosures of national defense information is extraordinary,\" prosecutors wrote in an October court filing.",
      "For over a year, investigators said Teixeira, who had top secret security clearance as an IT worker at the Otis Air National Guard Base,accessed the classified documents illegally and either hand-copied the information or printed the records before posting the data in the Discord chat rooms. He even messaged individuals in his forums and offered to find specific information about \"happenings that pertain to your country,\" court records said.",
      "The national defense information began appearing online in February 2022, but investigators didn't link the leaks to Teixeira for over a year. Prosecutors alleged Teixeira knew his conduct was illegal and accused him of violating his oath to serve.",
      "As the investigation into the leaks zeroed in on Teixeira's unit, prosecutors alleged in previous court documents that Teixeira began instructing others in the Discord group to \"delete all messages.\"",
      "\"[i]f anyone comes looking, don't tell them sh**,\" he allegedly wrote to one user. And he told another, \"Try to delete all my messages in civil discussions.\"",
      "\"In the aggregate, the defendant's criminal conduct over the course of more than a year 'critically and negatively impacted' the Department of Defense's mission, endangered his fellow soldiers, other citizens, and allied governments throughout the world,\" prosecutors argued last month, urging the judge to impose a heavy sentence.",
      "Teixeira's defense attorney, however, asked for a sentence of 11 years in prison, telling the judge, \"His intent was never to harm the United States,\" but to \"educate his friends about world events to make certain they were not misled by misinformation.\"",
      "Revealing that Teixeira was diagnosed with autism, his lawyer wrote in an October court filing that \"his motives and decisions were na\u00efve, not nefarious.\" Teixeira accepted responsibility for the admitted crimes, including by participating in an hourslong briefing with members of the intelligence community, the defense filings argued.",
      "\"The actions of Jack Teixeira are inexcusable,\" the attorney wrote, describing his client not as a criminal leaker but as a misguided young person swept up in an online ecosystem. \"However, Jack is still essentially a child \u2013 at the very least, a 'youthful offender' \u2013 who has his whole life in front of him.\"",
      "Following Teixeira's arrest, the Air Force inspector general found that individuals in his Massachusetts unit failed to take proper action after at least four separate security incidents. Members of his unit \"enabled\" the leaks by not properly supervising his access to classified information, the review concluded. The Air National Guard took action against 15 individuals for \"dereliction in the performance of duties\" as a result of the report's findings.",
      "Texeira also faces charges of disobeying orders and obstructing justice in a military court martial, which are expected to be adjudicated in March.",

      "Once a police officer in New York state and Border Patrol agent, the Obama administration tapped him to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch in 2013. During Homan's time at ICE under President Obama, the agency carried out record numbers of formal deportations. Obama gave Homan a Presidential Rank Award, the highest civil service recognition.",
      "Trump early in his first term named Homan acting director of ICE. He quickly generated controversy when he suggested undocumented immigrants \"should be afraid\" under the Trump administration.",
      "Homan was one of the masterminds of the first Trump administration's infamous \"zero tolerance\" policy, which led to the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents. The parents were prosecuted for illegal entry, while the children were sent to shelters for unaccompanied minors \u2014 without a plan to reunite them.

      "He suggested to CBS News correspondent Cecilia Vega that he would target criminals and national security threats first, and then seek to deport non-criminal migrants who are in the country illegally and are ordered deported.

      "Waves of U.S. Capitol riot defendants are citing Donald Trump's election in requests to delay their criminal prosecutions because of his public pledge to pardon some of the people convicted of crimes on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "In court filings reviewed by CBS News, defense attorneys asked federal judges in Washington, D.C., to postpone proceedings in some of the Jan. 6 cases until 2025, when President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "The filings complicate the Justice Department's ability to conclude its prosecutions \u2014 hundreds of which remain active \u2014 before the changeover in power.",
      "William Pope, a Jan. 6 defendant from Kansas, has filed a new request for a delay, blistering the Justice Department for continuing apace with his prosecution.\u00a0Pope's filing cited Trump's reelection, arguing, \"Any further action in these cases is not an 'administration of justice' in the public interest as the government claims, but a belligerent disregard for the will of the American people, from which all law and governmental power in this country is derived.\"",
      "In a new request to delay his sentencing, defendant Terry Allen's attorneys filed a motion saying, \"History has shown that President Donald Trump is not shy when it comes to exercising his pardon powers and there is clearly no reason to believe he won't do as he says.\" Allen's attorneys noted that in Trump's first term, he \"pardoned, commuted, or rescinded the convictions of 237 people,\" and \"[m]any were controversial.\"",
      "Some defendants are quoting Trump's campaign statements in their new court filings. Attorneys for defendant Larry Brock argued that Trump \"explicitly campaigned on justice for the January 6 defendants.\" They cited Trump's July 31 interview with the National Association of Black Journalists, in which he said he'd \"'absolutely' pardon those convicted in the January 6th prosecutions because 'they were convicted by a very tough system.'\" They also quoted Trump's claim about Jan. 6 convicts: \"'[S]ome call them prisoners. I call them hostages...release the J6 hostages, Joe. Release them, Joe. You can do it real easy, Joe.'\"",
      "Brock, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, was accused of rifling through papers on the desks of senators while amid the mob.",
      "Defense attorney Joseph McBride, who has defended several Jan. 6 criminal defendants told CBS News that requests would be made \"across the board\" to delay cases until Trump takes office. \"It would be foolish not to,\" he said. \"The Justice Department Is still arresting people, which is nuts and pointless. The pardon thing is looming. And I don't think any of these prosecutions will continue beyond (Trump taking office).\"",
      "Former federal prosecutor Scott Fredericksen told CBS News he thinks the Justice Department is going to be forced to confront the question of what to do with the cases.",
      "\"The department will probably say, 'We're going to continue with the cases,' and that the discussion of pardons is not sufficient to warrant delays,\" Fredricksen said.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately return requests for comment. In court filings, it has opposed requests for delays. In the case of Terry Allen, prosecutors disagreed that a continuance of the case was warranted because \"the defendant's justification at this time is mere speculation.\"",
      "\"The Court should proceed as it would in any other prosecution,\" prosecutors argued. \"Courts in this jurisdiction have denied similar motions.\"",
      "Opposing a request to delay the trial of defendant Stephen Baker, the Justice Department argued, \"There is a public interest in the prompt and efficient administration of justice. The government and the Court have endeavored to deliver that interest. The government disagrees that a continuance is warranted here, and the Court should proceed as it would in any other prosecution.\"",
      "But the numbers of delay requests are expected to grow significantly. McBride, the New York-based defense attorney, told CBS News requests are expected by all similarly situated defendants. He said defense attorneys must argue for all of their clients and may not \"pick and choose\" to ask for delays only for some.",
      "In his court filing, Pope included a photo of himself standing next to Trump.",
      "\"It is now up to the Court to decide if it wishes to expend judicial resources by enduring a taxing schedule in this case,\" the filing said. \"Ultimately, I will get the same result with a trial or with no trial.\"",
      "The Justice Department has launched over 1,500 criminal cases in its prosecution of the Capitol siege.\u00a0 According to federal records, approximately 950 defendants have pleaded guilty, and 200 more have been found guilty at trial.",
      "Arrests continue, including new cases unsealed over the past few weeks.",
      "Fredericksen said a Trump-appointed attorney general could move to have the department dismiss pending Jan. 6 cases \u2014 and could opt to reopen and dismiss cases against those who have already been convicted and sentenced to prison.",

The Massachusetts Congressman told The New York Times\u00a0after Trump's win that \"Democrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone\" and called for a new approach from the party on the transgender issues.",
      "\"I have two little girls, I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I'm supposed to be afraid to say that,\" Moulton told The Times.",

      "He said fellow Democrats and Congressional colleagues have told him, \"You're exactly right Seth, this is our problem. We try to cancel people rather than actually having debates about issues that Americans care about.\"",
      "\"We're losing on issues like this\"",
      "Congressman Seth Moulton doubled down on the comments after a Veterans Day event in Marblehead on Monday.",
      "\"I stand by them because importantly, I'm just trying to raise the debate. I'm not saying I have all the answers on this. It's not my area of expertise. But this is an example of a contentious issue that we have to be willing to take on as a Democratic Party,\" Moulton told WBZ.  \"One, we got to start winning elections and we're losing on issues like this.

      "Backlash to Seth Moulton's statement on trans athletes",

      "Moulton told WBZ that the outrage about his comments proves his point. \"It's a whole variety of issues where Democrats are clearly just out of touch with most of America. And I think that's because we do too much preaching and not enough listening,\" Moulton said.",
      "LGBTQ+ advocacy group MassEquality called Moulton's comments \"both harmful and factually inaccurate.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:49:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump campaign co-chair Susie Wiles will serve as White House chief of staff, the first woman \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 ever to hold that position.",
    "story": [
      "Last week,\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0announced his campaign co-chair Susie Wiles will serve as his White House chief of staff, the first woman \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 ever to hold that position. Calling her \"tough, smart, innovative..., universally admired and respected,\" Trump credited her with helping him win both the 2024 and 2016 elections.",
      "Behind the scenes",
      "Wiles is known as a formidable political operative who prefers to work behind the scenes, rather than on any stage \u2014 or in front of cameras. In keeping with that, when Trump\u00a0declared victory\u00a0in the early hours of last Wednesday morning, he invited her to come to the microphones, but she politely declined.",
      "She's managed to not just curry favor, but more critically, to remain in good standing with Trump, winning his trust while working in a high-profile campaign role, managing the ambitions, personalities and egos in Trump's orbit.",
      "Relationship with campaign staff",
      "Wiles is beloved by the Trump campaign staff, many of whom call her a mentor.",
      "\"Susie Wiles is a tremendous advocate for President Trump and a great boss to those that work for her,\" said Trump senior adviser Danielle Alvarez. \"She knows how to bring people together.\"",
      "\"For myself and countless others, having Susie Wiles as a mentor and a friend is a gift,\" said Brian Hughes, another senior adviser. \"The nation will see that with President Trump in the White House with Susie as the COS the next four years will be America's best.\"",
      "Those who have worked for Wiles \"will take a bullet for Susie,\" said Carlos Trujillo, a campaign adviser who served as U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States. Trujillo said most people don't see Wiles' motherly and grandmotherly side. \"She always made sure her people were taken care of,\" he said. \"She's very soft spoken, but she holds everyone accountable, and it's always done through love and kindness but never a place of hate.\"",
      "Management style",
      "Staffers say Wiles runs a tight and focused ship. Trump's 2024 campaign did not go through the big, dramatic shakeups or infighting that characterized his previous campaigns. Wiles' appointment signals that as president-elect, he wants to run his administration in a similar way.",
      "Wiles' legacy, Trujillo said, is her ability to cultivate talent. \"Susie in politics is the greatest coach of all time...she's going to be able to recruit the best talent.\"",
      "And while Wiles shies away from the spotlight, she made a rare comment on X when businessman Mark Cuban, in an interview on ABC's \"The View,\" accused Trump of not associating with \"strong, intelligent women.\" In response, Wiles\u00a0posted\u00a0for the first time this year: \"I'm told [Mark Cuban] needs help identifying the strong and intelligent women surrounding Pres. Trump. Well, here we are!\"",
      "Background",
      "After Trump won the 2016 election, Wiles, who was the chief strategist in Florida for his campaign, was dispatched in late September of 2018 to help Ron DeSantis with his 2018 bid to be Florida governor. At the time, he was trailing Democrat Andrew Gillum in several polls.",
      "After helping DeSantis win, however, Wiles was shut out of his inner circle, according to\u00a0The Atlantic's Tim Alberta. Wiles told Alberta that working for DeSantis was the \"biggest mistake\" of her career. She returned to the Trump campaign and ran his Florida campaign in 2020, and then after his loss, she went on to run Trump's Save America PAC.",
      "As Trump's 2024 co-campaign manager, Wiles, along with Chris LaCivita, hatched a plan to recruit, register and turn out Trump's low-propensity voters, Alberta reported. During the primary campaign, they pursued people in the reddest areas of the country who liked Trump but weren't habitual voters and in many cases, weren't even registered to vote. During the general campaign, Wiles and LaCivita raised a volunteer army to take on the legions of canvassers paid by Kamala Harris' cash-rich coffers.",
      "Wiles is a native of New Jersey, the daughter of renowned the late NFL kicker and sportscaster Pat Summerall. Soon after she graduated from college at the University of Maryland, she worked for Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign, and later went on to work in Florida politics. In 2010, she helped Sen. Rick Scott win his election against Democrat Bill McCollum, and she has also been a political consultant in Florida.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump wants his people in place in his administration as soon as possible.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday that he's appointing a \"border czar,\" former Immigrations and Customs Enforcement director and immigration hardliner Tom Homan, to join his administration. Homan, however, may not be the only such \"czar\" in the Trump administration.",
      "\"I am pleased to announce that the Former ICE Director, and stalwart on Border Control, Tom Homan, will be joining the Trump Administration, in charge of our Nation's Borders (\"The Border Czar\"), including, but not limited to, the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The term \"czar\" is shorthand for a high-level executive branch official in charge of a specific policy focus.",
      "They aren't Senate-confirmed positions",
      "The \"czar\" role is one that allows a president to step over the pesky checks and balances of the three branches of government. \"Czar\" roles aren't Senate-confirmed cabinet positions, like say, the secretary of state or Health and Human Services secretary. That means a president can appoint that person to his administration without the Senate's input, and quickly.",
      "Trump wants to put his people in place, and quickly, after experiencing in his first term how congressional authority can gum up an administration's plans. Trump said as much in a social media post on Sunday.",
      "\"Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more,\" Trump wrote Sunday, saying he wants recess appointments. \"This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again. We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\"",
      "Trump wouldn't be the first president to use \"czars\"",
      "Trump would not be the first president to use \"czars.\" Such czars have been appointed by presidents of both parties. Former President Barack Obama had, in part, an \"energy and environment czar,\" \"Afghanistan czar,\" \"car czar,\" \"health czar\" and \"auto recovery czar.\"",
      "His use of these positions was so widespread that in 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the history and legality of executive branch czars. The committee noted that some of these policy czars were at one point confirmed by the Senate, while others were in positions outside the White House that reported to a Senate-confirmed officer. But a handful worked in the White House. The use of such \"czars\" ignited a firestorm of criticism from Republicans, and even some Democrats raised concerns about their authority.",
      "But presidents before Obama had \"czars,\" too. President Bill Clinton had a \"Y2K czar,\" and President George W. Bush had an \"AIDS czar,\" \"counterterrorism czar\" and \"reading czar,\" among others. Historians believe the role dates back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, who rapidly expanded the size and role of the federal government.",
      "Trump also had something of a \"czar\" in his first term. Moncef Slaoui, a former pharmaceutical executive, oversaw Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's initiative to fast-track COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "During the Obama administration, Republicans blasted the growth of the administrative state, and decisions made by unelected bureaucrats. And during the Trump administration, Trump supporters bemoaned the so-called \"deep state\" of unelected career officers.",
      "Vice President Harris was sometimes dubbed a \"border czar,\" although not by President Biden himself, since the president tasked her with tackling the influx of migrants at the southern border. Harris fought against that label as the Democratic nominee.",
      "A \"czar\" position could make room for controversial names like RFK, Jr.",
      "The Senate will be controlled by Republicans when Trump takes office. But Trump still may have trouble confirming a few of the most controversial names, like vaccine denier Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to Senate-confirmed Cabinet positions.",
      "Kennedy\u00a0is on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the\u00a0president-elect's\u00a0campaign said. But it's also possible Kennedy could serve in a less formal role, like a \"czar.\"",
      "Where did the concept of \"czars\" originate?",
      "\"Czar\" comes from the Russian word \"tsar,\" which is derived from the Latin word \"caesar,\" according to World History Encyclopedia. Specifically, the term tsar refers to Russia's rulers for hundreds of years. Ivan IV The Terrible was formally crowned the \"tsar of all Russia\" in 1547, and the title continued until Russia's monarchy was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917.",
      "Franklin D. Roosevelt, who greatly expanded the size and scope of the federal government, used \"czars.\" But even before his time in office, the first use of the phrase \"czar\" in the U.S. was likely Nicholas Biddle, tapped to be president of the Bank of the United States during Andrew Jackson's presidency. He was sometimes called \"Czar Nicholas,\" which overlapped with Russia's Czar Nicholas I's reign.",
      "Over time, the term in U.S. came to be used informally for people handpicked by the president for principal positions who don't undergo Senate vetting, scrutiny or confirmation.",
      "What are the pros and cons of \"czars\"?",
      "Critics of such roles have argued \"czars\" run amock of the checks and balances system the forefathers founded. The late Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd criticized both Obama and Bush for creating such roles in their administrations.",
      "\"The rapid and easy accumulation of power by White House staff can threaten the Constitutional system of checks and balances,\" Byrd wrote in a publicized letter to Obama in 2009. \"At the worst, White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.\"",
      "The president can, of course, appoint White House employees. The constitutional issues come into question when the president selects a principal who isn't Senate-confirmed.",
      "But for a president looking to appoint an ally quickly, a \"czar\" is logistically much easier to get into office than is a Cabinet secretary.",
      "How effective a \"czar\" can really be is up for debate \u2014 especially since \"czars\" generally don't control budgets.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Senate Republicans prepare to vote Wednesday on new leadership for the upcoming Congress, President-elect Donald Trump is already weighing in with demands for the new majority leader regarding his Cabinet.",
      "After a decisive victory in the 2024 elections, Trump is returning to the White House with a GOP-led Senate at his side. Senate Republican leaders are expected to ease the way for the president-elect's agenda and his Cabinet and judicial nominees. Trump has made it clear that he'd like his nominees to be installed immediately, suggesting that he may want the option to bypass the Senate's advice and consent role entirely.",
      "Trump weighs in on recess appointments",
      "Perhaps the biggest factor remaining in the leadership race is whether Trump himself weighs in on the candidates. On Sunday, he stepped into the conversation, demanding in a Truth Social post that anyone seeking the position as leader \"must agree to Recess Appointments.\"",
      "Recess appointments enable a president to temporarily install nominees without the Senate confirmation process. Trump argued in a post on social media that without recess appointments, \"we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner.\"",
      "\"We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\" the president-elect said.",
      "The Constitution's Recess Appointment Clause grants presidents the ability to \"fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate.\" The maneuver is considered to be a way to make swift appointments during the Senate's absence, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service, which notes that recess appointments have also been used for political reasons \u2014 for instance, to make an appointment on a temporary basis for an individual who would not be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "With a GOP majority of at least 52 seats, Trump shouldn't have too much difficulty getting his nominations through the chamber through the regular process. But pushback from a handful of Republicans like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Todd Young of Indiana or Sen.-elect John Curtis of Utah could imperil some of his more controversial picks. The process could also be delayed by Democrats in the minority, who could rely on procedural maneuvers to extend the time it takes for Trump's Cabinet to be confirmed.",
      "But the recess appointment maneuver is a controversial one that both parties have combated in recent years. Recess appointments are allowed only when the Senate is out of session for 10 days. For the last decade, both chambers have headed off recess appointments by going into pro-forma sessions even when lawmakers are in recess. And a Supreme Court decision in 2014 gave the Senate more authority to prevent the maneuver, after controversial recess appointments by President Barack Obama.",
      "If Trump were to make an appointment during a recess in the first session of the new Congress, the appointment could last for almost two years, after which the individual could be appointed again through a recess appointment or the regular process, according to the CRS report. But without the Senate's approval, the appointee would not be paid.",
      "Should Republicans force a change to procedure in the upper chamber, they would do so with the risk that Democrats will take the same steps in their favor when they regain the majority. Still, all three candidates for GOP leader threw their support behind Trump's demand for recess appointments on Sunday.",
      "The candidates for Senate majority leader",
      "Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, are considered the front-runners in the race to replace Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. But Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has seen a surge of support from members of Trump's orbit \u2014 from Tucker Carlson to Elon Musk \u2014 that has drawn increased attention to the race.",
      "Thune, 63, is currently the No. 2 Republican and considered by some to be the favorite in the race. He's been in the Senate since 2004 and served as GOP whip since 2021. But he hasn't always had a strong relationship with Trump, and initially backed Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina for president in the GOP primaries.",
      "Cornyn, 72, has been in the Senate since 2002 and previously served as the Republican whip from 2013 to 2019. His fundraising chops have made him a top candidate in the Senate leadership race. But like Thune, he's previously distanced himself from Trump \u2014 a gap both senators have sought to close in recent months.",
      "Meanwhile, Scott has been angling for the position. The Florida Republican challenged McConnell for the role after the midterm elections in 2022, when he earned the support of just 10 members of his conference. Scott is similarly expected to find support from some of the conference's conservative members in this year's contest, and the outside endorsements from those who claim Cornyn and Thune are too close to McConnell could be a boon.",
      "Electing the \"next generation of leadership\"",
      "The leadership election comes after McConnell's decision to step away after 17 years at the helm, becoming the longest serving Senate leader in history.",
      "McConnell's decision to step aside and welcome \"the next generation of leadership\" teed up a high-stakes race for leader that has been shaking out behind the scenes since February. After Republicans flipped the Senate, the leadership race took on even greater importance.",
      "\"I had really hoped I'd be able to hand over to my successor the majority,\" McConnell told reporters at a news conference last week. \"I've been the majority leader, I've been the minority leader \u2013 majority's a lot better.\"",
      "Outside influence and endorsements",
      "The race, nine months in the making, has begun to draw input from outsiders in recent days. Tucker Carlson, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are among the Trump loyalists who have weighed in to back Scott, urging that he is best suited to carry out the president-elect's agenda.",
      "How the input from prominent outsiders weighs on the race remains to be seen. Senate Republicans will meet behind closed doors to elect the new leader, casting secret ballots, which make senators less likely to be swayed by external pressures.",
      "For months, the three candidates have been working behind the scenes to persuade their colleagues to back them for the chamber's top post. And so far, just a small portion of the Republican conference has shared publicly who they plan to support.",
      "Thune has the backing of Sens. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, along with Steve Daines of Montana, who chaired the GOP campaign arm, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, this cycle and may have valuable sway with new members whose races he buoyed. Meanwhile, Cornyn has the support of Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. And Scott has the backing of Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. In recent days, he also earned endorsements from Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee \u2014 two senators who have been floated as possible picks for Trump's cabinet.",
      "The bulk of the conference has yet to weigh in publicly, and likely won't be swayed by outsiders on a decision that will guide how the chamber operates for the next two years. But an endorsement of a candidate from Trump himself, who will work with the leader going forward, could change the dynamic.",
      "Whether Trump endorses a particular candidate remains to be seen. Thune acknowledged on CNBC last week that Trump can \"exert a considerable amount of influence\" on the leadership race, but he cautioned him against doing so, saying, \"I think my preference would be, and I think it's in his best interest, to stay out of that.\"",
      "\"He's got to work with all of us when it's all said and done,\" Thune said. \"But whatever he decides to do, that's going to be his prerogative, as we know.\"",

      "Such a role does not require Senate confirmation.",

      "\"It's going to be a well-targeted, planned operation conducted by the men of ICE. The men and women of ICE do this daily. They're good at it,\" he said. \"When we go out there, we're going to know who we're looking for. We most likely know where they're going to be, and it's going to be done in a humane manner.\"",

    "story": [
      "Nogales, Mexico \u2014 Ivan Castro Santos, his wife and their four children, including 1-year-old triplets, have been living in a crowded room over the past four months, waiting for an opportunity to enter the U.S.",
      "The young family traveled from southern Mexico to the House of Mercy and All Nations shelter in the northern Mexican border city of Nogales, joining other migrants from across Latin America. Half of them are children. All of them have one objective: finding work and safety in the U.S.",
      "Castro Santos, 22, said he and his wife, Fatima Gonzalez Hernandez, 19, decided to leave Guerrero, Mexico, because of \"the crime and the risk to the children\" there. \"To protect them,\" he added in Spanish, looking at his young children.",
      "Tens of thousands of migrants are estimated to be in Mexico, hoping to enter America, including through a program that allows them to use a smartphone app to request a time to be vetted, processed and admitted by American border officials. The system was established by the Biden administration to dissuade migrants from crossing the border illegally, but many are now worried that President-elect Donald Trump will make it much harder for them to make it into the U.S. at all.",
      "Castro Santos said he's worried about Trump \"canceling the appointments\" offered by the U.S. government app, known as CBP One. \"We don't want to run that risk of going back and putting them at risk,\" he said, referring to his children. If allowed into the U.S., he said his family would like to settle in Houston, where his sister lives. He said he would like to learn how to cook and work in a restaurant.",
      "Trump made tackling illegal immigration a central theme of his campaign, running on a platform of mass deportations, harsher asylum rules and a reversal of the Biden administration's border policies, including the app-powered entry system used by migrants in Mexico. His immigration promises appealed to many American voters, polls show, including those living near the southern border.",
      "Anna Parada, who was born and raised in Nogales, Arizona, just miles away from the border with Mexico, said the \"main\" reason she voted for Trump was because of his stance on immigration.",
      "\"I really saw the Biden administration being a little bit too lax on immigration,\" Parada said. \"And having Trump back in office, I believe it's going to be a difference again.\"",
      "On the Mexican side of the border, the reaction to Trump winning was dramatically different.",
      "Luz Angela, a migrant from Bolivia, said she felt \"scared\" when she learned American voters had elected Trump.",
      "\"I felt scared because he promised in his speeches that they would deport all the migrants,\" Angela said in Spanish. \"And that he would close the CBP One application.\"",
      "A doctor by trade, Angela said she and her 9-year-old son, Matias, fled political persecution in Bolivia. She said she was targeted by the government there after complaining about corruption in the hospital where she worked.",
      "Angela and her son have been waiting for a CBP One appointment for nearly 7 months since arriving in Nogales, Mexico. During her wait, she has volunteered as a doctor at the House of Mercy and All Nations shelter, treating fellow migrants.",
      "\"What we're looking for is for an opportunity to improve our lives but also perhaps improve the health care system over there,\" she said. \"I really like helping people who don't have easy access to healthcare.\"",
      "U.S. officials worry that Trump's election will end the months-long lull in illegal border crossings, which plunged this year following an aggressive effort by Mexican officials to interdict migrants and President Biden's move in June to make most of those crossing into the country illegally ineligible for asylum. Larger numbers of migrants, officials have said, could be incentivized to cross into the U.S. unlawfully in the coming weeks, before Trump takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Alba Jaramillo, a Tucson-based immigration attorney, said Trump's win and the potential end to the CBP One system, could prompt more migrants to cross the southern border without authorization, including along dangerous parts of the Arizona desert where some perish trying to make it into the U.S.",
      "\"They're desperate,\" said Jaramillo, the co-executive director of the Immigration Law and Justice Network, a pro-immigrant organization. \"I mean they have given up everything to come to the north.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 07:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Oil and natural gas companies will have to pay a federal fee if they emit methane above certain levels under a rule being finalized by the Biden administration that incoming Trump officials are likely to reverse.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a rule being made final by the Biden administration.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency rule follows through on a directive from Congress included in the 2022 climate law. The new fee is intended to encourage industry to adopt best practices that reduce emissions of methane - the primary component of natural gas - and thereby avoid paying.",
      "Methane is a climate \"super pollutant\" that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, set to be announced Tuesday at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes hours after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \"energy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule wouldn't become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Mr. Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden's methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\" he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that the EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, the EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (the equivalent of 34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain legal challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, called a fee proposed earlier this year a \"punitive tax increase\" that \"undermines America's energy advantage.''",
      "The API said it looks forward to working with Congress to repeal the \"misguided new tax on American energy.\"",
      "Environmental groups, for their part, have hailed the impending methane fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it's cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "The EPA said it expects that over time, fewer oil and gas companies will be charged for excess methane as they reduce emissions in compliance with the rule.",

    "story": [
      "Beirut \u2014 Declassified 1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led a British-Iraqi archeological team to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that became decisive in the spread of Islam throughout the region.",
      "The Battle of al-Qadisiyah was fought in Mesopotamia \u2014 in present-day Iraq \u2014 in the A.D. 630s between Arab Muslims and the army of the Sassanid Persian dynasty during a period of Muslim expansion. The Arab army prevailed and continued on its march into Persia, now Iran.",
      "A joint team of archeologists from the U.K.'s Durham University and the University of Al-Qadisiyah stumbled across the site while undertaking a remote sensing survey to map the Darb Zubaydah, a pilgrimage route from Iraq's Kufa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia built more than 1,000 years ago. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "While mapping the route, the team noticed that a site some 20 miles south of Kufa in Iraq's southern Najaf province \u2014 a desert area with scattered plots of agricultural land \u2014 had features that closely matched the description of the al-Qadisiyah battle site described in historic texts.",
      "William Deadman, a specialist in archaeological remote sensing at Durham University, said the Cold War era satellite images are commonly used tools by archeologists working in the Middle East because the older images often show features that have been destroyed or altered and wouldn't show up on present-day satellite images.",
      "\"The Middle East has developed so much in the last 50 years, both agricultural expansion and urban expansion,\" he said. Some of the distinguishing features at the al-Qadisiyah site, such as a distinctive trench, were \"much more pristine and clear\" in the 1970s images, he said.",
      "A survey on the ground confirmed the findings and convinced the team that they had correctly identified the site.",
      "The key features were a deep trench, two fortresses and an ancient river that was reportedly once forded by elephant-mounted Persian troops, said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah who's part of the team that made the discovery. The survey team also found pottery shards consistent with the time period when the battle took place.",
      "A revealing, well-known battle",
      "Jotheri said Iraqis of his generation, who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein, were all familiar with the battle in minute detail, down to the names of the generals on both sides.",
      "The battle at the time had political connotations \u2014 Iraq was engaged in a devastating war with Iran through much of the 1980s. Saddam pointed to the Battle of Qadisiyah as a harbinger of victory for Iraq.",
      "Like most children growing up in that era, Jotheri said he'd watched a popular movie about the battle multiple times as it was on regular rotation on television.",
      "In the post-Saddam era, al-Qadisiyah has become something of a political litmus test. Iraqis' views of the battle vary depending on their feelings toward Iran, which has expanded its influence in the country since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam.",
      "\"There is some political and religious context in this battle because now, of course, we have religious differences, ethnic differences, political differences in Iraq and we read or we view everything based on our \u2026 differences,\" Jotheri said. But he added, \"We all agree that it is a very important battle, a decisive one, and we all know about it.\"",
      "Discovery was part of a regional trend",
      "The team plans to begin excavations at the site in the coming year, Jotheri said.",
      "The discovery comes as part of a broader project launched in 2015 to document endangered archaeological sites in the region.",
      "It also comes at the time of a resurgence of archeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \"cradle of civilization,\" but where archeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",

    "summary": "Victims thought to be female were male and not related to one another, showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\"They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \"We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\"",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",
      "In August, archaeologists at Pompeii announced they had unearthed the remains of two more victims -- a man and a woman discovered inside what was likely the bedroom of their home, where they'd become trapped as the rest of the structure filled with debris. The woman was found on the bed with a collection of gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as a pair of gold earrings, a pair of pearl earrings and other jewelry.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers won a $700,000 prize for using artificial intelligence to read a 2,000-year-old scroll that was scorched in the Vesuvius eruption.",
      "The Herculaneum papyri consist of about\u00a0800 rolled-up Greek scrolls\u00a0that were carbonized during the 79 CE volcanic eruption that buried the ancient Roman town, according to the organizers of the\u00a0\"Vesuvius Challenge.\"",
      "The scroll's author was \"probably Epicurean philosopher Philodemus,\" writing \"about music, food, and how to enjoy life's pleasures,\" wrote contest organizer\u00a0Nat Friedman\u00a0on social media.",
      "The scrolls were found in a villa thought to be previously owned by Julius Caesar's patrician father-in-law, whose mostly unexcavated property held a library that could contain thousands more manuscripts.",

    "summary": "Medical issues aside, the astronauts described a water leak in June that triggered a blizzard in the International Space Station's airlock.",
    "story": [
      "Three NASA astronauts who just wrapped up a 235-day mission to the International Space Station discussed their flight with reporters Friday, but steadfastly refused to comment on a medical issue of some sort that resulted in one astronaut spending the night in a hospital after landing.",
      "The unidentified astronaut flew back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston the day after splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico on Oct. 25, rejoining their crewmates. But NASA, citing medical privacy issues, provided no details other than to say the astronaut \"is in good health and will resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members.\"",
      "\"I know there may be some interest in our post-flight medical event, where we diverted to a hospital,\" Crew 8 pilot Mike Barratt, a physician-astronaut, told reporters Friday. \"You know, space flight is still something we don't fully understand. We're finding things that we don't expect sometimes, and this was one of those times.",
      "\"We're still piecing things together on this. And so to maintain medical privacy and to let our processes go forward in an orderly manner, this is all we're going to say about that event at this time.\"",
      "Barratt, Crew 8 commander Matt Dominick, astronaut Jeanette Epps and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on March 3 and docked at the space station two days later. They returned to Earth last month after an extended stay in space.",
      "Barratt, Dominick and Epps all appeared healthy and in good spirits Friday as they continue their re-adjustment to gravity. Grebenkin flew back to Moscow shortly after splashdown, but in a social media post just after the crew's return to Earth, he was smiling and said to be in good shape.",
      "While the presumably minor medical issue remains a mystery, the crew shared highlights of their stay in space, including details about a water leak during preparations for a June spacewalk that triggered a blizzard in the space station's airlock.",
      "After a spacesuit \"discomfort\" problem forced Dominick and astronaut Tracy Dyson to call off a planned spacewalk on June 13, Dyson and Barratt suited up for another excursion on June 24.",
      "While floating in the airlock with the outer hatch open to space, an umbilical failed to \"seat\" properly and water began spewing into the chamber.",
      "\"Oh, my goodness,\" Dyson said when she noticed the water spewing out. \"There's a lot of water flowing. There's literally water everywhere. ... I've got ice all over my helmet.\"",
      "\"It was not a trivial leak,\" Barratt reflected Friday. \"Anybody who was watching NASA TV at the time could see there was basically a snowstorm, a blizzard spewing from the air lock, because we already had the hatch open. We were seeing flakes of ice in the air lock. Tracy was seeing a lot of them on her helmet, on her gloves, whatnot.",
      "\"So it was...dramatic is the right word, to be real honest. I think literally, Tracy's actions were nowhere short of a heroic to be able to re-mate that umbilical with her hands covered with ice and kind of being vision impaired and getting the air lock closed.\"",
      "Barratt said he grabbed her space-suited legs so Dyson could \"lever that thing closed, and she just made it happen. So yeah, there was a bit of drama. Everything worked out fine. And again, normal processes and procedures saved our bacon.\"",
      "NASA plans to resume spacewalks in January, and Barratt said the suits will be in good shape.",
      "\"I think we're leaving them a brand new umbilical, a really clean interface on that side where we had the problem and the suits are charged and really ready to go,\" he said. \"So I think we are more than ready for the next EVA campaign. I just wish we were doing it.\"",
      "That said, he pointed out, \"none of our spacesuits are spring chickens. And so we will expect to see some hardware issues with repeated use. So again, it's one of those things that we are always, at every second, ready to stop...or work a contingency procedure.\"",
      "As for the suit \"discomfort\" issue that Dominick reported prior to the earlier spacewalk attempt, no details were provided.",
      "\"We're still reviewing it and trying to figure all the details out,\" Dominick said.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 18:24:00 -0500",
    "summary": "As votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle.",
    "story": [
      "By the time the polls opened on Election Day, baseless claims of voter fraud had been building on social media for months, fueling doubts about the integrity of the election.",
      "Posts proliferated on X and other platforms pointing to hiccups like technical issues with voting machines, power outages and spelling errors on ballots as examples of a supposedly brewing conspiracy. And at 4:30 p.m. on Election Day, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that there was \"a lot of talk about massive cheating\" in Pennsylvania \u2014 which officials said had \"no factual basis whatsoever.\"",
      "But as the votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to a decisive victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle, researchers say.",
      "\"I think this shows that these narratives are pushed when they serve a purpose, and they are stage setting often for efforts to dispute unfavorable results,\" said Max Read, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. \"And then once that stage setting and those claims are no longer needed, they're not pushed anymore.\"",
      "The shift was stark in Elon Musk's \"Election Integrity Community,\" a group of nearly 65,000 started by the platform owner's political action committee encouraging members to report \"voter fraud or irregularities.\"",
      "The group had already become a repository for speculation and unfounded rumors before Election Day. When the polls opened, hundreds of posts an hour were shared until the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, when the race was called for Trump in Pennsylvania, all but eliminating a winning path for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "After that, the posting drastically diminished.",
      "Read's team at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also found that mentions across the platform of voting machines in Pennsylvania and Michigan soared on Tuesday afternoon but dropped to hardly any by Wednesday morning.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a software error caused voting machines to be temporarily down in Cambria County, a county in southwestern Pennsylvania with a population of about 131,000. Voters used paper ballots and a court order extended voting hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. But some on social media baselessly suggested the technical issues were something nefarious, a plot to discard votes in a county Trump won by a wide margin in both of the last two elections.",
      "Danielle Lee Tomson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public's research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state's election headquarters. Claims that the errors were intentional fueled a lawsuit challenging the results that was later dismissed.",
      "\"On Election Day, we can always expect there to be irregularities or glitches or problems at polling sites,\" Tomson said. \"The question is will those issues be contorted into a larger narrative that election fraud is happening.\"",
      "While the volume of election rumors has drastically decreased, false claims are still spreading about races that have not yet been called. In Arizona, where Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake trails Democratic candidate Ruben Gallego, social users on the right are using the fact that Gallego had more votes than Harris by Friday to cast doubt on the validity of his lead.",
      "Meanwhile, turnout numbers are being twisted by both the left and the right to cast doubt on election results. While millions of votes are still being counted, some point to higher turnout in 2020 as evidence that there are 20 million \"missing votes.\" On the right, some claim this is evidence that 2020 was stolen from Trump; on the left, some say it's grounds for a recount.",
      "But the volume of posts questioning Harris's loss was nowhere near the \"Stop the Steal\" efforts that followed Trump's 2020 election loss, according to both Tomson and Read's research. No elected officials cast doubt on the outcome the way Trump pushed election denial when he lost in 2020. Harris urged all Americans to accept the results of the election in her concession speech on Wednesday.",
      "\"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,\" Harris said. \"And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 14:04:53 -0500",
    "summary": "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" says Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanse.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",
      "Most social media companies have policies that bar children under the age of 13 from setting up accounts, but a 2022 study conducted by the U.K.'s media regulator Ofcom found that nearly 80% of children in the country had social media accounts by the age of 12.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned away former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows' bid to move his state prosecution to federal court in the case stemming from an alleged effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia.",
      "The court's denial of Meadows' appeal leaves in place a lower court decision that returned the prosecution to state court. Meadows and President-elect Donald Trump, for whom he worked, were charged alongside 17 others by Fulton County prosecutors for their alleged efforts to reverse Trump's electoral loss in Georgia in 2020.",
      "They pleaded not guilty to all charges. Proceedings have been on hold for months as a Georgia appeals court is set to consider in December whether to allow Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to continue prosecuting Trump and his allies.",
      "Meadows served as Trump's chief of staff from March 2020 to January 2021 and was a prominent figure in the president-elect's attempts to stay in office for a consecutive term after the November 2020 presidential election.",
      "Two counts were brought against him by Fulton County prosecutors: the first alleges that he engaged in a wide-ranging racketeering conspiracy with Trump, and the second alleges he participated in an effort to solicit a public officer, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, to violate his oath of office.",
      "Meadows is portrayed in the indictment returned in August 2023 as a go-between for Trump and others involved in coordinating the strategy for contesting the 2020 election and disrupting the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021. He participated in a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call between Trump and Raffensperger, during which the then-president asked Raffensperger to \"find\" 11,780 votes, enough to make him the winner of Georgia's election.",
      "After Meadows was charged, he sought to transfer the case to federal court under a federal officer removal statute and argued that the actions alleged in the indictment related to his role as chief of staff.",
      "The district court, however, sent the case back to the Fulton County Superior Court. While U.S. District Judge Steve Jones conceded that some of the charged conduct involved Meadows' official duties, there was not enough evidence to establish that a \"heavy majority\" of the acts alleged against him related to his role as chief of staff.",
      "\"Meadows's alleged association with post-election activities was not related to his role as White House Chief of Staff or his executive branch authority,\" Jones wrote in his September 2023 decision.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld the district court's decision, finding that the federal officer removal statute does not apply to former federal officers and \"his participation in an alleged conspiracy to overturn a presidential election was not related to his official duties.\"",
      "\"At bottom, whatever the chief of staff's role with respect to state election administration, that role does not include altering valid election results in favor of a particular candidate,\" Chief Judge William Pryor wrote for the three-judge panel.",
      "Meadows appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that whether a chief of staff prosecuted based on actions related to his work for the president can remove his case to federal court is not a close call.",
      "Calling the 11th Circuit's decision \"miserly and counterintuitive,\" Meadow's lawyers warned in a filing that allowing it to stand would open former federal officers up to politicized state prosecutions for unpopular federal policies.",
      "\"The chief of staff is a unique federal officer, the top aide to a coequal branch of government personified by the president,\" they wrote. \"If former officers cannot remove at all, and if even a current chief of staff cannot remove a case arising out of acts taken in the White House in service of the president, then the floodgates are open, and 'nightmare scenarios' will not take long to materialize.\"",
      "Fulton County prosecutors urged the Supreme Court to reject Meadows' appeal and leave the 11th Circuit's decision in place. They noted that Trump did not even move his case to federal court, and said Meadows failed to \"articulate any coherent source of authority for the president or his staff to supervise or affect a state's administration of elections.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawmakers are returning to Washington Tuesday for a lame duck session after Republicans flipped the Senate and appear poised to hold onto control of the House after last week's elections.",
      "The new Congress will be seated in January, and President-elect Donald Trump's agenda is expected to be its central focus. Until then, Senate Democrats may make a push to approve their priorities with their remaining days in control of the upper chamber.",
      "Lawmakers are also facing deadlines on other must-pass legislation, including funding the government, as they lay the groundwork for the new Congress with new-member orientation and leadership elections this week and next.",
      "The new Congress",
      "House Republicans reveled in their victories last week, expressing confidence that they would retain control of the lower chamber in the new year with just a handful of seats to go. Speaker Mike Johnson wrote a letter to colleagues asking for their continued support for his leadership, now that the election has delivered a \"mandate\" for a unified Republican government.",
      "\"If we meet this historic moment together, the next two years can result in the most consequential Congress of the modern era,\" Johnson continued, noting that \"to truly make America great again, we will need to begin delivering for the people on day one.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats continued to hold onto some hopes of flipping the House, to be the only check on Republican political power in Washington. Still, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who leads the Progressive Caucus, acknowledged Monday that Democrats have a \"very slim path to the majority.\"",
      "\"We are going to do our work to help rebuild and to come back from this loss and recalibrate,\" Jayapal said at a news conference to introduce the newly elected progressives.",
      "On the other side of the Capitol, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell praised the quality of Republican candidates in Senate races this cycle, saying the day after the election that he's \"never seen a better performance.\" With the new majority of at least 52 seats, the outgoing leader argued that Republicans did \"pretty well\" with narrow majorities during the last administration, citing three new Supreme Court justices and tax reform.",
      "\"It's harder, but I think we were successful before with a narrow majority and I think we will be again,\" McConnell said.",
      "Republicans to hold leadership elections",
      "In the Senate, Republicans will vote Wednesday to elect a new leader, since McConnell announced he would step aside earlier this year. A high-stakes race to replace the longest-serving leader in the chamber's history has been taking place behind the scenes.",
      "GOP Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, are considered the front-runners in the race to replace McConnell. But Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has seen a surge of support from members of Trump's orbit \u2014 from Tucker Carlson to Elon Musk \u2014 that has drawn more attention to the race.",
      "How the outside input weighs on the race remains to be seen. Senate Republicans will meet behind closed doors and cast secret ballots to elect a new leader, making them less likely to be swayed by outside pressures. But an endorsement of a candidate from Trump himself could change the dynamic. He has already weighed in with a demand about recess appointments.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republicans are also set to conduct leadership elections this week. With a stronger-than-expected showing across the House races, the current leadership slate is expected to enjoy widespread support to remain at the helm of the chamber. But Trump's selection of GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik to serve as ambassador to the U.N. created another opening in the leadership races.",
      "Lame duck to-do list: funding government, Biden's judicial nominations",
      "Congress is returning to pressure to avert a government shutdown after lawmakers approved a continuing resolution to keep the government funded through Dec. 20 earlier this year.",
      "The pre-holiday deadline to prevent a shutdown is commonplace for Congress, though it frustrates some House Republicans looking to avoid a vote on a massive spending bill known as an \"omnibus.\" Johnson said in September that he opposes an omnibus funding package around the holidays, suggesting that he would work to approve the12 full-year spending bills individually after the election. But the new balance of power in Washington next year almost certainly changes the calculus.",
      "House Republicans have so far approved a handful of the full-year spending bills, although they've done so on a partisan basis that makes them nonstarters in the Senate. And the upper chamber has yet to vote on any individual spending bills this year. The reality makes another stopgap measure punting a broader funding fight into the new year likely.",
      "Lawmakers may also address funding for disaster relief following the devastation caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton in the southeastern U.S. earlier this year. And an annual defense policy bill is also a top priority before the year's end.",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are expected to vote on judicial nominations, as President Biden has sought to match or even surpass the total number of judicial confirmations in Trump's first term. The issue takes on heightened importance for Democrats with another Trump term on the horizon.",

    "story": [
      "New York \u2014\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump's criminal conviction lives on, at least for another week.",
      "A New York judge on Tuesday deferred making an immediate decision on whether presidential immunity should have prevented jurors from seeing certain evidence at Trump's trial this spring \u2014 and if the verdict should be tossed.",
      "Justice Juan Merchan said he will rule next week on whether a July Supreme Court ruling granting Trump presidential immunity for official acts precludes a jury from finding him guilty after a criminal trial this spring.",
      "Merchan did not directly address sentencing, which had been scheduled for Nov. 26.",
      "A prosecutor for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg emailed Merchan Sunday night, saying Trump asked for a pause \"based on the impact on this proceeding from the results of the Presidential election.\"",
      "\"The People agree that these are unprecedented circumstances,\" wrote the prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, who added there's a need to balance the interests of \"a jury verdict of guilt following trial that has the presumption of regularity; and the Office of the President.\"",
      "Trump lawyer Emil Bove followed up in his own email to Merchan, writing that a \"stay, and dismissal, are necessary to avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump's ability to govern.\"",
      "The long-awaited ruling, on whether evidence shown at trial should have been shielded from jurors, due to presidential immunity, could have profound consequences for the case.",
      "Trump was the first former president ever to be convicted of crimes. On Nov. 5, he also became the first person with a criminal record ever to be elected president.",
      "Trump's lawyers vowed the day a unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May to fight his conviction. They were given an extraordinary opportunity not long after when the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts. The decision said evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",
      "Trump's legal team, which is led by Todd Blanche, seized on the landmark ruling, demanding Trump's conviction be set aside, and his sentencing canceled. They argued jurors should never have heard testimony related to Trump's communications with former White House communications director Hope Hicks, or his former executive assistant and director of White House Operations Madeleine Westerhout.",
      "Prosecutors argued in response that the Supreme Court ruling didn't apply to evidence shown at trial. They also said the material protested by Trump's lawyers were \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence the jury considered.",
      "The jury ultimately concluded that Trump committed 34 felonies in signing off on a scheme to cover-up reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen had paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, to buy her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump years early. The agreement has often been referred to as a \"hush money\" deal.",
      "Trump insists he is not guilty of falsifying business records \u2014 the charge he was convicted on \u2014 and has vehemently denied Daniels' story.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision in July was the latest curveball in a case that dates back to 2018, when the Manhattan District Attorney's office first began investigating the \"hush money\" deal.",
      "Trump, amid his first term as president, fought the investigation as it expanded into a wide-ranging probe of his finances. The case's first landmark Supreme Court ruling came in 2020, when the nation's highest court ruled the Constitution does not preclude a state criminal subpoena of a sitting president. The ruling allowed the Manhattan District Attorney, then Cyrus Vance Jr., access to Trump's tax returns.",
      "The borough's next district attorney, Alvin Bragg, took up the case but narrowed its focus, bringing it back to the \"hush money\" deal. On March 31, 2023, a grand jury made Trump the first ever former, and future, president indicted for crimes.",
      "Trump's seven-week trial began just more than a year later, on April 15. The jury returned his conviction after a day and a half of deliberations.",
      "Trump, sullen but defiant, walked out of the courtroom and in front of cameras just steps away immediately returned to his campaign for the presidency.",

    "story": [
      "Former Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, who admitted he illegally posted sensitive military information to online chat rooms in what prosecutors called one of the \"most prolific\" and \"rare\" government leak operations, is set to be sentenced in a Boston courtroom on Tuesday.",
      "Teixeira, a 22-year-old Massachusetts native, pleaded guilty in March to six counts of violating the Espionage Act, acknowledging he was behind the yearlong distribution of dozens of classified government documents \u2014 including some marked \"top secret\" \u2014 on Discord, a social media platform. The classified documents involved in the leak touched on a number of sensitive issues, but the most notable were about Russia's war in Ukraine, detailed troop movements and timelines for Western weapons deliveries to the war-torn country, investigators said.",
      "Federal law enforcement arrested Teixeira at his family's Massachusetts home after a weekslong probe into how sensitive Pentagon records were ending up online.",
      "Prosecutors have asked a federal judge to sentence the defendant to 200 months in prison \u2014 almost 17 years \u2014 for his central role in \"one of the most significant and consequential violations of the Espionage Act in American history,\" one that has prompted reforms in the handling of classified information.",
      "\"The harm the defendant caused to the national security from his disclosures of national defense information is extraordinary,\" prosecutors wrote in an October court filing.",
      "For over a year, investigators said Teixeira, who had top secret security clearance as an IT worker at the Otis Air National Guard Base,accessed the classified documents illegally and either hand-copied the information or printed the records before posting the data in the Discord chat rooms. He even messaged individuals in his forums and offered to find specific information about \"happenings that pertain to your country,\" court records said.",
      "The national defense information began appearing online in February 2022, but investigators didn't link the leaks to Teixeira for over a year. Prosecutors alleged Teixeira knew his conduct was illegal and accused him of violating his oath to serve.",
      "As the investigation into the leaks zeroed in on Teixeira's unit, prosecutors alleged in previous court documents that Teixeira began instructing others in the Discord group to \"delete all messages.\"",
      "\"[i]f anyone comes looking, don't tell them sh**,\" he allegedly wrote to one user. And he told another, \"Try to delete all my messages in civil discussions.\"",
      "\"In the aggregate, the defendant's criminal conduct over the course of more than a year 'critically and negatively impacted' the Department of Defense's mission, endangered his fellow soldiers, other citizens, and allied governments throughout the world,\" prosecutors argued last month, urging the judge to impose a heavy sentence.",
      "Teixeira's defense attorney, however, asked for a sentence of 11 years in prison, telling the judge, \"His intent was never to harm the United States,\" but to \"educate his friends about world events to make certain they were not misled by misinformation.\"",
      "Revealing that Teixeira was diagnosed with autism, his lawyer wrote in an October court filing that \"his motives and decisions were na\u00efve, not nefarious.\" Teixeira accepted responsibility for the admitted crimes, including by participating in an hourslong briefing with members of the intelligence community, the defense filings argued.",
      "\"The actions of Jack Teixeira are inexcusable,\" the attorney wrote, describing his client not as a criminal leaker but as a misguided young person swept up in an online ecosystem. \"However, Jack is still essentially a child \u2013 at the very least, a 'youthful offender' \u2013 who has his whole life in front of him.\"",
      "Following Teixeira's arrest, the Air Force inspector general found that individuals in his Massachusetts unit failed to take proper action after at least four separate security incidents. Members of his unit \"enabled\" the leaks by not properly supervising his access to classified information, the review concluded. The Air National Guard took action against 15 individuals for \"dereliction in the performance of duties\" as a result of the report's findings.",
      "Texeira also faces charges of disobeying orders and obstructing justice in a military court martial, which are expected to be adjudicated in March.",

      "William Pope, a Jan. 6 defendant from Kansas, has filed a new request for a delay, blistering the Justice Department for continuing apace with his prosecution.\u00a0Pope's filing cited Trump's reelection, arguing, \"Any further action in these cases is not an 'administration of justice' in the public interest as the government claims, but a belligerent disregard for the will of the American people, from which all law and governmental power in this country is derived.\"",
      "In a new request to delay his sentencing, defendant Terry Allen's attorneys filed a motion saying, \"History has shown that President Donald Trump is not shy when it comes to exercising his pardon powers and there is clearly no reason to believe he won't do as he says.\" Allen's attorneys noted that in Trump's first term, he \"pardoned, commuted, or rescinded the convictions of 237 people,\" and \"[m]any were controversial.\"",
      "Some defendants are quoting Trump's campaign statements in their new court filings. Attorneys for defendant Larry Brock argued that Trump \"explicitly campaigned on justice for the January 6 defendants.\" They cited Trump's July 31 interview with the National Association of Black Journalists, in which he said he'd \"'absolutely' pardon those convicted in the January 6th prosecutions because 'they were convicted by a very tough system.'\" They also quoted Trump's claim about Jan. 6 convicts: \"'[S]ome call them prisoners. I call them hostages...release the J6 hostages, Joe. Release them, Joe. You can do it real easy, Joe.'\"",
      "Brock, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, was accused of rifling through papers on the desks of senators while amid the mob.",
      "Defense attorney Joseph McBride, who has defended several Jan. 6 criminal defendants told CBS News that requests would be made \"across the board\" to delay cases until Trump takes office. \"It would be foolish not to,\" he said. \"The Justice Department Is still arresting people, which is nuts and pointless. The pardon thing is looming. And I don't think any of these prosecutions will continue beyond (Trump taking office).\"",
      "Former federal prosecutor Scott Fredericksen told CBS News he thinks the Justice Department is going to be forced to confront the question of what to do with the cases.",
      "\"The department will probably say, 'We're going to continue with the cases,' and that the discussion of pardons is not sufficient to warrant delays,\" Fredricksen said.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately return requests for comment. In court filings, it has opposed requests for delays. In the case of Terry Allen, prosecutors disagreed that a continuance of the case was warranted because \"the defendant's justification at this time is mere speculation.\"",
      "\"The Court should proceed as it would in any other prosecution,\" prosecutors argued. \"Courts in this jurisdiction have denied similar motions.\"",
      "Opposing a request to delay the trial of defendant Stephen Baker, the Justice Department argued, \"There is a public interest in the prompt and efficient administration of justice. The government and the Court have endeavored to deliver that interest. The government disagrees that a continuance is warranted here, and the Court should proceed as it would in any other prosecution.\"",
      "But the numbers of delay requests are expected to grow significantly. McBride, the New York-based defense attorney, told CBS News requests are expected by all similarly situated defendants. He said defense attorneys must argue for all of their clients and may not \"pick and choose\" to ask for delays only for some.",
      "In his court filing, Pope included a photo of himself standing next to Trump.",
      "\"It is now up to the Court to decide if it wishes to expend judicial resources by enduring a taxing schedule in this case,\" the filing said. \"Ultimately, I will get the same result with a trial or with no trial.\"",
      "The Justice Department has launched over 1,500 criminal cases in its prosecution of the Capitol siege.\u00a0 According to federal records, approximately 950 defendants have pleaded guilty, and 200 more have been found guilty at trial.",
      "Arrests continue, including new cases unsealed over the past few weeks.",
      "Fredericksen said a Trump-appointed attorney general could move to have the department dismiss pending Jan. 6 cases \u2014 and could opt to reopen and dismiss cases against those who have already been convicted and sentenced to prison.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:49:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump campaign co-chair Susie Wiles will serve as White House chief of staff, the first woman \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 ever to hold that position.",
    "story": [
      "Last week,\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0announced his campaign co-chair Susie Wiles will serve as his White House chief of staff, the first woman \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 ever to hold that position. Calling her \"tough, smart, innovative..., universally admired and respected,\" Trump credited her with helping him win both the 2024 and 2016 elections.",
      "Behind the scenes",
      "Wiles is known as a formidable political operative who prefers to work behind the scenes, rather than on any stage \u2014 or in front of cameras. In keeping with that, when Trump\u00a0declared victory\u00a0in the early hours of last Wednesday morning, he invited her to come to the microphones, but she politely declined.",
      "She's managed to not just curry favor, but more critically, to remain in good standing with Trump, winning his trust while working in a high-profile campaign role, managing the ambitions, personalities and egos in Trump's orbit.",
      "Relationship with campaign staff",
      "Wiles is beloved by the Trump campaign staff, many of whom call her a mentor.",
      "\"Susie Wiles is a tremendous advocate for President Trump and a great boss to those that work for her,\" said Trump senior adviser Danielle Alvarez. \"She knows how to bring people together.\"",
      "\"For myself and countless others, having Susie Wiles as a mentor and a friend is a gift,\" said Brian Hughes, another senior adviser. \"The nation will see that with President Trump in the White House with Susie as the COS the next four years will be America's best.\"",
      "Those who have worked for Wiles \"will take a bullet for Susie,\" said Carlos Trujillo, a campaign adviser who served as U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States. Trujillo said most people don't see Wiles' motherly and grandmotherly side. \"She always made sure her people were taken care of,\" he said. \"She's very soft spoken, but she holds everyone accountable, and it's always done through love and kindness but never a place of hate.\"",
      "Management style",
      "Staffers say Wiles runs a tight and focused ship. Trump's 2024 campaign did not go through the big, dramatic shakeups or infighting that characterized his previous campaigns. Wiles' appointment signals that as president-elect, he wants to run his administration in a similar way.",
      "Wiles' legacy, Trujillo said, is her ability to cultivate talent. \"Susie in politics is the greatest coach of all time...she's going to be able to recruit the best talent.\"",
      "And while Wiles shies away from the spotlight, she made a rare comment on X when businessman Mark Cuban, in an interview on ABC's \"The View,\" accused Trump of not associating with \"strong, intelligent women.\" In response, Wiles\u00a0posted\u00a0for the first time this year: \"I'm told [Mark Cuban] needs help identifying the strong and intelligent women surrounding Pres. Trump. Well, here we are!\"",
      "Background",
      "After Trump won the 2016 election, Wiles, who was the chief strategist in Florida for his campaign, was dispatched in late September of 2018 to help Ron DeSantis with his 2018 bid to be Florida governor. At the time, he was trailing Democrat Andrew Gillum in several polls.",
      "After helping DeSantis win, however, Wiles was shut out of his inner circle, according to\u00a0The Atlantic's Tim Alberta. Wiles told Alberta that working for DeSantis was the \"biggest mistake\" of her career. She returned to the Trump campaign and ran his Florida campaign in 2020, and then after his loss, she went on to run Trump's Save America PAC.",
      "As Trump's 2024 co-campaign manager, Wiles, along with Chris LaCivita, hatched a plan to recruit, register and turn out Trump's low-propensity voters, Alberta reported. During the primary campaign, they pursued people in the reddest areas of the country who liked Trump but weren't habitual voters and in many cases, weren't even registered to vote. During the general campaign, Wiles and LaCivita raised a volunteer army to take on the legions of canvassers paid by Kamala Harris' cash-rich coffers.",
      "Wiles is a native of New Jersey, the daughter of renowned the late NFL kicker and sportscaster Pat Summerall. Soon after she graduated from college at the University of Maryland, she worked for Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign, and later went on to work in Florida politics. In 2010, she helped Sen. Rick Scott win his election against Democrat Bill McCollum, and she has also been a political consultant in Florida.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 15:57:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump wants his people in place in his administration as soon as possible.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday that he's appointing a \"border czar,\" former Immigrations and Customs Enforcement director and immigration hardliner Tom Homan, to join his administration. Homan, however, may not be the only such \"czar\" in the Trump administration.",
      "\"I am pleased to announce that the Former ICE Director, and stalwart on Border Control, Tom Homan, will be joining the Trump Administration, in charge of our Nation's Borders (\"The Border Czar\"), including, but not limited to, the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The term \"czar\" is shorthand for a high-level executive branch official in charge of a specific policy focus.",
      "They aren't Senate-confirmed positions",
      "The \"czar\" role is one that allows a president to step over the pesky checks and balances of the three branches of government. \"Czar\" roles aren't Senate-confirmed cabinet positions, like say, the secretary of state or Health and Human Services secretary. That means a president can appoint that person to his administration without the Senate's input, and quickly.",
      "Trump wants to put his people in place, and quickly, after experiencing in his first term how congressional authority can gum up an administration's plans. Trump said as much in a social media post on Sunday.",
      "\"Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more,\" Trump wrote Sunday, saying he wants recess appointments. \"This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again. We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\"",
      "Trump wouldn't be the first president to use \"czars\"",
      "Trump would not be the first president to use \"czars.\" Such czars have been appointed by presidents of both parties. Former President Barack Obama had, in part, an \"energy and environment czar,\" \"Afghanistan czar,\" \"car czar,\" \"health czar\" and \"auto recovery czar.\"",
      "His use of these positions was so widespread that in 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the history and legality of executive branch czars. The committee noted that some of these policy czars were at one point confirmed by the Senate, while others were in positions outside the White House that reported to a Senate-confirmed officer. But a handful worked in the White House. The use of such \"czars\" ignited a firestorm of criticism from Republicans, and even some Democrats raised concerns about their authority.",
      "But presidents before Obama had \"czars,\" too. President Bill Clinton had a \"Y2K czar,\" and President George W. Bush had an \"AIDS czar,\" \"counterterrorism czar\" and \"reading czar,\" among others. Historians believe the role dates back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, who rapidly expanded the size and role of the federal government.",
      "Trump also had something of a \"czar\" in his first term. Moncef Slaoui, a former pharmaceutical executive, oversaw Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's initiative to fast-track COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "During the Obama administration, Republicans blasted the growth of the administrative state, and decisions made by unelected bureaucrats. And during the Trump administration, Trump supporters bemoaned the so-called \"deep state\" of unelected career officers.",
      "Vice President Harris was sometimes dubbed a \"border czar,\" although not by President Biden himself, since the president tasked her with tackling the influx of migrants at the southern border. Harris fought against that label as the Democratic nominee.",
      "A \"czar\" position could make room for controversial names like RFK, Jr.",
      "The Senate will be controlled by Republicans when Trump takes office. But Trump still may have trouble confirming a few of the most controversial names, like vaccine denier Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to Senate-confirmed Cabinet positions.",
      "Kennedy\u00a0is on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the\u00a0president-elect's\u00a0campaign said. But it's also possible Kennedy could serve in a less formal role, like a \"czar.\"",
      "Where did the concept of \"czars\" originate?",
      "\"Czar\" comes from the Russian word \"tsar,\" which is derived from the Latin word \"caesar,\" according to World History Encyclopedia. Specifically, the term tsar refers to Russia's rulers for hundreds of years. Ivan IV The Terrible was formally crowned the \"tsar of all Russia\" in 1547, and the title continued until Russia's monarchy was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917.",
      "Franklin D. Roosevelt, who greatly expanded the size and scope of the federal government, used \"czars.\" But even before his time in office, the first use of the phrase \"czar\" in the U.S. was likely Nicholas Biddle, tapped to be president of the Bank of the United States during Andrew Jackson's presidency. He was sometimes called \"Czar Nicholas,\" which overlapped with Russia's Czar Nicholas I's reign.",
      "Over time, the term in U.S. came to be used informally for people handpicked by the president for principal positions who don't undergo Senate vetting, scrutiny or confirmation.",
      "What are the pros and cons of \"czars\"?",
      "Critics of such roles have argued \"czars\" run amock of the checks and balances system the forefathers founded. The late Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd criticized both Obama and Bush for creating such roles in their administrations.",
      "\"The rapid and easy accumulation of power by White House staff can threaten the Constitutional system of checks and balances,\" Byrd wrote in a publicized letter to Obama in 2009. \"At the worst, White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.\"",
      "The president can, of course, appoint White House employees. The constitutional issues come into question when the president selects a principal who isn't Senate-confirmed.",
      "But for a president looking to appoint an ally quickly, a \"czar\" is logistically much easier to get into office than is a Cabinet secretary.",
      "How effective a \"czar\" can really be is up for debate \u2014 especially since \"czars\" generally don't control budgets.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 10:46:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Could the tariffs Trump's threatened to slap on Chinese imports backfire and help Beijing? Some experts say they will.",
    "story": [
      "Hong Kong \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap up a tariff of up to 60% on all goods imported to the U.S. from China. While that may sound like a potent economic threat to a country where economic growth is already faltering, could it actually be just what China needs?",
      "\"I do expect U.S.-China economic relations to be more volatile under Trump, but I think overall, this may turn out to be better for China,\" Chen Zhiwu, the top finance professor at the University of Hong Kong and a former professor at Yale University, told CBS News.",
      "Chen said if Trump does follow through with his threat of such steep tariffs on China, it \"might force the leadership in Beijing to have no other choice but to focus on the economy \u2014 especially given that the Chinese economy right now is in very big trouble.\"",
      "Since the start of Trump's first term in the White House, and through President Biden's term, China's economic growth has slowed from roughly 7% to 4.5%. The country's property market has crashed because of massive overbuilding, leading to the rise of empty ghost cities. Youth unemployment rocketed to a new high of nearly 19% in September, dimming prospects for China's future workforce.",
      "Beijing's intense focus over the past decade on bolstering its military to meet its geopolitical ambition of rivaling the U.S. and its European and Asia-Pacific allies has further sacrificed opportunities for domestic economic growth, said Chen.",
      "\"If you count the number of warships, China has by far the highest number of warships than any country, higher than even the U.S.' naval ships. What industries have grown the most so far this year? Definitely those warfare-related industries have gone up the most, but those consumer-oriented industries have had no growth or negative growth,\" he said.",
      "Most of China's top 20 aerospace and defense stocks have recorded double-digit growth over the past year alone.",
      "Tariffs \"a good thing for China for the long term\"?",
      "\"The pressure the U.S. is putting on China will become a good thing for China for the long term,\" agreed Wang Xiangwei, a former editor-in-chief of the Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post.",
      "China has relied on two primary engines to support rapid economic growth over the past 40 years, since former leader Deng Xiaoping initiated reforms and started opening the country up, Wang told CBS News. Those have been manufacturing cheap exports for the world by leveraging China's long-cheap labor force, and later, spending billions on domestic infrastructure including roads, rail and airports.",
      "But labor has become more expensive with the rise of China's booming middle class, and the government is running out of new things to build across the country.",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "Beijing has found it difficult, meanwhile, to fire up a potential third engine of economic growth: The capacity of the country's 1.3 billion people to consume domestically made products.",
      "Trump's threatened tariffs could give a needed external push for that to change, said Wang.",
      "\"I believe China's going to suffer in the short term. In the long term, he's [Trump] going to help China to make that painful transition,\" Wang said, noting that in the U.S., domestic consumption accounts for 70% to 80% of the national GDP, while in China, it's \"only about 60%.\"",
      "In effect, pushing China's own people to buy more of their country's own goods and services could, in the view of the two analysts, prove to be Beijing's best protection against Trump's threatened tariffs.",
      "\"The best tool would be to stimulate consumption growth inside China,\" said Chen. \"At the moment, the leadership has not really tried to help the Chinese consumers by sending them government checks and even tax costs to corporations. I think if the Chinese government really moves in that direction more aggressively, then it would help the Chinese economy generate more internal domestic consumption demand to make up for some of their possible lost exports to the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing needs Washington, but tariffs could have a complex impact",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 25% on Chinese agricultural products imported to the U.S., including seafood, pork and dairy. Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs, kicking off a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "Nearly eight years later, however, Beijing appears less able to wage such a war, due to its close economic links with the U.S.",
      "\"In terms of retaliation choices for China, it's very limited,\" said Chen. \"China imports a lot of agricultural products like soybeans, corn. They may try to import more such agricultural products from Brazil, and also from Russia as one of their ways to retaliate against the U.S. But at the end of the day, China imports so much [computer] chips from Nvidia, Intel, especially Qualcomm,\" Wang said. \"Those products are what China needs. So, China cannot produce internally.\"",
      "In effect, if Beijing does impose retaliatory tariffs, it could be shooting itself in the proverbial foot. Tariffs would make all those products, vital to China's continued economic and technological development, more expensive for its own people.",
      "But another possible impact of Trump's expected protectionist policies could actually be to push some of America's oldest allies and trade partners closer to China, reversing the so-called decoupling of the U.S. and Western European economies from Beijing that Washington has pushed under Mr. Biden.",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "\"The Biden administration did such a good job to more or less unite that,\" said Chen. \"If Trump makes the EU and NATO member countries upset, that makes it more possible for Germany, for France or Italy or even the U.K. to warm up more with China on the trade front. So, that may help neutralize, to some extent, the negative impact of the expected Trump tariffs on Chinese goods.\"",
      "Trump has claimed repeatedly that foreign companies would foot the bill, effectively absorbing the additional costs of exporting to the U.S. market imposed by his tariffs, but many economists disagree, and say it would effectively be a tax on American consumers.",
      "According to findings released by the National Retail Federation last week, U.S. consumers could lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power per year on everything from clothes and toys to household appliances and travel goods if there is a 60% blanket tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",
      "All of that said, and despite Trump's history of anti-China rhetoric, it remains unclear how quickly his administration might actually move to roll out sweeping tariffs, with some economists speculating that the president-elect plans, initially at least, to use the threat of additional levies as a cudgel to negotiate more favorable trade terms with Beijing. Trump could also choose to gradually phase in tariffs, delaying their full impact on China's economy.",
      "Will China attack Taiwan, and would Trump come to the rescue?",
      "Trump's return to the White House may also help Beijing further its interests with Taiwan, the democratically governed island of 23 million people just off China's east coast that the country considers a renegade province. President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under Beijing's control, by force if necessary.",
      "Since the U.S. government enacted the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, the U.S. is strategically committed to aid in Taiwan's defense in the event of any aggression, including by selling weapons to the island's government.",

      "A Navy destroyer that was sunk by Japanese forces during World War II has been discovered, the U.S. Navy confirmed on Monday. The Royal Australian Navy found the USS Edsall at the bottom of the Indian Ocean more than 80 years after it went down with more than 200 crew members on board.",
      "The USS Edsall, a 314-foot destroyer, was built in 1919 and commissioned in 1920. During World War II, the ship took part in numerous conveys, protecting other vessels from Japanese attacks in Australian waters.",
      "On March 1, 1942, Japanese naval forces attacked the ship. During the extended engagement, the Edsall was able to dodge heavy shelling, which led some Japanese soldiers to nickname the ship \"the dancing mouse,\" according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. Japanese air forces later joined the attack, and several hours after the fight began, the Edsall sank with over 200 crew members on board, having taken just one fatal hit among thousands of rounds.",
      "Almost all of the crew members were lost, according to the U.S. Navy, making the wreck \"a hallowed site.\"",
      "The shipwreck was recently found by the Royal Australian Navy. The announcement of the discovery was made on November 11, which marked\u00a0Veteran's Day in the United States and Remembrance Day in other parts of the world.",
      "\"This is part of our continuing efforts to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice,\" said U.S. Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy in a statement announcing the discovery. \"We will now be able to preserve this important memorial and hope that the families of the heroes who died there will know their loved ones rest in peace. We will tell their stories, learn from their bravery, and be inspired by their sacrifice. We will always remember them.\"",
      "Little information was provided about how the ship was found.

There were no details provided about what condition the ship was in, or how the wreck will be preserved.",
      "The announcement of the Edsall's discovery came just three days after U.K. military officials revealed that a shipwreck discovered off the coast of Scotland was confirmed to be a British cruiser sunk by a torpedo during World War I, killing more than 500 crew members on board.",

    "summary": "The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, resigned after a review found he and other Anglican Church leaders covered up \"prolific and abhorrent\" abuse of boys and young men.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, head of the global Anglican Church, resigned Tuesday after a review found that he and other senior church leaders had covered up the \"prolific and abhorrent\" abuse of over 100 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and other countries by a British lawyer who helped lead Christian summer camps in the U.K. and other countries.",
      "John Smyth was accused of attacking boys and young men he met at Christian camps in the 1970s and 1980s. He died in South Africa in 2018 at the age of 77 without ever facing any legal proceedings.",
      "\"The last few days have renewed my long felt and profound sense of shame at the historic safeguarding failures of the Church of England,\" Welby said in a statement announcing his resignation. \"For nearly twelve years I have struggled to introduce improvements. It is for others to judge what has been done.\"",
      "An independent Church of England review into the handling of complaints against Smyth found last week that, \"despite the efforts of some individuals to bring the abuse to the attention of authorities, the responses by the Church of England and others were wholly ineffective and amounted to a coverup,\" the leader of the review said.",
      "\"I am so sorry that in places where these young men, and boys, should have felt safe and where they should have experienced God's love for them, they were subjected to physical, sexual, psychological and spiritual abuse,\" Welby said in an initial statement responding to the review's findings. \"I am sorry that concealment by many people who were fully aware of the abuse over many years meant that John Smyth was able to abuse overseas and died before he ever faced justice.\"",
      "Welby has said he was unaware of Smyth's abuse until 2013, the year he became the archbishop.",
      "\"Nevertheless the review is clear that I personally failed to ensure that after disclosure in 2013 the awful tragedy was energetically investigated,\" Welby said. \"Since that time the way in which the Church of England engages with victims and survivors has changed beyond recognition. Checks and balances introduced seek to ensure that the same could not happen today.\"",
      "The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior figure in the Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church. The New York-based Episcopal Church, which has 1.6 million members, is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion and there are over 7,000 Episcopal churches across the U.S.",
      "Welby has played a central role in many high-profile events, including officiating the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and delivering the sermon at the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.",
      "\"I think, rightly, people are asking the question: 'Can we really trust the Church of England to keep us safe?' And I think the answer at the moment is 'no,'\" Bishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley told CBS News' partner network BBC News, calling on Welby to resign.",
      "Andrew Morse, who told the BBC he was abused for years by Smyth as a teenager, had also called for Welby to resign. He said Welby's \"admission that in 2013, which is really modern day in comparison to the 1970s and 1980s, that he didn't do enough, that he wasn't rigorous\u2026 is enough in my mind to confirm that Justin Welby, along with countless other Anglican churchmen, were part of a cover-up about the abuse.\"",
      "Morse said he was beaten several times by Smyth during his youth, and that further abuse could have been stopped if Welby had acted when he found out about Smyth's actions in 2013.",
      "\"It is those African lives and those African victims that are very much on my conscience \u2014 and I would hope on the archbishop's conscience too.\"",

    "story": [
      "Beirut \u2014 Declassified 1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led a British-Iraqi archeological team to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that became decisive in the spread of Islam throughout the region.",
      "The Battle of al-Qadisiyah was fought in Mesopotamia \u2014 in present-day Iraq \u2014 in the A.D. 630s between Arab Muslims and the army of the Sassanid Persian dynasty during a period of Muslim expansion. The Arab army prevailed and continued on its march into Persia, now Iran.",
      "A joint team of archeologists from the U.K.'s Durham University and the University of Al-Qadisiyah stumbled across the site while undertaking a remote sensing survey to map the Darb Zubaydah, a pilgrimage route from Iraq's Kufa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia built more than 1,000 years ago. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "While mapping the route, the team noticed that a site some 20 miles south of Kufa in Iraq's southern Najaf province \u2014 a desert area with scattered plots of agricultural land \u2014 had features that closely matched the description of the al-Qadisiyah battle site described in historic texts.",
      "William Deadman, a specialist in archaeological remote sensing at Durham University, said the Cold War era satellite images are commonly used tools by archeologists working in the Middle East because the older images often show features that have been destroyed or altered and wouldn't show up on present-day satellite images.",
      "\"The Middle East has developed so much in the last 50 years, both agricultural expansion and urban expansion,\" he said. Some of the distinguishing features at the al-Qadisiyah site, such as a distinctive trench, were \"much more pristine and clear\" in the 1970s images, he said.",
      "A survey on the ground confirmed the findings and convinced the team that they had correctly identified the site.",
      "The key features were a deep trench, two fortresses and an ancient river that was reportedly once forded by elephant-mounted Persian troops, said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah who's part of the team that made the discovery. The survey team also found pottery shards consistent with the time period when the battle took place.",
      "A revealing, well-known battle",
      "Jotheri said Iraqis of his generation, who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein, were all familiar with the battle in minute detail, down to the names of the generals on both sides.",
      "The battle at the time had political connotations \u2014 Iraq was engaged in a devastating war with Iran through much of the 1980s. Saddam pointed to the Battle of Qadisiyah as a harbinger of victory for Iraq.",
      "Like most children growing up in that era, Jotheri said he'd watched a popular movie about the battle multiple times as it was on regular rotation on television.",
      "In the post-Saddam era, al-Qadisiyah has become something of a political litmus test. Iraqis' views of the battle vary depending on their feelings toward Iran, which has expanded its influence in the country since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam.",
      "\"There is some political and religious context in this battle because now, of course, we have religious differences, ethnic differences, political differences in Iraq and we read or we view everything based on our \u2026 differences,\" Jotheri said. But he added, \"We all agree that it is a very important battle, a decisive one, and we all know about it.\"",
      "Discovery was part of a regional trend",
      "The team plans to begin excavations at the site in the coming year, Jotheri said.",
      "The discovery comes as part of a broader project launched in 2015 to document endangered archaeological sites in the region.",
      "It also comes at the time of a resurgence of archeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \"cradle of civilization,\" but where archeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",

      "The team consulted the war diary of the U-boat that sank Hawke, as well as the logs of the nearest warships to the cruiser at the time of its sinking, officials said. Divers also looked at contemporary charts of the North Sea to help pinpoint the possible wreck site.",
      "\"The wreck is in remarkable condition for a vessel of this era, likely due to the depth and having never been dived before,\" said Steve Mortimer, one of the divers. \"It's a fascinating site. You can look through the open scuttles and see artifacts just lying there on the deck. There's lots of Royal Navy crockery, including teacups, plates and bowls. It's a really remarkable time capsule.\"",
      "Mortimer and his team also located two large guns on the bow and stern, guns along the ship's sides as well as an admiral's walkway around the stern and navigation equipment.",
      "Three years before it sank, HMS Hawke made headlines in 1911 when she was damaged after colliding with RMS Olympic \u2013 the sister ship of the Titanic.",
      "After World War I broke out, the warship was assigned to enforce the naval blockade of Germany by patrolling between Scotland and Norway. The cruiser was doomed when on October 15, 1914, she was spotted by U-9 about 80 miles east of Fraserburgh, Scotland.",
      "Lieutenant Commander Jen Smith told the BBC that the Navy appreciated efforts to locate and identify wrecks around the U.K.",

    "title": "China building prototype nuclear reactor for new aircraft carrier, AP says",
    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 12:24:53 -0500",
    "summary": "\"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join,\" says a researcher behind the analysis of satellite images and government documents.",
    "story": [
      "Bangkok \u2014 China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press. China's navy is already the world's largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \"blue-water\" force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States.",
      "\"Nuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\" said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \"For China's leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country's global image as a leading power.\"",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",
      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",
      "Neither China's Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\"The reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\"",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen's complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China's 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \"intended for installation on a large surface warship\" under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project's \"national defense designation\" helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \"national defense-related construction project\" that is classified \"secret.\"",
      "\"Unless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\" researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \"convincing argument.\"",
      "\"From the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\" she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \"carefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\"",
      "\"Given the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\" said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury's research.",
      "China's first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \"ski-jump\" type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn't even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China's People's Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \"soon be announced,\" but so far it has not been.",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once - one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 - something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \"incremental improvements.\"",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \"have taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\"",
      "\"For now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\"",
      "Eventually, however, \"larger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\" Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\"As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\" Childs said.",
      "\"Much will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China's carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy's carriers.\"",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \"with greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\" said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\"These carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military's ability to 'intervene' in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\" Zhao said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \"first-class\" navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country's rejuvenation.",
      "The country's most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \"speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\"",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world's largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China's shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China's rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \"growing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\" the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",
      "And China's \"growing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China's shore,\" the report said.",

      "As delegates from nearly 200 countries gather for a major international summit on addressing the threat of climate change, they're confronting a new era of uncertainty for the United States' climate commitments in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential election victory.",
      "Trump has said that in a second term, he would again exit the Paris Climate Agreement, an accord signed in 2016 aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The U.S. formally withdrew during Trump's first term, but then rejoined under President Biden.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Trump transition office for more information about his plans.",
      "The United States joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, an international treaty, in 1992 and has attended its conferences \u2014 known as COP, for \"Conference of Parties\" \u2014 in many years since, most recently last year's COP28 in Dubai.",
      "Project 2025, the conservative blueprint drawn up by the Heritage Foundation for the next GOP administration \u2014 which the president-elect has endeavored to distance himself from \u2014 calls for the U.S. to withdraw from both the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.",
      "What is COP29?",
      "This year's United Nations Climate Change Conference \u2014 called COP29, since it's the 29th Conference of Parties \u2014 kicks off Monday in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, and runs through Nov. 22.",
      "The annual summit, which is held in a different location every year, brings together world leaders and thousands of other representatives of nations that are party to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Their goal is to take stock of the progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions\u00a0 \u2014 each country sets it own targets and action plan \u2014 and limiting global warming.",
      "So far, the world is falling far short of meeting these climate goals.",
      "Overall,\u00a02023 had the highest greenhouse gas emissions ever recorded, although here are currently 42 countries\u00a0where emissions are decreasing, including the United States, China, Russia and in the European Union.",
      "Without greater reductions over the next few years, the world is on a path to see a temperature increase of more than 3 degrees Celsius, according to an October U.N. report, which warned such an outcome \"would bring debilitating impacts to people, planet and economies.\"",
      "Under the Paris Agreement, countries update their targets for emission cuts (known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs) every five years. The next update is due in February.",
      "Who's going to COP29?",
      "This year, President Biden is sending a delegation that includes John Podesta, the senior presidential adviser for international climate policy, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Ali Zaidi, the White House national climate adviser. Vice President Kamala Harris represented the U.S. at last year's conference.",
      "The gathering in Baku will be smaller than some previous summits for several reasons, including fewer attendance passes and hotel spaces, and concerns over Azerbaijan's human rights record and its oil-production-based economy.",
      "A number of other world leaders have opted not to attend this year, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. California Gov. Gavin Newsom isn't going either, although California often has a strong presence at the conference.",
      "Among the thousands who will attend are delegates from the Taliban government of Afghanistan, the Associated Press reported, citing the country's national environment agency. Though the regime is not internationally recognized, Afghanistan is considered one of the nations most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, with severe drought,\u00a0flooding, and a great need for financial assistance.",
      "Higher attendance is expected at next year's COP30 in Brazil, whose president shown a greater commitment to tackling emissions and climate finance.",
      "What is expected to happen at COP29?",
      "Countries will share updated national climate action plans on how to reduce emissions. The current administration is expected to submit its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) before President Biden leaves office, but whether the commitments will be upheld under the Trump administration seems unlikely.",
      "Attendees will also be discussing climate financing. Developed nations, which are most responsible for climate change, are expected to provide funding to developing nations for climate adaptation and green energy projects. Amnesty International projects that trillions of dollars will be needed to get developing countries up to speed.",
      "What will a Trump presidency mean for U.S. involvement in global climate efforts?",
      "Experts say that withdrawing from major climate agreements has the potential to isolate the U.S. in global climate negotiations, damage its reputation as a leader and encourage other high-emitting nations like China to deprioritize their emissions reductions. Leaving the Paris Agreement would mean the U.S. does not have to report on its emissions each year, and it would have weaker legal responsibilities to provide climate finance to developing countries.",
      "But while exiting these global commitments would be a major setback in the eyes of climate advocates, it wouldn't stop state and local governments, businesses or nonprofits from stepping up.",
      "In the wake of Trump's victory, several climate advocacy organizations released a flurry of statements reiterating their commitment to clean energy investments, carbon emission reduction and environmental protection. States and local governments are also expected to continue investing in initiatives like cap-and-invest programs, carbon neutrality, and infrastructure improvements.",
      "Other countries are also not likely to throw away their climate commitments.",
      "\"I am struck by the last time this happened, even with the shock, not a single other country followed the United States in withdrawing from the agreement,\" said Jonathan Pershing, program director of environment at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and a former special envoy for climate change at the State Department.",
      "Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement would take at least a year to complete, and a future president would have the power to rejoin if they so choose \u2014 just as President Biden did after Trump exited the agreement during his first term.",
      "A withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, on the other hand, could have an even greater long-term impact. Exiting the global treaty would remove the U.S. from the international stage of climate discussions and could hamper the country's ability to participate in negotiations in the future. The U.S. Senate ratified joining the UNFCCC in 1992, which legal experts say could make withdrawal a more complex process.",
      "If the U.S. does withdraw, the rest of the world will continue to negotiate even in its absence. The void left by America will likely be filled by another country, like China, which could negotiate deals that fall in its favor.",
      "\"Leaving the Framework Convention doesn't provide a lot of benefit to a Trump administration,\" said David Waskow, director of International Climate Action at the World Resources Institute, on a call with reporters. \"It actually brings a lot of harm to the U.S. in terms of reputational impacts and the ability to work with other countries on shaping the clean energy economy.\"",

      "\"The furthest north they go from Antarctica is about 50 degrees south [latitude] from my readings and Ocean Beach is 35 degrees south,\" Cannell told Australia's national broadcaster ABC last week. \"So, a lot further north than what they've ever tracked\u00a0emperor\u00a0penguins from Antarctica before.\"",

      "The penguin is 39 inches tall and initially weighed 51 pounds. A healthy male emperor penguin can weigh more than 100 pounds.",
      "The Western Australia biodiversity department said its efforts were focused on rehabilitating the animal. Asked if the penguin could potentially be returned to Antarctica, the department replied that \"options are still being worked through.\"",

      "Emperor penguins are among the species directly threatened by the rising temperature of the oceans and seas across the world. According to The World Wildlife Foundation, about three-quarters of the world's breeding colonies of emperor penguins are vulnerable to fluctuations in the annual sea ice cover in the Antarctic, which have become far more erratic due to climate change.",

      "But Trump\u2019s best performances relative to 2020 were in reliably Democratic states. These states voted for Democrats, but by narrower margins than before.",
      "His strongest improvement was in New York, where the former and future president gained 6.4 points.",
      "His county-level gains were spread across the state, but notably included an improvement in all five of the New York City boroughs (where, again, there are some votes left to be counted).",
      "EARLY VOTES TOP 84M IN 2024 ELECTION",
      "He also posted a 5-point improvement in neighboring New Jersey, enough to reduce the margin of his loss to just 5.5 points. That is the best performance for a Republican candidate in more than three decades.",

      "Just as he improved in the battlegrounds and left-leaning states, he also put up strong gains in states like Texas, Tennessee, South Carolina and Idaho. Trump posted a 3-point improvement in all four of those conservative states, with smaller improvements in over a dozen more.",

It's worth noting that voice assistant technology is continually improving. In the future, we may see more sophisticated context recognition that can better distinguish between similar names on different devices. Until then, these workarounds should help Mike avoid any more awkward explanations to his colleague Terry!",

    "summary": "Shameless scammers trick veterans into giving personal info or cash. Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson explores five common scams.",
    "story": [
      "Chef Robert Irvine of the Robert Irvine Foundation speaks with Fox News Digital about the importance of supporting veterans and first responders this Veterans Day and some unique ways to do so.",
      "Cyberscammers are some of the most heartless people out there. They don\u2019t even spare our military heroes.",
      "Last year, these criminals stole $477 million from veterans, military personnel and their spouses, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). That\u2019s a $63 million jump from 2022, showing that the military community is a big target for scammers. The number of military members who lost money to these attacks went up by 7% to 30,948, per the FTC\u2019s latest data.",
      "These scammers use all kinds of tricks to get veterans to hand over personal info or hard-earned cash, including veterans' benefit scams and IRS scams. I break down five of the most common scams targeting our military heroes and how to stay safe from them.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYSEnter by\u00a0signing up for my free newsletter!",
      "Image of military personnel (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Romance scams",
      "Romance scams have become an increasingly painful reality for veterans, as scammers target them through fake online relationships to exploit their emotions and financial stability. Often, these scammers pose as attractive, understanding individuals on dating apps, social media platforms or even support forums specifically tailored for veterans. They\u2019ll build a relationship over weeks or months, using flattery and fabricated stories to create a strong emotional connection with their target.",
      "Once the scammer believes they\u2019ve gained enough trust, they\u2019ll ask for money, typically by inventing a sudden, urgent situation. It might be a \"medical emergency,\" a supposed travel expense to come to visit or even a claim that they need help with a legal matter. The requests start small but can quickly escalate as the scammer continues to manipulate the victim's emotions.",
      "This continues to be the most common fraud targeting veterans, costing them and their families over $40 million in 2020, according to Aura. Among all romance scam victims, those ages 50-69 were hit the hardest, losing $179.65 million in just the first three quarters of 2022. That figure has almost certainly surged in 2024.",
      "Image of military personnel supporting one another (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "NEARLY 1 MILLION MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES FACE DATA BREACH",
      "Veterans benefit scams",
      "Some scammers pretend to offer help with veterans' benefits. They promise to help increase benefits or expedite claims, but they\u2019re really after personal information or a fee. A scammer might claim you\u2019re eligible for new or additional benefits, contacting you by phone, email or text. When dealing with unsolicited advice, remember that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Phishing scams from fake government agencies",
      "Phishing scams are a social engineering trick where scammers send emails that look like they\u2019re from official places, like the government or your bank. These legit-looking emails act as bait, but the real goal is to grab your banking or credit card info.",
      "Sometimes, these scam emails will ask you to click a link or download an attachment, which can install malware on your device. Scammers are also known to send phishing links through LinkedIn, Facebook or other social media.",
      "One classic example is the IRS scam. Though it targets everyone, military members are prime targets. Scammers pretend to be IRS agents, threatening jail time, fines or other penalties if they don\u2019t get immediate payment. They even spoof IRS caller IDs to make their calls look real.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Rental property scams",
      "Rental property scams are a common way scammers try to exploit people looking for a place to rent. In these scams, fraudsters often post fake listings for apartments or houses on popular rental websites or social media platforms. The listing might look too good to be true, like a beautiful place at an unbelievably low price.",
      "The scammer will usually claim to be out of town or unavailable to meet in person, asking potential renters to send a deposit or rent payment upfront to \"secure\" the property. In some cases, they may even send fake lease agreements or claim that the property is already rented, but they can still \"help\" find a similar place.",
      "BEWARE OF THIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCAM BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU",
      "Car sales and financing scams",
      "Car sales and financing scams targeting veterans are unfortunately common. Scammers know that veterans may have limited experience with certain financial deals, so they exploit that by offering unrealistic car sales or financing options. These scams can take various forms, and the result is often financial loss and stress.",
      "Image of military personnel honoring our troops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways veterans can protect themselves from scams",
      "1) Be cautious with unsolicited offers: Whether it\u2019s a phone call, email or text, if someone claims to offer help with veterans' benefits or promises something too good to be true, don\u2019t take the bait. Verify the legitimacy of any offer directly through official channels like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or trusted veteran organizations.",
      "2) Watch out for emotional manipulation in online relationships: Romance scammers often prey on veterans' emotions. Avoid sharing personal or financial details with people you meet online, especially if the relationship feels rushed or too perfect. If someone asks for money after just a few weeks or months, it\u2019s likely a scam.",
      "3) Verify government communications: Scammers often impersonate government agencies like the IRS or VA. If you get a message that threatens penalties or asks for personal information, don\u2019t respond. Instead, contact the agency directly using official contact details to confirm whether the message is legitimate.",
      "4) Be skeptical of rental or car sale deals that seem too good to be true: If a rental listing or car sale seems too cheap or perfect to be true, it probably is. Always visit the property or dealership in person, and never send money upfront without seeing the product or having a signed agreement.",
      "5) Protect your personal information: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Scammers use phishing emails and fake websites to steal personal and financial information. Ensure your devices have updated security software and be extra cautious when handling sensitive data online.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6)\u00a0Invest in data removal services: Consider using data removal services to protect your personal information from being harvested by scammers. These services can help remove your data from public databases and people-search websites, reducing the risk of identity theft and unwanted solicitations.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers rely on misinformation to trick you. However, by staying informed and being extra careful when navigating the internet, you can stay safe. These bad actors are constantly finding new ways to target veterans, from romance scams to fake government offers. Being cautious, verifying offers and keeping your data secure are the best ways to avoid falling victim to these heartless fraudsters.",

      "What is a VPN?",
      "A VPN, or virtual private network, is a service that encrypts your internet connection, ensuring that your online activities remain private and secure. By routing your internet traffic through a secure server, VPNs mask your IP address, making it difficult for hackers and malicious entities to track your online behavior.",
      "A VPN being used on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "CAN YOU BYPASS VPN BLOCKS AND PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY?",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms \u2014 IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from its server network, effectively preventing websites and cybercriminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",

So, how can a VPN prevent identity theft? By encrypting your internet connection, VPNs protect against data breaches and unauthorized access to personal information, especially on unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi.

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses OpenAI ending its safety task force, actress Scarlett Johansson claiming the company copied her voice and the growing popularity of the voice notes phone feature.",
      "ChatGPT is an amazing tool, and its developer, OpenAI, keeps adding new features from time to time.",
      "Recently, the company introduced a new memory feature in ChatGPT, which essentially enables it to remember things about you. For example, it can recall your age, gender, philosophical beliefs and pretty much anything else.",
      "These memories are meant to remain private, but a researcher recently demonstrated how ChatGPT's artificial intelligence memory features can be manipulated, raising questions about privacy and security.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "ChatGPT introduction screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ChatGPT's Memory feature?",
      "ChatGPT\u2019s memory feature is designed to make the chatbot more personal to you. It remembers information that might be useful for future conversations and tailors responses based on that information, even if you open a different chat. For example, if you mention that you\u2019re vegetarian, the next time you ask for recipes, it will provide only vegetarian options.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "You can also train it to remember specific details about you, such as saying, \"Remember that I like to watch classic movies.\" In future interactions, it will tailor recommendations accordingly. You have control over ChatGPT\u2019s memory. You can reset it, clear specific memories or all memories, or turn this feature off entirely in your settings.",

      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "The security vulnerability in ChatGPT",
      "As reported by\u00a0Arstechnica, security researcher Johann Rehberger found that it\u2019s possible to trick the AI into remembering false information through a method called indirect prompt injection. This means the AI can be manipulated into accepting instructions from unreliable sources like emails or blog posts.",
      "For instance, Rehberger demonstrated that he could trick ChatGPT into believing a certain user was 102 years old, lived in a fictional place called the Matrix and thought the Earth was flat. After the AI accepts this made-up information, it will carry it over to all future chats with that user. These false memories could be implanted by using tools like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive to store files, upload images or even browse a site like Bing \u2014 all of which could be manipulated by a hacker.",
      "Rehberger submitted a follow-up report that included a proof of concept, demonstrating how he could exploit the flaw in the ChatGPT app for macOS. He showed that by tricking the AI into opening a web link containing a malicious image, he could make it send everything a user typed and all the AI's responses to a server he controlled. This meant that if an attacker could manipulate the AI in this way, they could monitor all conversations between the user and ChatGPT.",
      "Rehberger's proof-of-concept exploit demonstrated that the vulnerability could be used to exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. The attack isn't possible through the ChatGPT web interface, thanks to an API OpenAI rolled out last year. However, it was still possible through the ChatGPT app for macOS.",
      "When Rehberger privately reported the finding to OpenAI in May, the company took it seriously and mitigated this issue by ensuring that the model doesn\u2019t follow any links generated within its own responses, like those involving memory and similar features.",

      "Johann\u00a0Rehberger\u2019s ChatGPT conversation. (Johann Rehberger)",
      "CYBER SCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "OpenAI\u2019s response",
      "After Rehberger shared his proof of concept, OpenAI engineers took action and released a patch to address this vulnerability. They released a new version of the ChatGPT macOS application (version 1.2024.247) that encrypts conversations and fixes the security flaw.",
      "So, while OpenAI has taken steps to address the immediate security flaw, there are still potential vulnerabilities related to memory manipulation and the need for ongoing vigilance in using AI tools with memory features. The incident underscores the evolving nature of security challenges in AI systems.",
      "The company says, \"It\u2019s important to note that prompt injection in large language models is an area of ongoing research. As new techniques emerge, we address them at the model layer via instruction hierarchy or application-layer defenses like the ones mentioned.\"",
      "How do I disable ChatGPT memory?",
      "If you're not cool with ChatGPT keeping stuff about you or the chance that it could let a bad actor access your data, you can just turn off this feature in the settings.",
      "Open the\u00a0ChatGPT app or website\u00a0on your computer or smartphone.Click on the\u00a0profile icon in the top right corner of the screen.Go to Settings and then select Personalization.Switch the Memory option off, and you\u2019re all set.",

      "1. Regularly review privacy settings:\u00a0Stay informed about what data is being collected. Periodically check and adjust privacy settings on AI platforms like ChatGPT and others to ensure you\u2019re only sharing information you\u2019re comfortable with.",
      "2. Be cautious about sharing sensitive information:\u00a0Less is more when it comes to personal data. Avoid disclosing sensitive details such as your full name, address, or financial information in conversations with AI.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoid reusing them across different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your ChatGPT and other AI accounts.\u00a0By requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code, you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "5. Keep software and applications up to date:\u00a0Stay ahead of vulnerabilities.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered threats, so enable automatic updates whenever possible.",
      "6. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0 In an age where AI is everywhere, protecting your data from cyber threats is more important than ever. Adding strong antivirus software to your devices adds a critical layer of protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "As AI tools like ChatGPT get smarter and more personal, it's pretty interesting to think about how they can tailor conversations to us. But, as Johann Rehberger\u2019s findings remind us, there are some real risks involved, especially when it comes to privacy and security. While OpenAI is able to mitigate these issues as they arise, it also shows that we need to keep a close eye on how these features work. It's all about finding that sweet spot between innovation and keeping our data safe.",

    "story": [
      "SentinelOne's chief security adviser discusses the alarming rise in cyberattacks worldwide on 'Fox News Live.'",
      "Data theft and ransomware attacks against health care and critical third-party providers are still happening at an alarmingly high rate in 2024, which is shaping up to be as severe as last year, the worst on record for health care breaches.",
      "You might remember the\u00a0Ascension ransomware attack from May, one of the most devastating incidents in the health care sector, causing major issues for patients.",

      "Woman working on a computer in a hospital (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Impact of ransomware on health care",
      "Microsoft points out that beyond the financial risk to health care organizations, ransomware attacks can have life-threatening consequences. When health care providers lose access to diagnostic equipment or patient records due to ransomware, patient care is severely disrupted. For example, stroke code activations are nearly double during hospital attacks, with confirmed strokes increasing by 113.6%, and cardiac arrest cases rise by 81% and survival rates drop from 40% to just 4.5%.",
      "Health care facilities near hospitals hit by ransomware attacks also feel the impact, facing a surge in patients needing urgent care that they may not be equipped to handle. As a result, patients often face longer wait times.",
      "What\u2019s more troubling is that these attacks aren\u2019t limited to urban areas. Rural health clinics are also prime targets for cyberattacks. These facilities are particularly vulnerable to ransomware because they often lack the resources to prevent or respond to security incidents. And since these clinics are the only health care option within miles, a successful attack can be devastating for many rural communities.",
      "Mother, daughter and doctor walking in a hospital (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HEALTH CARE RANSOMWARE ATTACK EXPOSES PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION OF OVER 100 MILLION",
      "Why health care is the prime target?",
      "Ransomware attacks on health care have shot up 300% since 2015, making it one of the top 10 most targeted industries in the second quarter of 2024. This rise is mostly because health care organizations store extremely sensitive data, and hackers know there\u2019s big money to be made. With lives on the line, hospitals can\u2019t risk poor patient outcomes if their systems go down or the exposure of patient data if they don\u2019t pay. This reputation for paying ransoms just makes health care an even bigger target.",
      "Some of the blame also falls on health care organizations. They tend to have lower cybersecurity budgets compared to other industries, making it harder to defend against these kinds of attacks. Many facilities don\u2019t have staff dedicated to cybersecurity; some don\u2019t even have a chief information security officer or a security operations center. Instead, cybersecurity often gets lumped in with regular IT duties. Plus, doctors, nurses and other health care staff might not get any cybersecurity training, so they might not even recognize a\u00a0phishing email when they see one.",

      "1. Stay informed: Keep up to date with the latest news from your health care providers and reliable sources to stay aware of any disruptions or data breaches affecting systems and services.",
      "2. Maintain personal health records: Keep copies of your health records on your own devices or printed out, including details like medications, allergies, past surgeries and other relevant health information. This can be crucial if electronic health records become temporarily unavailable.",
      "3. Prepare for medical emergencies: Have a backup plan for emergencies, including knowing nearby alternative health care facilities. Research wait times and accessibility to help avoid delays if your primary facility is impacted.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Practice cybersecurity best practices: Use strong, unique passwords for online accounts and consider a\u00a0password manager to help manage them. Enable two-factor authentication where available to add an extra layer of security.",
      "5. Be vigilant against phishing: Cyberattacks often result in a spike in phishing emails and calls as attackers exploit the situation. Protect yourself by using strong antivirus software on all your devices, which can help block malicious links and detect phishing emails. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Confirm appointments: If you have upcoming appointments or procedures, contact your health care provider to confirm or reschedule if a cyberattack disrupts their normal operations.",
      "7. Monitor patient portals: Keep an eye on patient portals like MyChart for updates on your medical records and communication with health care providers, as these can provide critical information during service disruptions.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The surge in ransomware attacks on the health care industry is troubling and a harsh reminder that criminals don\u2019t care about the lives at risk. They\u2019re just after money. Health care organizations need to take lessons from the past two years, investing heavily in cybersecurity infrastructure and hiring dedicated staff to protect patient data and systems. With stronger defenses in place, the goal is to prevent these situations from reaching the point where paying a ransom is even considered.",

This means that Apple doesn\u2019t share all of its code information, which makes it harder for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities to take over a user\u2019s apps or iPhone.

      "Even though it is more difficult to penetrate the iPhone, it doesn\u2019t mean it is impossible. In fact, some hackers watch for particular vulnerabilities in iOS to launch their attacks. If you see such warnings, it\u2019s best to ignore them and avoid clicking on any links or downloading any suggested software. Below are several key steps you can take to secure your iPhone.",
      "1) Keep your iPhone up to date: Occasionally, Apple releases new iOS updates to address known vulnerabilities. When possible, it is best to\u00a0update the iOS so that your iPhone is safe from known vulnerabilities.",
      "2) Install and run strong antivirus software: An antivirus software actively running on all of your devices can help keep them all safe, including your iPhone. With iPhones, strong antivirus software will prevent you from clicking on any malicious links that may then install malware onto your devices, which can potentially extract personal information from your device. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These can be phishing attempts designed to steal your personal information.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Download apps only from the App Store: Stick to downloading apps from the official Apple App Store. Apps on the App Store are vetted by Apple for security, reducing the risk of downloading malicious software.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Adding an extra layer of security to your Apple ID can help protect your personal information. With\u00a02FA, even if someone gets your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without the second factor.",
      "5) Use strong passwords: Ensure that your passwords are strong and unique for different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them.",
      "6) Monitor app permissions: Regularly check the\u00a0permissions granted to your apps and revoke any that seem unnecessary. This can help prevent apps from accessing more information than they need.",

      "While most iPhone users rest easy knowing that the iOS keeps most common viruses and malware at bay, they are still susceptible to scammers trying to work around the closed code and scaring people into making bad choices that endanger their phones and data. Because Apple never sends out alerts about viruses or malware on your iPhone, it should be the first clue of a scam. Even if it looks official, iPhone users do not get alerts from Apple about viruses or malware. If you do install a good antivirus program, that will be the only program notifying you that there is anything amiss with your iPhone. Understanding these scams can go a long way in keeping you calm and your phone safe.",

I think many are unclear about this.\"",

      "Person checking emails on laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Common misconceptions",
      "Opening emails can instantly infect your device: One common myth is that simply opening an email can automatically infect your device with malware. In reality, modern email systems (such as Gmail, Outlook, etc.) generally prevent this from happening. The real danger comes from interacting with the content inside the email, such as clicking on malicious links or downloading harmful attachments.",
      "Plain text emails are always safe: While emails in plain text format are generally safer than HTML-based emails, they can still pose a risk if they contain malicious links. Phishing attacks can appear in plain text emails, luring you to dangerous websites.",
      "Emails from known contacts are always safe: Even if an email appears to come from someone you know, that doesn\u2019t always mean it's safe. Attackers can spoof email addresses or hack accounts, so always be cautious about unexpected or unusual messages from known contacts, especially those containing links or attachments.",
      "Spam filters catch all malicious emails: Spam filters are highly effective but not perfect. Some sophisticated phishing and malicious emails can bypass these filters and land in your inbox. This is why it\u2019s important to stay vigilant, even with emails that seem to have passed your email service\u2019s security checks.",
      "Previewing emails is always safe: Most modern email clients use a \"preview\" pane for quick reading. While the risk of malware through previews is significantly reduced in up-to-date systems, embedded trackers or other forms of data collection can still occur, confirming your activity to the spammer. Always disable automatic image loading or other active content features in your email client\u2019s settings to minimize exposure.",

      "CONTROL SPAM - HOW TO CREATE A QUICK ALIAS EMAIL ADDRESS",
      "What to watch out for",
      "As mentioned already, generally, simply opening an email is not enough to cause harm. However, there are some important points to consider:",
      "1) Embedded trackers: Some spam or\u00a0phishing emails contain trackers that can notify the sender when the email is opened. This can confirm to the spammer that your email address is active, potentially leading to more spam.",
      "2) Malicious links and attachments: The real danger lies in clicking on links or downloading attachments within the email. These can lead to malicious websites or download malware onto your device.",
      "3) HTML emails: Emails that contain HTML content can sometimes execute scripts when opened. While modern email clients have protections against this, it\u2019s still a potential risk.",
      "4) Phishing attempts: Even if you don\u2019t click on anything,\u00a0phishing emails can be designed to look very convincing and may trick you into providing personal information if you respond.",

      "2) Use a reputable email client: Choose an email provider that prioritizes security features like spam filtering and\u00a0two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of protection for your account.\u00a0Read more about secure and private email here.",
      "3) Enable email filtering: Turn on spam filters to reduce the number of unsolicited or potentially dangerous emails reaching your inbox. This reduces your exposure to phishing attempts. Most email platforms these days automatically filter out what they assume to be \"junk\" into their own folder. If you notice the amount of spam getting through to your inbox increasing, you may want to consider a\u00a0Spam Filter.\u00a0There are free options for different email providers. For Gmail, try\u00a0Mailwasher. For Outlook and Windows Mail, try\u00a0Spam Bully, which costs an annual fee of $29.95.",
      "4) Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your email client and operating system to stay protected from the latest security vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit.",
      "5) Consider data removal services: Use data removal services to ensure your personal information is less accessible to potential scammers. This reduces your risk of being targeted in the first place.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The case had been more than seven years in the making since Abigail \"Abby\" Williams, 13, and Liberty \"Libby\" German, 14, disappeared during their walk on Feb. 13, 2017, and investigators found them both brutally murdered the next day with sticks covering their bodies in a wooded area near the High Monon Trail.",

      "Allen's defense leaned largely on expert analysis showing Allen's unhealthy mental state after his 2022 arrest, which took the Delphi community as a surprise at the time.

      "China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press.",
      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \"blue-water\" force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States.",
      "\"Nuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\" said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \"For China\u2019s leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country\u2019s global image as a leading power.\"",
      "XI JINPING WARNS TRUMP US WOULD 'LOSE FROM CONFRONTATION' WITH CHINA AS RENEWED TRADE WAR LOOMS",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",

      "Neither China\u2019s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "Satellite images and public documents helped identify likely carrier project",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\"The reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\"",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen\u2019s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",

      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \"intended for installation on a large surface warship\" under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \"national defense designation\" helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \"national defense-related construction project\" that is classified \"secret.\"",
      "\"Unless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\" researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \"convincing argument.\"",
      "\"From the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\" she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \"carefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\"",
      "\"Given the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\" said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "Pursuit of a nuclear-powered carrier",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \"ski-jump\" type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \"soon be announced,\" but so far it has not been.",

(Pu Haiyang/Xinhua via AP)",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \"incremental improvements.\"",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \"have taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\"",
      "\"For now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\"",
      "CHINA OFFICIALLY 'DOESN'T CARE' ABOUT TRUMP WIN; UNOFFICIALLY, EXPERTS SAY BEIJING IS RATTLED",
      "Eventually, however, \"larger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\" Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\"As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\" Childs said.",
      "\"Much will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\"",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \"with greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\" said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\"These carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\" Zhao said.",
      "U.S.-China rivalry",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \"first-class\" navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \"speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\"",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, China's third conventionally powered aircraft carrier, the Fujian, conducts a maiden sea trial on May 7, 2024. (Ding Ziyu/Xinhua via AP, File)",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",

      "Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who served in the Obama administration, told\u00a0Fox News\u00a0Digital, \"It\u2019s an open question as to how a Trump 2.0 will operate in the Middle East. Unlike Trump 1.0, he has a much more isolationist VP in JD Vance, and he also at the same time told Netanyahu to finish up the war in Gaza. And while he has expressed an interest in a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, he has a history of taking aggressive actions against it, and his communications were targeted by the regime during his campaign, which may fuel distrust and suspicion.\"",
      "\"But the fundamentals of his wanting to focus on domestic issues are what will likely drive his policy in the early days, while he works to avoid international entanglements,\" Rubin added. \"My bet is that if the Middle East flares into creating headaches for him, particularly through increasing wars, he will work to stamp them out while not having a very ambitious agenda towards resolving longstanding challenges between Israel and the Palestinians.\"",

      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A looming battle among Senate Republicans over whom to pick as their next majority leader is turning into an early test of how much power President-elect Donald Trump's MAGA movement will exert in his second term.",
      "The three-way fight to replace outgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, pits Minority Whip John Thune of South Dakota against John Cornyn of Texas, a former McConnell deputy, and underdog candidate Rick Scott of Florida.",
      "The battle will gauge the staying power of long-serving senior Republicans grounded in an institutionalist view of the Senate, like Thune and Cornyn, against an emboldened pro-Trump wing looking to smash any vestiges of the old GOP as he returns to power.",
      "Scott, who's seeking to claim the latter mantle, said in an interview Monday that he'll push \u201cthe Trump agenda\u201d if he's elected.",
      "\u201cI talk to all my colleagues, and they are clear what they want and know we need to change. They want to be treated as equals, want to be part of a team. They know I have a great relationship with Trump and the speaker of the House, and I am a business guy. And I will get the Trump agenda done,\u201d Scott said.",
      "MAGA influencers online have started an online pressure campaign to sink the current and former McConnell deputies \u2014 and boost Scott \u2014 ahead of a candidate forum Tuesday and an expected closed-door election Wednesday.",
      "Right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson said Scott is the \u201conly candidate who agrees with Donald Trump\u201d and claimed the two other contenders \u201chate Trump and what he ran on.\u201d (Thune and Cornyn have been critical of Trump in the past, but both endorsed him this year.)",
      "Billionaire Trump benefactor Elon Musk also endorsed Scott, saying Monday, \u201cThe new Senate Majority Leader must respond to the will of the people.\u201d",
      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., one of Trump's top allies on the Hill, encouraged senators to elect Scott. \u201cThe Republican conference should choose a leader who represents the\u00a0People, not the same good ole\u2019 boy way it\u2019s been done for decades,\u201d Greene said on X.",
      "But it\u2019s far from clear that the campaign will succeed. The Senate is a famously insular body that is relatively detached from populist fervor, giving members six-year terms and usually operating on seniority. It would be unusual for Scott to leapfrog two colleagues who have served much longer, cultivated deeper relationships and have each paid their dues in pursuit of the job.",
      "Most importantly, the election will be held by secret ballot. Unlike votes on legislation and nominations \u2014 as well as the vote for speaker of the House \u2014 votes for Senate leadership are anonymous. That means relationships will be paramount and the online pro-Trump army won\u2019t know how members voted.",

      "Most notably, Trump himself hasn\u2019t weighed in as all three candidates seek to show their pro-Trump bona fides.",
      "Scott called Trump in May to ask him for his support in the leadership race, which he said he would appreciate, and his goal is to pressure Trump to announce his support before Wednesday\u2019s election, according to two people with knowledge of his thinking.",
      "In interviews since Election Day, Scott said he and Trump have been communicating by text.",
      "But Scott was coy when he was asked Monday whether he thinks he has Trump\u2019s support.",
      "\u201cI welcome anyone\u2019s support. He supported me in 2022 in my run against Mitch McConnell,\u201d Scott said.",

      "Scott is less popular among his colleagues than Thune and Cornyn; in 2022 he got just 10 votes when he unsuccessfully challenged McConnell for the top job. Thune and Cornyn have well-established relationships as leaders in the conference.",
      "Cornyn's office touted a total of $415 million raised for GOP senators and candidates over his 22 years in the Senate, aided by two terms as the National Republican Senatorial Committee chair.",
      "This cycle, Cornyn's office said, he raised about $33 million for GOP candidates. A source close to Thune touted a similar dollar figure for the 2024 election.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Thune\u2019s race to lose,\u201d said Mike Davis, a pugnacious Trump ally who previously was a top aide to Senate Republicans.",
      "But Davis said the price of admission for the job will be to advance Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cThe Senate Republicans \u2014 particularly Senate Republican leadership \u2014 must understand that the American people put President Trump back in the White House with his America First agenda. And any Republican leader candidate who does not agree with that should get the hell out of the way,\" he said.",
      "Scott, who just won a second six-year term, said in an interview that his victory in Florida shows that Republicans don\u2019t need to moderate their views.",
      "\u201cWe never moderated our positions, and we continued to win,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cNow if you look at the country, we are the center of the Republican Party. \u2026 The whole country is headed in our direction.\u201d",
      "Even before last week's elections, Scott had sought to become a bridge between House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and his Senate GOP conference and push McConnell out of relevancy. And with Republicans on track to hold on to a narrow House majority, Scott sees his bond with Johnson as an edge in the leadership race.",
      "A handful of sitting Republican senators have publicly backed him: Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. The names of some of them, like Rubio, Hagerty and Tuberville, have been floated for senior positions in the Trump administration.",
      "Trump is expected to meet with Speaker Johnson and the new Senate majority leader on Wednesday, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The Senate is expected to hold its majority leader vote Wednesday at 9:30 a.m., the same day Trump is scheduled to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House.",
      "Of the three senators in the running to succeed McConnell, Scott was the only one who did an interview on the Sunday shows this weekend, when he promoted his \u201cclose relationship\u201d with the speaker on Fox News.",
      "The interview and the MAGA online campaign were intentional moves to project a flood of support for Scott and put pressure on Thune, who is considered the front-runner.",
      "Trump has made one public demand: The next GOP leader should support his ability to make \u201crecess appointments\u201d to temporarily install personnel without Senate confirmation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spent eight months carefully listening to my colleagues about their vision for the next chapter of the Senate Republican Conference, especially as we hit the ground running with President Trump,\u201d Thune said in a statement. \u201cOne thing is clear: We must act quickly and decisively to get the president\u2019s cabinet and other nominees in place as soon as possible to start delivering on the mandate we\u2019ve been sent to execute, and all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments. We cannot let Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats block the will of the American people.\u201d",
      "Cornyn vowed that if Democrats block Trump\u2019s nominees, \u201cwe will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent. Additionally, the Constitution expressly confers the power on the President to make recess appointments.\u201d",
      "Scott, meanwhile, responded to Trump on X: \u201c100% agree.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A coalition of parents attempting to block a state law that would require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in public school classrooms by next year have won a legal battle in federal court.",
      "U.S. District Judge John deGravelles issued an order Tuesday granting the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction, which means the state can't begin its plan to promote and create rules surrounding the law as soon as Friday while the litigation plays out.",
      "The judge wrote that the law is \"facially unconstitutional\" and \"in all applications,\" barring Louisiana from enforcing it and adopting rules around it that require all public K-12 schools and colleges to exhibit posters of the Ten Commandments.",
      "DeGravelles, who heard arguments over the legislation on Oct. 21, also ordered the state attorney general's office to \"provide notice to all schools that the Act has been found unconstitutional.\"",
      "The law had dictated that schools have by Jan. 1 to comply. Attorney General Liz Murrill did not immediately respond to the judge's ruling but is expected to appeal.",
      "Gov. Jeff Landry signed the GOP-backed legislation in June, part of his conservative agenda that has reshaped Louisiana's cultural landscape, from\u00a0abortion\u00a0rights\u00a0to criminal justice to education.",
      "The move prompted a coalition of parents \u2014 Jewish, Christian, Unitarian Universalist and nonreligious \u2014\u00a0to sue the state\u00a0in federal court. They argued that the law \"substantially interferes with and burdens\" their First Amendment right to raise their children with whatever religious doctrine they want.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation have supported the suit.",
      "In their complaint, the parents said the law \"sends the harmful and religiously divisive message that students who do not subscribe to the Ten Commandments ... do not belong in their own school community and should refrain from expressing any faith practices or beliefs that are not aligned with the state's religious preferences.\"",
      "Steven Green, a professor of law, history and religious studies at Willamette University in Oregon, testified against the law during the federal court hearing, arguing that the Ten Commandments are not at the core of the U.S. government and its founding, and if anything, the Founding Fathers believed in a separation of church and state.",
      "At a news conference after the hearing, Murrill dismissed Green's testimony as not being relevant as to whether the posters themselves violate the First Amendment.",
      "\"This law, I believe, is constitutional, and we've illustrated it in numerous ways that the law is constitutional. We've shown that in our briefs by creating a number of posters,\" Murrill told reporters. \"Again, you don't have to like the posters. The point is you can make posters that comply with the Constitution.\"",
      "In August, Murrill and Landry presented examples of how posters of the Ten Commandments could be designed and hung up in classrooms for educational purposes. The displays included historical context for the commandments that the state believes makes its law constitutional.",
      "One poster compared Moses and Martin Luther King Jr., while another riffed off the song \"Ten Duel Commandments\" from the musical \"Hamilton.\"",
      "Murrill said no public funds will be required to be spent on printing the posters and they can be supplied through private donations, but questions remain about what happens to educators that refuse to comply with the law.",
      "The state has anticipated that the case could go to the U.S. Supreme Court, which last weighed in on the issue in 1980, when the justices ruled 5-4 that Kentucky's posting of the Ten Commandments in public schools was unconstitutional.",
      "Another state, Oklahoma, is facing similar lawsuits over a requirement that the Bible be part of lesson plans in public school grades five through 12, and that the Bible be stocked in every classroom.",
      "When asked what he would tell parents concerned about having the Ten Commandments in public schools, Landry said in August: \"Tell your child not to look at them.\""

      "The Summary",
      "A new report describes the dire state of Earth\u2019s snow and ice.Among other findings, it warns that several key climate tipping points appear more likely to be reached than previously thought.They include ice melt that could cause severe sea-level rise and the collapse of a crucial ocean current that governs how heat cycles in the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "A new report describes the dire state of Earth\u2019s snow and ice.",
      "Among other findings, it warns that several key climate tipping points appear more likely to be reached than previously thought.",
      "They include ice melt that could cause severe sea-level rise and the collapse of a crucial ocean current that governs how heat cycles in the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Venezuela lost its final glacier this year. The Greenland Ice Sheet is losing, on average, 30 million tons of ice per hour. Ice loss from the Thwaites Glacier, also known as the \u201cDoomsday\u201d glacier because its collapse could precipitate rapid Antarctic ice loss,\u00a0may be unstoppable.",
      "These are just a few of the stark findings from more than 50 leading snow and ice scientists, which are detailed in a new report from the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative.",
      "The report summarizes the state of snow and ice in 2024: In short, experts agree, it\u2019s been a horrible year for the frozen parts of Earth, an expected result of global warming. What\u2019s more, top cryosphere scientists are growing increasingly worried that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a key ocean current that governs how heat cycles in the Atlantic Ocean, is on a path toward collapse.",
      "A rapid halt to the current would cause rapid cooling in the North Atlantic, warming in the Southern Hemisphere and extreme changes in precipitation. If that happens, the new report suggests, northern Europe could cool by about 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit in a decade.",
      "The report highlights a shift in consensus: Scientists once thought tipping points \u2014 like the collapse of AMOC \u2014 were distant or remote possibilities. Now, some of those thresholds are appearing more likely to be crossed, and with less runway to turn the situation around.",
      "\u201cThe latest science is not telling us that things are any different to what we knew before, necessarily, but it\u2019s telling us with more confidence and more certainty that these things are more likely to happen,\u201d said Helen Findlay, an author of the report and a professor and biological oceanographer at Plymouth Marine Laboratory in England. \u201cThe longer we record these things, and the longer we\u2019re able to observe them and start to understand and monitor them, there\u2019s more certainty in the system and we start to really understand how these tipping points are working.\u201d",
      "Last month, 44 leading scientists wrote in an open letter to leaders of Nordic countries that the collapse of AMOC remained \u201chighly uncertain\u201d but that evidence in favor of such a collapse was mounting, and risks have been underestimated. Dramatic changes to the AMOC, they warned, would \u201clikely lead to unprecedented extreme weather\u201d and \u201cpotentially threaten the viability of agriculture in northwestern Europe.\u201d",
      "The new report similarly draws attention to the risk of AMOC collapse.",
      "Additionally, it projects that roughly two-thirds of glacier ice in the European Alps will be lost by 2050 if global greenhouse gas emissions keep their pace. Already, an estimated 10 million people are at risk of glacial outburst floods in Iceland, Alaska and Asia \u2014 a phenomenon already occurring as meltwater collapses ice dams and rapidly floods downstream. If high emissions continue, the report adds, models suggest that sea level could rise by roughly 10 feet in the 2100s, imperiling parts of many coastal cities.",
      "The report was released as world leaders gathered Monday in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, for the United Nations\u2019 COP29 climate conference.",
      "\u201cTiming is everything,\u201d said Julie Brigham-Grette, a geosciences professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and an author of the new report.",
      "She said the group hopes to rattle world leaders to attention: \u201cThe sense of urgency couldn\u2019t be higher. We\u2019ve been talking about urgency for a decade. It almost starts to feel like a useless word. What\u2019s more than \u2018urgent?\u2019 \u2018Catastrophic?\u2019 We\u2019ve run out of ways to describe it.\u201d",
      "To date, the report says, world governments are falling short on the pledges they made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of the Paris Agreement.",
      "Even if they were on track, those commitments\u00a0are insufficient to reach global climate goals, the authors say. On paper, the world\u2019s pledges would limit the rise in global temperatures to about 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 degrees Fahrenheit) this century. That\u2019s well short of the goal to cap warming at 1.5 degrees C.",
      "Global temperatures are currently on pace to rise more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit), on average.",
      "\u201cI feel quite frustrated,\u201d Findlay said. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand how they\u2019re missing the severity of the issue.\u201d",
      "In Baku on Monday, world leaders did agree to new rules for a global market to trade carbon credits. In a news release, COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev, who has been Azerbaijan\u2019s minister of ecology and natural resources since 2018, said the agreement was a \u201cgame-changing\u201d tool to direct climate financing to the developing world.",
      "But he also acknowledged, in a speech to delegates, that the world is \u201con a road to ruin\u201d under current climate policies.",
      "That warning and the new report both come amid fears the U.S. will backslide on its climate commitments and pull out of the Paris Agreement after Donald Trump takes office in January. Trump wants to remove the U.S. from the international treaty, and he began that process during his first presidential administration. President Joe Biden reversed the move in 2021.",
      "Peter Neff, a glaciologist and climate scientist at the University of Minnesota who was not involved in the new report, said its authors clearly communicated the scientific consensus.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing surprising for a glaciologist. Across the board, there\u2019s not good news with respect to ice on Earth. It\u2019s all, for the most part, going in one direction,\u201d Neff said.",
      "But he added that he still found the report\u2019s findings to be staggering: \u201cThese documents can hit you like a ton of bricks, and that\u2019s intentional.\u201d"

      "An American World War II warship that played a key role in Allied campaigns in the Pacific has been discovered at the bottom of the Indian Ocean more than 80 years after it was sunk.",
      "The U.S.S. Edsall was found 200 miles east of Christmas Island, south of Java, by the Royal Australian Navy. The discovery has revealed the final resting place of more than 200 servicemen who died when it was sank by Japanese forces on 1 March, 1942, three months after the attack on Pearl Harbor.",
      "\"Captain Joshua Nix and his crew fought valiantly, evading 1,400 shells from Japanese battleships and cruisers, before being attacked by 26 carrier-dive bombers, taking only one fatal hit,\" Caroline Kennedy, the U.S. ambassador to Australia, said in a joint video statement recorded with Vice Admiral Mark Hammond, head of the Royal Australian Navy.",
      "\"This is part of our continuing efforts to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice. We will now be able to preserve this important memorial and hope that the families of the heroes who died there will know their loved ones rest in peace,\" Kennedy said.",
      "The discovery was made in 2023, but the announcement was held back until Monday, which was Veterans' Day in the U.S. and Remembrance Day in Australia and Britain.",
      "Hammond said the 314-foot destroyer held a special place in naval history. \"The U.S.S. Edsall served valiantly during WWII, most notably in the early Pacific campaign. She operated alongside Australian warships protecting our shores, and played a role in the sinking of the Japanese submarine I124 off Darwin,\" he said.",
      "The Australian navy made the surprise discovery while conducting an unrelated and unspecified mission in the area. Its staff used \"advanced robotic and autonomous systems normally used for hydrographic survey capabilities to locate the U.S.S. Edsall on the seabed,\" Hammond said.",
      "\"The wreck of this ship is a hallowed site, serving as a marker for the 185 U.S. Navy personnel and 31 U.S. Army Air Force pilots aboard at the time, almost all of whom were lost when Edsall succumbed to her battle damage,\" Lisa Franchetti, the U.S. Navy chief of naval operations, said in a statement.",
      "The Edsall managed to evade shells from Japanese warships on the day of its sinking by undertaking some extreme maneuvers and using smokescreens \u2014 this led at least one Japanese combatant to describe the Edsall as a \"Dancing Mouse,\" according to the U.S. Navy's official history of the ship, referring to a popular pet at the time.",
      "A famous photograph was taken on board a Japanese ship of the Edsall being blown out of the water, later to be used in Japanese propaganda.",
      "The ship's captain, Lt. Joshua Nix, was 33 when the ship went down. His grandson, Jim Nix, from Dallas, told the Washington Post: \"When we asked about him as children, all we would get was, \u2018He died in the war. Nobody really knew. \u2026 It\u2019s bad that I didn\u2019t get to know him. But that\u2019s life.\""

That combination has delivered justice for Mandy and safety from a violent and dangerous criminal,\u201d Assistant District Attorneys Ryan Calvert and Alyssa Killin said in a statement.",

      "After having surged to record levels practically every year this century, overall diagnoses of the three top bacterial STIs have crested since the Covid pandemic. From 2022 to 2023, total diagnoses decreased by 2%, to 2.46 million new cases, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI surveillance report published Tuesday.",
      "And importantly, diagnoses of primary and secondary syphilis \u2014 the most infectious stages of the infection \u2014 dropped 10% last year, to 53,000 cases.",
      "The decline was driven by a 13% drop in such syphilis diagnoses among gay and bisexual men, who are about 2% of the adult population but have historically accounted for nearly half of such cases.",
      "STIs also spread disproportionately among young people and racial minorities. Just under half of the top three bacterial STIs were diagnosed among 15 to 24 year olds last year. Nearly one-third of cases were among Blacks, who are 13% of the population.",
      "Overall, gonorrhea declined by 7%, to 601,300 cases, last year; that followed a 9% decline the previous year. Among all stages of syphilis, cases increased 1%, to 209,250 diagnoses. Chlamydia remained stable from 2021 to 2023, at about 1.65 million cases.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re at an inflection point, and it\u2019s important that we push forward and take advantage of innovations and investment of STI prevention going forward,\u201d said Dr. Laura Bachmann, chief medical officer of the CDC\u2019s STI prevention division.",
      "The half-dozen other infectious disease experts who spoke with NBC News about the CDC report said they believed the sudden turnaround in syphilis diagnoses among gay and bisexual men was likely to be an early signal of such men\u2019s eager adoption of a new, proven protocol in which the oral antibiotic doxycycline is used for STI prevention.",
      "\u201cThat is huge cause for celebration. And I am a little surprised we see that trend at the national level already,\u201d said Dr. Julie Dombrowski, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington.",

      "Some experts expressed hope that doxycycline use among gay and bisexual men would have a positive spillover effect in women of childbearing age.",
      "Syphilis poses the greatest threat to newborns, among whom it can cause severe congenital defects and death. Whereas cases of the STI in newborns increased by 30% annually in recent years \u2014 greatly alarming public health experts \u2014 the upward trend has decelerated. Such a promising shift was apparently driven in part by nationwide efforts to increase testing among pregnant women.",
      "In another hopeful development, a shortage that began in early 2023 of the only recommended treatment for syphilis among pregnant women, Pfizer\u2019s Bicillin-LA, has abated.",
      "In recent years, a trio of randomized controlled trials have shown that instructing gay and bisexual men and transgender women to take one 200-milligram tablet of doxycycline within 72 hours of condomless sex lowers cases of chlamydia and syphilis among them by more than 70% and of gonorrhea by about 50%.",
      "The protocol is known as doxyPEP, which is short for doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis.",
      "San Francisco\u2019s Public Health Department was the first to recommend doxyPEP for gay and bisexual men and trans women, in October 2022. The CDC followed suit in June. So have health departments in other large cities, such as Chicago and New York, where LGBTQ community health centers have begun offering doxycycline to patients.",
      "A study of doxyPEP among cisgender women in Africa failed to show efficacy. There is, however, an ongoing trial in U.S. women.",
      "Thanks to penicillin, the nation made steady progress in fighting syphilis after World War II. By the mid-1990s, public health leaders were entertaining the possibility that the STI could be eliminated.",
      "But the approval of effective HIV treatment in 1996 reduced the public\u2019s fear of AIDS. That helped trigger a long decline in condom use among gay and bisexual men in particular. The subsequent approval of the HIV-prevention pill \u2014 called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP \u2014 in 2012 only hastened the decline.",
      "Bacterial STIs soared accordingly.",
      "DoxyPEP offers a promising form of harm reduction. It\u2019s cheap and well-tolerated, and it can easily be folded into many gay and bisexual men\u2019s routines for receiving prescriptions to treat or prevent HIV.",
      "Early analyses suggest doxyPEP is a sleeper hit in that population.",
      "A study published this month in the journal Sexually Transmitted Diseases found that San Francisco\u2019s guidance on the preventive tool was tied to a decline in STIs among local men. A study published in next month\u2019s edition of the journal found that among about 900 gay and bisexual men recruited for a survey through hook-up apps, half had heard of doxyPEP and nearly all expressed interest.",
      "A spokesperson for the PrEP-focused telehealth service MISTR told NBC News that since the company started offering doxyPEP in April, three-quarters of users who have filled PrEP prescriptions since then have also requested and received doxycycline. (The representative declined to provide the number of users this entailed but said that that MISTR serves \u201cover 450,000 patients in all 50 states, D.C. and Puerto Rico.\u201d) Since then, the overall quarterly STI positivity rate among MISTR users has plummeted from 12% to 6%.",
      "In November 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first at-home tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia, which public health experts hope might also help combat the spread of STIs.",
      "And in July, researchers presented findings at a global HIV conference in Munich of studies in which gay and bisexual men in Canada and female sex workers in Japan were instructed to take 100 milligrams of doxycycline daily. The protocol, called doxyPrEP, demonstrated generally comparable efficacy at preventing STIs compared with doxyPEP studies among gay men.",
      "Research is ongoing to address concerns that increased use of doxycycline to prevent STIs might help fuel the burgeoning drug-resistant pathogen crisis. Thus far, researchers have found reassuring signs.",
      "STI-prevention experts are also concerned that, as with HIV PrEP, doxyPEP will prove disproportionately popular among whites and thus will only widen racial disparities in STI transmission. Research is underway to analyze trends in doxyPEP\u2019s use that could help focus promotion of the intervention where the need is greatest.",
      "Public health experts have attributed this century\u2019s surge in STIs, at least in part, to a steady defunding of state and local public-health clinics.",
      "Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, an infectious disease expert at the University of Southern California who led the first study to demonstrate doxyPEP\u2019s efficacy, called for renewed spending on STI-related care.",
      "\u201cIf Trump is going to make IVF \u2014 in vitro fertilization \u2014 free,\u201d Klausner said of the president-elect\u2019s emphatic campaign pledge, \u201che should make STI testing and treatment free.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is planning to nominate South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem to serve as the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, according to four sources familiar with the decision.",
      "As Homeland Security secretary, Noem would oversee a number of key federal agencies including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. Secret Service, TSA and the Coast Guard.",
      "Noem, 52, has voiced support for the president-elect's hardline immigration policies and has defended her fellow Republican governors in their efforts to crack down on migrants in their states.",
      "In January, for example, she said in remarks that there was an \"invasion\" at the U.S.-Mexico border and said that her administration was considering helping Texas deter immigration at the southern border by sending security personnel and razor wire to the state. In response to her comments, members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota banned her from their reservation.",
      "Noem has criticized President Joe Biden's handling of the border, echoing arguments made by Trump that violent criminals are flooding into the country.",
      "\"He is ignoring federal law and allowing people into this country that are incredibly dangerous,\" she said in an interview in June on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"And just this week I think we had four different people that were attacked or raped or murdered by illegal immigrants that have come in over our open border. And that cannot continue to happen.\"",
      "In the same interview, when asked about Trump's possible plans to pardon Jan. 6 rioters who were convicted, she dodged the question and said that it would be his prerogative.",
      "\"I believe that Donald Trump, when he comes back to the White House and is in charge of this country, we\u2019re going to have incredible opportunities to show that people in this country will be safer, that we\u2019ll have law and order back in our streets,\" she said. \"If you look at one of the most violent areas of our country is often Democrat-run cities, sanctuary cities with an open border.\"",
      "Noem had been viewed as a possible vice presidential running mate for Trump in this cycle, but she was dogged by her admission in her book published in the spring that she had once shot and killed her dog.",
      "\"I would say that that was a story from 20 years ago about me protecting my children from a vicious animal,\" she said on \"Meet the Press.\" \"So we\u2019ve covered that, and any mom in those situations when you have an animal that\u2019s viciously killing livestock and attacking people it\u2019s a tough decision.\"",
      "Noem has served as governor of South Dakota since 2019 and previously served in the House of Representatives from 2011 to 2019 and in the state House from 2007 to 2011.",
      "Similar to Trump's other allies, Noem had signaled support for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. In separate interviews on CNN in April and May of this year, she wouldn't say if she would have certified that election and refused to say whether then-Vice President Mike Pence acted appropriately when he did certify Biden's victory.",
      "Noem is the latest in a flurry of picks Trump has made to join his second administration.",
      "Trump has so far announced Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to be U.S. ambassador to the U.N.; Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff; former Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., as EPA administrator; and Tom Homan to be \u201cborder czar,\u201d a role Trump said will oversee all of the administration's deportation efforts.",
      "Homan, who served as acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the first Trump administration, is an advocate of hardline immigration policies and has vowed to carry out mass deportations, a major campaign promise of Trump's. Two people familiar with Trump's decision said that Homan was not vying for the Homeland Security secretary position.",
      "NBC News has reported that Trump has also selected Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., as national security adviser; and is expected to name Stephen Miller to serve as White House deputy chief of staff for policy and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as secretary of state."

      "The Bears have not scored an offensive touchdown in their last two games, the first time they\u2019ve gone back-to-back games without an offensive score since the 2004 season. They only scored one offensive touchdown against the\u00a0Washington Commanders\u00a0and have been outscored 66-27 across three straight losses.",

      "Trump had been tentatively scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 26, but that date is now stayed for the time being, and it's unclear when or if the judge would proceed with the sentencing.",
      "Trump was convicted in May on 34 felony counts related to hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. He has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "The decision Merchan was expected to hand down on Tuesday was on Trump's motion for the conviction to be overturned and the indictment dismissed, on the grounds the case included some evidence that prosecutors should not have been able to use per the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity.",

    "story": [
      "David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson acknowledged there was \"a lot of tension\" between them on \"The X-Files\" that resulted in the co-stars not speaking for weeks off camera while working on the hit show.",
      "Anderson, 56, spoke to Duchovny, 64, on the Nov. 12 episode of his \"Fail Better\" podcast, with the two revisiting their time together on the hit Fox show that ran from 1993-2002, spawned two movies, and revivals in 2016 and 2018. Duchovny played FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder, and Anderson played his partner, Special Agent Dana Scully, in the science fiction series about unsolved cases involving the paranormal.",
      "Anderson said she came on Duchovny's podcast to have \"a conversation that I don't feel like we ever had,\" which led to him reflecting on shooting the show together during the height of its popularity in the '90s.",
      "\"The part of this conversation that is the trickiest part for me is, I guess I would talk about like my failure of friendship, or my failure of companionship,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"There was a long time working on the show where we were just not even dealing with one another off camera,\" he added. \"And there was a lot of tension, which didn\u2019t matter, apparently, for the work, because we\u2019re both f------ crazy, I guess, that we could just go out there and do what we needed to do.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s crazy that we were able to present on camera the various feelings and emotions and attraction and all that kind of stuff, but then not speak to each other for weeks at a time or whatever,\" Anderson said.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know, but I could have handled myself better,\" Duchovny said.",
      "Duchovny also opened up about leaving the show in the early 2000s and his emotions after Anderson left \"The X-Files\" following its revival in 2018.",
      "\"I never apologized to you for that,\" he told Anderson about his original departure from the show. \"I don\u2019t know that I even talked to you about it, and then you said you weren\u2019t going to do the show anymore, like, the last time we did it (in 2018). And I know that hurt my feelings.\"",
      "\"Oh, I didn't know,\" Anderson said.",
      "\"I get it, you know, like, OK, and I support it, whatever it is you want to do, but I was like, 'Oh, she\u2019s quitting me,' you know?\" Duchovny said. \"She doesn\u2019t like working with me anymore. It was like, that little kid inside is going, 'Hey!' And then I was like, but I didn\u2019t say anything to her back in the day.\"",
      "Later in their conversation, Anderson returned to the moment Duchovny left in 2001.",
      "\"We never talked about it,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t think I ever blamed you. ... I don\u2019t think I blamed you at all. I don\u2019t think I was upset.\"",
      "\"Well, thanks a lot,\" Duchovny said.",
      "After Duchovny departed, Anderson considered following him out the door.",
      "\"There was a point, I mean, for me at that time, it was, 'Can I too?'\" she said. \"At first I thought, 'Well, then we\u2019re both going to because clearly I can\u2019t go on without him, so surely I\u2019ll be able to.' And then they started talking about, 'Well, if you stay on, you can actually make some good money.'\"",
      "Duchovny also recalled a \"dysfunctional\" moment between the two in the midst of their stardom on the show.",
      "\"It was some Emmys, and it was the day after, and I had a private plane, and I was giving you a ride,\" he said. \"And you were late, and I was so angry. And then we sat on this private plane, flying to Vancouver from LA, not talking.",
      "\"And you wrote me a letter,\" he continued. \"So you\u2019re just like 6 feet away from me, writing a letter to me, and it\u2019s a beautiful letter. I don\u2019t remember it exactly, but it was appreciative, and it was like it was all the things that I wanted to hear. But it\u2019s just amazing that we couldn\u2019t just have that conversation. The fact that it\u2019s a private plane, it\u2019s just all ridiculous.\"",
      "\"I had no memory that we were even on a private plane together, let alone, yeah, I wrote you a letter on one,\" Anderson said. \"Interesting.\"",
      "Duchovny also remembered a moment with \"The X-Files\" creator Chris Carter amid some tension in the first season.",
      "\"I think we were kind of butting heads so early on in the first season that Chris asked us if we would go into fake couples (therapy). Like, would we go into TV character couple therapy? I remember sitting in his office with you, and Chris is like, 'Yeah, do you guys want to go into therapy.' And I was like, 'You mean as Mulder and Scully?' I\u2019m confused. I remember that.\"",
      "Another source of strife came in 2016 when Anderson fought for pay equity with Duchovny for the revival of the show. She told The Daily Beast at the time that she was only offered half the salary of Duchovny for the 2016 return and had spent three years during the original run of \"The X-Files\" trying to achieve pay equity with her co-star.",
      "\"That whole pay equity thing, that\u2019s in our past as well,\" Duchovny said. \"I was part of that.",
      "\"Selfishly, back then, I thought I was like being attacked,\" he continued. \"I thought, 'Oh, I\u2019m being attacked for being offered more money.'\"",
      "\"Attacked by who?\" Anderson asked.",
      "\"The world,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"What, that they blamed you in some way?\" Anderson said.",
      "\"In a way,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"Oh really, I didn\u2019t know that,\" Anderson said. \"I'm sorry. That's interesting that I wasn't paying attention to that side of it.\"",
      "\"Well, I didn't make you pay attention to it,\" Duchovny said.",
      "During their talk, the two also delved into Anderson's childhood and latest ventures, including her new book, \"Want,\" a collection of anonymous sexual fantasies submitted by women from around the world."

    "summary": "What happens to Kevin Costner's \"Yellowstone\" character of John Dutton in Season 5, Part 2? Here's how the series writes him off the show.",
    "story": [
      "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Warning: This story has major spoilers for the Season 5, Part 2 premiere episode of \u201cYellowstone.\u201d",
      "After nearly a two year hiatus, Paramount+'s riveting Western series, \u201cYellowstone,\u201d finally returns to give its dramatic conclusion.",
      "The popular Paramount+ show has captured audiences since 2018 with the ups and downs of the Dutton family, the owners of Montana's Yellowstone Dutton Ranch \u2014 the largest ranch in the United States.",
      "Six years later, \u201cYellowstone\u201d is set to air its final episodes, but without the show's favorite land magnate, John Dutton, played by Kevin Costner. His last appearance on the show was during the first part of Season 5, which\u00a0was released in 2022.",
      "After reports emerged of scheduling issues and drama between Costner and \u201cYellowstone\u201d creator Taylor Sheridan, Costner confirmed in a June Instagram video that he would not be returning to the show.",
      "So what happens to his John Dutton character, and will Costner make an appearance in Season 5, Part 2 of \u201cYellowstone\u201d?",
      "Read on to learn what happens in the Season 5, Part 2's premiere episode of \u201cYellowstone\u201d and how the show writes off Costner's character of John Dutton.",
      "What happens in first episode of Season 5, Part 2 of 'Yellowstone'?",
      "The first episode finds viewers in the middle of major drama as emergency services and caution tape surround John Dutton\u2019s mansion. As Beth Dutton (Kelly Reilly) runs to the house with Kayce Dutton (Luke Grimes) not far behind her, it becomes imminently clear that something is wrong with their father.",
      "As the siblings enter the home, viewers find that Governor Dutton has supposedly died by suicide. Beth immediately accuses Jamie (Wes Bentley) of having killed their father. While this opener is a jarring way to start off the second half of Season 5 \u2014 the episode quickly pivots to another scene.",
      "Viewers are now taken back to six weeks prior to Dutton's death as they follow Beth, Kayce, and their families in the days leading up to the tragedy. During the episode, time jumps back and forth between what led up to John Dutton\u2019s death and its aftermath.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Wendy Moniz, who plays Governor Lynelle Perry, says she believes the series handled John Dutton's storyline \"beautifully.\"",
      "\"What I know of the story telling \u2014 because it was redacted and we only know certain parts \u2014 is brilliant, because Taylor's [Sheridan] writing is that,\" she said.",
      "She added that \"the story that he had from the beginning is the story that he wanted to tell.\"",
      "Is Kevin Costner involved in Season 5, Part 2 of 'Yellowstone'?",
      "Despite his character being a central figure in the episode \u2014 we never actually see Costner. When Beth and Kayce enter the gruesome scene where John Dutton was believed to have shot himself, the audience only sees a limp hand, and a pool of blood.",
      "How do they write off Kevin Costner\u2019s character in 'Yellowstone'?",
      "As the first episode unravels, viewers quickly learn that John Dutton's death was not in fact suicide. Rather, it was a murder-for-hire scheme set forth by Sarah Atwood (Dawn Olivieri) who was in cahoots with Jamie Dutton. Sarah, a lawyer who has been an issue for John in previous episodes, says that she and Jamie agreed on the plan, but Jamie says he wasn't on board.",
      "While  John Dutton\u2019s death is made clear in the first few minutes of the episode \u2014 viewers soon learn that his presence still looms in the minds of the Dutton family.",
      "But, will we see actor Kevin Costner is one last scene? That is yet to be determined.",
      "Is this really the end for 'Yellowstone'?",
      "Paramount+ confirmed that this would be the final season for the Dutton family \u2014 but fans, and some of the show's stars, think that there could be room for more.",
      "When asked if this was the last season for \"Yellowstone\" by TODAY.com, Ian Bohen, who plays Ryan, a Dutton family ranch hand, teases \"it may not\" be the end.",
      "\"I feel satisfied, and very happy with what we've done. You know stories can't go on forever,\" he says. \"We're going to position it to have some sort of conclusion in some of the relationships and this and that. But not necessarily over.\"",
      "What are the 'Yellowstone' spinoffs?",
      "The expanding \"Yellowstone\" universe already has two popular spinoffs within the franchise and more on the way. The various shows travel throughout time, chronicling the same family over the course of hundreds of years.",
      "This prequel was packed with star power, including country stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, and actor Sam Elliot. The show traveled back in time to chronicle how the Dutton family first settled in Montana.",
      "Oscar winner Helen Mirren and legendary actor Harrison Ford led the cast of this prequel, which showed the next generation of Dutton family. Season 2 is currently in production.",
      "Another prequel series, this \"1944\" edition is greenlit for production. Further details, including a release date, are unknown.",
      "Formerly titled \"2024,\" this series will star Michelle Pfeiffer, and is set to follow the story of a New York family that moves to Montana. Currently, we don't know how the story will intertwine with the current characters of the Yellowstone universe.",
      "Another series featured in the \"Yellowstone\" universe is \"6666,\" pronounced \"Four Sixes,\" based on the real Four Sixes ranch in Texas, which Sheridan now himself owns.",
      "This spinoff will follow storylines on that ranch, however as of June that series was on hold. Sheridan told The Hollywood Reporter that because it's a real ranch with real families, it needs a \"unique level of special care.\""

      "\"So it was just sort of something that naturally came up on the show, but it's been really interesting to see what the response has been like,\" she said. \"It's just sort of gone everywhere.",
      "\"I think people have needed something like this, on a platform like that, to go, OK, we can talk about it now, and just to talk about that,\" she continued. \"And of course, it's not something that guys would have to think about, but I think it's really important for us, for all of our little young girls that are growing up, that we go like, 'This is the this is the mentality that a woman has to have, and that a young girl has to have every day ever.'\"",

      "The northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel\u2019s ground invasion and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the 13-month-old war, which was triggered by Hamas\u2019 attack into southern Israel. As in other areas of Gaza, Israel\u00a0has sent forces back in after repeated operations, saying Hamas has regrouped.",
      "The military says it only targets militants, whom it accuses of hiding among civilians in homes and shelters. Israeli strikes often kill women and children.",
      "On Sunday, the Israeli military released what it said was video footage of Hamas abusing detainees. The soundless footage, dated from 2018 to 2020, appears to show detainees with hoods over their heads chained up in stress positions. In some of the clips, men beat or poke them with batons.",
      "It was not possible to independently verify the videos, which the military said it had recovered during operations in Gaza.",
      "Rights groups\u00a0have long accused\u00a0the Hamas-run government in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank of abusing detainees and violently quashing dissent.\u00a0Israel has been accused of similar abuses, especially since the start of the war. Israeli prison authorities say they follow relevant laws and investigate any allegations of wrongdoing.",
      "Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel after war broke out in Gaza in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed militant group Hamas.",
      "Israel retaliated, and a series of escalations over several months led to all-out war in September, when Israel carried out a wave of heavy strikes and\u00a0killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as most of his top commanders.",
      "Since then, Israel has struck areas deeper and deeper inside Lebanon, while Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire from northern to central Israel. The fighting has killed over 3,000 people in Lebanon, according to the Health Ministry, and more than 70 people in Israel.",
      "In videos purporting to show the aftermath of Sunday\u2019s strike in Aalmat, some 25 miles north of Beirut, people were seen pulling the body of a little girl out of the rubble. The house had been flattened, and several cars nearby were also damaged.",
      "The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants blew holes in the border fence and stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250.\u00a0Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities who do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count but say over half the fatalities were women and children.",
      "Israeli bombardment and ground invasions\u00a0have left vast areas of Gaza in ruins\u00a0and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people,\u00a0often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people are living in crowded tent camps with few if any public services and no idea of\u00a0when they might return to their homes or rebuild.",
      "Cease-fire talks mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled since the start of the year, as have parallel efforts by the U.S. and others to halt the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "Qatar, which has served as a key mediator with Hamas, said over the weekend that\u00a0it had suspended its efforts\u00a0and would only resume them when \u201cthe parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war and the ongoing suffering of civilians.\u201d"

      "Qatar has halted its mediation efforts between Israel and Hamas, citing a lack of willingness from both sides to engage constructively, according to a diplomatic source briefed on the matter.",
      "Qatar\u2019s participation hinged on both parties demonstrating real interest in resolving the conflict, according to the diplomat. Qatari officials, however, concluded that recent negotiation efforts have been more focused on optics than peace efforts.",
      "The diplomat noted that Qatar may resume its role if both sides reach an impasse and show genuine intent to negotiate.",
      "Under U.S. pressure, Qatari officials had warned Hamas\u2019 political bureau earlier that it was no longer welcome in the country amid frustration over stalled hostage and cease-fire negotiations with Israel, according to a senior U.S. administration official and two diplomats briefed on the matter.",
      "\u201cHamas has been told that if this continues then Qatar cannot continue to host them,\u201d they said.",
      "\u201cQatar has become increasingly frustrated with a lack of progress toward a cease-fire by both Hamas and Israel,\u201d one of the diplomats told NBC News Saturday morning.",
      "Later, a diplomat added that Qatar had informed the Israelis and Hamas that \u201cas long as there is a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith, they cannot continue to mediate. As a consequence, the Hamas political office no longer serves its purpose.\u201d",
      "The officials did not say whether Hamas had been given a deadline, how its diplomats had responded to the warning to leave, or where they would go.",
      "The move is one of multiple indications that the Biden administration is intensifying efforts to achieve a Gaza cease-fire and hostage deal before leaving office.",
      "The U.S. asked Qatar to kick out Hamas about two weeks ago when the group rejected another hostage proposal after Israel killed Hamas\u00a0leader Yahya Sinwar, the senior U.S. administration official told NBC News late Friday.",
      "Qatar agreed and told Hamas\u2019 political leaders about the decision about 10 days ago, the U.S. official said.",
      "\u201cHamas is a terrorist group that has killed Americans and continues to hold American hostages,\u201d the official said. \u201cAfter rejecting repeated proposals to release hostages, its leaders should no longer be welcome in the capitals of any American partner.\u201d",
      "According to one of the diplomats briefed on the matter, once the Qataris had made their decision, they notified Israel and Hamas as well as the U.S. administration.",
      "\u201cAll sides were given no advance warning and were informed after the decision was made,\u201d they said.",
      "A Hamas official contacted for comment did not respond. Israeli officials were not immediately available for comment.",
      "A spokesperson for Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Majed bin Mohammed Al Ansari, said on X that reports about the Hamas office in Doha were \"inaccurate,\" adding that the office's purpose is to be a \"channel of communication between the concerned parties.\" He characterized Qatar's efforts to mediate between the parties as \"currently stalled.\"",
      "Since the start of the war in Gaza, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani has played a key role in mediating talks between Hamas and Israel, alongside Egypt and the U.S.",
      "While housing Hamas representatives in Qatar has long been considered an advantage by negotiators, the country is under growing pressure from the U.S., with the outgoing Biden administration anxious to force Hamas and Israel into a deal before leaving office.",
      "Meanwhile, Qatari leaders face the prospect of a hawkish Trump presidency and more powerful Republican lawmakers with little tolerance for rounds of unsuccessful talks or patience with the kingdom\u2019s role as a go-between for militants.",
      "The U.S. request to oust Hamas came partly because of the death of American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin and it coincided with the unsealing of indictments for Hamas leaders, including Khaled Meshal, who is known to be living in Qatar, according to the U.S. official.",
      "The official said the U.S. is still trying to secure the release of hostages \u2014 and that the administration believes that expelling Hamas from Doha will place more pressure on the organization.",
      "\u201cQatar has played an invaluable role in helping to mediate a hostage deal and was instrumental in securing the release of nearly 200 hostages last year,\u201d the senior U.S. official said. \u201cHowever, following Hamas\u2019 repeated refusal to release even a small number of hostages, including most recently during meetings in Cairo, their continued presence in Doha is no longer viable or acceptable.\u201d",
      "About 250 people were taken hostage during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack, which killed around 1,200. Of those, about 100 remain in captivity, with a third believed to be dead. More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the ensuing war, and Israeli forces have destroyed much of the blockaded enclave.",
      "The two diplomats told NBC News that Hamas was also asked to leave Qatar and relocate to Turkey in April. But after officials there failed to compel Hamas to agree to a hostage deal, that decision was quickly reversed, they said.",
      "\u201cThe Biden Administration and the Israeli government asked Qatar to bring them back to Qatar because they needed to continue the talks and couldn\u2019t do it while in Turkey,\u201d one diplomat said.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who is running to be Senate leader, co-sponsored a bill this year calling on the U.S. to reconsider Qatar\u2019s Major Non-NATO Ally Status.",
      "\u201cQatar has not been a good ally or partner to the United States for years,\u201d Scott said at the time.\u00a0\u201cIts recent behavior dealing with Hamas is telling.\u201d",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have also criticized Qatar for not forcing Hamas into an agreement.",
      "Earlier this year, Qatar defended its role in negotiations, with its embassy in Washington issuing a statement saying that Doha\u2019s capacity as mediator \u201cexists only because we were asked by the United States in 2012 to play this role.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlaming and threatening the mediator is not constructive, especially when the target is a friend and a Major Non-NATO Ally that presently hosts 10,000 U.S. troops and America\u2019s largest military presence in the Middle East,\u201d it added.",
      "Qatar has housed Hamas\u2019 political bureau for over 20 years, and before the war, provided the group with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual assistance, with the knowledge and cooperation of the Israeli government, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank.",
      "Hamas\u2019 leadership is divided between a military wing, based in Gaza, and the political bureau, whose top officials have been based in Qatar. That included Ismail Haniyeh, who led Hamas\u2019 political bureau from 2017 to July 2024, when he was killed while on a diplomatic visit to Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, in an assassination believed to have been carried out by Israel.Where Hamas would relocate is not clear, but Iran might be one option.",

The \u201cZionist entity today in Gaza and Lebanon pierce the heart of every human being,\u201d President Masoud Pezeshkian said at the time. \u201cThis pain is even greater for those of us who consider the oppressed Palestinian people as our brothers in faith.\u201d"

      "\u201cIt was horrific. It was heartbreaking. It was wrong. And it should never have happened,\u201d Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said with around 200 abuse survivors and families watching on from the public gallery at Parliament in the capital, Wellington.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Businesses and consumers in China found the annual Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival less attractive this year due to a sluggish economy, forcing e-commerce firms to look abroad for growth.",
      "Online service provider and e-commerce platform Alibaba started the now-famous event on Nov. 11, 2009, offering attractive discounts to entice shoppers to spend more. The extravaganza, also known as \u201cDouble 11,\u201d has since expanded to other platforms in China \u2014 such as JD.com and Pinduoduo \u2014 and abroad.",
      "It has long been regarded as a barometer of consumer sentiment.",
      "While Singles\u2019 Day was previously a one-day event, shopping platforms in China now kickstart the festival weeks ahead to drum up sales volume. Even some brick-and-mortar stores join the festival by launching sales campaigns and hanging promotional banners and posters in the hopes of luring shoppers.",
      "But amid China\u2019s lagging domestic economy, dragged down by a\u00a0real estate crisis and deflationary pressures, consumers no longer go all out during the shopping extravaganza.",
      "Meanwhile, e-commerce platforms grappling with a slowing domestic market have turned to overseas markets to seek new growth, offering promotions like global free shipping and allowing merchants to sell worldwide with ease.",
      "Alibaba, for example, said in a blog post on its Alizila site that some 70,000 merchants saw sales double with global free shipping. In markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, new customers also doubled, the e-commerce company said.",

      "\u201cI used to buy a lot two or three years ago and I even purchased a mobile phone (during Singles\u2019 Day),\u201d he said. However, following the Covid-19 pandemic, he stopped \u201cbecause of lower income.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am not going to buy anything this year,\u201d Zhang said.",
      "Some experts say that Beijing\u2019s\u00a0recent stimulus measures\u00a0have had little impact on increasing consumer confidence.",
      "\u201cPeople are not interested in spending and are cutting back on big-ticket items,\u201d said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. \u201cSince October 2022, the weak economy means that everything has been on discount year-round; 11.11 is not going to bring in more discounts than the month before.\u201d",
      "Rein said he expects low growth for the Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival as consumers tighten their spending in anticipation of difficult economic times ahead.",
      "Categories such as sportswear and fitness, however, have been doing well as customers \u201ctrade down a Gucci bag for Lululemon sportswear,\u201d he said.",
      "Jacob Cooke, CEO of e-commerce consulting firm WPIC Marketing + Technologies, said that despite the luxury downturn, the shopping festival still showed strong sales for goods in premium price brands across categories like mother-baby, personal care and toys, as well as outdoor and sport.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear shift in consumer priorities towards experiences, hobbies and health,\u201d Cooke said. \u201cWith record-level platform subsidies and generous membership programs like Alibaba\u2019s 88VIP, consumers actually showed a preference for premium branded goods during this year\u2019s festival.\u201d",
      "Platforms such as JD.com and Alibaba previously used to publish the total value of the festival\u2019s transactions, but have stopped since 2022. While yearly growth used to be in the double digits, estimates of recent figures have dwindled to low single-digit growth.",
      "Syntun, a data provider, estimated that last year\u2019s gross merchandising volume sales across major e-commerce platforms grew just 2% to 1.14 trillion yuan ($156.40 billion), a far cry from double-digit growth before Covid-19."

      "Many also worry that U.S. disengagement could lead other countries to backpedal on existing climate pledges or scale back future ambitions.",

      "Venezuela lost its final glacier this year. The Greenland Ice Sheet is losing, on average, 30 million tons of ice per hour. Ice loss from the Thwaites Glacier, also known as the \u201cDoomsday\u201d glacier because its collapse could precipitate rapid Antarctic ice loss,\u00a0may be unstoppable.",
      "These are just a few of the stark findings from more than 50 leading snow and ice scientists, which are detailed in a new report from the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative.",
      "The report summarizes the state of snow and ice in 2024: In short, experts agree, it\u2019s been a horrible year for the frozen parts of Earth, an expected result of global warming. What\u2019s more, top cryosphere scientists are growing increasingly worried that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a key ocean current that governs how heat cycles in the Atlantic Ocean, is on a path toward collapse.",
      "A rapid halt to the current would cause rapid cooling in the North Atlantic, warming in the Southern Hemisphere and extreme changes in precipitation. If that happens, the new report suggests, northern Europe could cool by about 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit in a decade.",
      "The report highlights a shift in consensus: Scientists once thought tipping points \u2014 like the collapse of AMOC \u2014 were distant or remote possibilities. Now, some of those thresholds are appearing more likely to be crossed, and with less runway to turn the situation around.",
      "\u201cThe latest science is not telling us that things are any different to what we knew before, necessarily, but it\u2019s telling us with more confidence and more certainty that these things are more likely to happen,\u201d said Helen Findlay, an author of the report and a professor and biological oceanographer at Plymouth Marine Laboratory in England. \u201cThe longer we record these things, and the longer we\u2019re able to observe them and start to understand and monitor them, there\u2019s more certainty in the system and we start to really understand how these tipping points are working.\u201d",
      "Last month, 44 leading scientists wrote in an open letter to leaders of Nordic countries that the collapse of AMOC remained \u201chighly uncertain\u201d but that evidence in favor of such a collapse was mounting, and risks have been underestimated. Dramatic changes to the AMOC, they warned, would \u201clikely lead to unprecedented extreme weather\u201d and \u201cpotentially threaten the viability of agriculture in northwestern Europe.\u201d",
      "The new report similarly draws attention to the risk of AMOC collapse.",
      "Additionally, it projects that roughly two-thirds of glacier ice in the European Alps will be lost by 2050 if global greenhouse gas emissions keep their pace. Already, an estimated 10 million people are at risk of glacial outburst floods in Iceland, Alaska and Asia \u2014 a phenomenon already occurring as meltwater collapses ice dams and rapidly floods downstream. If high emissions continue, the report adds, models suggest that sea level could rise by roughly 10 feet in the 2100s, imperiling parts of many coastal cities.",
      "The report was released as world leaders gathered Monday in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, for the United Nations\u2019 COP29 climate conference.",
      "\u201cTiming is everything,\u201d said Julie Brigham-Grette, a geosciences professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and an author of the new report.",
      "She said the group hopes to rattle world leaders to attention: \u201cThe sense of urgency couldn\u2019t be higher. We\u2019ve been talking about urgency for a decade. It almost starts to feel like a useless word. What\u2019s more than \u2018urgent?\u2019 \u2018Catastrophic?\u2019 We\u2019ve run out of ways to describe it.\u201d",
      "To date, the report says, world governments are falling short on the pledges they made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of the Paris Agreement.",
      "Even if they were on track, those commitments\u00a0are insufficient to reach global climate goals, the authors say. On paper, the world\u2019s pledges would limit the rise in global temperatures to about 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 degrees Fahrenheit) this century. That\u2019s well short of the goal to cap warming at 1.5 degrees C.",
      "Global temperatures are currently on pace to rise more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit), on average.",
      "\u201cI feel quite frustrated,\u201d Findlay said. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand how they\u2019re missing the severity of the issue.\u201d",
      "In Baku on Monday, world leaders did agree to new rules for a global market to trade carbon credits. In a news release, COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev, who has been Azerbaijan\u2019s minister of ecology and natural resources since 2018, said the agreement was a \u201cgame-changing\u201d tool to direct climate financing to the developing world.",
      "But he also acknowledged, in a speech to delegates, that the world is \u201con a road to ruin\u201d under current climate policies.",
      "That warning and the new report both come amid fears the U.S. will backslide on its climate commitments and pull out of the Paris Agreement after Donald Trump takes office in January. Trump wants to remove the U.S. from the international treaty, and he began that process during his first presidential administration. President Joe Biden reversed the move in 2021.",
      "Peter Neff, a glaciologist and climate scientist at the University of Minnesota who was not involved in the new report, said its authors clearly communicated the scientific consensus.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing surprising for a glaciologist. Across the board, there\u2019s not good news with respect to ice on Earth. It\u2019s all, for the most part, going in one direction,\u201d Neff said.",
      "But he added that he still found the report\u2019s findings to be staggering: \u201cThese documents can hit you like a ton of bricks, and that\u2019s intentional.\u201d"

Stefanik has served in the House since 2015 and represents New York's 21st Congressional District, which covers upstate New York, bordering Vermont and Canada.",
      "Any appointments by Trump that lead to vacancies in the House could prove problematic for House Republicans. While they could maintain control of the lower chamber, an election outcome that NBC News has not yet called, their margin will be slim, and they struggled throughout the last Congress to maintain effective control of the body with few votes to spare."

    "story": [
      "FIFA must halt the process to pick Saudi Arabia as hosts of the 2034 World Cup unless major human rights reforms are announced before the vote next month, Amnesty International and the Sport & Rights Alliance (SRA) have said.",
      "Votes are due to be held at the FIFA Congress next month to approve the 2030 and 2034 World Cups, though each has only a single bid. A combined bid of Morocco, Spain and Portugal is the sole bid for\u00a02030,\u00a0while Saudi Arabia is the lone bidder for 2034.",
      "Amnesty and the SRA said they had evaluated the human rights strategies proposed by the bidding countries and concluded in a new report that neither bid adequately outlined how they would meet the human rights standards required by FIFA.",
      "They said the risks were far greater in Saudi Arabia and hosting the tournament in the Gulf country would lead to \u201csevere and widespread\u201d human rights violations.",
      "\u201cThere will be a real and predictable human cost to awarding the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia without obtaining credible guarantees of reform,\u201d Steve Cockburn, Amnesty\u2019s head of labor rights and sport, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cFans will face discrimination... migrant workers will face exploitation, and many will die.",
      "\u201cFIFA must halt the process until proper human rights protections are in place to avoid worsening an already dire situation.\u201d",
      "FIFA said the bid evaluation reports for the 2030 and 2034 World Cup would be published ahead of its extraordinary Congress on Dec. 11.",

      "Discrimination concerns",
      "The World Cup hosts are set to be officially appointed at the FIFA Congress and Saudi Arabia\u2019s bid is almost certain to succeed due to the absence of any other expressions of interest before FIFA\u2019s deadline late last year.",
      "A major cause for concern has been whether LGBTQ people will be discriminated against in the Kingdom, where people can be sentenced to death if it is proved that they have engaged in same-sex sexual acts.",
      "Hammad Albalawi, head of Saudi Arabia\u2019s World Cup bid unit, said in September that LGBTQ fans were welcome and their\u00a0privacy would be respected, pointing to the millions of fans who had travelled to the country for sporting events in recent years.",
      "\u201cWe are committed to cultivating a competition environment free of discrimination, and striving to eradicate discrimination based on protected characteristics,\u201d Saudi Arabia said in its World Cup bid book.",
      "\u201cWorking with our government partners, we will verify that our laws align with our international commitments and implement necessary enhancements.\u201d",
      "Migrant workers",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s bid book stated 15 stadiums would be built or refurbished for the World Cup, with construction set to be completed by 2032, while more than 185,000 additional hotel rooms would be built ahead of the tournament.",
      "Cockburn said Saudi Arabia would need a vast number of migrant workers to deliver its World Cup ambitions in a country which has neither established a minimum wage for non-citizens nor introduced measures to prevent worker deaths.",
      "The issue is similar to the worker deaths in neighboring Qatar, which hosted the 2022 World Cup and built new stadiums with the help of migrant labor.",
      "Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper reported that at least 6,500 migrant workers \u2014 many of them working on World Cup projects \u2014 had died in Qatar after it won the right to stage the event, but the\u00a0number was disputed\u00a0by the Gulf nation.",
      "\u201cWe are dedicated to upholding our commitments concerning forced labour, child labour, non-discrimination and occupational safety and health. We will strive to ensure our partners uphold these standards,\u201d Saudi Arabia said in its bid book.",
      "Amnesty\u2019s report also said that the repression of free speech was a cause for concern, with Cockburn saying there was no serious commitment to reform.",
      "\u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s human rights strategy does not address the government\u2019s severe repression of free speech and the continued imprisonment of individuals who have been sentenced to decades in prison merely for their expression,\u201d Cockburn said.",
      "Saudi Arabia is spending billions to transform its global image from a country known for strict religious restrictions and human rights abuses into a tourism and entertainment hub.",
